  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.6 - Reports of public transportation systems, corporations or individuals\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn order to receive funds under the STOA Program, any\nparticipating public transportation system shall submit applications and\nreports in the form and at the time prescribed as follows: (a) Applications must be submitted each\nquarter using forms to be supplied by the Department. Such applications shall\nbe filed between the second and seventeenth day of the first month of each\nquarter, with the quarters tracking the State's Fiscal Year. (b) All systems must file an annual report. Those systems that provided more than one million vehicle, car or nautical\nmiles in local revenue service or carried more than one million revenue\npassengers during the preceding state fiscal year must file the report\nspecified by the commissioner. For those systems receiving federal funds, the\nreports filed with the cognizant federal agency may be submitted (with the\npermission of the commissioner under such terms as the commissioner may\nprescribe). In the case of such systems not required to file either of the two\nabove-identified reports, such systems must file an annual report using a form\nto be provided by the Department. All operators holding authority from the Commissioner of\n\nTransportation shall also file the report required by Part 741 of this Title. A11 operators holding authority from any city pursuant to section\n80\nof the\n\nTransportation Law shall also file a copy of any annual report required by such\ncity. (c) Filing Deadlines: The required annual financial and service data reports, shall be submitted to\nthe New York State Department of Transportation Transit Division within one\nhundred twenty (120) days of the completion of the operator's fiscal year. These reports must be signed by the Chief Executive Officer. All authorized\noperators' reports shall be submitted on or before March 31st of each year. Failure to file required annual reports noted in (b) above\nwithin the specified period from the end of the operator's fiscal year shall\nresult in the operator's next quarterly STOA payment otherwise due being\nwithheld pending receipt of the report. In the event that the required annual\nreport is still outstanding by the succeeding quarter, the funds withheld from\nthe prior quarter will then be returned to the general account for\nredistribution to all other eligible program participants. Besides withholding\nSTOA for failure to file timely annual reports, the Commissioner may also\nwithhold future State operating assistance payments from public transportation\nsystems or private operators that do not provide such operational, financial, performance data, or such other information as may be required and deemed\nnecessary by the Commissioner. (d) Section 15 data. When a public or private\nbus operator receives State operating assistance and that bus operator provides\nservice to or within an urbanized area of over 200,000 population, such\noperator shall file with the cognizant Federal agency such applications and/or\nreports (such as Section 15 data reports) as would serve to obtain and/or\nincrease the Federal assistance apportioned to such area. Such applications or\nagents will cover fiscal years starting on or after July 1, 1989. Transit\noperators must file such applications or reports even if a transit operator is\nnot receiving Federal aid from an urbanized area's apportionment. The local\n\nMetropolitan Transportation Organization (MPO) transit planning process is the\nproper forum to determine the allocation of Federal funds to individual transit\noperations. (e) The Commissioner\nmay grant exemptions to transit systems serving an urbanized area of over\n200,000 population from having to file these required applications or reports. Any request for an exemption must be filed by such affected transit systems\ndirectly with the Commissioner. Exemptions to filing these applications or\nreports will be granted by the Commissioner only in those cases where\nextraordinary circumstances, such as financial hardship, warrant exemption\ntreatment. (f) Corporation or\nindividuals: Any transportation system contracting with a corporation, firm or\nindividual for the provision of mass transportation services, pursuant to\nsection\n18-b\nof the\n\nTransportation Law and section\n119-r\nof the General Municipal Law, shall provide within that contract such\nrequirements as it deems necessary to obtain the information required by this\nsection.
