  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6654.3 - Concentration of services on target population\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Area agencies shall engage in system, program and client-level targeting to concentrate services and assistance on\nthe target groups of minority, low-income frail and vulnerable elderly. Area\nagency targeting efforts shall include: (1)\ndeveloping linkages to programs and services operated by other\nagencies; (2)\nplanning with\nappropriate individuals or groups; (3)\nassessing the need for\nservices; (4)\ninforming or\neducating relevant public or service needs; (5)\nadvocating with relevant public\ndecisionmakers; (6)\nfacilitating or\nbrokering the establishment of needed services; (7)\ncoordinating the development of needed\nservices; (8)\nleveraging other\nservices; (9)\nsecuring additional\nresources for service development; (10)\nproviding services through subcontract\nor directly where approved; (11)\nevaluating services provided; (12)\nrecognizing and making public their mandated responsibilities on\ntargeting; (13)\nconducting a\nvariety of activities at county and community levels to enhance participating\nof target populations in service programs sponsored by the area agency and by\nother service systems; (14)\nidentifying specific unmet needs of the target populations; (15)\nstimulating the development of resources\nand services to meet the identified needs of target populations; (16)\nreexamining the allocation of aging\nnetwork funds and develop strategies to make resources available to the target\npopulation; (17)\nensuring target\npopulation representation on area agency and service provider advisory\ncommittees and boards of directors and ensuring their participation in the\ndevelopment of targeting strategies; (18)\nensuring through monitoring (reporting), evaluating, technical assistance, assessment and training, that subcontractors\nidentify and serve the target population; (19)\nensuring that any directly provided\nservices by the area agency are targeted appropriately; (20)\nproviding for and encouraging the\nparticipating of target group members in the identification of needs and the\nplanning, implementation and evaluation of programs; (21)\nensuring appropriate target group\nrepresentation on agency staff and among volunteers; and\n(22)\nplanning and conducting a variety of\nactivities to ensure target group representation among consumers of service at\na level that exceeds their percentage representation in the aging population\nwithin the service area, utilizing such means as innovative outreach, location\nand services, use of appropriate community-based organizations and groups as\nwell as informal networks to assist in needs identification, and information\nand referral. (b) Area\nagencies on aging shall consider the proportion of target elderly in the\npopulation of the service area when asking allocation or reallocation decisions\nfor resources. Special targeting efforts should be undertaken with any\nallowable sources or new or one-time funds. OAA carryover, especially that in\nexcess of 10 percent, should be viewed as a potential resource for such\ntargeting efforts. In granting office approval for retention of carryover, the\nproposed use of such funds for targeting activities will be a major factor\nconsidered. (c) Service providers\nmust follow methods established by the area agency for giving preference: (1)\nfor OAA services, to elderly with\ngreatest economic or social need, with particular attention to low-income\nminority individuals; (2)\nfor CSE\nservices, to elderly people most at risk of institutionalization, particularly\nthose who are frail, disabled, of low income, members of minority groups, or\nisolated from their families and the community; and\n(3)\nfor EISEP services, to functionally\nimpaired elderly with unmet needs who require assistance to remain in their\nhomes. (d) Service\nproviders must follow methods established by the area agency for maximizing\nservices funded from other sources, and must assure that no OAA, CSE, or EISEP\nfunds are used to provide services to elderly people eligible to receive the\nsame or substantially similar services available to them under title XVIII, XIX\nor XX of the Federal Social Security Act or any other governmental program, or\nto residents of adult residential care facilities who previously received or\nare entitled by law to receive the same or substantially similar services from\nsuch facilities.
