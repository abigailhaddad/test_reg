The accused has the right to\nbe represented before a general or special or summary court-martial by civilian\ncounsel if provided at no expense to the State. The accused has the right to be\nrepresented by either the military counsel detailed under ML, 130.27, or\nmilitary counsel of the accused's own selection, if reasonably available before\na general or special court-martial. The accused is entitled to be represented\nby both the military counsel detailed under ML, 130.27, and military counsel of\nthe accused's own selection, if reasonably available, if the accused so\nrequests, in which event the detailed military counsel will act as associate\ncounsel to the individual military counsel (ML, 130.38[b]). (2)\n\nIndividual military counsel. (i) Reasonably available. Subject to this\nparagraph, the Chief of Staff to the Governor must define \"reasonably\navailable\". While so assigned, the following persons are not reasonably\navailable to serve as individual military counsel because of the nature of\ntheir duties or positions: (a) a general or\nflag officer; (b) a trial or\nappellate military judge; (c) a\ntrial counsel; (d) an appellate\ndefense or government counsel; (e) a principal legal advisor to a command, organization, or agency and, when such\ncommand, organization, or agency has general court-martial jurisdiction, the\nprincipal assistant of such an advisor; (f) An instructor or student at a service\nschool or academy. The Chief of Staff to the Governor may determine other\npersons to be not reasonably available because of the nature or\nresponsibilities of their assignments, geographic considerations, exigent\ncircumstances, or military necessity. A person who is a member of a force of\nthe organized militia different from that of which the accused is a member is\nreasonably available to serve as individual military counsel for such accused\nto the same extent as that person is available to serve as individual military\ncounsel for an accused in the same force of the organized militia as the person\nrequested. The Chief of Staff to the Governor may prescribe circumstances under\nwhich exceptions may be made to the prohibitions in this paragraph when merited\nby the existence of an attorney-client relationship regarding matters relating\nto a charge in question. However, if the attorney-client relationship arose\nsolely because the counsel represented the accused on review under ML 130.67, this exception does not apply. (ii)\n\nProcedure. Subject to this paragraph, the Chief of Staff to the Governor may prescribe procedures for determining\nwhether a requested person is reasonably available to act as individual\nmilitary counsel. Requests for an individual military counsel are to be made by\nthe accused or the detailed defense counsel through the trial counsel to the\nconvening authority. If the requested person is among those not reasonably\navailable under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph or under regulations of the\n\nChief of Staff to the Governor, the convening authority must deny the request\nand notify the accused, unless the accused asserts that there is an existing\nattorney-client relationship regarding a charge in question or that the person\nrequested will not, at the time of the trial or investigation for which\nrequested, be among those so listed as not reasonably available. If the accused\nmakes such claim, or if the person is not among those so listed as not\nreasonably available. If the accused's request makes such a claim, or if the\nperson is not among those so listed as not reasonably, the convening authority\nmust forward the request to the commander or head of the organization, activity, or agency to which the requested person is available in accordance\nwith the procedure prescribed by the Chief of Staff to the Governor. This\ndetermination is a matter within the sole discretion of that authority. An\nadverse determination may be reviewed upon request of the accused through that\nauthority to the next higher commander or level of supervision. (3)\n\nExcusal or withdrawal. Except\nas otherwise provided in N.Y.C.R.M. 505(d)(2) and paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, defense counsel may be excused only with the express consent of\nthe accused, or by the military judge upon application for withdrawal by the\ndefense counsel for good cause shown. (4)\n\nWaiver. The accused may expressly waive\nthe right to be represented by counsel and may thereafter conduct the defense\npersonally. Such waiver is to be accepted by the military judge only if the\nmilitary judge finds that the accused is competent to understand the\ndisadvantages of self-representation and that the waiver is voluntary and\nunderstanding. The military judge may require that a defense counsel remain\npresent even if the accused waives counsel and conducts the defense personally. The right of the accused to conduct the defense personally may be revoked if\nthe accused is disruptive or fails to follow basic rules of decorum and\nprocedure. (5)\n\nNonlawyer present. Subject to the discretion of the military judge, the accused may have present\nand seated at the counsel table for purpose of consultation persons not\nqualified to serve as counsel under N.Y.R.C.M. 502.
