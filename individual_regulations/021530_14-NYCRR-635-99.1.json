For purposes of this\nsubdivision, the term \"room and board\" shall not include an amount established\nunder a method determined by the State to reflect the portion of costs of rent\nand food attributable to an unrelated person caregiver who is residing in the\nsame household with an individual who, but for the assistance of such\ncaregiver, would require admission to a hospital, nursing facility, or\nintermediate care facility for the mentally retarded.\"\n(b) Adult.

The fact that someone is functioning in the role of advocate for a\nperson enrolled in the HCBS waiver does not endow that party with any legal\nauthority over the person's affairs unless they also happen to be the adult\nperson's guardian or the parent of a minor. (d) Agency. The \"operator\" of a facility, program or service operated, certified, authorized, or funded through contract by OPWDD.

That is, housing and services are mutually exclusive considerations, as is the\nselection of specific services from the list of available approved services. The individualized services environment is in distinct contrast to an overall\nor comprehensive residential services model, in which housing and some services\nare intrinsically linked (\ni.e., where a person lives largely\ndetermines the services received). In the individualized service environment, where a person lives has no necessary connection to the services received, even\nthose which may be received at the housing site.

This document may\nbe known by a different name but it must comprise the elements described in\nthis definition. The goal of the ISP is to ensure the provision of those things\nnecessary to sustain the person in his/her chosen environment and preclude\nmovement to an ICF/DD. These services, activities and supports, identified in\nthe ISP, are to reflect the preferences, capabilities, and capacities of the\nperson and emphasize the development of self-determination\n(\ni.e., making personal choices), independence, productivity, and integration into the community. The ISP identified by personal descriptive\nand identification information, contains at a minimum: (1)\nassessment information and\nrecommendations; (2)\nan\nidentification of each service, service provider (including type), the amount, frequency, and duration of each service, and effective dates for service\ndelivery; (3)\nan identification of\nthe person's personal goals, preferences, capabilities, and capacities which\nare then related to habilitation or support needs stated in terms of outcomes\nto be achieved within specified timeframes; and\n(4)\nservice coordination, including\nassessment, service planning and coordination, linkage and referral, follow-up\nand monitoring.

The service oordinator should also ensure that a review\nof the ISP occurs when the individual and/or parties chosen by the individual\nrequest it; or when the capabilities, capacities or preferences of the\nindividual have changed and warrant a review; or when it is determined by the\nservice coordinator that the prevailing plan (or portions of the plan) is/are\nineffective. If habilitation services are provided (\ni.e., residential habilitation, day habilitation, community habilitation, supported\nemployment, pre-vocational services, pathway to employment), the relevant\nhabilitation plan(s) must be developed, and on a semiannual basis thereafter, reviewed and revised as necessary by the habilitation service provider.
