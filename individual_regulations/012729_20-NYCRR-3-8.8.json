Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.8 - Impact of combined group changes on the PNOLC subtraction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a\ncorporation that filed separately subsequently joins a combined group in a\nlater taxable year, the corporation's PNOLC subtraction allotment and unused\nPNOLC subtraction carryforward are added to the combined group's PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment and unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward, respectively, subject to the rules in section 210(1)(a)(viii)(B) and this Subpart. (b) If a corporation is a member of a\ncombined group and subsequently leaves that group in a later taxable year, the\nleaving member of the combined group takes its own PNOLC subtraction allotment\nwith it to use in future taxable years. In addition, such member also takes its\nown share of the combined group's combined unused PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforward, which shall be based upon its share of the combined group's PNOLC\nsubtraction available for use in the last year it was included in the combined\ngroup. If the leaving corporation joins another combined group, its PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment and unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward are added to\nthe combined group's PNOLC subtraction allotment and unused PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforward, respectively, subject to the rules in section 210(1)(a)(viii)(B)\nand this Subpart. If such corporation does not join another combined group, it\nis allowed its PNOLC subtraction allotment and unused PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforward on a separate basis, subject to the rules in section\n210(1)(a)(viii)(B) and this Subpart. The remaining combined group must reduce\nits unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward by the leaving member's share of such\nunused carryforward. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
