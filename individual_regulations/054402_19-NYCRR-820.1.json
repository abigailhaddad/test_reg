  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 820.1 - Purpose and effect\n\nState Regulations\n\nPursuant to General Municipal Law (GML), section 209-cc, the\n\nState Fire Administrator, in consultation with the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation, is required to develop and maintain a list of the common names of\nwild animals to be reported annually to local authorities, on a date which the\n\nFire Administrator shall determine. The Fire Administrator has developed a list\nof such common names and has distributed the list to all municipal clerks. The\nlist is also posted on the Department of State's website. As common names of\nanimals have neither legal nor scientific significance, the list is, of\nnecessity, not exclusive. Accordingly, where there is any question as to\nwhether a particular animal must be reported, GML, section 209-cc(2)(c) shall\ngovern. The purpose of this Part is to further comply with GML, section 209-cc\nby providing the annual reporting date and the report form, as well as other\nprocedural details. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n820.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
