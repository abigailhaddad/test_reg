Tit. 16 § 255.143 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\ncomponent of a pipeline must be able to withstand operating pressures and other\nanticipated loadings without impairment of its service ability with unit\nstresses equivalent to those allowed for comparable material in pipe in the\nsame location and kind of service. However, if design based upon unit stresses\nis impractical for a particular component, design may be based upon a pressure\nrating established by the manufacturer by pressure testing that component or a\nprototype of the component. (b) The\ndesign and installation of pipeline components and facilities must meet\napplicable requirements for corrosion control found in this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.143\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
