  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 302.14 - Student activity fees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Referendum. Prior to the close of the academic year 2004-2005 and every two years\nthereafter, the student body (or such components thereof as may be designated\nby the chief administrative officer, or designee) at each State-operated campus\nshall determine by referendum whether student activity programs shall be\nsupported by either voluntary or mandatory student fees. Such referendum shall\nbe held on the same day as the annual elections for officers of the\nrepresentative student organization or organizations (hereinafter referred to\nas \"student government\"). The determination resulting from each referendum\nshall remain in force for a period of two academic years, except that at any\ntime and from time to time within such two-year period a subsequent referendum\nheld in accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the student government\nmay effect a change in this determination with respect to the following\nacademic year. (b) Voluntary fees. Where students at a State-operated campus have determined to make the payment\nof student activity fees voluntary, the student government shall be responsible\nfor the collection, appropriation and disbursement of such fees subject to the\npermitted uses authorized in paragraph (c)(3) of the Board of Trustees' Policy. With the approval of the chief administrative officer, or designee, personnel\nor facilities of the campus, or both, may be used in connection with the\ncollection of such fees on behalf of the student government provided that the\ncollection of voluntary student activity fees is clearly distinguished from the\ncollection of required university fees. (c) Mandatory fees. Where students at a\n\nState-operated campus have determined to make the payment of student activity\nfees mandatory, the appropriation, collection and disbursement of such fees, whensoever collected, shall be governed by the following regulations: (1)\n\nPreparation and certification of the\nbudget. (i) The student government shall\nprepare and approve a budget governing expenditures from student activity fees\nin accordance with the constitution and by-laws of the student government, and\nconsistent with the principles of equal opportunity and viewpoint neutrality, prior to registration for each academic year. The constitution and by-laws of\nsuch student government shall specify the criteria governing eligibility for\nfunding of and allocations to student organizations from student activity fees. While referenda of the student body may not be used to help determine specific\nallocations to particular student organizations, mechanisms such as polls or\nsurveys may be used to ascertain student interest and participation in programs\nor events. Allocations included in the budget shall fall within programs\ndefined in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The approved budget shall\nthereafter be presented to the chief administrative officer prior to the\nregistration for each academic year for review and certification that the\nallocations from the fee and any proposed sources of revenue are in compliance\nwith the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subdivision. Upon determination by\nthe chief administrative officer, or designee, that the approved budget is in\ncompliance with these regulations, he or she shall so certify, and such\ncertification shall authorize the collection of the fee at\nregistration. (ii)\n\nAppeals. In the\nevent that the chief administrative officer, or designee, concludes that a\nparticular proposed allocation included in the budget may not be in compliance\nwith the provisions of this Part, he or she shall refer such proposed\nallocation to a campus review board composed of eight members of whom four\nshall be appointed by the student government and four appointed by the chief\nadministrative officer, or designee. The campus review board shall study the\nproposed allocation and make a recommendation to support or not to support it. The chief administrative officer, or designee, shall thereafter make the final\ndecision. Any proposed allocation which is determined not to be in compliance\nwith the provisions of these regulations shall be excluded from the\nbudget. (2)\n\nCollection\nat registration. The total amount of the fee for one academic year, as fixed\nand assessed by the student government, shall not exceed an amount to be\ndetermined by the chancellor in consultation with the student assembly. Upon\nregistration, every student shall be required to pay one half of the total fee, or proportionate part thereof, if registered for less than full-time, each term\nfor which he or she registers. Failure to pay the required fee may result in\ndenial of registration. The fiscal officer of each State-operated campus shall\ncollect the prescribed fee at the time of registration and shall pay over the\namounts so collected to an independent fiscal agent designated by the student\ngovernment and approved by the chief administrative officer, or designee. If\nthere is reasonable evidence in an individual case, as determined by the chief\nadministrative officer, or designee, that payment of the fee may cause undue\nhardship, such student may nevertheless be allowed to register and the\nobligation to pay such fee shall thereafter be subject to administrative review\nand action by the chief administrative officer, or designee, after consultation\nwith the student government. In a case in which a student has been allowed to\nregister without payment of the student activity fee, the chief administrative\nofficer may withhold grades or transcripts of credits until payment has been\nwaived by such administrative action or the obligation has been met. In\naddition, the student government may determine to deny participation in student\nactivities in the case of any student who has not fulfilled his or her\nobligation with respect to payment of the mandatory student activity fee. Student imposed fees in excess of the mandated fee shall be considered\nvoluntary within the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section. Policies\ngoverning refunds to students who cancel their registration or withdraw from\nthe university shall be established by the student government. For those\nperiods outside the academic year (i.e., summer session) a mandatory fee also\nmay be collected, provided the amount of the fee is consistent with the level\nof programming provided during that period and is used in accordance with the\n\nBoard of Trustees' Policy. The amount of this fee shall be determined by the\nstudent government in consultation with the chief administrative officer of the\ncampus, or designee, and shall not be included within the cap applicable to the\namount charged for the academic year. (3)\n\nUse of funds. Funds which are collected\nunder provisions of this section which require every student to pay the\nprescribed mandatory fee and all revenues generated from use of the fee shall\nbe used only for support of the following programs for the benefit of the\ncampus community: (i) programs of cultural\nand educational enrichment; (ii)\nrecreational and social activities; (iii)\ntutorial programs; (iv)\nathletic programs, both intramural and\nintercollegiate; (v) student\npublications and other media; (vi)\nassistance to recognized student organizations including religious student\norganizations, for the purposes and activities of the organization that are of\nan educational, cultural, recreational or social nature, and provided further\nthat the criteria for recognition of student organizations, the criteria\ngoverning eligibility for funding of and allocations to such student\norganizations from student activity fees shall be specified in the constitution\nand by-laws of the student government; (vii)\ninsurance related to conduct of these\nprograms; (viii)\nadministration of\nthese programs; (ix)\ntransportation\nin support of these programs; (x) student services to supplement or add to those provided by the\nuniversity; (xi)\nremuneration and\nreimbursement of reasonable and necessary travel expenses in accordance with\nstate guidelines to students for service to student government; (xii)\ncampus-based scholarships, fellowships\nand grant programs, provided the funds are administered by the campus or a\ncampus affiliated organization; (xiii)\npayments for contractual services\nprovided by a nonprofit organization to the extent that such services are in\naid of an approved student activity during the budget year and which activity\nserves the purposes set forth above and provided further that such payments may\nnot be exclusively for the general corporate purposes of such\norganization; (xiv)\nsalaries for\nprofessional nonstudent employees of the student government to the extent that\nthey are consistent with hiring practices and compensation rates of other\ncampus-affiliated organizations; and\n(xv)\ncharitable donations to a nonprofit\norganization; provided, however, that such donations may be funded only from\nthe proceeds of a fundraiser held by a recognized student\norganization. (4)\n\nDisbursement of funds. Proceeds of the student activity fee shall be disbursed\nby the student government, through the designated independent fiscal agent, provided that the proposed fiscal commitment for each expenditure shall have\nbeen approved by the chief administrative officer or designee. In the event\nthat the chief administrative officer, or designee, concludes that a particular\nproposed fiscal commitment may not be in compliance with an approved budgetary\nallocation and the provisions of this section, he or she shall refer such\nproposed fiscal commitment to the campus review board for review and\nrecommendation. Final determination for approval of the compliance with this\nsection of any proposed fiscal commitment shall rest with the chief\nadministrative officer or designee. Fiscal and accounting procedures prescribed\nby the chancellor, or designee, shall be adopted and observed by the student\ngovernment. These procedures shall include, among other things, provisions for\nan annual independent audit including the communication to student government\nmanagement by the independent auditor of any internal control matter(s) noted\nduring the conduct of the audit; and for public dissemination of information\nregarding the budgeting process including a list of funded activities, current\nallocations and expenditures. (5)\n\nChanges to approved budget. Changes to the approved budget after certification, either prior to or subsequent to the collection of mandatory fees, shall be\nsubject to administrative review and certification by the chief administrative\nofficer, or designee, in the same manner as was applicable to the original\nbudget. (d) Use of\ncollege facilities. The provisions of this section shall not be interpreted to\nauthorize the use of college facilities for student activities and programs\nwithout appropriate administrative approval. Appropriate payments shall be made\nby student organizations for the use of college facilities where there are\nextraordinary costs to the college associated with such events. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
