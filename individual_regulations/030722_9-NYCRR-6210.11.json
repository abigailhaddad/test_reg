  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.11 - Voting systems security\n\nState Regulations\n\nCounty board election officials shall take all steps\nnecessary to ensure that the voting systems and election processes entrusted to\nthem are protected against errors, accidents and malicious or fraudulent\nmanipulation, consistent with voting system security procedures developed by\nthe State Board. (a) The county board\nshall establish procedures and policies which protect the voting system\nfacility itself, the voting systems stored therein, and servers and computer\nsystems used therein. The county board shall also ensure that any security\nfeatures or processes recommended by the vendor, such as virus protections, shall be implemented. The county board shall further provide within the\nfacility, locked, secure storage for all ballots, system test materials, copies\nof software, copies of ballot programming, programming devices, memory devices, disability access devices, voting system keys, key cards, and all ancillary\ndevices or voting system components and materials. (b) County boards shall adopt security\nprocedures which restrict and document all access to voting systems, computer\nsystems, software, firmware, system components, programming, test materials and\nany other ballot creation, counting or other system components. All\nprogramming, maintenance testing, pre-qualification and post-election testing\nand canvassing/recanvassing, shall be conducted by bi-partisan teams and be\nperformed in secure, restricted-access space, and logs shall be maintained\nindicating task/staff assignments, time in and out, security password change\ndates and other such pertinent data. (c) Internal security procedures shall\nrequire the frequent changing of passwords at established intervals, including\nprior to setup for use in any election. (1)\n\nIf at any time the county board discovers that any password has been lost, shared or otherwise compromised, all passwords shall be changed. (2)\n\nIf persons with administrative passwords\nare assisting in the performance of election tasks not related to the\nadministration of the voting system, they shall perform such work using their\nstaff password, and not their administrative password. (d) The county board shall maintain a log, in\na manner prescribed by the State Board, which clearly tracks a chain of custody\nfor each voting system. (1)\nA log shall be\nmaintained for each voting system, identifying the placement of and serial\nnumber on each tamper-evident seal used to secure the voting system and its\ndevices while in the custody of the county board, used to secure the device for\ndelivery to poll sites, and for the securing and return of same, after the\nclose of polls. (i) At any stage of the\nadministration, programming or conduct of an election, if a tamper-evident seal\nis found to have been compromised, or if serial numbers as logged do not match\nthose on the device, the matter shall be immediately documented and\ninvestigated. (ii)\n\nThe county board\nshall adopt procedures which direct their actions in such investigations, and\nwhich identify methods for the resolution or amelioration of such breaches of\nsecurity. (2)\nA copy of\ncounty board security procedures and policies shall be filed with the State\n\nBoard upon adoption. (e) The voting system supporting software, the election management software (EMS)\nand the specific election configuration and ballot configuration for each\nelection shall be maintained under control of the county board and placed in\nsecure locked storage at all times when not in use. Master copies of all\nelection configuration and ballot configuration shall be retained in secured\nlocked storage as designated by the county commissioners and separate from the\nlocation of working copies, from the time of completion of pre-qualification\ndemonstration testing and for as long after the election as required by law, these regulations, as ordered by a court, or as directed by the State\n\nBoard. (f) The county board shall\nenforce the provisions of the Election Law which relate to canvassing and\nrecanvassing of votes cast in an election, as well as these regulations and\ndirectives of the State Board. (g) The voting system and any computers or other peripheral devices shall be\ndedicated solely to election configuration, ballot configuration (layout) and\nvote counting functions, including tests listed in section\n6210.2\nof this Part\npre-qualification and post-election testing. The system components used\nspecifically for voting, such as any scanner, DRE or ballot marking device, shall not be capable of being networked: no modem, telecommunications nor\nwireless communications devices may be components of a voting system. Other\ncomponents that are not physically or electronically connected to a scanner, DRE, ballot marking device or other component used specifically for voting may\nbe configured as a closed network which can not be connected to any other\ninternal or external network. Such closed network may be used for the\npreparation of ballot configuration (layout) and vote counting functions. Any\nEMS system configured as a closed network requires prior approval and testing\nby the State Board of Elections. No unapproved software or hardware may be\ninstalled or run at any time on any part of the voting system. (h) Audit records shall be prepared for all\nphases of election configuration and ballot configuration using devices under\nthe care, custody and control of the county board. Such audit records shall\naddress the election configuration and ballot configuration phase, pre-qualification tests, and voting and ballot-counting operations. The voting\nsystem supporting software shall log and report audit data such that: (1)\n\nSystems shall provide the capability to\ncreate and maintain a real-time audit record to record and provide the operator\nor election inspector with continuous updates on voting system\nstatus. (2)\n\nAll systems shall\ninclude a real-time clock as part of the system's hardware. The system shall\nmaintain an absolute record of the time and date or a record relative to some\nevent whose time and data are known and recorded. (3)\n\nAll audit record entries shall include\nthe time-and-date stamp. (4)\n\nThe\ngeneration of audit record entries shall not be able to be terminated or\naltered by program control, hardware control or by the intervention of any\nperson. The physical security and integrity of the record shall be maintained\nat all times. (5)\n\nThe system shall\nbe capable of printing a copy of the audit record. (6)\n\nAny and all reports produced by the\nprinter shall be retained by the county board in accordance with Election Law\nand these regulations. (i) All vote counting programs, including the\nvoting system supporting software and the specific election configuration and\nballot configuration coding for each election, shall be available for\ninspection by the State Board. (j) The county board shall adopt a contingency plan, which addresses how an\nelection shall be configured, tested, conducted, and tabulated, in the event of\nan unanticipated or unavoidable event. Such plan shall, at a minimum, identify\nan alternate site within the county, from which election management, administrative or canvassing tasks can be conducted, in the event their own\nfacility is unavailable to them or otherwise compromised. (k) Following voting and ballot accounting, the ballots as originally secured at the close of polls on Election Day, shall\nbe reassembled, packaged, sealed and labeled. (1)\n\nThe county board shall develop a written\nplan for the retention and storage of the foregoing, and any other data\nprocessing materials related to the vote counting, and of all documentation of\nthe election. (2)\n\nAll such ballots, materials and documents shall be placed in locked storage in a secure location\nand shall remain there until the expiration of the period for challenging\nelections and for as long as required by law, State Board regulations, or\nunless a court orders their release. (l) Voting systems and election management\nsystems shall be implemented such that the county board's voting system will\nonly accept election configuration and ballot configuration from that board's\nelection management system and an election management system will only accept\nresults from that board's voting systems, unless two or more county boards\nenter into a mutually-acceptable written agreement to share election\nconfiguration and ballot configuration programming services. A copy of such\nwritten agreement shall be filed with the State Board. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
