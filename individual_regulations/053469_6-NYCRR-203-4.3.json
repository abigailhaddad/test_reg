  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 203-4.3 - Centrifugal Compressors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe requirements of this\nsection apply to centrifugal natural gas compressors located at natural gas\ntransmission compressor stations, and natural gas underground storage\nfacilities. (2)\n\nThe requirements of\nthis section do not apply to centrifugal natural gas compressors that operate\nfewer than 200 hours over a rolling twelve (12) month period total provided\nthat the owner or operator: (i) Maintains a\nnon-re-settable hour meter for operation, and\n(ii)\n\nMaintains a record, for a minimum of\nfive (5) years, of the operating hours per month, and\n(iii)\n\nProvide a rolling twelve (12) month\ntotal calculation of hours to the Department once per year. (b) Beginning January 1, 2023, centrifugal compressors with wet seals shall control the wet seal vent\ngas with the use of a vapor collection system as described in Subpart 203-8 or\nshall replace the wet seal with a dry seal. (c) Beginning January 1, 2023, components on\ndriver engines and compressors that use a wet seal or a dry seal shall comply\nwith the LDAR requirements specified in Subpart 203-7, and; (d) The compressor wet seal shall be measured\nannually by direct measurement (high volume sampling, bagging, calibrated flow\nmeasuring instrument) while the compressor is running at normal operating\ntemperature in order to determine the wet seal emission flow rate using one of\nthe following methods: (1)\n\nVent stacks shall\nbe equipped with a meter or instrumentation to measure the wet seal emissions\nflow rate; or, (2)\n\nVent stacks\nshall be equipped with a clearly identified access port installed at a height\nof no more than six (6) feet above ground level or a permanent support surface\nfor making wet seal emission flow rate measurements. (3)\n\nIf the measurement is not obtained\nbecause the compressor is not operating for the scheduled test date and the\nremainder of the inspection period, then testing shall be conducted within\nfourteen (14) days of resumed operation. The owner or operator shall maintain\nfor at least five (5) years, and make available upon request by the Department, a copy of operating records that document the compressor hours of operation and\nrun dates and a signed statement from the responsible official in order to\ndemonstrate compliance with this requirement. (e) A compressor with a wet seal emission\nflow rate greater than three (3) scfm, or a combined flow rate greater than the\nnumber of wet seals multiplied by three (3) scfm, shall be successfully\nrepaired within thirty (30) days of the initial flow rate measurement. (1)\n\nAn extension to the thirty (30) day\ndeadline may be granted by the Department if the owner or operator can\ndemonstrate that the parts or equipment required to make necessary repairs have\nbeen ordered and the owner or operator notifies the Department as specified in\n203-10.3 to report the delay and provides an estimated time by which the\nrepairs will be completed. (f) ) If parts are not available to make the\nrepairs, the wet seal shall be replaced with a dry seal no later than eighteen\n(18) months after the exceeding measurement is made. (g) The owner or operator shall maintain for\nat least five (5) years, a record of the flow rate measurement and shall report\nthe result to the Department within sixty (60) days after completed. (h) A centrifugal natural gas compressor with\na wet seal emission flow rate measured above the standard specified in\nsubdivision\n203-4.3\n(e) and\nwhich is a critical component, shall be successfully repaired by the end of the\nnext scheduled process shutdown or within twelve (12) months from the date of\nthe initial flow rate measurement, whichever is sooner.

Tit. 6\n§§\n203-4.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 16, 2022/Volume XLIV, Issue 07, eff. 3/3/2022\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
