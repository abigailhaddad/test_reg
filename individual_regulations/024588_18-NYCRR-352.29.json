  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.29 - Budgeting-the budgetary method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The budgetary method shall be applied to\nthe individual case to determine eligibility and the amount of the grant and/or\nthe amount to be paid for a \"purchase of service.\"\n(b) When the estimate of regularly recurring\nneed based on the regulations of the department exceeds the available income\nand/or resources, the difference shall be known as a \"budget deficit.\" When the\navailable income and/or resources exceed the estimate of regularly recurring\nneed, the difference shall be known as a \"budget surplus.\"\n(c) An individual or family shall be entitled\nto public assistance and care when a budget deficit exists; provided, however, a household shall not be deemed in need and entitled to any cash assistance\nwhen there is a budget deficit of less than $10. (d) Where investigation has been completed\nand need established on a continuing basis, the regularly recurring cash grant\nshall meet the full budget deficit, if there is one, and/or provision shall be\nmade for the purchase of service when need is based on the need for such\nservice, except that when the estimate of regularly recurring need and/or the\namount of the assistance grant based on the regulations of the department do\nnot equal a whole dollar amount, the amount(s) shall be rounded down to the\nnext whole dollar amount. (e) When\nan item is paid by voucher or restricted grant, the amount paid must be\ndeducted from the ensuing regularly recurring cash grant. When payments for\nheat and/or domestic energy (lights, cooking, hot water) are made by voucher, amounts not to exceed the following are to be removed from the grant: (1)\n\nFor heat only bills, the fuel for heating\nallowance, as defined in section\n352.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart, is to be removed from the grant for a recipient not residing in or\nbudgeted in accordance with Section 8 certificate housing provisions as\noutlined in section\n352.31\n(d)(2)(ii)\nof this Part. An amount equal to the appropriate fuel allowance schedule set\nforth in section\n352.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart for the appropriate heating type and public assistance household size is\nto be removed from the grant for a recipient residing in Section 8 certificate\nhousing or budgeted in accordance with the Section 8 certificate housing\nprovisions outlined in section\n352.31\n(d)(2)(ii)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor domestic only\nbills, an average monthly amount of the domestic energy cost is to be removed\nfrom the grant. However, when the recipient's utility bill (heat and/or\ndomestic energy) is placed on voucher payment as a result of recipient\nmismanagement, the provisions set forth in section\n352.5\n(g) of this\n\nPart apply. In the case where the amount paid is for a period of more than one\nmonth, the deduction from the ensuing regularly recurring cash grants must be\nfor the same number of months for which the bill is being paid. (f) When the budget deficit\nincreases between periods covered by the last regularly recurring grant, a\nspecial grant shall be made for the difference. This shall include the\nallowance necessary to provide on a prorated basis for an additional member of\nthe household or for a member of the public assistance household who returns\nhome for a visit. (g) When an\napplicant for public assistance or care is an essential person in an SSI case, the amount of his/her essential person payment shall be considered as income\nand available to the applicant in determining his/her eligibility and degree of\nneed. (h) Treatment of income in\nexcess of standard of need. (1)\n\nFor public\nassistance households, when the assistance unit's monthly income after\napplication of applicable disregards exceeds the household's needs because of\nreceipt of non-recurring lump sum earned or unearned income, (including\nretirement, survivors', and disability insurance benefits as provided for under\ntitle II of the Social Security Act; other retroactive monthly benefits; and\npayments in the nature of a windfall, e.g., inheritances or lottery winnings, personal injury and workers' compensation awards), except to the extent that\nsuch lump sum income is earmarked and used for the purpose for which it is paid\n(e.g., monies for previously incurred medical bills resulting from an accident\nor injury; funeral and burial costs; and replacement or repair of resources), the family will be ineligible for aid for a calculated period. This period is\ncalculated by dividing the sum of the lump sum income and any other income\nreceived during the month, after applicable disregards for the month, by the\nhousehold needs for a family which consists of the family assistance or safety\nnet assistance unit plus any other individual whose needs are taken into\naccount in determining eligibility and the amount of the grant. Any income\nremaining from this calculation is income in the first month following the\nperiod of ineligibility. (2)\n\nThe\nlocal district shall shorten the period of ineligibility in any one or more of\nthe following cases and in the following manner: (i) by excluding from any lump sum income for\nwhich this subdivision applies any amount which would be exempt and disregarded\nas cash and liquid or non-liquid resources because it does not exceed the\nresource eligibility limit as established under section\n352.23\n(b) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nby recalculating the\nperiod of ineligibility based upon the new standard of need and the amount of\nthe lump sum which would remain if a proportionate amount thereof had been\ngranted in each month of ineligibility, when an event occurs which, had the\nfamily been receiving assistance for the month of occurrence, would result in a\nchange in the amount of assistance payable for such month; or\n(iii)\nby recalculating the period of\nineligibility based upon the actual amount of the lump sum remaining when the\nincome received or a portion thereof has become unavailable to the members of\nthe family for reasons that were beyond the control of such members. Unavailable shall mean the family no longer has the lump sum income. Reasons\nwhich are considered to be beyond the control of the family shall include but\nare not limited to any event or circumstances which the family did not foresee\nor could not prevent, such as loss or theft of income or a life threatening\ncircumstance; or\n(iv)\nby\nrecalculating the period of ineligibility based upon the actual amount of the\nlump sum remaining when the family incurs, becomes responsible for, and pays\nmedical expenses as defined under the Medical Assistance Program in the month\nof ineligibility; or\n(v) by\nrecalculating the period of ineligibility based upon the actual amount of the\nlump sum remaining if the family, within 90 days of receipt of the lump sum, has used any or all of the lump sum for the following exempt resources: (a) to purchase an automobile that is needed\nto seek or retain employment or for travel to and from work activities and\nwhich is exempt from the public assistance resource limit under section\n352.23\n(b) of this\n\nPart; or\n(b) to open a separate\nbank account or bank accounts that are exempt from the public assistance\nresource limit under section\n352.23\n(b) of this\n\nPart for the purpose of purchasing an automobile to seek or retain employment\nor for the purpose of paying tuition at a two-year or four-year accredited\npost-secondary educational institution; or\n(c) to purchase a burial plot that is exempt\nfrom the public assistance resource limit under section\n352.23\n(b) of this\n\nPart; or\n(d) to purchase a\nbona-fide funeral agreement that is exempt from the public assistance resource\nlimit under section\n352.23\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nIn\ninstances when an individual makes a voluntary payment of excess income to a\nlocal district as recovery for past assistance granted, the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall not apply; however, if the amount of\nthe excess income exceeds the amount of past assistance, the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall apply to the remainder. (i) Residency. (1)\n\nIn accordance with section\n131-a\n(3)\nof the Social Services Law, the following\nrules apply for persons entering this State and applying for home relief. For\nthe first six months after establishing residency in this State, home relief\nbenefits are limited to the standard of payment in the state in which the\napplicant resides immediately prior to establishing residency in this State. In\nno event can the grant be greater than the grant for which the applicant would\notherwise be eligible for under this Title. For purposes of this subdivision, the standard of payment which would be available under the laws of another\nstate refers to a schedule of comparative grants which the department will\ndistribute to each social services district and other interested parties and\nwhich will be effective on July 1st of each odd numbered year, beginning in\n1995. The schedule will set forth, for any state which financially participates\nin or mandates a program of assistance generally available to needy persons\nmeeting specified income and resource requirements, the amount of the state's\nmaximum standard of payment, if any, for each household size. If there is no\ngeneral assistance program in the state in which the applicant previously\nresided, home relief will not be payable for the first six months after\nestablishing residency in this State. Home relief benefits are not payable for\npersons entering this State from outside the United States, its territories or\npossessions for the first six months after they establish residency in this\n\nState. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this\nsubdivision, an individual establishes when his or her residency in this State\nbegan by providing to the appropriate employee of the social services district\ninformation showing when the individual entered the State and establishing that\nthe individual is currently residing in the State with a fixed intention to\nremain here. (3)\n\nThis subdivision\nwill apply to recipients of aid to dependent children when all necessary\n\nFederal approvals are obtained. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
