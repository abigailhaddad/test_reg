(2)\n\nAn operational plan will be approved only\nwhere it is established that the facility will meet, and will be operated in\naccordance with, all applicable provisions of law and the requirements of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nIf a program other than a\nshelter for families is or will be operating in the same building or on the\nsame premises as a shelter for families and such program requires a department-\napproved operating certificate, license or permit, an operational plan for the\nshelter for families will only be approved if there is a valid operating\ncertificate, license or permit for such other program. (4)\n(i) The\ndepartment must advise the local social services district in writing of its\napproval or disapproval of a proposed operational plan within 45 days of\nreceipt of the plan except as provided in subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, if a shelter for families is located in the\nsame building or on the same premises as a program requiring an operating\ncertificate, license or permit issued by the department and if such\ncertificate, license or permit has not been issued at the time the proposed\noperational plan for the shelter for families is submitted, the department will\nnot approve the operational plan until after such certificate, license or\npermit has been issued.

(iii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, if the department determines that additional information is\nrequired before it can approve or disapprove the proposed operational plan, the\ndepartment within 30 days of receiving the proposed operational plan may\nrequest that the social services district submit additional information within\n30 days of the request for such additional information. The department must\nadvise the social services district in writing within 30 days of receipt of the\nadditional information of its approval or disapproval of the operational\nplan. (iv)\n\nNotwithstanding\nsubparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, a social services district\nmay request that the department give limited approval of an operational plan. Limited approval will be withdrawn by the department if the facility's\noperational plan is not fully approved by the department within one year of\ngranting limited approval or a lesser time period as specified by the\ndepartment. If limited approval is withdrawn, the social services district may\nnot continue to claim reimbursement for the costs associated with the operation\nof the facility. The department may give limited approval if the operational\nplan meets the following criteria: (a) the\ndepartment has been provided with information that the facility is in\ncompliance with all applicable State and local laws, regulations and codes, as\nspecified in section\n900.5\n(a) of this\n\nPart; (b) the facility's procedures\nfor the admission of residents and transfer and discharge of residents are in\ncompliance with the requirements set forth in sections\n900.6, 900.7 and\n900.8\nof this Part; (c) the facility's plans for health services, supervision and food service arrangements are in compliance with the\nrequirements set forth in sections\n900.10, 900.11\nand\n900.13\nof this Part; (d) the facility's rules setting forth\nresident's rights and responsibilities while residing in the facility are in\ncompliance with the requirements set forth in section\n900.9\nof this Part; and\n(e) the plan contains on forms and in the\nmanner prescribed by the department, a financial statement for the shelter's\nmost recently completed fiscal year, if any, and a proposed one year budget, including estimated income and expenditures. However, if this information is\nnot provided, the department may, subject to the approval of the Director of\nthe Division of the Budget, establish an interim per diem rate. State\nreimbursement may not exceed this rate until full approval of the operational\nplan is granted. (e) An operational plan approved by the\ndepartment will remain in effect for a maximum period of five years. An\noperational plan for a shelter for families located in the same building or on\nthe same premises as a program requiring an operating certificate, license or\npermit issued by the department, however, will be considered approved only for\nso long as such other program has a valid operating certificate, license or\npermit but in no case longer than five years. No later than 60 days prior to\nthe expiration of an operational plan, the social services district must submit\non forms and in the manner prescribed by the department, a request to renew the\napproval of the operational plan. Such request must include appropriate\nfinancial data; any proposed new, or changes to existing, contracts; any\nproposed revisions to leases or rental agreements; documentation that the\nfacility is in compliance with applicable State and local laws, regulations, and codes as specified in section\n900.5\n(a) of this\n\nPart; and information regarding any other changes being proposed to the current\noperational plan. The social services district may request an extension of the\n60-day period in order to submit appropriate financial data, and the department\nmay grant one extension, not to exceed six months. If an extension is granted, the department may, subject to the approval of the director of the budget, either continue reimbursement at the approved rate or establish an interim per\ndiem rate. State reimbursement may not exceed these per diem rates, and will\ncontinue until such time as either the appropriate financial data is submitted\nand the operational plan is approved, or operational plan approval by the\ndepartment is withdrawn. (f) Proposed revisions to an approved operational plan must be submitted by the\nlocal social services district to the department for approval prior to\nimplementation. An operational plan for a shelter for families located in the\nsame building or on the same premises as a program requiring an operating\ncertificate, license or permit issued by the department must be revised if the\noperation of such other program ceases or if there is a change in the operating\ncertificate, license or permit for such program. Proposed revisions are subject\nto the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section. (g) For costs incurred by a facility that\nbegins operation after the effective date of this Part, reimbursement may be\navailable from the date the social services district submits its proposed\noperational plan provided: (1)\nthe facility\nis operational at the time the plan is submitted or within 45 days after the\ndate of submittal; (2)\nthat if the\ndepartment has requested additional information, the social services district\nsubmits such information within 30 days; and\n(3)\nthe operational plan is fully approved no\nlater than one year from the date the social services district submits its\nproposed operational plan or a lesser time period as specified by the\ndepartment.
