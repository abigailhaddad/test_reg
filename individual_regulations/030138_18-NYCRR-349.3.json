(ii)\nA\nqualified alien who has resided in the United States for five or more years but\nwhose entry into the United States was on or after August 22, 1996, is, if\notherwise eligible, eligible for family assistance and safety net\nassistance.

(2)\n\nEligibility for services. (i) Qualified aliens, if otherwise eligible\nand except as otherwise provided by Federal law shall be eligible for services\nfunded under title XX of the Federal Social Security Act. (ii)\n\nAny alien, including an alien who is not\na qualified alien, is eligible for adult protective services and services and\nassistance relating to child protection to the extent that such person is\notherwise eligible pursuant to the regulations of the Office of Temporary and\n\nDisability Assistance and the Office of Children and Family Services of the\ndepartment.

(c) Referral and reporting of aliens\nunlawfully residing in the United States. (1)\n\nReferral. Any applicant or recipient who has been determined to be ineligible\nfor family assistance, or safety net assistance because he or she is an alien\nunlawfully residing in the United States or because he or she failed to furnish\nevidence that he or she is lawfully residing in the United States must be\nimmediately referred to the United States Bureau of Immigration and Customs\n\nEnforcement, or the nearest consulate of the country of the applicant or the\nrecipient for such service or consulate to take appropriate action or furnish\nassistance. (2)\n\nReporting. Each\nsocial services district must report to the Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance, the name and address and other identifying information known to it\nwith respect to any alien known to be unlawfully in the United States in the\nmanner prescribed by such office. A determination that an individual is not\nlawfully present in the United States can be made only about someone who is\napplying for benefits. Such a determination cannot be made about an individual\nwho is only submitting an application for benefits on behalf of other family\nmembers. A determination by a social services district that an applicant is not\nlawfully present in the United States can only be a result of a finding of fact\nor conclusion of law that is made as part of a formal determination subject to\nadministrative review and supported by a determination by the Bureau of\n\nImmigration and Customs Enforcement or the Executive Office of Immigration\n\nReview, such as a final order of removal. A response to the social services\ndistrict through the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements System\n(SAVE) that shows no service record exists for the individual or indicates that\nthe individual has an immigration status rendering him or her ineligible for\nbenefits does not support a finding of unlawful presence in the United\n\nStates.
