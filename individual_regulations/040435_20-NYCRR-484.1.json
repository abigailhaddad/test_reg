  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 484.1 - Forms of returns\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 505\n(a) All returns are required to be filed on\nform MT-903 which is prescribed by the State Tax Commission, irrespective of\nthe method elected. An election must be made in the first return filed in any\ncalendar year as to the method of reporting, i.e., gross\nweight or unloaded weight method. (b) A carrier reporting under the gross\nweight method must include in his return every motor vehicle operated by him\nduring the period covered by the return which has a maximum gross weight alone\nor in combination with another motor vehicle of over 18,000 pounds. Every such\nmotor vehicle for which a permit was issued to the carrier must be accounted\nfor in the return even though no taxable miles were traveled during the period\ncovered by the return. It should also include all such motor vehicles on which\nthe carrier is paying the tax under a lease or interchange agreement, even\nthough the permits were issued to another person. However, no motor vehicle\nwith a maximum gross weight of 18,000 pounds or less should be included in the\nreturn. (c) A carrier electing the\nunloaded weight method must include in his return every truck having an\nunloaded weight of over 8,000 pounds and every tractor having an unloaded\nweight of over 4,000 pounds. Every such truck or tractor for which a permit was\nissued must be accounted for in the return even though no taxable miles were\ntraveled during the period covered by the return. In addition, it should\ninclude all such trucks and tractors on which the carrier is paying the tax\nunder a lease or interchange agreement, even though the permits were issued to\nanother person. However, such carrier should not include any trailer in the\nreturn, even though a permit was obtained for the trailer because of its\nmaximum gross weight, nor should any truck with an unloaded weight of 8,000\npounds or less and any tractor with an unloaded weight of 4,000 pounds or less\nbe included in the return if a permit was obtained for such truck or tractor\nsolely by reason of its maximum gross weight. (d) Motor vehicles for which the taxpayer has\npermits but which were operated by another carrier who will pay the tax shall\nbe listed on form TMT-4 (Equipment Interchanged or Leased). Copies of the\nprescribed forms will be furnished taxpayers by the State Tax Commission. Failure on the part of any taxpayer to receive a blank form will not, however, excuse him from making a return. Taxpayers not supplied with the proper forms\nshall make application therefor to the Tax Commission or at any district office\nin ample time to prepare and file returns on or before the due date. (e) In order to facilitate the audit of tax\nreturns and to aid in finding specific vehicles on such returns, carriers who\nhave highway use permits for a large number of vehicles are required to report\ntheir vehicles as follows: vehicles should be arranged according to weight\ngroups and, within each weight group, in numerical sequence according to the\npermit numbers of the trailers. For example, under the gross weight method all\ntractor-trailer combinations with a maximum gross weight between 56,001 and\n58,000 pounds should be in one group, those between 58,001 and 60,000 pounds\nshould be in another group, etc. Under the unloaded weight method trucks should\nbe listed first and arranged according to weight groups. Tractors should then\nbe listed and also arranged according to weight groups. The mileage for each\nvehicle or combination should be reported separately. However, under either\nmethod instead of computing the tax which is in curred for each such vehicle or\ncombination, the tax may be computed for the total mileage under each weight\ncategory. This should eliminate the need for making unnecessary\ncomputations. (f) The Tax\n\nCommission may require any taxpayer to file such other reports and submit such\nfurther information as it may require in the course of the administration of\nthe provisions of article 21 of the Tax Law. (g) Every return must have a certification to\nthe effect that the statements contained in the return are true. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
