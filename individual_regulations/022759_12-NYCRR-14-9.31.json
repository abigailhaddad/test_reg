  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.31 - Feed piping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The feedwater shall be introduced into a boiler in such a manner that the water\nwill not be discharged directly against surfaces exposed to gases of high\ntemperature or to direct radiation from the fire, or close to any riveted\njoints of the furnace sheets or of the shell. For pressures of 400 pounds or\nover, the feedwater inlet through the drum shall be fitted with shields, sleeves, or other suitable means to reduce the effects of temperature\ndifferentials in the shell or head. If necessary, the discharge end of a feed\npipe shall be fitted with a baffle to divert the flow from the riveted joint. Feedwater, other than condensate returned as provided for in section\n14-9.27\n(b) of\nthis Subpart, shall not be introduced through the blowoff. (b) When a horizontal-return tubular boiler\nexceeds 40 inches in diameter, the feedwater shall discharge at about three\nfifths the length from that end of the boiler which is subjected to the hottest\ngases of the furnace (except a horizontal-return tubular boiler equipped with\nan auxiliary feedwater heating and circulating device), above the central rows\nof tubes. The feed pipe shall be carried through the head or shell farthest\nfrom the point of discharge of the feedwater in the manner specified for a\nsurface blowoff in section 14- 9.27(a) of this Subpart, and be securely\nfastened inside the shell above the tubes. (c) In vertical tubular boilers having tubes\nfour feet or less in length, the feedwater shall be introduced at a point not\nless than one fourth the length of the tube above the lower tube sheet or crown\nsheet. For tubes more than four feet in length, the feedwater shall be\nintroduced at a point not less than 12 inches above the crown sheet. When the\nboiler is under pressure feedwater shall not be introduced through the openings\nor connections used for the water column, the water gage glass, or the gage\ncocks. In closed systems the water may be introduced through any opening when\nthe boiler is not under pressure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.31\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
