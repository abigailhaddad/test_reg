  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 202-2.3 - Required contents of an emission statement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Emission statements shall include the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nCertification by a responsible\nofficial. A responsible official must sign a form or other legal instrument\nprovided by the department to certify the emission statement information. Further, the certification must include the e-mail address of the responsible\nofficial. This certification shall state that after reasonable inquiry, the\nresponsible official has concluded that the statements and information in the\ndocument are accurate and complete in accordance with this Subpart, based on\nthe best available information. The certification shall include the full name, title, original signature, date of signature, e-mail address and telephone\nnumber of the responsible official. (2)\n\nFacility level information, consisting\nof: (i) full name of facility; (ii)\nowner's name; (iii)\nstreet address (physical location) of\nthe facility; (iv)\nfour-digit\nprimary SIC code or NAICS code for the facility; (v) calendar year for which emissions are\nbeing reported; and\n(vi)\ntotal\nfacility fuel use, average sulfur content, average ash content and heat value\n(for combustion installations). (3)\n\nProcess level information, consisting of: (i) process identification; (ii)\neight-digit SCC for the\nprocess; (iii)\nannual throughput or\nquantity of fuel consumed (combustion sources); (iv)\ndescription of the process; (v) description of installed air pollution\ncontrol equipment; (vi)\nthe average\nnumber of hours of operation per day (including annual, peak ozone season, and\npeak carbon monoxide season in carbon monoxide nonattainment or maintenance\nareas); (vii)\nthe average number of\ndays of operation per week (including annual, peak ozone season, and peak\ncarbon monoxide season in carbon monoxide nonattainment or maintenance\nareas); (viii)\nthe number of weeks\nper year of operation (including annual, peak ozone season, and peak carbon\nmonoxide season in carbon monoxide nonattainment or maintenance\nareas); (ix)\npercent operation by\nseason, January, February, and December; March-May; June-August; September-November (percent fuel use by season for combustion sources). The sum\nof the four seasons must equal 100 percent; (x) total days of operation (during the peak\nozone season, June-August, and peak carbon monoxide season, January, February, and December, in carbon monoxide nonattainment or maintenance areas); (xi)\ncontrol efficiencies achieved by the air\npollution control equipment. The control efficiency should reflect the total\ncontrol efficiency from all control equipment for a specific air contaminant\n(e.g., VOCs, NOx). If the actual control efficiency is unavailable, the design\nefficiency or the control efficiency limit imposed by a permit shall be\nused; (xii)\nannual reportable\nprocess emissions, for each regulated air contaminant emitted, (in units of\npounds per year). Emissions of individual contaminants (identified by CAS code)\nless than 10 pounds per year may be reported on a process basis as less than 10\npounds. For purposes of calculating emission fees, contaminants reported as\nless than 10 pounds will be treated as though 10 pounds of the contaminant were\nemitted. Reporting of emissions for processes with source classification codes\nbeginning with 1 or 2 is optional. In such cases, the department will calculate\nprocess-level emissions based upon the reported fuel use and published emission\nfactors; (xiii)\nannual reportable\nfugitive emissions. A facility must estimate fugitive emissions which are\ngenerated from its operation. A facility may aggregate fugitive emissions under\na single process to account for total facility fugitive emissions where the\norigin of such emissions cannot be identified. The facility must indicate such\naggregation has occurred on its emission statement; (xiv)\nemissions estimate method (see section\n202-2.4\nof this Subpart); (xv)\nemission factors and source from where\nthe emission factor was obtained (if used to determine actual\nemissions); (xvi)\nstart time\n(hour); and\n(xvii)\nwork weekday\nemissions. (b) The department shall provide instructions for completing the emission\nstatements each year. These instructions shall include emissions method codes, chemical family codes, and control equipment types. (c) A facility is required to report actual\nemissions for each contaminant listed on its title V operating permit. A\nfacility must also report its actual emissions of each of the following\ncontaminants: (1)\nsulfur oxides\n(SO\n2\n); (2)\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs); (3)\nnitrogen oxides\n(NO\nx\n); (4)\ncarbon monoxide (CO); (5)\nlead and\nlead compounds (Pb); (6)\nprimary\nPM\n2.5\n(includes filterable and condensable); (7)\nprimary PM\n10\n(includes filterable and condensable); (8)\nammonia\n(NH\n3\n); (9)\nhazardous air pollutants (HAPs) reported at the CAS registry number level, as\ndefined in Part 200 of this Title; (10)\n\nCarbon dioxide\n(CO\n2\n); (11)\n\nMethane (CH\n4\n); (12)\n\nNitrous oxide\n(N\n2\nO); (13)\n\nHydrofluorocarbons (HFCs); (14)\n\nPerfluorocarbons (PFCs); (15)\n\nSulfur hexafluoride (SF\n6\n); and\n(16)\n\nAny regulated air contaminant. (d) The department will provide\n\nTitle V facilities with emission statement survey forms that reflect the\ninformation contained in the facility's operating permit. A responsible\nofficial must certify to the accuracy of this information and correct or\nsupplement the provided emission statement if it contains incorrect or missing\ninformation. The submission of an emission statement by a facility does not\nconstitute an application for a permit modification or relieve the facility of\nthe requirement to submit a permit modification application in accordance with\n\nPart 201 of this Title as required. (e) Facilities are required to report\nestimates of VOC, NO, SO, primary PM, primary PM, and CO emissions from exempt\nactivities as defined in section\n201-3.2\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, every three years as part of the periodic inventory (beginning in 1990, i.e., 2017, 2020, 2023, 2026, etc.). (f) As part of the periodic inventory, the\ndepartment shall provide additional forms and instructions to facilities in\norder to verify or collect the following information for permitted activities\nin the Title V permit: (1)\nX stack coordinate\n(longitude); (2)\nY stack coordinate\n(latitude); (3)\nstack\nheight; (4)\nstack\ndiameter; (5)\nexit gas\ntemperature; (6)\nexit gas\nvelocity; (7)\nexit gas flow\nrate; (8)\ndesign capacity; and\n(9)\nmaximum nameplate\ncapacity.
