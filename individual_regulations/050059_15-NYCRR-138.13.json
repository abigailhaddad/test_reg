(2)\n\nAll advertising must\nindicate that the course is six hours in length. (3)\n\nPoint/Insurance Reduction Program\nadvertising shall not be combined with any other advertising such as driving\nschool or insurance agency advertising unless it has been approved by the\nsponsoring agency in order to protect the public from potentially confusing or\nmisleading information. (4)\n\nNo\nsponsoring agency, delivery agency, instructor or employee may publish, advertise or imply that the completion of the course conducted for point\nreduction will result in the erasing or masking of any information from a\nmotorist's driving record. Communication with course participants must clearly\nindicate that while certain departmental administrative actions based upon a\nmotorist's point accumulation may be prevented, all traffic convictions will\ncontinue to be displayed on the motorist's driving record. (5)\n\nNo sponsoring agency, delivery agency, instructor or employee may make false or misleading claims or statements in any\nof its advertisements. (6)\n\nAll\ncourse advertising must identify the sponsoring agency and delivery\nagency. (7)\n\nAny material in\ndepartmentally produced literature may be quoted without attribution, provided\nthe quote retains its original meaning. Any presentation of departmental\nmaterial which implies or creates a meaning other than the meaning offered by\nthe department is prohibited. (8)\n\nThe only acceptable reference to the department is that the sponsoring agency's\ncourse is approved by the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. Words\nwhich convey partnership, such as \"in cooperation with,\" \"supervised by,\"\n\"recommended by,\" or \"endorsed by\" the Department of Motor Vehicles may not be\nused. No sponsoring agency, delivery agency, instructor or employee shall\nfalsely advertise or represent itself to be an agent or employee of the\n\nDepartment or of New York State unless the sponsoring agency is a State agency\nor the State agency is an approved delivery agency offering courses to its\nemployees. No delivery agency may use the words \"DMV approved\" in their\nadvertising unless they specifically state that the sponsoring agency's course\nhas been approved by the DMV for point and insurance reduction\npurposes. (9)\n\nNo sponsoring agency\nor delivery agency shall conduct business or display or distribute any\nadvertising material within a building owned or leased by the State or county\nin which motor vehicle registrations or licensees are issued to the\npublic. (10)\n\nNo organization shall\nadvertise point or insurance reduction benefits in any manner until such time\nas such advertising has been approved in accordance with this Part. (11)\n\nNo sponsoring agency or delivery agency\nshall use any name other than its approved name for advertising or publicity\npurposes.

(12)\nA copy, recording or videotape of any\nadvertisement shall be kept on file by a sponsoring agency or delivery agency\nfor three years along with a record of when and where it was used or\ndistributed. (13)\n\nAdvertising shall\nreflect the serious nature of the motor vehicle accident prevention course and, in no way, either through the text of the advertisement or through the name of\nthe course, diminish the subject matter of the course. Advertising shall not\nrefer to gimmicks or enticements, such as comedy or free gifts, or to any\nbenefits other than point and insurance reduction. (14)\n\nPermission to re-publish any content of\nthe department's web site shall be obtained from the department's Internet\noffice. The department will provide an image to use as a link to the site. The\ndepartment's web site may not be placed within any other web site\nframes. (15)\n\nComparative statistics\nor claims which state or imply that one sponsoring agency is more effective\nthan another are not to be used. The effectiveness of one sponsoring agency's\napproved course may not be statistically compared to another approved\ncourse. (16)\n\nNo implicit or\nexplicit claims which are not supported by documentation are permissible. Such\ndocumentation and the proposed advertising must be reviewed and approved by the\nsponsoring agency in accordance with the standards of this section before they\nmay be used. (17)\n\nSponsoring\nagencies or delivery agencies should consider including the following topic\nguidelines in their advertising: (i) Persons\nare eligible once in 18 months for point reduction, even if the point reduction\nbenefit is not used. Points which are reduced remain on a motorist's record, but are not counted by the department in determining further administrative\nactions against the license. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
