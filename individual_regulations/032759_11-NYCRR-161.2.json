  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 161.2 - Tort reform refiling requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To alleviate affordability and availability problems affecting commercial risk, professional liability and public entity insurance, the omnibus and companion laws contain a number of significant measures in the nature of tort reform: (1)\nmodification of the joint and several liability doctrine; (2)\nnew appellate standard for review of verdicts; (3)\ncredit for collateral sources; (4)\nitemized verdicts required in tort actions; (5)\nperiodic payment of substantial future damages; (6)\npenalties for frivolous litigation; (7)\nimmunity for uncompensated nonprofit directors and officers; and\n(8)\nmodification of toxic tort statute of limitations. (b) With the exception of paragraphs (a)(7) and (8) of this section, these reforms are across-the-board measures, affecting tort actions regardless of the identity of plaintiffs or defendants. Collectively, these meaningful measures can reasonably be expected to reduce commercial risk, professional liability and public entity insurance costs. These overall cost savings must be reflected in appropriate reduced rates for these coverages. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n161.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
