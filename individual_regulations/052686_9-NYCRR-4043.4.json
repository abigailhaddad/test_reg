Tit. 9 § 4043.4 - Trainer's responsibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ntrainer shall be responsible at all times for the condition of all horses\ntrained by him or her. No trainer shall start or permit a horse in his or her\ncustody, care or control to be started if the trainer knows, or might have\nknown or have cause to believe, that the horse has received any drug or other\nrestricted substance that could result in a positive test. The trainer shall be\nheld responsible for any positive test unless the trainer can show by\nsubstantial evidence that neither the trainer nor any employee nor agent was\nresponsible for the administration of the drug or other restricted substance. Every trainer must guard each horse trained by him or her in such manner and\nfor such period of time prior to racing the horse so as to prevent any person, whether or not employed by or connected with the owner or trainer, from\nadministering any drug or other restricted substance to such horse contrary to\nthis Part.

The record(s) of every joint injection shall be submitted, in a form and manner\napproved by the commission, by the trainer to the commission within 48 hours of\nthe treatment.
