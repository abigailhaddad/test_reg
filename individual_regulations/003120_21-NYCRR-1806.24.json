Tit. 21 § 1806.24 - Standards for diversions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nproject sponsors of all diversions subject to review and approval under section\n1806.4, 1806.5 or\n1806.6\nof this Part shall comply\nwith the following standards. (b) For projects involving out-of-basin diversions, the following requirements\nshall apply: (1)\n\nProject sponsors shall: (i) demonstrate that they have made good\nfaith efforts to develop and conserve sources of water within the importing\nbasin, and have considered other reasonable alternatives to the\ndiversion; (ii)\ncomply with the\ngeneral standards set forth in sections 1801.3, 1806.21, and\n1806.22\nof this Part, and the\napplicable requirements of this Part relating to consumptive uses and\nwithdrawals. (2)\n\nIn\ndeciding whether to approve a proposed diversion out of the basin, the\ncommission shall also consider and the project sponsor shall provide\ninformation related to the following factors: (i) any adverse effects and cumulative\nadverse effects the project may have on the ability of the Susquehanna River\n\nBasin, or any portion thereof, to meet its own present and future water\nneeds; (ii)\nthe location, amount, timing, purpose and duration of the proposed diversion and how the project will\nindividually and cumulatively affect the flow of any impacted stream or river, and the freshwater inflow of the Chesapeake Bay, including the extent to which\nany diverted water is being returned to the basin or the bay; (iii)\nwhether there is a reasonably\nforeseeable need for the quantity of water requested by the project sponsor and\nhow that need is measured against reasonably foreseeable needs in the\n\nSusquehanna River Basin; (iv)\nthe\namount and location of water being diverted to the Susquehanna River Basin from\nthe importing basin; (v) the\nproximity of the project to the Susquehanna River Basin; (vi)\nthe project sponsor's pre-compact member\njurisdiction approvals to withdraw or divert the waters of the basin; (vii)\nhistoric reliance on sources within the\n\nSusquehanna River Basin. (3)\n\nIn deciding whether to approve a proposed\ndiversion out of the basin, the commission may also consider, but is not\nlimited to, the factors set forth in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this\nparagraph. The decision whether to consider the factors in this subdivision and\nthe amount of information required for such consideration, if undertaken, will\ndepend upon the potential for the proposed diversion to have an adverse impact\non the ability of the Susquehanna River Basin, or any portion thereof, to meet\nits own present and future needs: (i) the\nimpact of the diversion on economic development within the Susquehanna River\n\nBasin, the member states or the United States of America; (ii)\nthe cost and reliability of the\ndiversion versus other alternatives, including certain external costs, such as\nimpacts on the environment or water resources; (iii)\nany policy of the member jurisdictions\nrelating to water resources, growth and development; (iv)\nhow the project will individually and\ncumulatively affect other environmental, social and recreational\nvalues; (v) any land use and\nnatural resource planning being carried out in the importing basin. (c) For projects\ninvolving into-basin diversions, the following requirements shall apply. (1)\n\nProject sponsors shall: (i) provide information on the source, amount, and location of the water being diverted to the Susquehanna River Basin\nfrom the importing basin; (ii)\nprovide information on the water quality classification, if any, of the\n\nSusquehanna River Basin stream to which diverted water is being discharged and\nthe discharge location or locations; (iii)\ndemonstrate that they have applied for\nor received all applicable withdrawal or discharge permits or approvals related\nto the diversion, and demonstrate that the diversion will not result in water\nquality degradation that may be injurious to any existing or potential ground\nor surface water use. (2)\n\nIn deciding whether to approve a proposed\ndiversion into the basin, the commission shall also consider and the project\nsponsor shall provide information related to the following factors: (i) any adverse effects and cumulative\nadverse effects the project may have on the Susquehanna River Basin, or any\nportion thereof, as a result of the introduction or potential introduction of\ninvasive or exotic species that may be injurious to the water resources of the\nbasin; (ii)\nthe extent to which the\nproposed diversion satisfies all other applicable general and specific\nstandards set forth in sections\n1806.20\n-1806.25 of this Part\npertaining to withdrawals and consumptive use.
