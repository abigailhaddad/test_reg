  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-10.3 - Pre-operational monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\napplicant or the permittee must conduct a pre-operational monitoring program. (1)\n\nAt the time a permit application is\nsubmitted, the applicant must have performed environmental monitoring to\nprovide the data required as part of a complete application by Subpart 383-3 of\nthis Part. For characteristics such as rainfall, air temperature, and\ngroundwater levels that are subject to seasonal variation, data must have been\ncollected for at least 12 consecutive months. If the applicant is the New York\n\nState Energy Research and Development Authority acting pursuant to section\n1854-c\nof the Public Authorities Law, this monitoring may have been conducted, in part, by the Commission. (2)\n\nThe applicant must continue the\npre-operational monitoring program until either the department denies the\napplication for a permit or the effective date of the permit. (b) The pre-operational monitoring\nprogram must provide environmental data on the site and the surrounding\nvicinity as described in subdivision (c) of this section. The data must be\ncollected on the site and also at a sufficient distance from the site to\nprovide background concentrations and levels. (c) The pre-operational monitoring program\nmust include: (1)\ninformation about the\necology, meteorology, climate, demography, natural resources, land use, hydrology, geology, geochemistry, and seismology of the disposal\nsite; (2)\nbackground levels of\nradiation and background concentrations of radioactive materials in air, water, soils, flora, and fauna; (3)\nconcentrations and distribution of radioactive materials and any other\nconstituents, both in the environment and released by other nearby facilities, that may affect the ability of the land disposal facility to meet the\nperformance objectives or that may mask the environmental monitoring program; and\n(4)\nan aerial radiation survey\nof the site and the land within a five-mile radius of the site, with the\nresults of the survey referenced to the grid system required by section\n383-11.2\n(c) of\nthis Part. (d) With the\nexception of those monitoring stations intentionally located at the future\nlocations of disposal units, pre-operational monitoring stations must be\nlocated, to the extent practicable, so that: (1)\nthe stations will not have to be\ndecommissioned during site operations; (2)\nthe stations will continue to provide\nuseful data during the operation, closure, post-closure, and institutional\ncontrol periods; and\n(3)\npre-operational, operational, and post-operational data can be meaningfully\ncompared. (e) The\npre-operational monitoring program must be designed to detect any significant\nchanges in site environmental conditions caused by construction\nactivities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-10.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
