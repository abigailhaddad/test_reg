  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 470.3 - Value of gratuities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The value of gratuities under section 517 of the Unemployment Insurance Law may\nbe determined and established by rules promulgated by the Industrial\n\nCommissioner in the following manner: (1)\n\nPublic hearings with respect to which notice as to time, place and purpose has\nbeen given at least 20 days prior to the date of each such hearing shall be\nheld in regard to such rules. (2)\n\nSuch rules shall be filed in the offices of the Industrial Commissioner and the\n\nSecretary of State and published within 30 days of the date of filing in the\noffice of the Secretary of State. The public announcement shall indicate the\ndate of filing in the office of the Secretary of State and such rules shall\nbecome effective 30 days after such filing unless otherwise specified\ntherein. (3)\n\nNotices pursuant to\nparagraph (1) above and announcements pursuant to paragraph (2) above shall be\nmade in such manner as the Industrial Commissioner deems expedient for the\npurpose of giving due notice to all reasonably interested parties. (b) Gratuities, the value of which\nis not established by any rule promulgated under this section, shall be\nreported at the actual amount if ascertainable or, if this be impossible, shall\nbe evaluated by the employer upon a reasonable basis and reported by him\naccordingly. Employers shall submit upon request a statement of the basis used\nin, and sustaining the reasonableness of, such evaluation. (c) Whenever the value of gratuities has been\ndetermined and established by a rule promulgated in accordance with this\nsection, such determination shall be binding for the purpose of the\n\nUnemployment Insurance Law on all parties concerned with respect to the basis\non which contributions and benefits are payable pursuant to sections 570 and\n590 of such law, respectively. (d) If the employer makes a definite service charge which is added to each\ncustomer's bill, or if in those places of the employer's establishment where\nthe usual services to customers are rendered, announcements are conspicuously\ndisplayed forbidding the acceptance of gratuities (tips) by employees, or if\nsuch practice is actually brought to each customer's attention in writing at or\nbefore the time the customer is advised of the amount due the employer as a\ncharge for the commodities sold or services rendered and the employer submits a\nsworn statement to the Department of Labor setting forth that his employees are\nnot allowed to accept gratuities pursuant to an agreement or understanding with\nthem, and that he adopts reasonable means to obtain compliance with such\nagreement or understanding, it shall be deemed that no gratuities are received\nby the employees of that employer unless the employer, directly or indirectly, encourages contravention of such practice. (e) Any rule promulgated pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section may be modified in the Industrial\n\nCommissioner's discretion, after investigation and upon notice and\nhearing. (f) If, after a rule\npromulgated pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section has been in effect two\nyears or more, an application for a modification is made by representative\norganizations of employers or employees affected by such rule, new hearings\nshall be held within six months of such application. After proper hearings, a\nnew rule shall be promulgated which may affirm or modify the rule in force and\neffect at the time such application was made. The provisions of subdivision (a)\nof this section shall apply to notices of hearings, promulgations of rules, and\npublications thereof under this subdivision. (g) When, under any rule promulgated pursuant\nto subdivision (a) of this section, the value of gratuities received may be\nestablished by a statement submitted by an employee certifying the value of\ngratuities received by such employee, such statements shall be valid only if\nsubmitted not less frequently than once each calendar quarter, except that the\nstatement for a period of employment shall not be valid unless submitted prior\nto the date of mailing or personal delivery of notice to the employer that the\nemployee has filed an original claim for the first time subsequent to such\nperiod of employment.
