A camper body which is inserted upon, and\nis integrally attached to a truck in a nonarticulating manner whether or not\nthe body is partially supported by an attached additional axle shall be deemed\nto be a part of the truck, and shall not be deemed to be a separate vehicle. (1)\n\nRegistration. Such a camper body shall\nnot be separately registered. The motor vehicle may be registered as an auto\ntruck, under the provisions of section\n401\n(7)(B)(1)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, or\nas a house coach under the provisions of section\n401\n(6)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. If\nregistered as an auto truck, the maximum gross weight shall include the weight\nof the camper body and such registration shall be valid for operation of the\nmotor vehicle with or without the camper body attached. If registered as a\nhouse coach, the registration shall be valid only for operation with the camper\nbody attached. (2)\n\nDisplay of rear\nnumber plate. The rear number plate shall be attached to the vehicle or camper\nbody so that such plate is plainly visible from the rear while the vehicle is\nbeing operated. (3)\n\nLighting\nequipment. A vehicle with such a camper body attached shall be equipped in\naccordance with the lighting requirements of section\n376\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law. (b) Articulated insert bodies. An insert body\nwhich rests partially upon its own axle or axles and partially upon the chassis\nor frame of a truck, and which is attached to such truck in an articulating\nmanner by means of a fifth wheel or similar device attached to the carrying\ncompartment of the truck shall be deemed to be a full trailer and not a\nsemi-trailer for registration and licensing purposes, and the truck to which\nsuch body is attached shall not be deemed to be a tractor solely because of its\nuse with such body. (1)\n\nRegistration. Such an\narticulated body shall be registered in the same manner as a house coach\ntrailer if such body is used for camping or as a living abode, and shall be\nregistered in the same manner as a full trailer, if used for any other purpose. The motor vehicle used in conjunction with such body shall be registered in its\nordinary classification, disregarding its use with the insert body. The weight\nof insert body shall not be considered a part of the maximum gross weight of\nthe hauling vehicle. (2)\n\nRiding in\narticulated insert camper bodies. Because of the different and more substantial\nmethod of attachment between the hauling vehicle and the articulated camper\nbody, such camper body, pursuant to the authority contained in section\n218\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law, shall not be classified as a house coach trailer\nfor the purposes of section\n1228\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and such camper bodies, therefore, may be\noccupied while being hauled on the public highways.
