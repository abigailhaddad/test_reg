State or county agencies administering or overseeing federal or State\nprograms which are being, or can be, used in part to pay for the transport of\nagency program clientele should adopt new or revised program policies or\nprocedures which re-direct portions of such programs' funds and other\ntransportation resources to a rural county's coordinated public transportation\nservice. Agencies should take other policy or administrative actions that would\nfacilitate or provide incentives to their local agency counterparts to\nparticipate in a rural county's coordination program funded by this\n\nPart. (b) Section 16(b)(2)Program. (1)\n\nWhen included and operated as an integral\npart of a coordinated public transportation service plan approved by the\n\nDepartment and adopted pursuant to this Part, and consistent with the Urban\n\nMass Transportation Act of 1964, as amended, vehicles obtained through Section\n16(b)(2) of said Federal Urban Mass Transportation Act, are eligible to carry\npersons other than the elderly and disabled on a regular basis, provided that\nthe transportation needs of elderly and/or disabled persons described in the\nrecipient's original Section 16(b)(2) grant application, and those of other\nelderly and disabled persons in the rural county, are met by the adopted\ncoordinated public transportation service. (2)\n\nIn rural counties which have adopted a\ncoordinated public transportation service plan in accordance with this Part, and such plan has been approved by the Department, the Department shall give\npriority in awarding current or future grants for vehicles to be funded through\nthe 16 (b) (2) Program to applications for transportation services which are\nformally included in a county's coordinated public transportation service and\nare operated, or subcontracted and managed by, the county's designated\ncoordinated service operator. In any cases where 16(b)(2) grant vehicles are to\nbe used for client- specific portions of a coordinated public transportation\nservice, such portions of service must, at a minimum, be advertised and\noperated as open to the general public on a seat-available basis and such\nvehicles must at all other times be made available without condition to the\ncounty's coordinated service operator for its operation for other\npurposes. (3)\n\nIn rural counties\nwhich have an adopted coordinated public transportation service in accordance\nwith this Part, priority in granting vehicles through the Section 16(b)(2)\nprogram shall be given by the Department for transportation services which, at\na minimum, are operated as open to the general population of elderly and/or\ndisabled persons on a regular and continuing, equal opportunity basis and which\ndo not give priority to any one agency's clientele. (4)\n\nOrganizations applying for and receiving\n16(b)(2) grant vehicles for services within a rural county are required to\nparticipate in that county's planning and implementation process leading to the\ndevelopment of a coordinated public transportation service. In addition, should\na 16(b)(2) recipient's client service area be wholly or partly contained within\na rural county and should the government of that county adopt and implement a\ncoordinated public transportation service plan which is approved by the\n\nDepartment, then the 16(b)(2) recipient shall, when requested by the\n\nDepartment, lease or otherwise make available to the county's coordinated\nservice operator any 16(b)(2) grant equipment it applied for or received\nfollowing the commencement of the county's coordinated service planning\nprocess, in accordance with its Section 16(b)(2) grant agreement. (c) New York State Mass\n\nTransportation Operating Assistance (NYSTOA). Those portions of a county's\ncoordinated public transportation service which meet the eligibility and other\nrequirements of the State mass transportation operating assistance program\nshall be eligible for assistance through that program, in accordance with 17\nNYCRR Part\n975\nand related Department guidelines. If a private operator subject\nto maximum operating assistance guidelines under NYSTOA receives operating\nassistance through this Part, then both sources of operating assistance will be\nconsidered in establishing the maximum operating assistance under the NYSTOA\nprogram. (d) Federal Mass\n\nTransportation Operating and Capital Assistance (Sections 18 and 9). Those\nportions of a county's coordinated public transportation service which are\neligible for and receive New York State mass transportation operating\nassistance and which meet the eligibility and other requirements of the UMTA\nSection 18 or Section 9 programs shall be eligible for assistance through those\nprograms, in accordance with UMTA Circulars and/or Department guidelines, up to\nthe eligibility limits of such assistance prescribed therein and contingent\nupon the amount of such Federal funds made available to the county by the\n\nDepartment or the Urban Mass Transportation Administration. (e) Should a county's coordinated public\ntransportation service receive operating assistance through this Part and also\nreceive public transportation operating assistance through the NYSTOA and/or\n\nFederal Section 18 or 9 programs, then the total of assistance in any fiscal\nyear from all sources plus any local share required for such sources shall not\nexceed the total eligible operating expenses, minus operating income and any\napplicable allowance for profit. (f) Federal Rural Transit Assistance Program\n(RTAP). A rural county's designated coordinated service operator and any of its\nsubcontractors shall be eligible to receive technical assistance and training\nthrough the Department's Rural Transit Assistance Program. (g) Failure to comply with any of the\nregulations of the Department shall result in a suspension of payments of funds\nunder this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
