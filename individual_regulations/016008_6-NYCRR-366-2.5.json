  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 366-2.5 - Alternatives evaluation and selection\n\nState Regulations\nA LSWMP must include a qualitative assessment of\nalternatives and enhancements to the existing solid waste management program\nthat will decrease the amount of waste managed through disposal and thermal\ntreatment by increasing waste reduction, reuse and the recovery of recyclables\nto the maximum extent practicable over the term of the planning period. The\nassessment must include the following: (a) Alternatives Assessment. The alternatives\nassessment must address, at a minimum, the introduction or enhancement of the\nfollowing efforts or describe why they are not applicable: (1)\nwaste reduction programs; (2)\nreuse programs; (3)\nrecyclables recovery programs for paper, metal, glass, plastic, and textiles; (4)\norganics recovery programs for food\nscraps and yard trimmings; (5)\nprograms to develop or improve local and regional markets for\nrecyclables; (6)\nenforcement\nprograms; (7)\nincentive-based\npricing; (8)\neducation and\noutreach; (9)\ndata collection and\nevaluation efforts; (10)\nlocal\nwaste transporter licensing programs, including an assessment of laws\npreventing commingling of recyclables with waste; (11)\nflow control and districting\npotential; (12)\nC&D debris\nreduction, including deconstruction, reuse and recovery programs; (13)\nprivate sector management and\ncoordination opportunities; (14)\nmanagement of waste through thermal treatment technologies; and\n(15)\nwaste disposal options. The information used in the alternatives assessment may\nbe drawn from a combination of technology and program summary information\nprepared by or compiled by the department as well as other information\navailable to the planning unit. (b) Alternative Evaluation. A LSWMP must\ninclude an evaluation of the alternatives that may enhance existing solid waste\nmanagement program elements or add new program elements. For each alternative\nevaluated, the following must be addressed. (1)\n\nAdministrative/Technical Impacts. An\nevaluation of the economic and administrative feasibility of implementation\nwithin the planning period including the following information: (i) the estimated quantitative and\nqualitative impact of each alternative on the various components of the waste\nstream; (ii)\nthe appropriate types\nand sizing of facilities or programs needed, based on the projected quantities\nand composition of the solid waste generated; (iii)\na summary of the cost data used for\nevaluation, including consideration of any available life-cycle analysis data\nfor the various alternatives; and\n(iv)\nthe impact or effect on natural resource\nconservation, energy production and employment-creating\nopportunities. (2)\n\nJurisdictional Impacts. An analysis of the impact on neighboring planning units\nand other neighboring jurisdictions, and environmental justice within the\nplanning unit, including: (i) an assessment\nof interest in participation by other neighboring planning units or other\nneighboring jurisdictions; (ii)\nalternatives that would be available if any neighboring planning units or other\nneighboring jurisdictions participated; (iii)\ncomments and recommendations received\nfrom any neighboring planning units or other neighboring jurisdictions; and\n(iii)\nan assessment of the\nenvironmental justice impacts in the planning unit. (c) Selected Alternatives and\n\nPrograms Identification. After the various alternatives have been evaluated, a\nsummary of the preferred alternatives and programs to be pursued by the\nplanning unit must be described in the LSWMP, including: (1)\nthe alternatives chosen and reasons for\ntheir selection; (2)\nan\nidentification of expected qualitative and quantitative impacts, including, but\nnot limited to, waste reduction, reuse, materials recovery, increased\nparticipation in recovery opportunities and product stewardship programs, as\nwell as any economic, administrative or partnership benefits; (3)\nan identification of the administrative, contractual, and financial requirements required for program implementation; and\n(4)\nan identification of any\nnew or modified local laws, ordinances or regulations that may be required to\nfully implement the selected alternatives.
