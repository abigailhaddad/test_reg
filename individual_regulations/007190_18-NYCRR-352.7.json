Shelter arrears\npayments authorized for applicants under this paragraph are limited to a total\nperiod of six months once every five years unless the district determines at\nits discretion that additional shelter arrears payments are necessary based on\nthe individual case circumstances. Such payments may be made only when: (i) such payment is essential to forestall\neviction or foreclosure and no other shelter accommodations are available; or\n(ii)\nthe health and safety of\nthe applicant is severely threatened by failure to make such payment; and\n(iii)\nthe authorization for the\npayment receives special written approval by the social services official or\nsuch other administrative officer as he or she may designate, provided such\nperson is higher in authority than the supervisor who regularly approves\nauthorization; (iv)\nthe applicant\nreasonably demonstrates an ability to pay shelter expenses, including any\namounts in excess of the appropriate local agency maximum monthly shelter\nallowance, in the future.

Subsequent assistance to pay arrears may not be\ngranted unless there are no past-due amounts owed under any such repayment\nagreement. The social services district, in addition to any rights it has\npursuant to the Social Services Law, may enforce the repayment agreement in any\nmanner available to a creditor.

If all such efforts fail, an allowance may be made for a compromise\nsettlement of such payments or, if a compromise cannot be reached, for other\nessential payments; provided, however, that the compromise settlement or\nallowances shall not exceed the cost of replacement.
