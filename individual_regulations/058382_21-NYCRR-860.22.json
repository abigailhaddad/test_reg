Zone C5 is: (1)\n\nThat part of Red Clay Creek\nextending from the confluence of the East and West branches of Red Clay Creek\nin Pennsylvania at RM 13.4 to RM 12.6, at the Pennsylvania-Delaware state line; and\n(2)\n\nWest Branch Red Clay Creek\nextending from its source to its mouth on Red Clay Creek at RM 13.4. (b) Water uses to be protected. The\nquality of zone C5 waters shall be maintained in a safe and satisfactory\ncondition for the following uses: (1)\n(i) public water supplies after reasonable\ntreatment; (ii)\nindustrial water\nsupplies after reasonable treatment; (iii)\nagricultural water supplies; (2)\n(i) maintenance and propagation of resident\ngame fish and other aquatic life; (ii)\nmaintenance and propagation of\ntrout; (iii)\nwildlife; and\n(3)\nrecreation. (c) Stream\nquality objectives. (1)\n\nDissolved oxygen: (i) not less than 5.0 mg/l at any\ntime; (ii)\nminimum 24-hour average\nof 6.0 mg/l; and\n(iii)\nnot less\nthan 7.0 mg/l in spawning areas whenever temperatures are suitable for trout\nspawning. (2)\n\nTemperature. Except in designated heat dissipation areas (see section\n861.12\n[f][5]\nof\nthis Title): (i) not to exceed 5° F (2.8° C)\nrise above ambient temperature until stream temperature reaches 50° F (10.0°\nC); (ii)\nnot to exceed 2° (1.1° C)\nrise above ambient temperature when stream temperature is between 50° F (10.0°\nC) and 58° (14.4° C); and\n(iii)\nnatural temperature will prevail above 58° F (14.4° C). (3)\npH. Between 6.0 and 8.5. (4)\n\nPhenols. Not to exceed 0.005 mg/l, unless\ndue to natural conditions. (5)\n\nThreshold odor number. Not to exceed 24 at 60° C. (6)\n\nSynthetic detergents (M.B.A.S.). Not to\nexceed 0.5 mg/l. (7)\n\nRadioactivity: (i) alpha emitters, not to exceed 3 pc/l\n(picocuries per liter); and\n(ii)\nbeta emitters, not to exceed 1,000 pc/l\n(8)\n\nFecal coliform. Not to exceed 200 per 100\nmilliliters as a geometric average; samples shall be taken at such frequency\nand location as to permit valid interpretation. (9)\n\nTotal dissolved solids. Not to exceed: (i) 133 percent of background; or\n(ii)\n500 mg/l, whichever is less. (10)\n\nTurbidity. (i) Not to exceed\n(a) the natural background by 10 units; or\n(b) a maximum of 25 units, whichever is less. (ii)\n\nIncreases not to be attributable to industrial waste discharges. (d) Effluent quality\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAll discharges shall meet\nthe effluent quality requirements of this Part. (2)\n\nThe carbonaceous oxygen demand from an\noutfall (exclusive of storm water bypass) shall not exceed that assigned by the\ncommission to maintain stream quality objectives. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
