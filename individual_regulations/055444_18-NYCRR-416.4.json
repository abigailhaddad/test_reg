(2)\n\nWhen conducting\nevacuation drills, the exit route must be varied to ensure that all approved\nmeans of egress are practiced. If one of the exit routes leads to a window or\nfire escape, the drill must include taking the children to the window or fire\nescape and explaining what would be expected of them should an actual fire\noccur that requires they use this exit route. Exiting through the window or on\nto the fire escape during a drill is not required. (3)\n\nWhen multiple shifts of care are\nprovided, such drills must be conducted monthly during each shift of\ncare.
