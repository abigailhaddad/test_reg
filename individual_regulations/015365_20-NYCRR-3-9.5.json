  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-9.5 - Income from discharge of indebtedness\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn a year in which the corporation has income from the\ndischarge of indebtedness that was excluded from Federal taxable income, the\ncorporation must reduce any New York NOLs in the same manner as provided under\nIRC section 108(b) and related regulations, provided reductions to Federal tax\nattributes that are not applicable to New York State are excluded. The amount\nby which the New York NOLs must be reduced is computed by multiplying the New\n\nYork business apportionment factor for the year of discharge by the amount of\n\nFederal NOL that is required to be reduced. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n3-9.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
