The written\ncertification may be made at the pre-hearing conference prescribed in\nsubdivisions (g) and (h) of this section.

(c) Medical records. (1)\n\nIn accordance with the limited release, the parties may seek production of relevant medical records from medical\nprofessionals and hospitals that have treated the claimant for previous injury\nto the same body part or similar illness to the one listed on the employee\nclaim form. (2)\n\nMedical\nprofessionals authorized to practice before the board shall deliver a copy of\nduly requested records within 21 days of the request and within 10 business\ndays if the requesting party offers to increase payment to $1.50 per page\ncopied (an expedited request). (3)\n\nIn addition to any other penalties, a medical professional authorized to\npractice before the board who fails to produce requested documents within 21\ndays, or within 10 business days of an expedited request, shall be subject to\nadministrative warning or suspension or revocation of his or her authorization\nto treat and/or conduct independent medical examinations of injured workers, as\ndetermined by the chair or his or her designee.

Certification shall have the same meaning as\nin section\n300.37\n(d)(1)(i)\nof this Part. (e) Claimant's retention of a legal representative within 10 days of the\npre-hearing conference may constitute good cause for the insurance carrier to\nobtain an adjournment of that conference if the information and/or\ndocumentation provided by the legal representative in accordance with\nsubdivision (d) of this section or any other information or documentation\nsubmitted to the board by the legal representative prior to or at the\npre-hearing conference is material and new or different from the information\nand/or documentation submitted by the claimant. Such adjournment shall be\nwithin the discretion of the Workers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator as\nto whether such information is material and new or different from the\ninformation previously submitted on behalf of the claimant. Such adjournment\nshall only be for such time as is necessary to obtain any documents or other\ninformation that is relevant and responsive to such new and different documents\nand information provided by claimant's legal representative. (f) Pre-Hearing conference statement. (1)\n\nTen days before the pre-hearing\nconference, the insurance carrier or its legal representative and legal\nrepresentative of the claimant shall file with the board and serve on all other\nparties a pre-hearing conference statement. A claimant that has not retained a\nlegal representative on or before the date for the pre-hearing conference shall\nnot be required or asked to file the pre-hearing conference statement. The\npre-hearing conference statement shall contain information to facilitate the\njust, speedy and efficient disposition of the claimant's right to workers'\ncompensation benefits, including settlement. If a claimant retains a legal\nrepresentative within 10 days of the pre-hearing conference, the legal\nrepresentative shall complete and file a pre-hearing conference statement in\naccordance with this subdivision at or prior to the pre-hearing\nconference. (2)\n\nThe pre-hearing\nconference statement shall include: (i) a\nbrief summary of the claim; (ii)\nthe theory of the case with statutory and if appropriate, case\ncitations; (iii)\nwith respect to\nthe insurance carrier's statement, an offer of proof for each defense\nraised; (iv)\na list of lay\nwitnesses, including claimant, the party will call to testify at the initial\nhearing, including the names, addresses, employers if known, and a summary of, and the estimated time needed for, the testimony; (v) a list of medical witnesses, if known, that the party intends to cross-examine and whether the party wishes such\ncross-examination to be by deposition or, if the Workers' Compensation Law\njudge or conciliator permits, at a hearing; (vi)\nthe names of any additional necessary\nparties; (vii)\na statement that all\nforms necessary to resolve the controversy, including medical reports other\nthan an independent medical examination report (hereinafter referred to as IME\nreport), have been submitted or will be submitted before or at the pre-hearing\nconference; (viii)\na statement that\nall discovery has been completed or will be completed by the pre-hearing\nconference, or which shall detail what further discovery is necessary and why\nit will not be completed prior to the pre-hearing conference; (ix)\nwith respect to the insurance carrier, a\nstatement of whether it alleges that the claimant has not presented prima facie\nmedical evidence, and the basis for such challenge; and\n(x) if applicable, a request by the carrier\nfor a broader release for medical records than that set forth in section\n300.37\n(b)(1)(iii)\nof this Part, accompanied by an affidavit by the insurance carrier, or if\nrepresented, by the insurance carrier's legal representative setting forth the\nrelevance of the records that may be obtained through use of the broader\nrelease. (3)\n\nEach party\nshall attach to the pre-hearing conference statement any and all reports, forms\nand documents that the party intends to use at the hearing(s), which the party\nhas in its possession or could reasonably have obtained, insofar as they are\nnot already a part of the electronic case file maintained by the board, including hospital records and forms detailing the employer's statement of\nwages and the claimant's work status. (4)\n\nFailure by the insurance carrier to\ntimely serve upon all other parties and file with the board the pre-hearing\nconference statement, or the filing by the insurance carrier of a materially\nincomplete statement shall result in a waiver of defenses to the claim; failure\nto list a witness on, or to include a copy of any document not in the\nelectronic case file with the pre-hearing conference statement, which the\ninsurance carrier had in its possession or could reasonably have obtained, shall constitute a waiver of the right to call such witness or introduce such\ndocument in the case. There shall be no waiver if the Workers' Compensation Law\njudge finds, based on the affidavit of the insurance carrier's legal\nrepresentative (or if the insurance carrier does not have a legal\nrepresentative, then by the insurance carrier), that the conduct at issue was\ndue to good cause and the insurance carrier exercised good faith and due\ndiligence. (g) The\npre-hearing conference for represented claimants. (1)\n\nThe pre-hearing conference shall be held\nwithin 30 days of the filing of a notice of controversy and a medical report\nreferencing an injury, and shall proceed as described herein. (2)\n\nAt the pre-hearing conference, the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator may take appropriate action with\nrespect to the following: (i) confirmation\nthat all forms and notices necessary to resolve the controversy, including\nmedical reports except IME reports, have been submitted to the board and served\nupon all other parties and a verification from the parties that all information\nthereon is accurate; (ii)\naddition\nof any other necessary parties; (iii)\nsimplification and limitation of\nfactual and legal issues; (iv)\nstipulations by the parties; (v) presentation of a list of proposed witnesses; (vi)\nsettlement or other disposition of the\ncase; (vii)\nconfirmation that the\nparties have conferred in a good faith effort to settle or otherwise resolve\nthe case; and\n(viii)\nscheduling any\nhearings or submission of testimony by deposition as to the resolution of\ndisputed threshold issues. (3)\n\nIf the insurance carrier alleges in the\nnotice of controversy and/or pre-hearing conference statement that the claimant\nhas not presented prima facie medical evidence, the Workers' Compensation Law\njudge or conciliator shall determine at the pre-hearing conference whether the\nmedical report or reports presented constitute prima facie medical evidence. (i) A finding that the medical report or\nreports constitute prima facie medical evidence is an evidentiary determination\nthat the case may proceed and is interlocutory and is not reviewable by the\nboard as provided in subdivision (i) of this section. (ii)\n\nUpon a finding that the claimant's\nmedical report does not constitute prima facie medical evidence, the case shall\nbe marked as no further action. Claimant may thereafter submit additional\ninformation on an amended or other medical report, upon which submission the\ncase shall be scheduled for another pre-hearing conference. (4)\n\nThe Workers' Compensation Law\njudge or conciliator shall find a waiver of any defense for which the offer of\nproof at the pre-hearing conference is insufficient. (5)\n\nAt the pre-hearing conference, the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator shall: (i) obtain the names and addresses of all\nhealth care providers who rendered treatment for a previous injury to the same\nbody part or similar illness to the one claimed in the controverted workers'\ncompensation claim and direct, if necessary, the claimant to sign the\nappropriate limited medical release; (ii)\nif the insurance carrier requested a\nbroader release for medical records than that set forth in section\n300.37\n(b)(1)(iii)\nof this Part, hear arguments from all parties as to whether the request should\nor should not be granted, render a decision and if the decision is to grant the\nrequest, direct the claimant to sign the appropriate broader release; and\n(iii)\ndetermine if there are\nany prior workers' compensation claims and direct, if necessary, the claimant\nto sign the prescribed authorization pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law, section 110-a. (6)\n\nIf\nthe claimant has not filed the employee claim form prior to the pre-hearing\nconference, the claimant will be directed to complete and file such form at the\npre-hearing conference. If the claimant is represented at the pre-hearing\nconference, the legal representative shall certify the employee claim form in\naccordance with section\n300.37\n(d)(1)(i)\nof this Part. (7)\n\nThe parties shall\nidentify the evidence they intend to present at the initial expedited hearing, including lay witnesses and documents. The Workers' Compensation Law judge or\nconciliator shall schedule the initial expedited hearing at which testimony of\nthe claimant and all other lay witnesses shall be taken and recorded for a date\nno more than 30 days after a pre-hearing conference at which the claimant was\nrepresented. However, if there is no request for the testimony of the claimant\nor any other lay witnesses the initial expedited hearing shall not be scheduled\nand held. (8)\n\nIf the insurance\ncarrier requests an opportunity to have the claimant examined by an independent\nmedical examiner, the IME report must be completed, filed and served in\naccordance with Workers' Compensation Law, sections 13-b(4) and 137 and section\n300.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart at least three days before the date set by the Workers' Compensation Law\njudge or conciliator for the initial expedited hearing. If the claimant will\nnot testify and no other lay testimony will be taken so an initial expedited\nhearing will not be scheduled, the Workers' Compensation Law judge or\nconciliator shall set a date that is no more than 30 days after the pre-hearing\nconference for the IME report to be filed and served. The failure to file and\nserve the IME report by such date shall be a waiver of the insurance carrier's\nright to examine the claimant and to have filed on its behalf or otherwise have\nconsidered an IME report on the threshold issue of causal relationship, unless\nthe insurance carrier makes a showing of good cause for such failure, and that\nit acted in good faith and with due diligence. The showing must be made by an\naffidavit by the insurance carrier or if represented, by its legal\nrepresentative. Good cause shall include, but not be limited to, the inability\nto obtain medical records in advance of the hearing or the failure of the\nclaimant to appear for an independent medical exam. (9)\n\nThe parties shall identify any medical\nwitnesses they wish to cross-examine and indicate whether they wish the medical\nwitnesses to appear at a hearing or by deposition. The Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw judge or conciliator shall decide whether medical witnesses shall appear\nfor cross-examination at a hearing or by deposition. (10)\n\nFor those medical witnesses to be\ncross-examined at a hearing, the Workers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator\nwill set a hearing date no more than 60 days from the pre-hearing conference\nand may permit the medical witnesses to appear at the hearing by\ntelephone. (11)\n\nFor medical\nwitnesses to be cross-examined by deposition: (i) the Workers' Compensation Law judge or\nconciliator shall direct that the depositions shall be conducted and the\ntranscripts filed with the board no more than 55 days from the pre-hearing\nconference; (ii)\nthe Workers'\nCompensation Law judge or conciliator may permit depositions to be taken by\ntelephone; (iii)\nany medical\nreport(s) and IME report(s) filed with the board and served on the parties\nprior to the deposition(s) shall constitute the direct testimony of the medical\nwitnesses and there shall be no direct examination at the deposition unless\nrequested by a party and authorized by the Workers' Compensation Law judge or\nconciliator upon a finding of exceptional circumstances. Any redirect\nexamination shall be limited to points raised by the cross-examination; and\n(iv)\nthe decision of the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator setting forth the directions and\norders made at the pre-hearing conference, including the direction and order\nfor medical witnesses to be cross-examined by deposition and whether direct\nexamination was authorized, shall be sent to the medical witnesses who the\nparties are directed to examine. The first part of the decision containing the\ndirections and orders shall prominently set forth: (a) the direction for medical witnesses to be\ncross-examined by deposition and the transcripts filed with the board within 55\ndays of the pre-hearing conference or cross-examined at a hearing to be held\nwithin 60 days of the pre-hearing conference, which date shall be specified in\nthe decision; (b) whether direct\nexamination of medical witnesses was authorized; and\n(c) that payment for prior medical services\nby the insurance carrier may depend upon the medical witnesses' appearance at\nthe deposition or hearing, as the case may be, in order to resolve this\ncontroverted claim. (12)\nA legal representative appearing on\nbehalf of a party must be authorized to enter into stipulations and a\nsettlement or a person authorized to do so shall be available during the\npre-hearing conference. (13)\n\nIf the\nclaim is not settled or otherwise resolved at the pre-hearing conference, the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator shall find that such claim, if\notherwise covered by this section, is suitable for expedited hearings, unless\nthe Workers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator finds that there are complex\nfactual or medical issues, the resolution of which are not suitable for\nresolution through the process set forth in subdivision (h) of this section. Absent a finding to the contrary, claims involving death, occupational disease\n(not including, for purposes of this section, carpal tunnel syndrome), or\nsexual assault shall be presumed not suitable for resolution through the\nprocess set forth in subdivision (h) of this section. The Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw judge or conciliator must set forth on the record the reasons for such\nfinding. (14)\n\nThe Workers'\nCompensation Law judge or conciliator shall issue a decision stating all\ndeterminations, directions and orders made at the pre-hearing\nconference. (15)\n\nThe pre-hearing\nconference shall be recorded. (16)\n\nIf the claimant fails to appear or is otherwise not prepared to proceed, the\ncase shall be marked as no further action. The case shall be scheduled for\nanother pre-hearing conference upon the claimant's application advising that he\nor she is prepared to proceed. (17)\n\nIf the insurance carrier or its legal representative fails to appear, a\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law judge or conciliator will render a decision based\nupon the evidence contained in the board file. The insurance carrier will be\ndeemed to have waived its right to have an IME report considered on the issue\nof causal relationship and to cross-examine the medical providers who have\ntreated the claimant. The foregoing is subject to the insurance carrier making\nthe required showing for an adjournment pursuant to subdivision (j) of this\nsection. (18)\n\nAttendance fees for\nthe hearing testimony or deposition of physicians, podiatrists, chiropractors\nand psychologists directed pursuant to this section shall be governed by Part\n301 of this Title. (h) Expedited hearing process in controverted cases when the claimant is\nrepresented. (1)\n\nThe initial expedited\nhearing: (i) within 30 days following a\npre-hearing conference at which the claimant is represented, the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge shall hold an initial expedited hearing at which\ntestimony of the claimant and all other lay witnesses shall be taken and\nrecorded. However, if there is no request for the testimony of the claimant or\nany other lay witnesses the initial expedited hearing shall not be held and the\ntestimony of the medical witnesses shall be taken as set forth at the\npre-hearing conference. (ii)\n\nIf a\nparty's witness does not appear, then the party shall have waived the right to\nhave the witness testify in-person or by deposition, unless the party makes a\nshowing of good cause that he or she should be granted additional time, and\nthat he or she acted with good faith and due diligence. The showing must be\nmade by an affidavit of the legal representative of the party or, if the party\ndoes not have a legal representative, then by the party. (iii)\n\nIndependent medical examination. All\nIME reports shall be filed and served pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law, section 137(1)(a) and section\n300.2\n(d)(11)\nof\nthis Part no later than three days before the date of the initial expedited\nhearing as provided in subdivision (g)(8) of this section. If the IME report\nwas filed and served in the five days before the initial expedited hearing, the\ninsurance carrier's legal representative must bring copies of the IME report\nand proof of service to the initial expedited hearing for the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge and other parties. Failure to timely file and serve an\nIME report in a controverted claim shall be a waiver of the insurance carrier's\nright to examine the claimant and to have filed on its behalf or otherwise have\nconsidered an IME report on the issue of casual relationship, unless the\ninsurance carrier makes a showing of good cause that it should be granted\nadditional time, and that it acted in good faith and with due diligence. The\nshowing must be made by an affidavit by the insurance carrier, or if\nrepresented, by its legal representative. (iv)\n\nIf the insurance carrier filed and\nserved an IME report at least three days prior to the initial expedited\nhearing, the claimant's legal representative must advise the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge if it still requests the cross-examination of the\nindependent medical examiner. (2)\n\nHearing for medical witnesses when the\nclaimant is represented. (i) If the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge directs the testimony of any medical witness at a\nhearing, the Workers' Compensation Law judge shall hold a hearing that is no\nmore than 30 days after the initial expedited hearing at which such medical\ntestimony shall be taken unless the party to produce a medical witness shows\ngood cause why the medical witness cannot appear by that date, and that it\nacted in good faith and with due diligence, in which case the hearing shall be\nscheduled as soon as practicable. (ii)\n\nAt such hearing, any medical report(s)\nand IME report(s) previously filed with the board and served on the parties\nshall constitute the direct testimony of the medical witnesses and there shall\nbe no direct examination at the hearing unless requested by a party and\nauthorized by the Workers' Compensation Law judge upon a finding of exceptional\ncircumstances. Any redirect examination shall be limited to points raised by\nthe cross-examination. (iii)\n\nIf the\nmedical witness to be cross-examined by claimant's legal representative fails\nto appear as scheduled, then the insurance carrier's right to introduce the IME\nreport from the witness or have the medical witness testify at a hearing or by\ndeposition shall be waived, unless the insurance carrier makes a showing that\nthe witness did not appear because of good cause, and that the insurance\ncarrier acted in good faith and with due diligence. The showing must be made by\nan affidavit of the legal representative of the insurance carrier or, if the\ninsurance carrier does not have a legal representative, then by the insurance\ncarrier. (iv)\n\nIf the medical\nwitness to be cross-examined by the insurance carrier does not appear for\ncross-examination as scheduled, then his or her testimony shall be taken by\ndeposition at the earliest date practicable but no more than 30 days after the\ndate the medical witness was originally scheduled to testify unless the\nclaimant makes a showing that the witness could not appear within that period\nbecause of good cause, and the claimant acted in good faith and with due\ndiligence. Such deposition may be taken by telephone. With respect to any such\nmedical witness authorized by the chair or his or her designee to treat and/or\nconduct independent medical examinations of injured workers, the board shall\npromptly direct the witness to appear at such deposition. If the witness does\nnot appear for the deposition, the testimony of the witness shall not be\nrescheduled at either a hearing or deposition and the chair or his or her\ndesignee shall take such action as it deems appropriate with respect to the\nwitness' authorization to treat and/or conduct independent medical examinations\nof injured workers. (3)\n\nSummations, memoranda of law and briefs. The parties shall be permitted to make\noral summations at the last hearing to present evidence on the controverted\nissues, or the last deposition of a medical witness regarding causal\nrelationship. In all cases, written post-hearing summations of the evidence, memoranda of law, and/or briefs are not permitted, unless the Workers'\nCompensation Law judge finds, on the record, that the claim presents extensive\nand complicated factual determinations or novel and important questions of law. All such post-hearing submissions, must be filed with the board and served on\nall other parties within five business days from such order or conclusion of\nthe evidence, as described in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, whichever is\nlater. (4)\n\nDecisions. (i) When the close of evidence occurs at a\nhearing, the Workers' Compensation Law judge shall advise the parties, on the\nrecord, of his or her decision, including the reasons and evidence supporting\nthe decision, and that a notice of decision will be sent after the close of the\nhearing unless the Workers' Compensation Law judge determines on the record\nthat there are extensive and complicated factual determinations or novel and\nimportant questions of law, in which case the written decision shall be issued\nwithin five business days of the hearing, or if post-hearing submissions have\nbeen ordered, within five business days of the date the post-hearing\nsubmissions are received or the post-hearing submissions were due, whichever is\nearlier. (ii)\n\nWhere the close of\nthe evidence does not occur at a hearing, it shall occur no later than 60 days\nafter the pre-hearing conference, subject to any adjournment of a hearing or\ndeposition having been granted or unless the Workers' Compensation Law judge on\nthe record finds exceptional circumstances respecting submission of additional\ndocumentation that warrants a longer period and states the basis therefore. If\nthe close of the evidence does not occur at a hearing, but upon the submission\nof deposition transcript(s) and/or documentation directed or ordered by the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law Judge, then the Workers' Compensation Law Judge shall\nissue a decision within five business days from the close of the\nevidence. (5)\n\nApplicability of section\n300.34\nof this Part. Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary, the provisions of section\n300.34\nof this Part only apply to\nthe resolution of claims covered by this section as specifically referenced in\nthis section. (i) Decisions in expedited hearing process. Decisions containing only orders or\ndirections made by a Workers' Compensation Law judge in connection with the\npre-hearing conference and expedited hearing process in controverted cases, pursuant to this section, including a finding that the medical report or\nmedical reports constitute prima facie medical evidence, shall not be\nreviewable by the board under Workers' Compensation Law, section 23 until a\ndecision has been made by a Workers' Compensation Law judge establishing or\ndisallowing the claim. (j) Adjournments in controverted cases. (1)\n\nAdjournments for a deposition to a period of time beyond that specified in this\nsection, a pre-hearing conference, or a hearing in a controverted claim shall\nonly be granted in an emergency. (2)\n\nThe grounds for adjournment must be\nestablished by an affidavit of the legal representative of the requesting party\n(or if the requesting party is not represented, by the party), that shall be\nserved on all other parties and filed with the board by the party promptly upon\nlearning the circumstances that are the basis for the adjournment requested. In\nthe event that the emergency occurs on the day of the pre-hearing conference or\nhearing, the legal representative may make an oral application for an\nadjournment which the Workers' Compensation Law judge may grant, conditioned\nupon the requesting party promptly filing with board a confirming affidavit, as\ndescribed in this subsection. (3)\n\nAn adjournment, if granted, shall be as short as practicable and generally\nshall not exceed 20 days. (4)\n\nAdjournment includes a rescheduling or continuance. (5)\n\nAn emergency is a serious event that\noccurs preventing the timely completion of some action ordered or directed by\nthe board or regulation. An emergency includes death in the family, serious\nillness, significant prior professional or business commitment, and inclement\nweather that prevents travel. It does not include any event that can be\nprevented or mitigated by the timely taking of reasonable action. (6)\n\nIf a Workers' Compensation Law judge\nfinds that a request for an adjournment or continuance is not an emergency and\nis frivolous, he or she shall impose such penalties as are in accordance with\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law, section 25(3)(d) and section\n300.34\n(f) and (g)\nof this Part. (k) This\nsection shall not apply to controverted claims where an employer has failed to\nsecure coverage, as referenced in Workers' Compensation Law, section 50, and\nsubdivisions (g), (h) and (i) shall not apply if a claimant is unrepresented at\nthe time of the pre-hearing conference at which hearing or hearings are\nscheduled for witness testimony.
