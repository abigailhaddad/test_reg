  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 525.2 - Nature of tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sales tax. (1)\n(i) Except as specifically exempted or excluded, sales tax is imposed on the\nreceipts from: (a) every retail sale of\ntangible personal property, as provided in section\n1105 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw; (b) every sale, other than a\nsale for resale, of specifically enumerated services, as provided in sections\n1105(b) and (c); and\n(c) every sale\nof food and drink when sold in or by a restaurant, tavern or other\nestablishment or by a caterer, as provided in section 1105(d). (ii)\n\nSales tax is also imposed on\nrent for every occupancy of a hotel room and on admission charges, dues and\nother amusement charges, as provided in sections\n1105 (e) and (f)\nof the Tax Law, respectively. (iii)\n\nEach of the various types of\ntransactions has statutory exemptions, exceptions, exclusions and limitations. See, for example, sections\n1111, 1115\nand\n1116\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nExcept as specifically provided\notherwise, the sales tax is a \"transactions tax,\" with the liability for the\ntax occurring at the time of the transaction. Generally, a taxed transaction is\nan act resulting in the receipt of consideration for the transfer of title to\nor possession of (or both) tangible personal property or for the rendition of\nan enumerated service. The time or method of payment is generally immaterial, since the tax becomes due at the time of transfer of title to or possession of\n(or both) the property or the rendition of such service (but see section\n1132[a][2] regarding materialmen). (3)\n\nExcept as specifically provided\notherwise, the sales tax is a \"destination tax.\" The point of delivery or point\nat which possession is transferred by the vendor to the purchaser, or the\npurchaser's designee, controls both the tax incidence and the tax\nrate. (4)\n\nThe sales tax is\ngenerally a \"consumer tax.\" That is, the person required to collect tax must\ncollect the tax from the customer (i.e., the consumer) when collecting the\ntaxable receipt, rent or amusement charge to which the tax applies. The\ncustomer cannot shift the liability for payment of the tax to another person\nnor otherwise be relieved of such liability. The vendor, or other person\nrequired to collect the tax, collects the tax as trustee for and on account of\nthe State and is also personally liable for the tax required to be\ncollected. (b) Compensating use tax. (1)\n\nThe compensating\nuse tax is imposed on the use within the State of certain tangible personal\nproperty and certain enumerated services: (i) purchased by a New York resident (as defined in section\n526.15\nof\nthis Title) outside of the State, which would have been subject to sales tax if\npurchased in this State; or\n(ii)\npurchased in the State but, for various reasons, the sales tax was not paid at\nthe time of purchase. (2)\n\nCompensating use tax is also imposed on\nthe use within this State of certain tangible personal property manufactured, processed or assembled by the user, including, certain computer software\nwritten or otherwise created by the user.
