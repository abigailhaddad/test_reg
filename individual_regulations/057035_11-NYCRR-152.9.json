  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 152.9 - Excess medical malpractice risk insurance coverage eligibility requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order to be eligible for participation in the Excess Medical Malpractice Insurance Program effective July 1st of any policy year, a physician must complete all of the requirements for the excess medical malpractice basic or follow-up course, as applicable, prior to that date. For example, in order for a physician to be eligible for the Excess Medical Malpractice Insurance Program effective July 1, 2005 through June 30, 2007, the physician must have completed the required basic or follow-up course requirements, as appropriate, by July 1, 2005. (b) A physician that has not satisfactorily completed all the excess medical malpractice risk management requirements as provided in subdivision (a) of this section may not be eligible for the Excess Medical Malpractice Insurance Program until, and effective as of, the date the requirements are completed. The physician must also complete any required excess medical malpractice follow-up course during the following policy year in order to be eligible for the Excess Medical Malpractice Insurance Program effective July 1st of the next succeeding two policy years. For example, a physician who does not complete the basic or follow-up course, which is required for eligibility beginning July 1, 2005, until August 1, 2005, becomes eligible for excess medical malpractice insurance on August 1, 2005. The physician continues to be eligible for the policy year beginning July 1, 2006. In order to continue to be eligible for excess medical malpractice insurance effective July 1, 2007, the physician must complete the excess medical malpractice risk management follow-up course requirements by July 1, 2007.
