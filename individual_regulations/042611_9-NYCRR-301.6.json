The application must be signed by the applicant or an authorized\nofficer thereof and must set forth the name of the applicant, the proposed\ndate, time, duration, nature and location of the planned activity, a thorough\ndescription of the activity, an estimate of the expected attendance and a\ndescription of any facilities to be provided by the applicant or requested to\nbe provided by the commissioner in support of the activity. The office shall\nrespond to timely filed applications not later than five days prior to the\nrequested use date. The commissioner may, upon good cause shown, waive time\nlimitations for issuance of a permit for public assembly. (b) Every applicant shall obtain insurance\ncoverage in accordance with the requirements of section\n301.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart unless granted a waiver by the office. An applicant may request and will\nbe granted a waiver from this insurance requirement where they can\nsatisfactorily demonstrate that (1) an event is protected under the\n\nFirst\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution, and (2) such insurance is either\nso financially burdensome or otherwise unobtainable, so as to preclude the\napplicant from conducting the event. (c) The commissioner reserves the right to\nrequire special facilities be provided at the applicant's expense. Such\nfacilities may include, without limitation, special security measures, first\naid facilities and adequate portable toilet facilities. Participants must also\ncomply with all applicable State and local health laws and\nregulations. (d) A public assembly\nmay be held only in the area indicated on the permit and during such dates and\ntimes and in such a manner as authorized by the permit. (e) If an application is denied, the\napplicant will be informed in writing of the reason(s) for the denial, and will\nbe advised that the denial may be appealed by written request to the\ncommissioner submitted within 15 days of receipt of notice of such denial. The\ncommissioner may reverse, affirm or modify the original determination. The\ncommissioner's written determination on the appeal shall be provided no later\nthan 24 hours prior to the requested event time. (f) In reviewing applications for public\nassembly or denials thereof, the commissioner may consider the availability of\nalternative times, dates, locations or manners for the conduct of such\nactivity. (g) The commissioner may\nrevoke a permit at any time upon the grounds set forth in section\n301.7\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
