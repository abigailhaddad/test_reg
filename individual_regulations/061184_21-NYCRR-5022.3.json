An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of\nall or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except an\neligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution which, under\nthe Internal Revenue Code or any regulations thereunder, may not be rolled\nover, such as: any distribution which is one of a series of substantially equal\nperiodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life (or\nlife expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives (or joint life\nexpectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more; any distribution to the extent\nsuch distribution is required by section\n401(a)(9)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in\ngross income. Anything in the foregoing to the contrary notwithstanding, in the\ncase of distributions made after December 31, 2001, a portion of a distribution\nshall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely because the\nportion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not includible\nin gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an individual\nretirement account or annuity described in section\n408(a) or (b)\nof the\n\nInternal Revenue Code or to a qualified defined contribution plan described in\nsection\n401(a)\nor\n403(a)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is\nincludible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so\nincludible.

However, in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to a surviving\nspouse, an eligible retirement plan is an individual retirement account or an\nindividual retirement annuity. Anything in the foregoing to the contrary\nnotwithstanding, in the case of distributions made after December 31, 2001: (1)\nan eligible retirement plan shall include\nan annuity contract described in section\n403(b)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code and an eligible plan under section\n457(b)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state\nor any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state\nand which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan\nfrom the system; and\n(2)\nthe\ndefinition of eligible retirement plan shall also apply in the case of a\ndistribution to a surviving spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee\nunder a qualified domestic relations order as defined in section\n414(p)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code. (c) Distributee. A distributee includes a teacher or former teacher. In addition, the teacher's or former teacher's surviving spouse and the teacher's or former\nteacher's spouse or former spouse who is the alternate payee under a qualified\ndomestic relations order, as defined in section\n414(p)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of the spouse or\nformer spouse. A distributee also includes a person other than a spouse who is\na designated beneficiary eligible to receive a benefit because of a member or\nretiree's death; in such case, the distributee's only rollover option is a\ndirect rollover to an inherited individual retirement account. (d) Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a\npayment by the system to the eligible retirement plan specified by the\ndistributee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
