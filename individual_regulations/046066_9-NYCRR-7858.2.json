  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7858.2 - Information requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nforecast and historic data on deliveries, natural gas supply requirements and\nprices: (1)\n\nBy utility service area and\nstatewide if available, the estimated monthly and annual in-state natural gas\ndeliveries, winter season deliveries and peak day deliveries by end-use or\ncustomer classifications (in tabular and graphic files, in formats deemed\nappropriate by the board), specifically identifying the extent to which energy\nefficiency measures, fuel switching, and the sale of natural gas directly to\nend-users has been incorporated within such forecasts. Natural gas data may be\nrequested for the categories stated below: (i) firm demand, specifying total residential\ndeliveries, total commercial deliveries, total industrial deliveries, total\nelectric generation deliveries, total natural gas vehicle sales, total\nout-of-state sales, total public authority deliveries other deliveries, and\nlost and unaccounted for natural gas; (ii)\ninterruptible demand, specifying total\nresidential deliveries, total commercial deliveries, total industrial\ndeliveries, total electric generation deliveries, total natural gas vehicle\nsales, total out-of-state sales, total public authority deliveries, other\ndeliveries, and lost and unaccounted for natural gas; (iii)\ntransportation customer deliveries, specifying total residential deliveries, total commercial deliveries, total\nindustrial deliveries, total electric generation deliveries, total public\nauthority deliveries, and other deliveries; (iv)\ndeliveries for injection and\nliquefaction requirements; and\n(v) the average monthly number of customers by the customer classes in total\nresidential volumes, total commercial volumes, total industrial volumes, total\nelectric generation volumes, total natural gas vehicle volumes, total\nout-of-state volumes, total public authority volumes, other volumes, and, if\napplicable, lost and unaccounted for natural gas. (2)\nA forecast of natural gas supply\nrequirements over the planning period, statewide and by utility service area, specifically identifying the amounts of natural gas needed to meet severe\nweather conditions, lost and unaccounted for natural gas, out-of-state sales\ncommitments and use within the State. This information should be provided for\npeak day, winter season, and annual load, both for normal weather and design\nweather. (3)\nA description of the\nload forecasting methodology and the assumptions and data used in the\npreparation of the forecasts, specifically including projections of demographic\nand economic activity and such other factors, statewide and by service area, which may influence demand for natural gas, the bases for such projections, and\nconversions to natural gas from other supply sources and expansion of\ndistribution. The description shall include the source of the weather data, including years of data used, and a description of the calculation of peak day\nload. (4)\n\nEnd-user and city gate\nnatural gas prices by monthly and annual sales, a projection of estimated\nend-user and city gate natural gas prices for the planning period; and a\ndescription of the methodology and assumptions used to develop the foregoing\nprojection of estimated prices. (5)\nA detailed description of the methodology and assumptions used to develop the\nprojection of estimated prices. (b) For natural gas inventory and supply\nassessment: (1)\n\nProjected supplies of natural\ngas by monthly and annual sendout, for each of the categories identified below: (i) total firm supply and capacity, including\nmonthly (if applicable), annual and seasonal, storage, and other; (ii)\ntotal interruptible supply and capacity, including released firm transportation and interruptible\ntransportation; (iii)\ntotal company\nsources, including LNG, liquefied petroleum gas/air (including propane), and\nother; (iv)\ntotal transportation of\ncustomer natural gas, including firm and interruptible; and\n(v) total appropriate deductions. (2)\n\nAn inventory of: (i) all existing supply sources, storage\nfacilities, and transmission facilities used to provide service within the\n\nState; (ii)\ntransmission and\nstorage facilities under construction which would be used to provide service\nwithin the State, including their costs (projected or actual, where known) and\ncapacities; (iii)\ntransmission\nfacilities proposed to be constructed, listing separately those with FERC\napproval, those in the FERC filing and pre-filing process, those which have\nsought non-binding precedent agreements; and\n(iv)\ntransmission facilities operated, or\nplanned to be operated by other than members of the Northeast Gas Association, to the extent that such information is available. (3)\n\nAn assessment of the ability of existing\nnatural gas supply resources and transportation capacity, and those reasonably\ncertain to be available, to satisfy their projected requirements over the\nplanning period. (4)\nA statement of\nrecommended supply additions and demand-reducing measures for satisfying the\nnatural gas supply requirements not reasonably certain to be met by natural gas\nsupply sources identified in this section and the reasons therefore. (c) For in-state natural gas\nproduction: (1)\na summary of monthly and\nannual natural gas production, including: number and location of wells, volume\nand energy content of annual production (million British Thermal Units [MMBTU]\nor dekatherms); (2)\nsummary of\nend-use or interconnection with local distribution, intrastate or interstate\nnatural gas pipelines (if applicable); (3)\nthe number and demand of customers\ndirectly attached to local production and information on the reliability of\nthat supply to those customers; (4)\namount of fuels/electricity used in production process (e.g., drilling; pumping; transportation of equipment, water, building materials, fluids, wastes; equipment use; waste treatment); (5)\namounts and concentrations of compounds\nused in production process; (6)\namount of land cleared associated with production process; (7)\nand such other information as the chair, from time to time, may require to carry out the purposes of this\n\nChapter. (d) For\ninterstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines: (1)\ncurrent certificated pipeline capacity\nentering and exiting the State of New York; (2)\na description of expansion pipeline\ncapacity projects to serve New York customers, which have been approved but not\nyet constructed, and proposed projects awaiting approval; (3)\na list of contract quantities and\ndeliveries to customers in the State of New York, including deliveries made\ndirectly to end-users, such as cogeneration facilities. Where available, such\ndata shall be provided on a monthly and a contract year basis (November 1st\nthrough October 31st); (4)\na\ndiscussion of impediments to further market expansion in the State and the\nnortheast region; (5)\npeak load and\ncapacity spatially referenced data, in a format that the board deems\nappropriate, of the existing pipeline facilities under current and projected\nload graphically identifying pipelines that are near or projected to exceed\npipeline capacity during the planning period. (e) Spatially referenced data, in a format\nthat the board deems appropriate, of local distribution company franchise\nterritories, the location of major transmission and distribution pipelines, and\nthe location of other major natural gas facilities. (f) For natural gas research and development: (1)\na statement of research and development\nplans, including objectives and programs in the areas of energy efficiency, dual fuel, and new energy technologies; (2)\nrecent results of such programs\nundertaken or funded to date; and\n(3)\nan assessment of the potential impacts of\nsuch results. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7858.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
