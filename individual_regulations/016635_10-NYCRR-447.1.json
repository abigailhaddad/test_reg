The college has a policy of revising their publication annually and it\nis available in January of each year. The latest edition is to be used for\ndetermining the standard units of measure for tests and procedures performed. In recording Workload Measurement Units for reporting to the Health Care\n\nFinancing Administration (HCFA), workload units related to quality control\nstudies, calibration standards, and specimen collection, and repeats and\nduplicates for which a patient is not charged are not to be counted. Workload\nunits for unlisted tests and procedures should be reasonably estimated based\nupon work units for other comparable procedures, or estimated by qualified\npersonnel. Workload measurement units shall be maintained and reported for\nlaboratory services obtained from outside laboratories. (c) Copies of the Laboratory Workload\n\nRecording Method can be obtained by writing to: College of American Pathologists\n7400 North Skokie Boulevard\n\nSkokie, Ill. 60076\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
