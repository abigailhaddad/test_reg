  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 574.7 - Application of the overall intensity guidelines\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the provisions of section 809(10)(c) of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act and the applicable exemptions of section 811 of the\n\nAct, the following rules shall apply: (a) The number of new principal buildings\nassociated with a project shall be the net increase in principal buildings on a\nproject site. A project that does not result in such a net increase (such as\ntearing down an existing principal building and constructing a new principal\nbuilding elsewhere on the project site) will not be considered to involve a new\nprincipal building for the purpose of applying the overall intensity\nguidelines. (b) Where a purely\nmathematical application of the overall intensity guidelines to a given project\nsite results in a fractional number of permissible principal buildings, that\nnumber shall be rounded to the nearest whole number, which shall be the\narithmetically permissible number of principal buildings. (c) As many as a 10 percent greater number of\nprincipal buildings than are arithmetically permissible may be permitted where\njustified by natural resource and public considerations, such as where a common\nsewerage system is provided or where the project would be substantially\ninvisible from travel corridors. (d) The overall intensity guidelines shall\napply to all principal buildings which are part of a project, except single\nfamily dwellings or mobile homes which are proposed to be located on (1) a\npreexisting vacant lot of record as described in section 811(1)(a) of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act, (2) a lot located in a preexisting subdivision\nwhich has received New York State Department of Health approval, or (3) a lot\ncreated by bona fide gift, devise or inheritance where the donor or decedent\ncontinuously owned the property since prior to May 22, 1973 and the recipient\nwas a member of his immediate family.
