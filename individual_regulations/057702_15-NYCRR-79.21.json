  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.21 - Inspection of motor vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section comprises the safety inspection or the safety\nportion of a safety and emissions inspection for all motor vehicles that have a\nseating capacity, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under\n15 passengers, all motor vehicles and trailers that have a MGW, as indicated on\nthe vehicle registration certificate, under 18,001 pounds, except: motorcycles; those motor vehicles and trailers that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle\nregistration certificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the\nregistrant requests a heavy vehicle inspection; and semi-trailers. Additional\nsafety inspection requirements for all trailers, except semi-trailers, that\nhave a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under 10,001\npounds, may be found in section\n79.22\nof this Part. Additional\nsafety inspection requirements for all motor vehicles and trailers, except\nsemi-trailers, that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration\ncertificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, except when the\nregistrant requests a heavy vehicle inspection, may be found in section\n79.23\nof this Part. The emissions\ninspection requirements may be found in sections\n79.24, 79.25, and\n79.26\nof this Part. (a) Service brake system. Every vehicle must be tested for brake equalization after a\ncomplete inspection has been performed. Such test must be on a dry, hard, level\nsurface, free from loose material (indoors or outdoors) or with approved brake\ntesting equipment set to approved specifications. At least one front axle wheel\nmust be removed for brake inspection. (Identify location of wheel removed on\nVS-1074 if you use this form, or on the appropriate CVIS when prompted.)\n\nHowever, an inspector may remove as many wheels as necessary to determine the\ncondition of the braking system. A brake tester that has been approved by the\ncommissioner may be used to test the vehicle's braking system in lieu of\nperforming a brake equalization test and the requirement that a wheel be\nremoved. Procedure\n\nReject\nif: 1. Brake Equalization\n1. The vehicle fails to make straight stop without\nsignificant wheel pull. Visually Inspect Condition of\n\nBrake System\n2. Inspect wheel cylinders and calipers for\nleakage. 2. Wheel cylinders or calipers leak. 3. Inspect hoses and lines for leaks, cracks, chafing, flattened or restricted section and improper support. 3. Hoses or lines leak, or are cracked, flattened or are\ninsecurely fastened, copper tubing or compression fittings are used. 4. Inspect master cylinder for leakage and reservoir\nfluid level. 4. Master cylinder leaks or reservoir is not full to its\ndesigned capacity. Note: Visual inspection of mechanical system. It is imperative\nthat brake system reservoir cover and the surrounding area be thoroughly\ncleaned before cover is removed to assure that no dirt is mixed with brake\nfluid. Procedure\n\nReject if: Test Pedal Reserve\n5. While the vehicle is stopped, depress brake pedal\nunder normal foot pressure (if vehicle is equipped with power brakes, engine\nshould be running for this test). 5. Pedal reserve is less than 1/3 of the possible travel\nor less than the manufacturer's specification. Test Brake for Fade\n6. Apply brakes, using normal foot pressure. On vehicles\nequipped with power brakes the engine should be running. 6. Brake pedal does not hold its position for at least\n60 seconds without fading. Inspect Power Brake\n\nUnit\n7. With engine stopped apply brakes several times to\ndeplete power assist in system. Depress brake pedal and while maintaining\nforce, start engine. 7. Brake pedal does not fall slightly under force when\nengine starts. Check Condition of Drum Brake\n\nLinings\n8. Bonded linings Measure the lining thickness at the\nthinnest point. 8. Thinnest point is less than 1/16 inch. 9. Riveted linings Inspect for loose or missing\nrivets. 9. Any rivets are loose or missing. Measure lining thickness above rivet head at thinnest\npoint. Lining is worn to less than 1/32 inch over any rivet\nhead. Check Condition of Brake Linings\nand Pads\n10. Inspect for audible or visual sign from disc brake\nwear sensors, if vehicle is so equipped. 10. Disc brake wear sensor is activated. 11. All linings and pads Inspect for broken or cracked\nlinings and parts of linings not firmly attached to their mounting. Also\ninspect for contamination. 11. Friction material is broken, cracked or not firmly\nand completely attached to its mounting. If friction surface is contaminated\nwith oil or grease or there is metal-to-metal contact. Brake Drums\n12. Inspect the condition of the drum friction surface\nfor substantial cracks extending to the open edge of the drum (short hairline\nheat check cracks should not be considered). 12. There are substantial cracks on the friction surface\nextending to open edge. Inspect for cracks on the outside of drum. There are external cracks. Inspect for mechanical damage. There is evidence of mechanical damage other than\nwear. Inspect for contaminated friction surface. Friction surface is contaminated with oil, grease, or\nbrake fluid. Brake Rotor\n13. Inspect for substantial cracks extending to edge of\nrotor. Inspect for mechanical damage. 13. There are substantial cracks extending to edge. There\nis evidence of mechanical damage other than wear. Inspect discs for any distortion or scoring that\nwould impair braking system. Distortion or scoring impairs the braking\nsystem. Brake Components\n14. Visually inspect components of the braking\nsystem. 14. There is any disconnected, improperly installed, broken, frozen, seized, bypassed, or missing component of the braking\nsystem. Note: An inoperative anti-lock brake system or an illuminated ABS\nwarning light are not causes for rejection. (b) Parking brake. If a 1962 or older vehicle is not originally equipped with\nparking brake, disregard this procedure. Procedure\n\nReject if: Parking Brake\n\nFunction\n1. Set the parking brake firmly. If vehicle is equipped\nwith an \"automatic parking brake release\" type, that releases itself when gear\nselector is placed in a position other than park or neutral, omit paragraph 1\nof this subdivision and inspect all other points of the parking brake. 1. Parking or holding brake will not hold the vehicle\nstationary with engine running at a slightly accelerated speed with shift lever\nin drive position for automatic transmission or shift lever in low gear while\nengaging the clutch on a standard transmission. Parking Brake\n\nComponents\n2. Check parking brake components for general\ncondition. 2. Cable(s) are visibly frayed or frozen, or there are\nmissing or defective cotter pins or broken or missing retracting springs or\nworn rods or couplings. There is no reserve travel in the lever or pedal when\nthe brake is fully applied. The ratchet and pawl or other automatic locking\ndevice does not hold the brake position or cannot be properly released. Parking Brake\n\nIndependence\n3. Examine means by which parking brake works. 3. Parking brake is activated by same means as service\nbrake. Parking brake is not mechanically activated. (c) Tires. A vehicle which is used primarily in an authorized landfill\nmay be equipped with foam-filled tires. Such tires would not be rejectable\nunder paragraphs 2, 3, 4 and 5. However, the tires must be inspected for the\nrequired tread depth and restricted usages. Note: If a tire obviously has the required tread depth, it is not\nnecessary to use the tread depth gauge. Use of the gauge is only required when\ntread depth is questionable and a reading must be obtained to determine whether\nor not the tire must be rejected. Do not check tread depth at tread wear\nindicator bar or tie bar. Procedure\n\nReject if: Tires\n1. Tire tread depth readings shall be taken in two\nadjacent major grooves showing the most tread wear. Readings for a tire which\nhas the tread design running across the tire or for a siped tire where such\ntread design is permitted, shall be taken at or near the center of the tire. Inspect all tires mounted on vehicles (do not inspect spare tire). 1. Any tire is worn to less than 2/32 of an inch of\nmajor tread design at the two worst adjacent points at which the gauge readings\nare obtained. However, the front tires of a motor vehicle, other than a\ntrailer, with a MGW of 10,000 pounds or more, or truck tractor must not be worn\nto less than 4/32 of an inch of major tread design at the two points at which\nthe gauge readings are obtained. 2. Inspect for breaks or cuts. 2. Tire has fabric break, or a cut in excess of one inch\nin any direction and deep enough to reach the body cords. 3. Inspection for bumps, bulges or knots. 3. Tire has visible bumps, bulges or knots indicating\npartial failure or separation of the tire structure. 4. Inspect for any ply or cord structure that is\nexposed. 4. Tire has any portion of the ply or cord structure\nexposed. 5. Visually inspect for restricted usage marking on\ntires. Every tire manufactured for highway use will be labeled with one symbol\nDOT which indicates that the tire conforms to the applicable Federal Motor\n\nVehicle Safety Standards. 5. Tire is marked \"not for highway use,\" \"for farm use\nonly,\" \"for racing use only,\" \"for temporary use only,\" or other markings\nhaving like meaning or the tire size designation is preceded by a \"T.\"\nWheel Fasteners\n6. Inspect for number and condition of wheel\nfasteners. 6. Any wheel fastener is missing or broken. 7. Check tire pressure. 7. Advise customer if tire pressure is not within range\nrecommended by vehicle manufacturer. Note: Tire pressure check\nis an advisory only, do not reject the vehicle. The customer must be notified\nin writing. (d) Steering, suspension, front end and chassis/frame. Procedure\n\nReject if: Steering Wheel Free\n\nPlay\n1. For vehicles equipped with power steering, the engine\nmust be running and the fluid level, belt tension and condition must be\nadequate before testing. 1. Steering wheel movement exceeds: Power Steering: 2\ninches free play Manual Steering: 3 inches free play\n\nWith front tires in straight ahead position, turn\nsteering wheel until motion can be detected at the front tires. Align a\nreference mark on steering wheel with a mark on a ruler and slowly turn\nsteering wheel in the opposite direction until motion can again be detected at\nthe front tires. Measure free play at steering wheel. Steering Linkage\n2. Turn steering wheel to extreme right or left\npositions to determine if there is any binding or interference (on vehicles\nequipped with power steering, engine must be running). With vehicle raised, visually inspect steering linkage and front end components for excessive wear\nand/or looseness. 2. There is any tightness, binding or interference when\nturning the steering wheel completely to the right or left. There is excessive\nwear and/or looseness in any of the following parts: wheel bearings, upper and\nlower cross shaft and bushing, upper and lower outer pins and bushings, idler\narm, center control arms, tie rod ends, drag link ends, steering and pitman\narms, gear box mounting, rack and pinion mounting, steering column mounting or\nsteering wheel shaft mounting; the coupler or universal between gear box and\nsteering column is frayed or cracked; the adjustable column lock or latch does\nnot hold column securely; the steering or shock damper displays visible leakage\nor is missing or broken. Spring and Torsion\n\nBars\n3. Inspect general condition of springs and torsion\nbars. 3. Any front or rear springs or air springs, if\nequipped, are noticeably sagging or broken or if spring shackles are\nexcessively worn or loose. Any torsion bar or stabilizer bar, including\nmechanical linkage is broken, disconnected, missing or bent. 4. Visually inspect chassis/frame or primary uni-body\nmember for general condition. 4.
