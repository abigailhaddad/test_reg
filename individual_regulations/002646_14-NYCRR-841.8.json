Tit. 14 § 841.8 - Medical assistance payments for substance use disorder inpatient rehabilitation services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nprovisions of this section are applicable to programs certified under Part\n818. (b) Rates of Payment. (1)\n\nRates will be calculated using a\ncost-based fee methodology inclusive of operating costs and capital\nreimbursement. There shall be no capital add-on to these fees, nor any separate\n\nMedicaid reimbursement for capital costs. (2)\n\nFees will be established using a\nregression model based on the relationship between normalized cost and program\ncapacity, recognizing both regional cost differentials and economies of scale. The calculated statewide fees based on program capacity, will then be adjusted\nusing regional cost factors (based on the county in which the facility is\nlocated). Geographic region and regional cost factor charts will be posted on\nthe OASAS website. (3)\n\nFees will be\ndeemed to be inclusive of all service delivery costs and will be considered\npayment in full for fee-for-service Medicaid reimbursed services. (4)\n\nFee schedules used to determine rates\nwill be posted on the Office website. Schedules used to determine fees include: (i) statewide OASAS Freestanding Inpatient\n\nRehabilitation fee chart based on bed size; and\n(ii)\ngeographic region and regional cost\nfactor chart. (c) Bed size. (1)\n\nFor existing and new inpatient\nrehabilitation facilities, the bed size will be based on the certified capacity\nof the program site. (2)\n\nIf the\ncertified bed size changes, the fee will be revised accordingly and will be\neffective on the date of the bed size change. (3)\n\nFacilities with fewer than 14 certified\nbeds will use the 14-bed fee. Facilities with 120 or more certified beds will\nuse the 120-bed fee. (4)\n\nBed size\nis determined at certification and listed on the program operating certificate\nissued by the Office. (d) Base year. From time to time, and at the\ndiscretion of the Office, the fees may be revised using new base year data. The\nbase year for new fee calculations will be the most recent, substantially\ncomplete Consolidated Fiscal Report period available at the time of the\ncalculation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
