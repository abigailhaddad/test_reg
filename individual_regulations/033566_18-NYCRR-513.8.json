  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 513.8 - Fair hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A recipient may ask for a fair hearing\nfrom this department to review a denial or modification of a request or the\nfailure of the Department of Health to make a determination within the time\nperiod specified in this Part. The method for asking for the hearing and the\nprocedures for the conduct of the hearing are governed by Part 358 of this\n\nTitle. (b) A fair hearing held\npursuant to this section is limited to a review of the following issues: (1)\nwhether the requested medical, dental and\nremedial care, services or supplies are medically necessary and appropriate for\nthe individual recipient's medical needs; (2)\nwhether other adequate and less expensive\nalternatives have been explored and, where appropriate and cost effective, were\nauthorized; (3)\nwhether the medical\nor dental care, services or supplies requested or authorized conform to\naccepted professional standards; (4)\nwhether the Department of Health failed\nto make a determination within the time period specified in this Part; and\n(5)\nwhether the recipient and\nthe Department of Health complied with the processes and procedures of this\n\nPart and Part 358 of this Title. (c) A decision after fair hearing may remand\nthe case to the Department of Health if the evidence in the hearing record is\nnot sufficient either to affirm or overturn the determination, or there is\nreason to believe that a remand would result in a more equitable determination. This may occur when: new and material evidence has been received at the\nhearing; there has been a material change in law or policy affecting the case; there has been a change in the recipient's condition; or the requested care, services or supplies no longer meet the recipient's needs.
