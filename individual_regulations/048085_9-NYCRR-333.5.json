The agency making the request for a release must forward such\nrequest by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. However, if\nno response to a request for release is received from the organization for the\nblind or handicapped within four weeks of the date of such request for release, this requirement will be waived.

This administrative expense will be that expense incurred in performing\nresponsibilities as the nonprofitmaking charitable agency or commission\ndesignated to facilitate order pursuant to sections 175-a and 175-b of the\n\nState Finance Law. (p) Once\ndesignation as preferred source has been made, the nonprofit agency or\ncommission representing the handicapped will be responsible for supplying the\n\nOffice of General Services with a copy of the contract award.
