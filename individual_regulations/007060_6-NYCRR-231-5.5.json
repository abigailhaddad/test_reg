  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-5.5 - Emission offset requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Emission offset applicability'. (1)\nA\nproposed new facility which is subject to this Subpart must offset its\npotential to emit for each nonattainment contaminant for which it equals or\nexceeds the major facility threshold. (2)\nA proposed modification to an existing\nnon-major facility must offset its project emission potential for each\nnonattainment contaminant for which the project emission potential equals or\nexceeds the major facility threshold. (b) 'Offset ratio'. (1)\n\nAn emission offset of VOC or\nNO\nx\nas ozone precursors must exceed the corresponding\nfacility potential to emit or project emission potential (subsequent to\napplication of LAER), as appropriate, by the applicable offset ratio specified\nin Subpart 231-13 of this Part. A greater offset ratio may be required, on a\ncase-by-case basis, to provide an acceptable contribution demonstration as set\nforth in this section. (2)\n\nAn\nemission offset of PM-10 must at least equal (offset ratio of one to one or\ngreater) the corresponding facility potential to emit or project emission\npotential (subsequent to application of LAER), as appropriate, by the\napplicable offset ratio specified in Subpart 231-13 of this Part. A greater\noffset ratio may be required to provide a net air quality benefit as set forth\nin this section. (3)\n\nAn emission\noffset of PM-2.5 (including applicable precursors) must at least equal (offset\nratio of one to one or greater) the corresponding facility potential to emit or\nproject emission potential of the same pollutant (subsequent to application of\nLAER), as appropriate, by the applicable offset ratio specified in Subpart\n231-13 of this Part. A greater offset ratio may be required to provide a net\nair quality benefit as set forth in this section. (c) 'Use of an ERC as part of an emission\noffset'. An ERC must meet the following conditions to be used as part of an\nemission offset: (1)\nfor\nNO\nx, P M -10, or VOC emissions, ERCs must have\nphysically occurred on or after November 15, 1990 but need not be\ncontemporaneous; (2)\nfor PM-2.5\n(including applicable precursors) ERCs must have physically occurred on or\nafter April 5, 2005 but need not be contemporaneous; (3)\nan ERC, or portion thereof, must be\nincluded as a condition in the permit for the proposed new or modified facility\nfor which the reduction is used. (d) 'Net air quality benefit and emission\noffset location for PM-10, or PM-2.5 (including applicable precursors)'. An\nemission offset of PM-10, or PM-2.5 (including applicable precursors) must meet\nthe following: (1)\n\nContribution\ndemonstration. An emission offset may be obtained from the same nonattainment\narea in which a proposed new or modified facility is to be located. An emission\noffset may also be obtained from other nonattainment areas of equal or higher\nclassification if emissions from such other areas contribute to a violation of\nthe NAAQS for PM-10 or PM-2.5, as applicable, in the nonattainment area where\nthe proposed new or modified facility is to be located. These other areas must\nbe determined in accordance with department approved modeling\nprocedures. (2)\n\nNet air quality\nbenefit demonstration. As part of a permit application, the applicant must\nsubmit an air quality impact evaluation for PM-10 and PM-2.5, as applicable, in\naccordance with department approved modeling procedures. The ambient air\nquality impact analysis must demonstrate that: (i) the net impact of the proposed emissions\nincrease and the emission offset provides for a net benefit, on balance, in the\narea affected by the proposed new or modified facility; and\n(ii)\nfor PM-10 and PM-2.5, the net impact in\nno case exceeds an applicable significant impact level of section\n231-12.6\nof this Part. (3)\n\nInterstate offsets. An\nemission offset of PM-10 or PM-2.5 (including applicable precursors), may be\nobtained from areas of equal or higher classification located in another state, in accordance with department approved modeling procedures, provided that an\ninterstate reciprocal trading agreement is in place and the requirements of\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision are met. (e) 'Ozone nonattainment and emission offset\nlocation'. Department approved modeling procedures must be used by an applicant\nto find default acceptable VOC or NO\nx\noffset source\nlocations within New York State or to perform a case specific contribution\ndemonstration. An emission offset of VOC or NO\nx\nis\nsubject to the following: (1)\n\nProposed new or\nmodified facility located in an ozone nonattainment area. (i) Intrastate offset sources. An emission\noffset of VOC or NO\nx\nmust be obtained from: ('a')\nthe same ozone nonattainment area; or\n('b')\nother ozone nonattainment\nareas of equal or higher classification, if emissions from such other areas\ncontribute to a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the nonattainment area\nwhere the proposed new or modified facility is to be\nlocated. (ii)\n\nInterstate\noffset sources. An emission offset may be obtained from ozone nonattainment\nareas of equal or higher classification in another state, if emissions from\nsuch other areas contribute to a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the\nnonattainment area where the proposed new or modified facility is to be located\nand an interstate reciprocal trading agreement is in place. Department approved\nmodeling procedures may be used by an applicant to perform a case specific\ncontribution demonstration. (2)\n\nProposed new or modified facility located\nin an attainment area of the state within the ozone transport region. An\nemission offset of VOC or NO\nx\nmay be obtained from any\nlocation within the ozone transport region within New York State. Such an\noffset may also be obtained from another state in the ozone transport region, provided that an interstate reciprocal trading agreement is in place. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
