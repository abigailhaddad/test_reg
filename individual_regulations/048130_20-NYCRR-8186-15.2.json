Complaints and supporting documentation\nmay be served personally at the Albany office of the commissioner or by mail. If a complaint is not accompanied by supporting documentation, ORPTS will\nrecommend to the State Board that the tentative State equalization rate, tentative class equalization rates or tentative class ratios be established as\nthe final State equalization rate, final class equalization rates or final\nclass ratios. (b) The complaint\nshall be in writing on a form prescribed by ORPTS and signed by the chief\nexecutive officer or legal representative of the complainant. (c) (1)\n\nAn\nobjection to the tentative equalization rate, class equalization rate or class\nratios, other than sample parcel objections, shall be made in writing.

(2)\n\nSpecific documentation must be supplied\nto support the objection as follows: (i) If\nthe objection alleges invalid or incorrect assessor's report data for any\nearlier year or the year for which the equalization rate is being determined, the assessor must identify the assessor's report year where the invalid or\nincorrect data was originally reported, and the specific parcel or parcels in\nquestion.

If supporting\ndocumentation is based on 25 sales or more, such information must be submitted\nin a computer readable format previously agreed to by ORPTS. (v) If the complainant alleges that a major\ntype full value estimate developed by using a CAMA technique is incorrect, it\nmay provide alternative CAMA data or modeling to support a claimed alternative\nfull value estimate or it may provide an alternative major type full value\nestimate as provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nIf the complainant alleges that a major\ntype full value estimate developed by using some technique other than CAMA or\nsample parcels is incorrect, it may provide alternative data using the same\ntechnique to support an alternative full value estimate or it may provide an\nalternative major type full value estimate as provided in subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph. (vii)\n\nIf the\ncomplainant alleges that the uniform percentage entered on the tentative\nassessment roll is the level of assessment of all property on the assessment\nroll or of a particular major type of property on that roll it must submit\ncredible information to support that allegation and an explanation of how that\ninformation supports that allegation.
