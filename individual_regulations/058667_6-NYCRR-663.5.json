  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 663.5 - Standards for issuance of permits and letters of permission\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person proposing to conduct an activity\nthat requires a permit or letter of permission, as described in section\n663.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart, must meet the standards for permit issuance and receive a permit or\nletter of permission prior to commencing that activity. The burden of showing\nthat the proposed activity will comply with the policies and provisions of the\nact and this Part rests entirely on the applicant. (b) A letter of permission will be issued\nonly if the commissioner has determined that the proposed activity will not\nsubstantially alter or impair the functions or benefits of a wetland. Those\nactivities are identified as \"LP\" in section\n665.7\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, the statewide minimum land use regulations for freshwater wetlands, and\nas \"L\" in the activities chart in section\n663.4\n(d). In\ngranting a letter of permission, the commissioner must determine that the\nproposed activity complies with the limits of the activities as stated in the\nstatewide minimum land use regulations contained in Part 665 of this\n\nTitle. (c) In granting, denying or\nmodifying a permit, the commissioner shall apply the standards for permit\nissuance contained in subdivision (e) of this section in conjunction with the\nclassification of the subject wetland as indicated on the official freshwater\nwetlands map filed by the department, and as established in Part 664 of this\n\nTitle. In applying these standards, the commissioner will consider the effects\nof the proposed activity regardless of political boundaries. (d) As shown in the chart in subdivision (e)\nof this section, a determination of compatibility and a weighing of need\nagainst benefits lost are the criteria for decisionmaking. The three tests for\ncompatibility must be used for all activities listed in the minimum land use\nregulations and section\n663.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart that carry a compatibility category of \"C\" or \"N\" as defined in Part 665\nof this Title and in section\n663.4\n(d). Activities and land uses not listed in the minimum land use regulations or in\nthe procedures table in section\n663.4\n(d) also must\nbe evaluated using the three-part compatibility test. Activities designated as\n\"L\" in section\n663.4\n(d) have been\ndetermined under the minimum land use regulations to be compatible and no\nfurther compatibility or weighing analysis need be performed before issuance of\na letter of permission as defined in section\n663.2\n(r). Activities identified as \"E\" are exempt and do not require either a permit or\nletter of permission. Exempt activities are included in section\n663.4\n(d) to assist\nthe department and applicants in determining regulatory procedures. (1)\n\nWhen the three tests of compatibility\ngiven in the chart in subdivision (e) of this section are met, no other\nweighing standards need apply, regardless of the wetland's classification, and\na permit, with or without conditions, may be issued for the proposed activity. In conjunction with the three-part test, the statewide minimum land use\nregulations or a local variance from them that has been duly adopted according\nto the provisions of Part 665 of this Title are the basis for determinations of\ncompatibility. (2)\n\nIf the proposed\nactivity cannot meet all three tests of compatibility or if it is identified as\n\"X,\" incompatible, then, for a permit to be issued, the activity must meet each\nof the weighing standards listed in the chart in subdivision (e) of this\nsection for the classification of the wetland that would be affected by the\nproposed activity. (3)\n\nIf it is\ndetermined that a written request for a letter of permission exceeds the\nthresholds identified in the items listed in sections\n665.7\n(g) and\n663.4\n(d), a letter\nof permission may not be issued. Instead the proposed action must be tested for\ncompatibility using the three-part test in subdivision (e) of this section and\na permit application must be processed pursuant to the act and this Part. If\nthere is question or doubt as to whether any proposed activity being reviewed\nfor compatibility with the three-part test in subdivision (e) meets any of the\nthree parts of the test, the action must be treated as incompatible and the\nactivity weighed according to the standards identified in subdivision\n(e). (e) Standards\nfor Permit issuance. (1)\n\nCompatibility. These three tests are to be used to determine\nthe compatibility of all activities identified as P(C) or P(N) in section\n663.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart or for any actions not listed in section\n663.4\n(d). If all\nthree of the following tests of compatibility are met, no other weighing\nstandards need be met, regardless of the wetland class. A permit, with or\nwithout conditions, may be issued for a proposed activity on a wetland of any\nclass or in a wetland's adjacent area, if it is determined that the activity\n(i) would be compatible with preservation, protection and conservation of the\nwetland and its benefits, and (ii) would result in no more than insubstantial\ndegradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland, and (iii) would be\ncompatible with public health and welfare. (2)\n\nWeighing. These weighing\nstandards must be applied to all activities identified as P(X) in section\n663.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart, and to all those activities listed as P(C) of (N) in section\n663.4\n(d) or not\nlisted in section\n663.4\n(d) that do\nnot meet the three tests of compatibility listed in section\n663.5\n(e)(1). If\nthe proposed activity is listed as (X) or cannot meet the three tests for\ncompatibiltiy, then a permit may be issued only if the proposed activity meets\neach of the standards below for the class of wetland affected: For wetland Classes I, II, III and IV, the proposed\nactivity must be compatible with the public health and welfare, be the only\npractible alternative that could accomplish the applicant's objectives and have\nno practicable alternative on a site that is not a freshwater wetland or\nadjacent area. For wetland Classes I, II, and III, the proposed activity\nmust minimize degradation to, or loss of, any part of the wetland or is\nadjacent area and must minimize any adverse impacts on the functions and\nbenefits that the wetland provides. For wetland Class IV, the proposed activity must make a\nreasonable effort to minimize degradation to, or loss of, any part of the\nwetland or its adjacent area. Class I wetlands\n\nClass II wetlands\n\nClass III wetlands\n\nClass IV Wetlands\n\nClass I wetlands provide the most critical of the\n\nState's wetland benefits, reduction of which is acceptable only in the most\nunusual circumstances. A permit shall be issued only if it is determined that\nthe proposed activity satisfies a compelling economic or social need that\nclearly and substantially outweighs the loss of or detriment to the benefit(s)\nof the Class I wetland. Class II wetlands provide important wetland\nbenefits, the loss of which is acceptable only in very limited circumstances. A\npermit shall be issued only if it is determined that the proposed activity\nsatisfies a pressing economic or social need that clearly outweighs the loss of\nor detriment to the benefit(s) of the Class II wetland. Class III wetlands supply wetland benefits, the\nloss of which is acceptable only after the exercise of caution and discernment. A permit shall be issued only if it is determined that the proposed activity\nsatisfies an economic or social need that outweighs the loss of or detriment to\nthe benefit(s) of the Class III wetland. Class IV wetlands provide some wildlife and open\nspace benefits and may provide other benefits cited in the act. Therefore, wanton or uncontrolled degradation or loss of Class IV wetlands is\nunacceptable. A permit shall be issued for a proposed activity in a Class IV\nwetland only if it is determined that the activity would be the only\npracticable alternative which could accomplish the applicant's objectives. (f) Interpretation of some terms used\nin subdivision (e) of this section. (1)\n\nPublic health and welfare. Those concerns include: (i) consistency of the proposed activity with\nphysical health, if necessary, as judged by health professionals; and\n(ii)\nconsistency with related Federal, State\nand local laws, regulations and policies. If a proposed activity is inconsistent with physical\nhealth, or with any related laws, regulations and government policies, this\nwould weigh against issuing a permit under the act until such conditions were\nmet that would make the proposed activity consistent with these\nprovisions. (2)\n\nOnly\npracticable alternative. A proposed activity is the only practicable\nalternative if no other is physically or economically feasible. This does not, however, mean that the most profitable or least costly alternative is the only\nfeasible one nor that the least profitable or more costly alternative is the\nonly feasible one. (3)\n\nEconomic and\nsocial need. When the economic and social need for the proposed activity is\nconsidered, the economic and social burden that would be imposed on the public\nshall be considered. The public economic and social burden may include: associated services, such as sewer systems, schools, and fire and police\nprotection, necessitated by the proposed activity; prevention of contamination, flood or other damage to the proposed development on the wetland by methods\nsuch as channelization, alteration of land, alteration of water flow, draining\nor construction of dams, dikes or levees; and/or services and repairs, such as\nmedical care, pumping, cleaning, dredging and emergency assistance as a result\nof contamination, flooding or other damage to the proposed development on the\nwetland. Nothing in this section precludes the consideration of any issue which\nmust be addressed under the State Environmental Quality Review Act (article 8\nof the Environmental Conservation Law). (4)\n\nSpecific Class I standards. (i) \"... reduction of which is acceptable\nonly in unusual circumstances.\" Permits for the vast majority of activities\nthat could not avoid reducing a benefit provided by a Class I wetland would not\nbe approved. The word\nreduction\nmeans that this applies not\njust to the loss of any benefit, but to the partial loss or reduction of a\nbenefit. (ii)\n\"... satisfies a\ncompelling economic or social need...\" The word\ncompelling\nimplies that the proposed activity carries with it not merely a sense of\ndesirability or urgency, but of actual necessity; that the proposed activity\nmust be done; that it is unavoidable. (iii)\n\"... clearly and substantially\noutweighs...\"\nClearly\nmeans that the need for the proposed\nactivity must outweigh the loss of or detriment to the benefits in a way that\nis beyond serious debate. Substantially\ncarries this further, in that not only must the need clearly outweigh the loss or detriment, but the\nmargin of outweighing itself must be large or significant. (5)\n\nSpecific Class II standards. (i) \"... loss of which is acceptable only\nin limited circumstances.\" Permits for most activities that could not avoid\ncausing a loss of or detriment to a benefit provided by a Class II wetland\nwould not be approved. (ii)\n\"... satisfies a pressing economic or social need...\"\nPressing\nshould suggest that for the need to outweigh the loss of or detriment to a\nbenefit of a Class II wetland, it must be urgent and intense, though it does\nnot have to be necessary or unavoidable. (iii)\n\"... clearly\noutweighs...\" means that the need for the proposed activity must\noutweigh the loss of or detriment to the benefits in a way that is beyond\nserious debate, although there does not have to be a large or significant\nmargin between the need and the loss. (6)\n\nSpecific Class III standards. (i) \"... loss of which is acceptable only\nafter the exercise of caution and discernment.\" This means that permits could\nbe issued for activities that could not avoid loss of or detriment to a benefit\nprovided by a Class III wetland but only after careful evaluation. (ii)\n\"... satisfies an economic or social\nneed...\" The need for the activity is real and undeniable, though it does not\nhave to be necessary, unavoidable, urgent or intense. (iii)\n\"... outweighs...\"\nmeans that the need for the activity must outweigh the loss of or detriment to\na benefit, but the balance in favor of the activity does not have to be beyond\nserious debate. (7)\n\nClass\nIV standards. Permit issuance cannot be indiscriminate or unexamined for Class\nIV wetlands and still require consideration of loss of wetland\nvalues. (g) Mitigation of impacts. (1)\n\nThe\napplicant may suggest a proposal to enhance the existing benefits provided by a\nwetland or to create and maintain new wetland benefits in order to increase the\nlikelihood that a proposed activity will meet the applicable standards for\npermit issuance. Such a proposal must meet the following provisions: (i) the mitigation must occur on or in the\nimmediate vicinity of the site of the proposed project; (ii)\nthe area affected by the proposed\nmitigation must be regulated by the act and this Part after mitigative measures\nare completed; and\n(iii)\nthe\nmitigation must provide substantially the same or more benefits that will be\nlost through the proposed activity. (2)\n\nAny mitigation considered as part of a\npermit granted pursuant to this Part will be included as a condition on such\npermit and must be complied with as mandatory if other work is started or\ncompleted. (3)\n\nIf mitigation\nproposed does not totally compensate for lost values or benefits that would be\nlost by the proposed activity, then the net loss of benefits must be assessed. Any unmitigated net loss of wetland values must then be weighed according to\nstandards contained in section\n663.5\nof this Part. (h) A duly filed notice in writing\nthat the State or any agency or political subdivision of the State is in the\nprocess of acquiring any freshwater wetland by negotiation or condemnation\nauthorizes, but does not require, denial of any permit, but only if both the\naffected landowner and the local government have been so notified. (1)\n\nThe written notice must include an\nindication that the acquisition process has commenced, such as that an\nappraisal of the property has been prepared or is in the process of being\nprepared. (2)\n\nIf the landowner\nreceives no offer for the property within one year of the permit denial, this\nban to the permit lapses. If its negotiations with the applicant are broken\noff, the State or any agency or political subdivision must, within six months\nof the end of negotiation, either issue its findings and determination to\nacquire the property pursuant to section\n204\nof the Eminent Domain Procedure Law or\nissue a determination to acquire the property without public hearing pursuant\nto section 206 of the General Domain Procedure Law, or this ban to the permit\nlapses.
