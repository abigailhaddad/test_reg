  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 604.1 - Obligation of attorneys and judges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application of rules. This Part\nshall apply to all actions and proceedings, civil and criminal, in courts\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court in\nthis Judicial Department. It is intended to supplement but not to supersede the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct (Part 1200 of this Title) and the rules governing\njudicial conduct as promulgated by the Administrative Board of the Judicial\n\nConference. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Part\nand the Rules of Professional Conduct, or the rules governing judicial conduct, the Rules of Professional Conduct, and the rules governing judicial conduct\nshall prevail. (b) Importance of decorum in court. The courtroom, as the place where justice is\ndispensed, must at all times satisfy the appearance as well as the reality of\nfairness and equal treatment. Dignity, order and decorum are indispensable to\nthe proper administration of justice. Disruptive conduct by any person while\nthe court is in session is forbidden. (c) Disruptive conduct defined. Disruptive conduct is any intentional conduct by any person in the courtroom\nthat substantially interferes with the dignity, order and decorum of judicial\nproceedings. (d) Obligation of the attorney. (1)\n\nThe attorney is both an officer of\nthe court and an advocate. It is his professional obligation to conduct his\ncase courageously, vigorously, and with all the skill and knowledge he\npossesses. It is also his obligation to uphold the honor and maintain the\ndignity of the profession. He must avoid disorder or disruption in the\ncourtroom, and he must maintain a respectful attitude toward the court. In all\nrespects the attorney is bound, in court and out, by the provisions of the\n\nRules of Professional Conduct (Part 1200 of this Title). (2)\n\nThe attorney shall use his\nbest efforts to dissuade his client and witnesses from causing disorder or\ndisruption in the courtroom. (3)\n\nThe attorney shall not engage in\nany examination which is intended merely to harass, annoy or humiliate the\nwitness. (4)\n(i) No attorney shall argue in\nsupport of or against an objection without permission from the court; nor shall\nany attorney argue with respect to a ruling of the court on an objection\nwithout such permission. (ii)\n\nHowever, an attorney may make a\nconcise statement of the particular grounds for an objection or exception, not\notherwise apparent, where it is necessary to do so in order to call the court's\nattention thereto, or to preserve an issue for appellate review. If an attorney\nbelieves in good faith that the court has wrongly made an adverse ruling, he\nmay respectfully request reconsideration thereof. (5)\n\nThe attorney has neither\nthe right nor duty to execute any directive of a client which is not consistent\nwith professional standards of conduct. Nor may he advise another to do any act\nor to engage in any conduct which is in any manner contrary to this\n\nPart. (6)\n\nOnce a\nclient has employed an attorney who has entered an appearance, the attorney\nshall not withdraw or abandon the case without (i) justifiable cause, (ii)\nreasonable notice to the client, and (iii) permission of the court. (7)\n\nThe attorney is not\nrelieved of these obligations by what he may regard as a deficiency in the\nconduct or ruling of a judge or in the system of justice; nor is he relieved of\nthese obligations by what he believes to be the moral, political, social, or\nideological merits of the cause of any client. (e) Obligations of the judge. (1)\n\nIn the administration of\njustice, the judge shall safeguard the rights of the parties and the interests\nof the public. The judge at all times shall be dignified, courteous, and\nconsiderate of the parties, attorneys, jurors, and witnesses. In the\nperformance of his duties and in the maintenance of proper court decorum the\njudge is in all respects bound by the rules governing judicial\nconduct. (2)\n\nThe\njudge shall use his judicial power to prevent disruptions of the\ntrial. (3)\nA judge\nbefore whom a case is moved for trial shall preside at such trial unless he is\nsatisfied, upon challenge, or sua sponte, that he is unable to serve with\ncomplete impartiality, in fact or appearance, with regard to the matter, or\nparties in question. (4)\n\nWhere the judge deems it\nappropriate in order to preserve or enhance the dignity, order and decorum of\nthe proceedings, he shall prescribe and make known the rules relating to\nconduct which the parties, attorneys, witnesses and others will be expected to\nfollow in the courtroom. (5)\n\nThe judge should be the exemplar of\ndignity and impartiality. He shall suppress his personal predilections, control\nhis temper and emotions, and otherwise avoid conduct on his part which tends to\ndemean the proceedings or to undermine his authority in the courtroom. When it\nbecomes necessary during trial for him to comment upon the conduct of\nwitnesses, spectators, counsel, or others, or upon the testimony, he shall do\nso in a firm and polite manner, limiting his comments and rulings to what is\nreasonably required for the orderly progress of the trial, and refraining from\nunnecessary disparagement of persons or issues. (6)\n\nThe judge is not relieved\nof these obligations by what he may regard as a deficiency in the conduct of\nany attorney who appears before him; nor is he relieved of these obligations by\nwhat he believes to be the moral, political, social, or ideological\ndeficiencies of the cause of any party.
