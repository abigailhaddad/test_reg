  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 101.9 - Hardship cases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notwithstanding\nany other provisions contained in this Part, in hardship cases, the\ncommissioner may make advance payments in anticipation of a displaced person's\nactually moving or actually purchasing or renting and occupying decent, safe\nand sanitary replacement housing. The commissioner may authorize the advance\npayment of the amount determined to represent reasonable and necessary moving\nexpenses or the amount of the approved replacement housing payment deemed\nnecessary to purchase or rent decent, safe and sanitary replacement housing. In\nthe case of a replacement housing payment, payment shall be made only if there\nis a signed contract for the purchase of a replacement housing property or, in\nthe case of a replacement rental unit, if there is a signed lease or some other\nfirm commitment. In both instances, the proposed replacement housing shall be\ninspected prior to payment to determine whether it is decent, safe and\nsanitary. (b) When the commissioner\ndetermines that an unusual or hardship situation exists and it is determined to\nbe in the public interest to do so, the commissioner may authorize relocation\npayments even though the strict requirements of eligibility and reimbursement\nspecified in this Part are not met.
