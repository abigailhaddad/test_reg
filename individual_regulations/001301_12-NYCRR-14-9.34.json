  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.34 - Feedwater supply apparatus\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided for in subdivisions (b) and (d) below, boilers having more\nthan 500 square feet of water-heating surface shall have at least two means of\nfeeding water. Except as provided for in subdivisions (c), (d) and (e) of this\nsection, each source of feeding shall be capable of supplying water to the\nboiler at a pressure of three percent higher than the highest setting of any\nsafety valve on the boiler. For boilers that are fired with solid fuel not in\nsuspension, and for boilers whose setting or heat source can continue to supply\nsufficient heat to cause damage to the boiler if the feed supply is\ninterrupted, one such means of feeding shall not be susceptible to the same\ninterruption as the other and shall provide sufficient water to prevent damage\nto the boiler. (b) Except as\nprovided for in subdivision (a) of this section, a boiler fired by gaseous, liquid or solid fuel in suspension may be equipped with a single means of\nfeeding water provided means are furnished for the shutting off of its heat\ninput prior to the water level reaching the lowest permissible level\nestablished by ASME. (c) For\nboilers having a water-heating surface of not more than 100 square feet, the\nfeed connection to the boiler shall not be smaller than 1/2 inch pipe size. For\nboilers having a water heating surface of more than 100 square feet, the feed\nconnection to the boiler shall not be smaller than 3/4 inch pipe\nsize. (d) High-temperature water\nboilers shall be provided with means of adding water to the boiler or system\nwhile under pressure. (e) A\nforced-flow steam generator with no fixed steam and waterline shall be provided\nwith a source of feeding capable of supplying water to the boiler at a pressure\nnot less than the expected maximum sustained pressure at the boiler inlet, as\ndetermined by the boiler manufacturer, corresponding to operating at maximum\ndesigned steaming capacity with maximum allowable working pressure at the\nsuperheater outlet. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.34\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
