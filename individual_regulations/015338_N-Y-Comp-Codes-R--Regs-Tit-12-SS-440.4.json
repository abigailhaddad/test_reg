Such notice shall include: (i) either the identity of all independent\npharmacies and pharmacy chains designated by the carrier, or where the carrier\ndesignates a pharmacy benefits manager or other party, the identity and contact\ninformation for the pharmacy benefits manager or other party, who shall provide\na list of all pharmacies in the employee's state to the employee in writing or\nelectronically upon and in accordance with an employee's request; and\n(ii)\na toll-free number and website where the\nemployee may access information regarding the procedures the employee must\nfollow to fill and refill prescriptions through a remote pharmacy or other\nmeans, and may obtain a list of such pharmacies including their name, address\nand phone number, searchable by geographic location and fully updated as of the\ndate at issue, in that employee's state. (2)\n\nEach employer within seven days following\nreceipt of such notice, and each self-insured employer upon the designation of\nan independent pharmacy or pharmacies, chain pharmacy or pharmacies, pharmacy\nbenefit manager, or other party under this section, must either: (i) post the notice required in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision in the same location where the notice of workers'\ncompensation coverage required by section\n51\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law is posted; or\n(ii)\ndistribute a copy of the notice to all\nemployees in New York State by providing the notice in paper format or sending\nit electronically; or\n(iii)\nposting\nthe notice on its employee accessible intranet or internet website. (3)\n\nIf the designated independent\npharmacies, pharmacy chains, or pharmacy benefit manager change, the carrier or\nself-insured employer, or its designee, must revise the notification required\nby paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision to reflect such changes. The\ncarrier or its designee shall provide such revised notification to all\nemployers whose employees are required to use such pharmacy or pharmacies or\npharmacy benefit manager. Such revised notification shall be posted or\ndistributed by each employer in accordance with paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. The designation of any new independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefit manager previously listed in the notice provided under\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, or the removal of any such pharmacy chain, independent pharmacy, or pharmacy benefit manager, shall not be valid until\nseven business days after such posting and distribution of the revised\nnotice. (b) Individual\nnotice requirements for self-insured employers and insurance carriers.

If the self-insured employer or insurance carrier has designated an independent\npharmacy or pharmacies, chain pharmacy or pharmacies, or pharmacy benefit\nmanager, and requires the claimant to obtain prescription medicine from such\npharmacy or pharmacies or from a pharmacy affiliated with the pharmacy benefit\nmanager, the document shall include such information as necessary to notify the\nclaimant or pharmacies when the claimant attempts to fill a prescription, that\nthe self-insured employer or insurance carrier has made such designation, including the website address and toll-free telephone number required by\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section and any identifying code that the claimant may\nbe required to use when making purchases through a remote pharmacy. The\ndocument may contain such accurate and relevant information in regard to the\nworkers' compensation coverage for the claimant as the self-insured employer or\ninsurance carrier deems appropriate, and shall be accompanied by such\nexplanatory information in easily understood plain language as is necessary to\nexplain how to use the document to purchase medication. In addition, upon\nreceiving notification of the claim, the self-insured employer or insurance\ncarrier shall provide the claimant a toll-free number and website where any\ninformation about the designated independent pharmacies, pharmacy chains, or\npharmacy benefit manager can be obtained; and\n(3)\na list of designated independent\npharmacies or chain pharmacies that shall include pharmacies located within 15\nmiles of the claimant's place of residence or employment if the claimant\nresides in a rural area or within five miles if the claimant resides in a\nmunicipality which is an incorporated city or village having a population of\n2,500 or more; and\n(4)\ncontact\ninformation for any designated remote pharmacy. (c) The requirement to use a designated\nindependent pharmacy, chain pharmacy, or pharmacy benefit manager, shall not be\neffective until all notification requirements set forth in subdivisions (a) and\n(b) of this section have been met. Additionally, when the insurance carrier or\nselfinsured employer or their agent has previously served the claimant with the\nprescribed notice required by subdivision (d) of section\n440.3\nof this Part, the\nself-insured employer, insurance carrier, or their agent, must reserve the\nclaimant with the notice required in subdivision (b) of this section in order\nto require a claimant to resume use of a designated pharmacy. (d) A self-insured employer's, insurance\ncarrier's, or employer's failure to comply with the notification requirements\nof this Part may be subject to sanction by the chair in accordance with section\n440.10\nof this Part. Such sanction\nmay include a direction that reimbursement to any pharmacy, pharmacy processing\nagent or other third party that paid for the medication harmed by such failure\nto be at a rate greater than that provided to designated pharmacies, although\nin no case more than the fee schedule, and the costs to the harmed party\nresulting from the failure plus statutory interest. In cases of persistent and\nsignificant non-compliance, such sanction may include suspension or prohibition\nof the self-insured employer's or insurance carrier's designation of pharmacies\nunder this Part.
