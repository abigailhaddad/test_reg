(2)\n$100 for a stationary\ncombustion installation having a maximum operating heat input less than 50\nmillion British thermal units per hour as stated on the most recent application\nfor a permit to construct or application for a certificate to\noperate. (3)\n$1,000 for a process\nair contamination source having an annual emission rate equal to or greater\nthan 25 tons per year of any one of the following: sulfur dioxide, nitrogen\ndioxide, total particulates, carbon monoxide, total volatile organic compounds\nand other specific air contaminants. The annual emission rate is the actual\nannual emission rate as stated on the most recent application for a permit to\nconstruct or application for a certificate to operate. If hours of operation\nhave not been specified on the applications, then maximum possible hours of\noperation (8,760 hours) are used to calculate actual annual\nemissions.

The\ncharging capacity is established in accordance with the application for a\npermit to construct or application for a certificate to operate the incinerator\nsource and is calculated on an emission point basis. (6)\n$100 for an incinerator with a maximum\ndesign charge rate of less than 2,000 pounds of refuse per hour. The charging\ncapacity is established in accordance with the application for the most recent\npermit to construct or application for a certificate to operate the incinerator\nsource and is calculated on an emission point basis.
