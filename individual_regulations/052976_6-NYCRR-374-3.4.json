  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-3.4 - Standards for universal waste transporters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThis section applies to universal waste\ntransporters (as defined in section\n374-3.1\n[i]\nof this\n\nSubpart). (2)\n\nPart 364 of this\n\nTitle also applies to universal waste transporters. (b) Prohibitions. A universal waste transporter is: (1)\nprohibited from disposing of universal\nwaste; and\n(2)\nprohibited from\ndiluting or treating universal waste, except by responding to releases as\nprovided in subdivision (e) of this section. (c) Waste management. (1)\nA universal waste transporter must comply\nwith all applicable U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR\nparts\n171\nthrough\n180, incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, for transport of any universal waste that meets the definition of\nhazardous material in\n49 CFR\n171.8. For purposes of the Department of\n\nTransportation regulations, a material is considered a hazardous waste if it is\nsubject to the hazardous waste manifest requirements of the U.S. Environmental\n\nProtection Agency specified in 40 CFR part\n262. Because universal waste does\nnot require a hazardous waste manifest, it is not considered hazardous waste\nunder the Department of Transportation regulations. (2)\n\nSome universal waste materials are\nregulated by the Department of Transportation as hazardous materials because\nthey meet the criteria for one or more hazard classes specified in\n49\nCFR\n173.2. As universal waste shipments do\nnot require a manifest under 40 CFR\n262, they may not be described by the DOT\nproper shipping name \"hazardous waste, (l) or (s), n.o.s.,\" nor may the\nhazardous material's proper shipping name be modified by adding the word\n\"waste.\"\n(d) Storage time limits. (1)\nA\nuniversal waste transporter may only store the universal waste at a universal\nwaste transfer facility for 10 days or less. (2)\n\nIf a universal waste transporter stores\nuniversal waste for more than 10 days, the transporter becomes a universal\nwaste handler and must comply with the applicable requirements of section\n374-3.2 or\n374-3.3\nof this Subpart while\nstoring the universal waste. (e) Response to releases. (1)\nA universal waste transporter must\nimmediately contain all releases of universal wastes and other residues from\nuniversal wastes. (2)\nA universal\nwaste transporter must determine whether any material resulting from the\nrelease is hazardous waste, and if so, it is subject to all applicable\nrequirements of Parts 370 through Subpart 374-1 and Part 376 of this Title. If\nthe waste is determined to be a hazardous waste, the transporter is subject to\ngenerator requirements under Part 372 of this Title. (f) Off-site shipments. (1)\nA universal waste transporter is\nprohibited from transporting the universal waste to a place other than a\nuniversal waste handler, a destination facility, or a foreign\ndestination. (2)\n\nIf the universal\nwaste being shipped off-site meets the Department of Transportation's\ndefinition of hazardous materials under\n49 CFR\n171.8, incorporated by reference in section\n370.1(e) of this Title, the shipment must be properly described on a shipping\npaper in accordance with the applicable Department of Transportation\nregulations under 49 CFR part\n172, incorporated by reference in section\n370.1(e) of this Title. (g) Exports. A universal waste transporter transporting a shipment of\nuniversal waste to a foreign destination other than to those OECD countries\nspecified in section\n372.5\n(h)(1)(i)\nof\nthis Title (in which case the transporter is subject to the requirements of\nsection\n372.5\n[h]\nof this\n\nTitle) may not accept a shipment if the transporter knows the shipment does not\nconform to the EPA acknowledgment of consent. In addition the transporter must\nensure that: (1)\na copy of the EPA\nacknowledgment of consent accompanies the shipment; and\n(2)\nthe shipment is delivered to the facility\ndesignated by the person initiating the shipment.
