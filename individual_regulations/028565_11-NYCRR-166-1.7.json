  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 166-1.7 - Allocation of excess profits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annually, the Insurance Department shall determine the total amount of excess profit dollars to be distributed, in accordance with the following procedure: A six-year excess profit shall equal the six-year average of the annual rates of return on net worth (computed in accordance with section 166- 1.6 of this Subpart), minus 21.0 percent. The resulting figure, if positive, shall be divided by the average countrywide earned premium-to-net worth ratio of the six-year period, thus stating the excess profit as a percentage of premiums. This percentage shall then be multiplied by the six-year total direct earned premiums for New York motor vehicle insurance, to produce the total dollar amount to be returned to New York policyholders. (b) A group or fleet of insurers shall be deemed, with respect to this regulation, to be a single insurer. (c) Insurers with an overall six-year average rate of return of 21 percent or less (computed using the method described in subdivision (d) of this section) shall be exempted from returning excess profits. (d) Insurers not subject to subdivision (c) of this section shall have their share of total New York excess profits computed in accordance with the following procedure: (1)\n\nEach insurer's annual return on net worth shall be computed using the formulas and the industrywide values from section\n166-1.6\nof this Subpart, except that: (i) the Underwriting Gain Ratio\nNY\nshall be replaced by the individual insurer's comparable Underwriting Gain Ratio (derived from New York's Loss and Expense Ratios); and\n(ii)\nthe Dividends to Policyholders\nCTY\nshall be replaced by the ratio of the individual insurer's total dividends paid on New York motor vehicle business to its New York earned premiums for the motor vehicle lines, multiplied by industrywide Earned Premium\nCTY. Individual insurer New York dividend and earned premium data will be taken from page 14 of the insurer's annual statement; industrywide Earned Premium\nCTY\nwill be the value used in section\n166-1.6\nof this Subpart (as derived from Best's Aggregates and Averages). (2)\n\nFor each insurer, a six-year average of its annual rates of return on net worth (computed as in paragraph [1] of this subdivision) shall then be calculated, and 21.0 percent shall be subtracted from that average. The resulting figure, if positive, shall be divided by the average industrywide, countrywide earned premium-to-net worth ratio of the six-year period (i.e., the same value as computed in subdivision [a] of this section). This ratio shall then be multiplied by the individual insurer's six-year total direct earned premiums for New York motor vehicle insurance, to produce a total dollar amount. If the resulting figure, as calculated above, is not positive, the insurer's total dollar amount shall be set at zero, and the insurer shall be exempted from returning excess profits, in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (3)\n\nThe total dollar amount for each insurer, as calculated in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be divided by the sum of the total dollar amounts similarly calculated for all insurers. The resulting ratio shall then be multiplied by the industrywide total dollar amount to be returned to New York policyholders (as calculated in subdivision [a] of this section) to determine the individual insurer's total dollar amount to be returned to its New York policyholders. (e) The Insurance Department shall determine annually the liability of each insurer for its share of any excess profit to be returned, and notify such insurer thereof. (f) Procedures which insurers shall follow in returning excess profits. (1)\n\nEach insurer's share of total excess profits to be returned, as determined by the Insurance Department, shall be allocated to each of its current New York insureds who is of record as of the date of distribution, in accordance with a fair, practicable and nondiscriminatory plan for refunds or credits, which shall be established by such insurer. (2)\n\nDistribution of excess profits to individual insureds shall be made among all of an insurer's New York motor vehicle business (including assigned risks and commercial risks). (3)\n\nInsurers' allocation of excess profits to individual insureds shall be accomplished within 90 days of receipt of notification from the department pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section. (g) The superintendent may waive or modify any requirement for an individual insurer's refund or credit which the superintendent determines to be de minimis, impracticable, or otherwise unreasonable. (h) See section\n166-2.7\nof this Part for discussion of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
