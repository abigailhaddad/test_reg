The following conditions apply to all Part 373 permits, and will be incorporated into the permits either expressly or by reference. If\nincorporated by reference, a specification to these regulations must be given\nin the permit. (1)\n\nDuty to comply. The\npermittee must comply with all conditions of this permit. Any permit\nnoncompliance constitutes a violation of ECL article 27, title 9, and is\ngrounds: (i) for enforcement\naction; (ii)\nfor permit\ntermination, revocation and reissuance, or modification; or\n(iii)\nfor denial of a permit renewal\napplication. (2)\n\nDuty to\nreapply. If the permittee wishes to continue an activity regulated by this\npermit after the expiration date of this permit, the permittee must apply for\nand obtain a new permit. (3)\n\nNeed\nto halt or reduce activity not a defense. It will not be a defense for a\npermittee in an enforcement action that it would have been necessary to halt or\nreduce the permitted activity in order to maintain compliance with the\nconditions of this permit. (4)\n\nDuty\nto mitigate. In the event of noncompliance with the permit, the permittee must\ntake all reasonable steps to minimize releases to the environment and must\ncarry out such measurements as are reasonable to prevent significant adverse\nimpacts on human health and the environment. (5)\n\nProper operation and maintenance. The\npermittee must at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and\nsystems of treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are\ninstalled or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of\nthis permit. Proper operation and maintenance\nincludes\neffective performance, adequate funding, adequate operator staffing and\ntraining, and adequate laboratory and process controls, including appropriate\nquality assurance procedures. This provision requires the operation of backup\nor auxiliary facilities or similar systems only when necessary to achieve\ncompliance with the conditions of the permit. (6)\n\nPermit actions. This permit may be\nmodified, suspended or revoked for cause. The filing of a request by the\npermittee for a permit modification, suspension or revocation, or a\nnotification of planned changes or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any\npermit condition. (7)\n\nProperty\nrights. The permit does not convey any property rights of any sort, or any\nexclusive privilege. (8)\n\nDuty to\nprovide information. The permittee must furnish to the commissioner, within a\nreasonable time, any relevant information which the commissioner may request to\ndetermine whether cause exists for modifying, suspending or revoking this\npermit, or to determine compliance with this permit. The permittee must also\nfurnish to the commissioner, upon request, copies of records required to be\nkept by this permit. (9)\n\nInspection\nand entry. The permittee must allow the commissioner or an authorized\nrepresentative, upon the presentation of identification, to: (i) enter at reasonable times upon the\npermittee's premises where a regulated facility or activity is located or\nconducted, or where records must be kept under the conditions of this\npermit; (ii)\nhave access to and\ncopy, at reasonable times, any records that must be kept under the conditions\nof this permit; (iii)\ninspect at\nreasonable times any facilities, equipment (including monitoring and control\nequipment), practices or operations regulated or required under this permit; and\n(iv)\nsample or monitor at\nreasonable times, for the purposes of assuring permit compliance, or as\notherwise authorized by the ECL, any substances or parameters at any\nlocation.

This period may be extended by request of\nthe commissioner at any time. The permittee must maintain records of all\nground-water quality and ground-water surface elevations, for the active life\nof the facility, and for the post-closure care period as well. (iii)\n\nRecords for monitoring information must\ninclude: (a) the date, exact place and time of\nsampling or measurements; (b) the\nname(s) of the individual(s) who performed the sampling or\nmeasurements; (c) the date(s)\nanalyses were performed; (d) the\nname(s) of the individual(s) who performed the analyses; (e) the analytical techniques or methods\nused; and\n(f) the results of such\nanalyses.

In satisfying this provision, the department\nmay incorporate applicable requirements of Subpart 373-2 of this Part and Parts\n374 and 376 of this Title directly into the permit or establish other permit\nconditions that are based on this Part. The department may impose permit\nconditions as the department determines necessary to protect human health and\nthe environment. If, as the result of an assessment or other information, the\ndepartment determines that conditions are necessary in addition to those\nrequired under 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and\nimplemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, Subpart 373-2 of this Part, or Subpart 374-1 of this Title, to\nensure protection of human health and the environment, the department will\ninclude those terms and conditions in a Part 373 permit for a hazardous waste\ncombustion unit. (3)\n\nNew permits, renewal of permits and modified or suspended permits shall incorporate each of\nthe applicable requirements referenced in this section. (4)\n\nIncorporation.

(1)\n\nThe permit may, when appropriate, specify\na schedule of compliance leading to compliance with this Part. (i) Time for compliance. Any schedules of\ncompliance will require compliance as soon as possible. (ii)\n\nInterim dates. Except as provided in\nclause (2)(i)(\nb\n) of this subdivision, if a permit establishes\na schedule of compliance which exceeds one year from the date of permit\nissuance, the schedule will establish interim requirements and the dates for\ntheir achievement. (a) The time between\ninterim dates will not exceed one year. (b) If the time necessary for completion of\nany interim requirement is more than one year, and is not readily divisible\ninto stages for completion, the permit will specify interim dates for the\nsubmission of reports of progress toward completion of the interim requirements\nand indicate a projected completion date. (iii)\n\nReporting. The permit will be written\nto require that, no later than 14 days following each interim date and the\nfinal date of compliance, the permittee shall notify the commissioner, in\nwriting, of its compliance or noncompliance with the interim or final\nrequirements, or submit progress reports if clause (ii)(\nb\n) of\nthis paragraph is applicable. (2)\n\nAlternative schedules of compliance. A\npermit applicant or permittee may cease conducting regulated activities (by\nreceiving a terminal volume of hazardous waste and for treatment and storage\nHWM facilities, closing pursuant to applicable requirements; and for disposal\nHWM facilities, closing and conducting post-closure care pursuant to applicable\nrequirements) rather than continue to operate and meet permit requirements as\nfollows: (i) If the permittee decides to cease\nconducting regulated activities at a given time within the term of a permit\nwhich has already been issued: (a) the permit\nmay be modified to contain a new or additional schedule leading to timely\ncessation of activities; or\n(b) the\npermittee must cease conducting permitted activities before noncompliance with\nany interim or final compliance schedule requirement already specified in the\npermit. (ii)\n\nIf the\ndecision to cease conducting regulated activities is made before issuance of a\npermit the term of which would have included the termination date, the permit\nwhen issued will contain a schedule leading to termination to ensure timely\ncompliance with applicable requirements. (iii)\n\nIf the permittee is undecided whether\nto cease conducting regulated activities, the commissioner may issue or modify\na permit to contain two schedules as follows: (a) Both schedules will contain an identical\ninterim deadline requiring a final decision on whether to cease conducting\nregulated activities no later than a date which ensures sufficient time to\ncomply with applicable requirements in a timely manner if the decision is to\ncontinue conducting regulated activities. (b) One schedule will lead to timely\ncompliance with applicable requirements. (c) The second schedule will lead to\ncessation of regulated activities by a date which will ensure timely compliance\nwith applicable requirements. (d) Each permit containing two schedules will include a requirement that, after the\npermittee has made a final decision under clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph, it must follow the schedule leading to termination if the\ndecision is to cease conducting regulated activities. (iv)\n\nThe applicant's or permittee's decision\nto cease conducting regulated activities shall be evidenced by a firm public\ncommitment satisfactory to the commissioner, such as resolution of the board of\ndirectors of a corporation. (e) Effect of a permit. (1)\n\nCompliance with a permit issued pursuant\nto this Part during its term constitutes compliance, for purposes of\nenforcement, with Parts 370 through 374 and 376 of this Title except for those\nrequirements not included in the permit which: (i) become effective by statute; (ii)\nare promulgated under Part 376 of this\n\nTitle restricting the placement of hazardous wastes in or on the\nland; (iii)\nare promulgated under\n\nSubpart 373-2 of this Part regarding leak detection systems for new and\nreplacement surface impoundment, waste pile, and landfill units, and lateral\nexpansions of surface impoundment, waste pile, and landfill units. The leak\ndetections system requirements include double liners, CQA programs, monitoring, action leakage rates, and response action plans, and will be implemented\nthrough the procedures of section\n373-1.7\nof this Subpart for major\nmodifications; or\n(iv)\nare\npromulgated under section\n373-3.27, 373-3.28 or\n373-3.29\nof this Part limiting air\nemissions. (2)\nA permit\nmay be modified, revoked, and reissued, or terminated during its term for cause\nas set forth in section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
