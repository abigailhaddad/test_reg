  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2104.7 - Subdivision by alteration or remodeling\n\nState Regulations\nA certificate or an order authorizing subdivision shall\nbe issued where the landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of\nhousing accommodations for the immediate purpose of substantially altering or\nremodeling them, provided that the landlord shall have secured such approval\ntherefor as is required by law. No certificate or order authorizing subdivision\ninvolving alteration or remodeling shall be granted under this section unless\nthe administrator shall find: (a) That\nsuch alteration or remodeling is for the purpose of subdividing an\nunder-occupied housing accommodation containing six or more rooms, exclusive of\nbathrooms and kitchen, into a greater number of housing accommodations\nconsisting of self-contained family units which meet the requirements of\nsection\n2100.11\nof this Title. An apartment\nmay be deemed under-occupied when there is less than one occupant for each\nroom, exclusive of bathrooms, kitchen and three additional rooms. Roomers or\nboarders who are not members of the tenant's family shall not be counted as\noccupants. (b) Upon approval of\nplans by the local authorities having jurisdiction thereof, where such approval\nis required, and before proceeding with such alteration or remodeling, application shall be made to the administrator for an order directing the\ntenant occupying such housing accommodation to remain in possession of an\nadequate portion thereof, as determined by the administrator, and to surrender\npossession of the remainder of said housing accommodation, within a time to be\nfixed by the administrator. Where it is not practicable for the tenant to\nremain in possession of a portion of the housing accommodation, the\nadministrator may require the landlord to furnish suitable temporary housing\naccommodations to the tenant during the alteration. The order so granted shall\nbe conditioned on the right of such tenant to first occupancy of any housing\naccommodation resulting from such alteration or remodeling of such subdivided\nhousing accommodation. (c) Where\nthe tenant cannot be adequately housed in any portion of the subdivided housing\naccommodation, the landlord may secure a certificate or an order authorizing\nsubdivision where he shows that he is willing and able to relocate the tenant\nin other suitable housing accommodations within the same city, village or town\nnot unreasonably distant from the premises being altered, and available at a\nrent not greater than the rent now being paid by such tenant. (d) The administrator shall establish the\nterms and conditions under which such alteration or remodeling may be made and\nshall establish the maximum rent to be paid by the tenant occupying such\nsuitable portion of such housing accommodation during the alteration, and shall\nestablish the maximum rent to be paid by such tenant for the first occupancy of\nany housing accommodation selected by him in such subdivided housing\naccommodation after it has been altered or remodeled. The administrator shall, pursuant to section\n2102.6\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, establish the maximum rent on the basis of the maximum rents for\ncomparable housing accommodations after taking into consideration all other\nfactors bearing on the equities involved. The landlord shall file an\napplication under section\n2100.11\nof this Title for an order\nof decontrol; provided, however, that such order of decontrol shall not apply\nto that portion of the original housing accommodations occupied by a tenant in\npossession at the time of the conversion but only so long as such tenant\ncontinues in occupancy. (e) Where\nthe housing accommodation to be subdivided had a maximum monthly rent of $200\nor more as of March 1, 1943, or the date of first renting thereafter, there\nshall be no requirement that the tenant be relocated or given occupancy of any\nof the housing accommodations created by the alteration or\nsubdivision. (f) In the case of\nhousing accommodations in a structure or premises owned by a cooperative\ncorporation or association where the landlord is the individual owner of stock\nallocated to a housing accommodation, no certificate or order shall be granted\nunder this section unless the administrator shall also find that the landlord\nhas met the requirements of section\n2104.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (g) The order in all such\ncases shall grant the landlord permission to recover possession of the housing\naccommodations without further application should the tenant fail to abide by\nthe order of subdivision issued by the administrator.
