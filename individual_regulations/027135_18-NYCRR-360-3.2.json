Such cases must be reported to the local child support\nenforcement unit, as specified in paragraph (f)(3) of this section. (f) Good cause for refusing to\ncooperate. (1)\n\nClaiming good cause for\nrefusing to cooperate. (i) Opportunity to\nclaim good cause. An applicant for or recipient of MA will have the opportunity\nto claim good cause for refusing to cooperate as specified by subdivision (c)\nof this section. (ii)\n\nNotification\nto the applicant or recipient. The MA applicant or recipient shall be notified\nof the right to claim good cause as an exception to the cooperation requirement\nand of all the requirements applicable to a good cause determination. (a) Such notice shall be in writing in a form\nprescribed by the Department of Health. (b) The social services district worker or an\nappropriate designee and the applicant or recipient shall sign and date a copy\nof the notice. A copy of the notice shall be given to the applicant or\nrecipient, and a signed copy shall be filed in the MA case record. (iii)\n\nRequirements upon applicant\nor recipient. An applicant for or recipient of MA who refuses to cooperate, and\nwho claims to have good cause for refusing to cooperate, has the burden of\nestablishing the existence of a good cause circumstance and will be required\nto: (a) specify the circumstances that the\napplicant or recipient believes provide sufficient good cause for not\ncooperating; (b) corroborate the\ngood cause circumstances in accordance with subparagraph (vii) of this\nparagraph; and\n(c) if requested, provide sufficient information (such as the putative father or absent parent's\nname and address, if known) to permit an investigation pursuant to clause\n(vii)(\ng\n) of this paragraph. If the applicant or recipient does\nnot meet the above requirements, the social services district worker or an\nappropriate designee shall on that basis determine that good cause does not\nexist. (iv)\n\nCircumstances under which cooperation is against the best interests of the\nchild. Cooperation in establishing paternity or seeking support shall be deemed\nto be against the best interests of the child only if: (a) the applicant's or recipient's\ncooperation in establishing paternity or securing support is reasonably\nanticipated to result in: (1)\nphysical harm to\nthe child for whom support is to be sought; (2)\nemotional harm to the child for whom\nsupport is to be sought; (3)\nphysical harm to the parent or caretaker relative with whom the child is living\nwhich reduces such person's capacity to care for the child\nadequately; (4)\nemotional harm to\nthe parent or caretaker relative with whom the child is living, of such nature\nor degree that it reduces such person's capacity to care for the child\nadequately; or\n(b) the\nchild for whom support is sought was conceived as a result of incest or\nforcible rape; or\n(c) legal\nproceedings for the adoption of the child are pending before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; or\n(d) the\napplicant or recipient is currently being assisted by a public or licensed\nprivate social agency to resolve the issue of whether to keep the child or\nrelinquish him or her for adoption, and discussions have not gone on for more\nthan three months. (v) Physical harm and emotional harm defined. Physical harm and emotional harm must\nbe of a serious nature in order to justify a finding of good cause. A finding\nof good cause for emotional harm may only be based on a demonstration of an\nemotional impairment that substantially affects the individual's\nfunctioning. (vi)\n\nSpecial\nconsiderations related to emotional harm. (a) For every good cause determination which is based in whole or in part on the\nanticipation of emotional harm to the child, the parent or the caretaker\nrelative, the social services district worker or an appropriate designee shall\nconsider the following: (1)\nthe present\nemotional state of the individual subject to emotional harm; (2)\nthe emotional health history of the\nindividual subject to emotional harm; (3)\nthe intensity and probable duration of\nthe emotional upset; (4)\nthe degree\nof cooperation to be required; and\n(5)\nthe extent of the involvement of the\nchild in the paternity establishment or support enforcement activity to be\nundertaken. (b) The\nfindings with respect to the above factors shall be documented in the MA case\nrecord. (vii)\n\nProof of\ngood cause claim. (a) The good cause\ndetermination will be based on corroborative evidence supplied by the applicant\nor recipient only after the social services district worker or an appropriate\ndesignee has examined the evidence and found it actually verifies the good\ncause claim. (b) The applicant or\nrecipient who claims good cause must provide corroborative evidence within 20\ndays from the day the claim was made. If the social services district worker or\nan appropriate designee determines that the applicant or recipient requires\nadditional time because of the difficulty of obtaining the corroborative\nevidence, upon supervisory approval, the worker or designee shall allow a\nreasonable additional period of time. (c) Good cause may be corroborated with the\nfollowing types of evidence: (1)\nbirth\ncertificates or medical or law enforcement records which indicate that the\nchild was conceived as the result of incest or forcible rape; (2)\ncourt documents or other records which\nindicate that legal proceedings for adoption are pending before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; (3)\ncourt, medical, criminal, child protective services, social services, psychological, or law enforcement records which indicate that the putative father or absent\nparent might inflict physical or emotional harm on the child or caretaker\nrelative; (4)\nmedical records which\nindicate emotional health history and present emotional health status of the\ncaretaker relative or the child for whom support would be sought, or written\nstatements from a mental health professional licensed to practice in New York, indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning the emotional health of the\ncaretaker relative or the child for whom support would be sought; (5)\na written statement from a public or\nlicensed private social agency that the applicant or recipient is being\nassisted by the agency to resolve the issue of whether to keep the child or\nrelinquish him or her for adoption; and\n(6)\nsworn statements from individuals, other\nthan the applicant or recipient, with knowledge of the circumstances which\nprovide the basis for good cause claim. (d) If after examining the corroborative\nevidence submitted by the applicant or recipient, the social services district\nworker or an appropriate designee determines that additional corroborative\nevidence is needed to permit a good cause determination, the worker or designee\nwill: (1)\npromptly notify the applicant or\nrecipient that additional corroborative evidence is needed; and\n(2)\nspecify the type of document\nneeded. (e) Upon\nrequest, the social services district worker or an appropriate designee will: (1)\nadvise the applicant or recipient how to\nobtain the necessary documents; and\n(2)\nmake a reasonable effort to obtain any\nspecific documents which the applicant or recipient is not reasonably able to\nobtain without assistance. (f) Where a claim is based on the applicant's\nor recipient's anticipation of physical harm as specified and defined in\nsubparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this paragraph, and corroborative evidence is not\nsubmitted in support of the claim: (1)\nthe\nsocial services district worker or an appropriate designee will investigate the\ngood cause claim when the worker or designee believes that the claim is\ncredible without corroborative evidence, and corroborative evidence is not\navailable; (2)\ngood cause will be\nfound if the claimant's sworn statement and the investigation which is\nconducted satisfy the social services district worker or an appropriate\ndesignee that the applicant or recipient has good cause for refusing to\ncooperate; and\n(3)\na determination\nthat good cause exists will be reviewed and approved or disapproved by\nsupervisory personnel and the findings will be recorded in the MA case\nrecord. (g) The good\ncause claim may be further verified if the applicant's or recipient's statement\nof the claim required by this subparagraph, together with the corroborative\nevidence, does not provide sufficient basis for making a determination. When\nthe social services district worker or an appropriate designee determines that\nit is necessary, the worker or designee may conduct an investigation of good\ncause claims to determine that good cause does or does not exist. (h) If the social services district worker or\nan appropriate designee conducts an investigation of a good cause claim, the\nworker or designee will: (1)\ncontact the\nabsent parent or putative father from whom support would be sought if such\ncontact is determined to be necessary to establish the good cause claim; and\n(2)\nprior to making such\nnecessary contact, notify the applicant or recipient to enable the applicant or\nrecipient to: (i) present additional\ncorroborative evidence or information so that contact with the parent or\nputative father becomes unnecessary; or\n(ii)\nwithdraw the application for assistance\nor have the case closed; or\n(iii)\nhave the good cause claim denied.

(i) Prior to making a final\ndetermination of good cause for refusing to cooperate, the social services\ndistrict worker or an appropriate designee shall: (a) afford the local child support\nenforcement unit the opportunity to review and comment on the findings and\nbasis for the proposed determination; and\n(b) consider any recommendation from the\nchild support enforcement unit. (ii)\n\nThe worker or designee shall give the\nlocal child support enforcement unit the opportunity to participate in any\nhearing that results from an applicant's or recipient's appeal of any action of\nthe Department of Health under this subdivision. (3)\n\nNotice to the local child support\nenforcement unit. The social services district worker or an appropriate\ndesignee shall promptly report to the local child support enforcement unit: (i) all cases in which good cause has been\nclaimed and a determination is pending; (ii)\nall cases in which there is a good cause\nfor refusal to cooperate and the basis for the determination and whether or not\nchild support enforcement may proceed without the participation of the\ncaretaker relative; and\n(iii)\nall\ncases in which it has been determined there is not good cause for refusal to\ncooperate. (4)\n\nGranting\nor continuation of assistance. MA shall not be denied, delayed or discontinued\npending a determination of good cause for refusal to cooperate if the applicant\nor recipient has complied with the requirement of this subdivision to furnish\ncorroborative evidence and information. (5)\n\nPeriodic review of good cause\ndetermination. The social services district worker or an appropriate designee\nshall: (i) periodically review, not less\nfrequently than at each redetermination of eligibility, those cases in which\nthe agency or an appropriate designee has determined that good cause exists\nbased on a circumstance that is subject to change; (ii)\ndetermine if circumstances have changed\nto the extent that good cause no longer exists. If so, the worker or designee\nshall rescind the findings; and\n(iii)\ngive prompt notification to the child\nsupport enforcement unit of every change in determination of good cause, as\nrequired by subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (6)\n\nRecordkeeping. Social services districts\nshall maintain records of the activities under this subdivision as prescribed\nby the Department of Health. (7)\n\nEnforcement without the caretaker's cooperation. (i) If a determination of good cause is made\non the basis of the circumstances specified above, a determination shall also\nbe made of whether or not child support enforcement could proceed without risk\nto the child or caretaker relative if the enforcement or collection activities\ndid not involve their participation. (ii)\n\nThis determination shall be in writing, contain the agency's or its designee's finding and basis for determination, and\nbe entered into the MA case record. (iii)\n\nIf the social services district worker\nor an appropriate designee excuses cooperation but determines that the child\nsupport enforcement unit may proceed to establish paternity or enforce support, the worker or designee shall notify the applicant or recipient to enable such\nindividual to withdraw his or her application for assistance or have the case\nclosed. (iv)\n\nIn the process of\nmaking a determination under this paragraph, the social services district\nworker or an appropriate designee shall afford the child support enforcement\nunit the opportunity to review and comment on the findings and basis for the\nproposed determination, and consider any recommendation from the child support\nenforcement unit. (8)\n\nFinal determination of good cause for refusal to cooperate. (i) The social services district worker or an\nappropriate designee will make the final determination that good cause does or\ndoes not exist. Such determination shall: (a) be in writing; (b) contain the\nfindings and basis for the determination; and\n(c) be entered in the MA case\nrecord. (ii)\n\nThe\ndetermination shall be made within 30 days from the day the good cause claim is\nmade. (iii)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict worker or an appropriate designee may exceed the 30-day period when\nthe case record documents that additional time is needed because the\ninformation required to verify the claim cannot be obtained within 30 days or\nthe claimant did not provide corroborative evidence within 20 days. (iv)\n\nIf the social services district worker\nor an appropriate designee determines good cause does not exist: (a) the applicant or recipient will be so\nnotified and afforded the opportunity to cooperate, withdraw the application\nfor assistance, or have the case closed; and\n(b) continued refusal to cooperate will\nresult in sanctioning the applicant or recipient.
