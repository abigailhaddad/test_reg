  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 112.2 - Modifications increasing Federal adjusted gross income\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 606(g)(9), 606(l)(3), 612(b), 617-a\n\nThe following items are to be added to Federal adjusted gross income in determining the New York adjusted gross income of a resident individual: (a) Interest income on obligations of any state, other than New York State, or of a political subdivision of any such other state (including that part of an exempt-interest dividend, as described in section\n852[b][5]\nof the Internal Revenue Code, paid by a regulated investment company which is derived from any such obligations), unless created by compact or agreement to which New York State is a party, to the extent not properly includible in Federal adjusted gross income. (See section 612[b][1] of the Tax Law.)\n\nExample: Interest income received by a resident individual on bonds of the State of California must be added to such individual's Federal adjusted gross income in arriving at such individual's New York adjusted gross income, as this interest income is subject to New York State personal income tax, but not to Federal income tax. (b) Interest or dividend income on obligations or securities of any authority, commission or instrumentality of the United States, which the laws of the United States exempt from Federal income tax but not from state income taxes. (See section 612[b][2] of the Tax Law.)\n(c) Income taxes. (1)\n\nGeneral. Income taxes imposed by New York State or any other taxing jurisdiction, to the extent deductible in determining Federal adjusted gross income and not credited against Federal income tax. (See section 612[b][3] of the Tax Law.)\n\nExample: Where New York City unincorporated business income tax was deducted in determining Federal adjusted gross income, the amount of such tax must be added to Federal adjusted gross income, since income taxes are not deductible for New York State personal income tax purposes. Where, however, a particular tax is not deducted in determining Federal adjusted gross income but is credited against the amount of Federal income tax, no addition is necessary. For example, where the amount of foreign income tax is credited against the total Federal income tax of a taxpayer, no modification need be made for the amount of such income tax credit since it was not deducted in determining Federal adjusted gross income. (2)\n\nShareholders of S corporations. In the case of a shareholder of an S corporation, (i) where the election provided for in section\n660 (a)\nof the Tax Law is in effect, with regard to the taxes imposed upon or payable by such S corporation, the term\nincome taxes\nas used in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall include the Franchise Tax on Business Corporations imposed under article 9-A of the Tax Law, regardless of the measure of such tax; (ii) where the election provided for in section\n660 (a)\nof the Tax Law is in effect, or where such election cannot be made, such term\nincome taxes\nshall not otherwise include any taxes imposed by this State or any other state of the United States, or any political subdivision of this State (\ne.g., the New York City General Corporation Tax under chapter 6 of title 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York) or any other state, or the District of Columbia imposed upon or payable by such S corporation. (d) Interest expense on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry obligations or securities whose interest income is exempt from New York State personal income tax, to the extent that such interest expense is deductible in determining Federal adjusted gross income. (See section 612[b][4] of the Tax Law.)\n\nExample: A dealer in United States securities borrowed $100,000 from a bank to purchase a new issue of United States Treasury certificates for ultimate sale to such dealer's customers. In determining his Federal adjusted gross income, such dealer includes the interest income received on these certificates and deducts as a business expense the interest payable on the bank loan. However, the interest income received on the certificates is not subject to New York State personal income tax and is subtracted from Federal adjusted gross income in determining New York adjusted gross income (see section\n112.3\n[a]\nof this Part). Conversely, the interest expense incurred on the bank loan used to purchase these certificates is not deductible for purposes of New York State personal income tax and must be added to Federal adjusted gross income in computing New York adjusted gross income. (e) (1)\n\nExpenses paid or incurred during the taxable year for: (i) the production or collection of income which is exempt from New York State personal income tax; or\n(ii)\nthe management, conservation or maintenance of property held for the production of such income; and\n(2)\n\nThe amortizable bond premium for the taxable year on any bond the interest income on which is exempt from New York State personal income tax; to the extent such expenses and premiums are deductible in determining Federal adjusted gross income. Expenses, and amortizable bond premiums otherwise allowable, which are directly attributable to any class of income (either taxable or exempt for New York State personal income tax purposes) must be allocated to the class to which they relate, and if an item of expense or premium is attributable to both taxable and exempt income, a reasonable portion thereof, based on all facts and circumstances, must be allocated to each class. (See section 612[b][5] of the Tax Law.)\n\nExample 1: A dealer in United States and municipal securities received $20,000 of interest income on United States bonds (fully taxable for Federal income tax purposes) and $30,000 of interest income on state and local bonds, $5,000 of which represented interest income on bonds issued by the City of New York. Expenses of the taxpayer (other than interest expense) attributable to the production and collection of such interest income amounted to $7,500, consisting of $1,500 attributable to the United States bond interest income, $4,500 attributable to the state and local bond interest income, and $1,500 attributable to both types of interest income. In determining Federal adjusted gross income, the taxpayer included the interest income on the United States bonds and deducted as business expenses the collection expenses of $7,500. For New York State personal income tax purposes, the modifications based on the foregoing income and expense items which are to be made in determining New York adjusted gross income are as follows: 1. The $20,000 of interest income on United States bonds is to be subtracted from Federal adjusted gross income (see section\n112.3\n[a]\nof this Part). 2. The $25,000 of interest income on state and local bonds, other than the New York City bonds, is to be added to Federal adjusted gross income (see subdivision[a] of this section). 3. In accordance with this subdivision, expenses in the amount of $3,000 attributable to income exempt from New York State personal income tax are to be added to Federal adjusted gross income. The amount of expenses allocated to such exempt income is computed in the following manner: Expenses allocated to Federal bond interest\n\nExpenses allocated to state and local bond interest\n\nDirect expense\n$1,500\n$4,500\n\nIndirect expense\nprorated $1,500 ×\n$20,000\n$50,000 =\n600\n$1,500 ×\n$30,000\n$50,000 =\n900\n\nTotal\n$2,100\n$5,400\n\nApportionment of expense allocated to state and local bond interest\n\nAllocable to New York City bond interest: $ 5,000\n× $5,400 =\n$900\n$30,000\n\nAllocable to other than New York City bond interest: $25,000\n× $5,400 =\n$4,500\n$30,000\n\nAllocable to exempt income\n\nExpense allocable to Federal bond interest as above\n$2,100\n\nExpense allocable to New York City bond interest as above\n900\n\nTotal allocable to exempt bond interest\n$3,000\n\nExample 2: An individual engaged in business as a building contractor owns United States bonds which such individual regularly posts as security in lieu of performance bonds to guarantee completion of contracts entered into in the course of such individual's business. When such bonds are purchased at a premium, it is the taxpayer's regular practice to amortize the bond premium in accordance with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. Under these circumstances, the amortization of bond premium is deductible in arriving at Federal adjusted gross income since it is a deduction attributable to a trade or business. Since the interest income on the bonds involved is not subject to New York State personal income tax and is subtracted from Federal adjusted gross income in determining New York adjusted gross income (see section\n112.3\n[a]\nof this Part), the taxpayer is required to add to Federal adjusted gross income the amount of any deduction for amortization of bond premium reflected therein with respect to the tax-exempt United States bonds. (f) (1)\n\nThe amounts required by sections\n612 (g)(1) and (6)\nof the Tax Law (see section\n112.7\n[a][1][ii]\nand\n112.7\n[a][2]\nof this Part) to be added to Federal adjusted gross income where a taxpayer has exercised the election to claim the optional modifications for depreciation.
