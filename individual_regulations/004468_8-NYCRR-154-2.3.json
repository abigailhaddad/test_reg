Each school district shall implement the following\nidentification process and steps to determine if a student is an English\nlanguage learner upon a student's initial enrollment or reentry in a New York\n\nState public school. If, after the completion of any step, it is determined\nthat a student is not an English language learner, the remaining steps of the\ninitial enrollment and/or reentry process shall not be completed. (1)\n\nStep 1. Administration of the home\nlanguage questionnaire by qualified personnel as defined in section\n154-2.2\n(u) of this\n\nSubpart to parents or persons in parental relation to determine if a language\nother than English is spoken at home.

(3)\n\nStep 3. Students who have\na disability, follow a process, as specified in Subpart 154-3 of this Part, to\ndetermine whether the student shall take the statewide English language\nproficiency identification assessment and whether the student should be\nidentified as an English language learner. (4)\n\nStep 4. Administration of a statewide\n\nEnglish language proficiency identification assessment as prescribed by the\ncommissioner, except for such students defined in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision for whom it has determined that such assessment is not\nappropriate.

For students enrolling in kindergarten for the\nstart of classes in September, the statewide English language proficiency\nidentification assessment may not be administered before June 1st. (8)\n\nDistricts must complete all steps of the\nidentification process in this section prior to the student's final placement\nin a school. A student shall be provisionally placed in a school until the\nidentification process is completed.

(2)\n\nEach school district shall maintain all\ndocuments related to the initial identification and any subsequent review\nprocess, including the home language questionnaire, English language\nproficiency identification assessment results, and any other records generated\nas part of the identification process and review process as defined in\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. Such information shall be maintained\nas part of the student's cumulative record. (d) Program requirements. Each school district shall provide either a bilingual\neducation or English as a new language program to students identified as\n\nEnglish language learners. Each school district shall implement bilingual\neducation and/or English as a new language programs with fidelity to the\nrequirements of this Part and in accordance with guidance prescribed by the\ncommissioner. (1)\n\nAnnual estimate of\nenrollment of English language learners by school and grade. Each school\ndistrict shall, by such date before the end of the current school year as\ndetermined by the commissioner, and in such format as determined by the\ncommissioner, annually prepare and submit to the commissioner and make widely\navailable through public means, which may include, but not be limited to\nposting on the Internet, distribution through the media, and distribution\nthrough public agencies, an estimate of the number of English language learners\nwho are expected to be enrolled in each school and in each grade within each\nschool, as well as the number of English language learners in the district who\nspeak the same home language, in the following school year. Such annual\nestimate shall be based on the previous three years of enrollment data for\n\nEnglish language learners by school, grade and home language. (2)\n\nEach school district in which the sum of\neach school's annual estimate of enrollment of English language learners equals\n20 or more English language learners of the same grade level, all of whom have\nthe same home language that is other than English, shall provide a sufficient\nnumber of bilingual education programs in the district in the following school\nyear, such that there are bilingual education programs available in the\ndistrict for at least 70 percent of the estimated English language learners\nstudents who share the same home language other than English and grade level\ndistrictwide. (3)\n\nEach school\ndistrict shall place any new bilingual education programs required by paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision in a school that has not been identified as a school\nunder registration review or as a focus or priority school pursuant to Part 100\nof this Title, if such school exists in the district. If a school that has not\nbeen so identified does not exist or does not have the physical space for the\nnew bilingual education program, the district must submit a justification, in a\nform and according to such timeline as prescribed by the commissioner, and\nreceive approval from the commissioner to place the new bilingual education\nprogram(s) in a focus school or in a priority school if no focus school exists\nin the district. In the case of New York City, in the event that a priority\nschool is the only option for placement of a new bilingual education program, the district shall open the program but give parents or persons in parental\nrelation the option to transfer their child to a bilingual education program in\na school that has not been identified as a school under registration review or\nas a focus or priority school pursuant to Part 100 of this Title in a\nneighboring community school district. In all such cases where the opportunity\nto transfer to another school is offered, the student shall be provided\ntransportation in accordance with Education Law section 3635 and/or district\npolicy as applicable. (4)\n\nEach\nschool district that has an annual estimate of enrollment of English language\nlearners in which 20 or more English language learners of the same grade level\nassigned to a school, all of whom have the same home language that is other\nthan English, shall provide such students with a bilingual education program at\nthat school in the following school year. (5)\n\nEach English language learner shall be\nprovided the opportunity to transfer to another school in the district that\noperates a bilingual education program that serves the same grade level and\nlanguage, if such bilingual education program does not exist in the school in\nwhich the student is enrolled. In all such cases where the opportunity to\ntransfer to another school is offered, the student shall be provided\ntransportation in accordance with Education Law section 3635 and/or district\npolicy as applicable. (6)\nA\ndistrict may seek permission on an annual basis from the commissioner for a\none-year exemption from providing bilingual education programs required by\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision in languages that are the home language of\nless than five percent of the statewide English language learner population. A\ndistrict may seek permission for such exemption for no more than five\nconsecutive school years, if the district demonstrates that: (i) the district does not have qualified\nstaff to operate a bilingual education program in that language for all\neligible students at either the district level or at one or more schools that\nare required to offer a bilingual program; or\n(ii)\nthe district overestimated the number of\n\nEnglish language learners in that language who would be enrolled in the\ndistrict or a school who are in the same grade and speak the same home language\nsuch that the actual number of such students is fewer than\n20. (7)\n\nIn order to\nqualify for a one-year exemption from providing such bilingual education\nprogram in languages that are spoken by less than five percent of the statewide\n\nEnglish language learner population, a district must submit, in such format and\naccording to such timeline, as may be prescribed by the commissioner, for\napproval: (i) evidence demonstrating the\nefforts that the district made to recruit qualified bilingual teachers in the\nlanguages that are spoken by less than five percent of the total statewide\n\nEnglish language learner population and the plans that the district and the\nschool, as applicable, has for ongoing and intensive efforts to recruit\nqualified bilingual teachers in that language, or evidence of the number of\n\nEnglish language learners enrolled in a school by grade and home language and\nthe district class size averages compared to the class size averages that would\nbe required to operate a bilingual education program for which an exemption is\nsought; (ii)\na plan for how the\ndistrict will provide alternate home language supports in the form of bilingual\nteacher assistants/aides and/or heritage language programs, as defined by the\ncommissioner, and make such home language supports available for all students\nwho would otherwise be enrolled in a bilingual education\nprogram. (8)\n\nUpon a\nfinding that the district has made adequate efforts to recruit bilingual\nteachers, has developed a plan to intensify its recruitment efforts, and will\nimplement satisfactory alternate home language supports for students for whom\nthe district would otherwise be required to provide a bilingual education\nprogram, the commissioner may grant a one-year exemption to the school district\nfrom the requirement to provide a bilingual education program. (9)\n\nAn English as a new language program must\nbe provided to all English language learners who are not served by a bilingual\neducation program. (10)\n\nIn\ninstances where the commissioner has determined that a school district has\ndemonstrated a pattern in its annual estimate of enrollment of English language\nlearners of consistent underestimation of enrollment at the district or school\nlevel of English language learners in the same grade and who spoke the same\nhome language, the commissioner may direct the school district to establish\nbilingual education programs as the commissioner deems necessary to ensure that\nappropriate opportunities to participate in bilingual education programs are\nprovided to English language learners. (e) Program continuity. Each district shall provide program continuity such that\nall students designated as English language learners can continue to receive\nthe program type (\ni.e., bilingual education or English as a\nnew language) in which they were initially enrolled, as long as the students\nremain designated as English language learners and, in the case of a bilingual\neducation program, there were at least 15 students enrolled in a grade in such\nprogram in the district the prior school year. (f) Parental notification and\ninformation. (1)\n\nThe parent or other\nperson in parental relation of a student designated as an English language\nlearner who is a new entrant, as defined in section\n117.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, shall be provided a high quality orientation session on the State\nstandards, assessments, and school expectations for English language learners, as well as the program goals and requirements for bilingual education and\n\nEnglish as a new language programs, as prescribed by the commissioner. Such\norientation shall occur prior to a student's enrollment in a program provided\nthat a student shall not be withheld from timely program placement if a parent\nor person in parental relation does not attend an orientation session. Such\norientation shall be provided in a language or mode of communication that the\nparent or person in parental relation best understands. (2)\n\nFollowing such orientation, the parent or\nother person in parental relation of a student designated as an English\nlanguage learner shall be notified, in English and the language or mode of\ncommunication the parent or other person in parental relation best understands, that, where available, bilingual education shall be the default program. Such\nnotice must also indicate that a parent or person in parental relation may\ndirect that his or her child be placed in an English as a new language program\nif the parent or person in parental relation does not want his or her child to\nbe enrolled in a bilingual education program. (i) The notification shall explain the goals\nand purpose of bilingual education and English as a new language programs\navailable in the district. (ii)\n\nThe\nnotification shall state that the student will receive all required core\ncontent in all programs offered, and that participation in a bilingual\neducation or English as a new language program will not restrict the student's\naccess to extracurricular activities offered by the school or\ndistrict. (iii)\n\nIn a school that is\nnot required to provide a bilingual education program, parents or persons in\nparental relation shall be notified of the option of transferring their child\nto a school within the district, provided such program is available at another\nschool, pursuant to paragraph (d)(5) of this section. In New York City, such\nnotification shall also inform parents or persons in parental relation of the\nright to transfer to a bilingual education program in a school that has not\nbeen identified as a school under registration review or as a focus or priority\nschool pursuant to paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Such notifications of the\nright to transfer must also indicate that transportation will be provided to a\nstudent who transfers in accordance with Education Law section 3635 and/or\ndistrict policy as applicable. (iv)\n\nIn a school where the number of eligible students requires that a bilingual\neducation program be provided, but the school has been granted an exemption\npursuant to paragraphs (d)(8) and (9) of this section, the notification must\nexplain how the school will offer to support home language as defined in\nsubparagraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section, and provide a summary of its plans for\ninstituting a bilingual education program the following school\nyear. (3)\n\nUpon\nnotification of the parent or person in parental relation, the school district\nshall provide the parent or person in parental relation 10 school days to sign\nand return to the district a statement that the parent or person in parental\nrelation is either in agreement with the child being placed in a Bilingual\n\nEducation program or directs the district to place the child in an English as a\n\nNew Language program. If a parent or person in parental relation does not\nreturn the signed notification form within 10 school days of receiving the\nnotice, the student shall be placed in a Bilingual Education program if there\nis one in the school that serves the grade and home language spoken by the\nstudent or in an English as a New Language program if the school is not\nrequired to provide a Bilingual Education program. In the event that a parent\nor person in parental relation does not return the signed notification form\nwithin 10 school days, the parent or person in parental relation shall retain\nthe right to make a final decision regarding the placement of their child in a\n\nBilingual Education or English as a New Language program. (4)\n\nIf a student is placed in an English as a\nnew language program because the parent or person in parental relation\nrequested that the student not be placed in a bilingual education program or\nbecause the parent or person in parental relation did not make a choice and the\nschool was not required to open a bilingual education program pursuant to\nparagraph (d)(4) of this section, the parents or persons in parental relation\nshall be notified, in a language or mode of communication they best understand, that they retain the right to transfer their child to a bilingual education\nprogram and that transportation will be provided in accordance with Education\n\nLaw section 3635 and/or district policy as applicable. (5)\n\nSchool districts shall individually meet\nwith the parents or persons in parental relation of English language learners\nat least once a year, in addition to parent-teacher conferences, quarterly\nprogress meetings or other such scheduled meetings provided for parents or\npersons in parental relation of all students, to discuss the goals of the\nprogram, their child's language development progress, their child's English\nlanguage proficiency assessment results, and language development needs in all\ncontent areas. This additional meeting shall include all school staff necessary\nto sufficiently inform the parents or persons in parental relation about the\nchild's language development in all content areas in English and in the child's\nhome language in the case of students enrolled in a bilingual education\nprogram. Such meeting shall be conducted with a qualified\ninterpreter/translator in the language or mode of communication the parent or\nperson in parental relation best understands. School districts shall determine\nthe manner and form of such individual parent meetings, in accordance with\nlocal collective bargaining agreements. (6)\n\nEach school district shall maintain\nrecords of signed notices of parents and persons in parental relation that\nindicate program selection as well as orientation session agendas and sign in\nsheets for such orientations. In the event that a parent or person in parental\nrelation does not indicate a program choice, such information shall be recorded\nby the district. All such information must be accessible at all times that\nschool is open for school staff. Signed notices of parents and persons in\nparental relation that indicate program selection shall be included in the\nstudent's cumulative record. (g) Placement.

(3)\n\nNotwithstanding the\nprovisions of this subdivision, where exigent circumstances exist, as\nidentified by the commissioner, the commissioner may allow school districts to\nseek an extension of the 10-day timeline prescribed in this subdivision\nprovided, however, that such extension to the 10-day timeline shall not exceed\n20 additional days. A school district seeking such extension shall submit an\nextension request, in such format and according to such timeline as prescribed\nby the commissioner, that includes evidence that the exigent circumstances are\nimpacting such district's ability to meet the 10-day\ntimeline.
