  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17§ 1.0 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Department\nof Transportation policy. A free society is characterized by government which\nis responsive and responsible to the public, and a public that is aware of\ngovernment actions. The more open a government is with its citizenry, the\ngreater the understanding and participation of the public in government. The\npeople's right to know the processes of government decisionmaking and the\ndocuments and statistics leading to determination is basic in our society. The\ngovernment is the people's business; and the public, individually and\ncollectively and represented by a free news media, should have unimpaired\naccess to government records. It is, therefore, the policy of the Department of\n\nTransportation to make its records an open book in accordance with the\nprovisions of article 6 of the Public Officers Law and of these\nregulations. (b) Categories of\nrecords to which access may be denied. Under the terms of the Freedom of\n\nInformation Law, all Department of Transportation records, i.e., any records\nheld or produced with or for this department, are available for inspection and\ncopying, with the reservation that the department may deny access to certain\nrecords or parts of records if, and only if: (1)\nthey are specifically exempted from\ndisclosure by State and Federal statute; (2)\ndisclosure would constitute an\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy under the provisions of subdivision 2\nof section\n89\nof the\n\nPublic Officers Law. This would include employment, medical or credit\nhistories; personal references of applicants for employment; sale or release of\nlist of names and addresses if the lists would be used for commercial or fund\nraising purposes; information of a personal nature which is not relevant to the\ndepartment's ordinary work and would result in economic or personal hardship to\nthe person. This would not include records in cases where identifying details\nare deleted; the person who is the subject of the record consents in writing to\nits disclosure; or the person who is the subject of the record desires a\ncopy; (3)\ndisclosure would impair\npresent or imminent contract awards, or collective bargaining\nnegotiations; (4)\nthey are trade\nsecrets or are maintained for the regulation of commercial enterprise which, if\ndisclosed, would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the\nsubject enterprise; (5)\nthey are\ncompiled for law enforcement purposes and which, if disclosed, would: (i) interfere with law enforcement\ninvestigations or judicial proceedings; (ii)\ndeprive a person to a right of a fair\ntrial or impartial adjudication; (iii)\nidentify a confidential source or\ndisclose confidential information relating to a criminal investigation; and\n(iv)\nreveal criminal\ninvestigative techniques or procedures, except routine techniques and\nprocedures; (6)\ndisclosure would endanger the life or safety of any person; (7)\nthey are inter-agency or intra-agency\nmaterials which are not: (i) statistical or\nfactual tabulations or data; (ii)\ninstructions to staff that affect the public; (iii)\nfinal agency policy or determinations; and\n(iv)\nexternal audits, including\nbut not limited to audits performed by the comptroller and the Federal\ngovernment; (8)\nthey are\nexamination questions or answers which are requested prior to the final\nadministration of such questions; and\n(9)\nthey are computer access codes.
