  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 152.8 - New York State income tax returns for periods of less than 12 months\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the case of\nan estate, trust or partnership which was not in existence for the entire 12\nmonths of its normal taxable year, the short period which the taxpayer was in\nexistence during such 12 months is a taxable year for which a New York State\nincome tax return must be filed. Examples of such short taxable years are as\nfollows: (1)\n\nIf a partnership is terminated\nand completely liquidated during its normal taxable year and this results in an\naccounting period of less than 12 months for Federal income tax purposes, such\nperiod is a taxable year for which a New York State partnership return must be\nfiled. (2)\n\nThe first New York State\nfiduciary return of an estate or trust will often be a short- period income tax\nreturn, due to the choice of an accounting period by the fiduciary which is\neither a calendar year or fiscal year. For an estate, the first New York State\nfiduciary return would cover the period from the day following the decedent's\ndeath to the start of the regular tax year selected by the fiduciary; for a\ntrust, the first New York State fiduciary return would cover the period from\nthe date the trust was established to the beginning of the trust's regular tax\nyear, as selected by the trustee. (3)\n\nThe final New York State fiduciary return\nof an estate or trust will in many situations be a short-period income tax\nreturn, due to the termination of administration with respect to the estate, or\nthe termination of the trust, during its normal taxable year. (b) In general, the requirements\nwith respect to the time for filing a short-period income tax return are the\nsame as for the filing of a New York State income tax return or a taxable year\nof 12 months which ends on the last day of the short period; see section\n152.1\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n152.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
