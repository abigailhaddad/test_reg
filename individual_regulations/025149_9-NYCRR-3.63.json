  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.63 - Executive Order No. 63: [Establishing procedures for the letting of State contracts.]\nState Regulations\n(1)\n\nChapter\n883 of the Laws of 1976 created the Job Retention Board, the purpose of which\nis to provide the Governor with a mechanism for granting a preference in the\nletting of State contracts to New York State resident bidders, who have\nsubstantial economic ties with New York State, and who contribute to the\n\nState's economy, where sufficient off-setting benefits will be realized by the\n\nState in terms of State employment and generation of State and local tax\nrevenues. (2)\n\nIn furtherance of\nthis purpose, and in order to assure the effective, fair, and uniform\nimplementation of the mechanism established by chapter 883, the Governor shall, pursuant to subdivision (2) of section 174 of the State Finance Law, recommend\nthe substitution of the bid of a New York State resident bidder only upon the\nunamimous recommendation of the Job Retention Advisory Committee, hereinafter\nestablished, and in accordance with the procedures established by this\n\nOrder. (3)\n\nThe procedures\nestablished by this Order shall apply only to contracts, as determined by the\nappropriate State contracting office, for which: (3)\n(a) the\nlowest responsible bid has not been submitted by a New York State resident\nbidder, as hereinafter defined; (3)\n(b) the\nlowest responsible bid is not for an item substantially manufactured, produced\nor assembled within New York State; (3)\n(c) a\nrequest for preference has been made by submission of a completed preferential\nbidding form; the amount of the bid accompanied by any such request is within\n10 percent of the lowest responsible bid; and such amount is within available\nappropriations; (3)\n(d) payments of the State contract price will\nnot be derived primarily from Federal funds under regulations precluding\npreferential award to a State resident bidder; and\n(3)\n(e) the\ncontract does not cover the procurement of materials, supplies or items, construction activities or any services which have been exempted from this\nprocedure by the appropriate State contracting office because of either the\ncritical and exceptional nature of the subject matter, or the existence of an\nemergency barring any delay in issuance of the award. (4)\n\nThe Commissioner of General\n\nServices shall provide sufficient quantities of the preferential bidding form\nprepared pursuant to section\n163-a\nof\nthe State Finance Law to each State contracting office. The Commissioner of\n\nGeneral Services will also issue and disseminate to State contracting offices\nguidelines in order to assure uniform, orderly and expeditious compliance with\nthe provisions of this Order. (5)\n\nEach State contracting office shall include a copy of the preferential bidding\nform with documents provided to potential bidders on State contracts until\n\nApril 1978, and thereafter each State contracting office shall make such\npreferential bidding forms readily available to all potential\nbidders. (6)\n\nThe appropriate State\ncontracting office shall review any completed preferential bidding form\nsubmitted in connection with a bid, otherwise acceptable pursuant to pertinent\nprovisions of law and regulations, to determine whether the bidder is a New\n\nYork State resident bidder. A New York State resident bidder is one who\ndemonstrates: (6)\n(a) performance of manufacture, production or\nservices within New York State, other than mere marketing, sales or contracting\nrelative to the goods or services to be sold to the State, which generates\nactual employment within the geographic boundaries of the State representing a\ncontribution to the State's economy, as evidenced by the number of persons so\nemployed and their wages, the amount of unemployment insurance tax paid for\nsuch employees per year, and withholding tax participation on behalf of such\nemployees per year; and\n(6)\n(b) payment of local property tax in New York State in an amount greater than\n$1,500 per year, or payment of more than $3,000 per year in rental for space\nwithin New York State used in the bidder's business; and\n(6)\n(c) additional participation in the State's economy, evidenced by payment of other\n\nState and local taxes, purchase on a regular basis of materials, supplies or\nservices from businesses within the State, or similar activity in the State\neconomy. (7)\n\nUpon a determination by a State contracting office that a bid has been\nsubmitted by a New York State resident bidder, the contracting office shall\ndetermine whether the award of the contract (by itself, or in the aggregate\nwhere items are customarily reordered over a period of time), will result in\nman-hour employment which represents a significant percentage of the bidder's\ntotal employment. Upon a finding that the award of the contract will result in\nsuch employment, the contracting office shall immediately advise the\n\nCommissioner of General Services who shall refer the matter to the members of\nthe Job Retention Advisory Committee. The contracting office shall provide the\n\nJob Retention Advisory Committee with all relevant material necessary for the\nreview of bids submitted. (8)\n\nThe\nmembers of the Job Retention Advisory Committee shall consider only bids which\nhave been reviewed by the appropriate State contracting office in accordance\nwith the procedures established by this Order. (9)\n\nThe Job Retention Advisory Committee\nshall consist of the Commissioners of Commerce, General Services, and Taxation\nand Finance, the Industrial Commissioner, the Executive Director of the\n\nEconomic Development Board, and the Director of the Budget. The Commissioner of\n\nGeneral Services shall serve as chairman. (10)\n\nThe members of the committee shall\nreview bids referred by the Commissioner of General Services to assure that the\nprovisions of paragraphs (6) and (7) of this Order have been complied with, and\nto determine whether those extraordinary circumstances required by subdivision\n(2) of section 174 of the State Finance Law have been demonstrated by the\nbidder so as to warrant the initiative by the Governor to recommend that the\nbid of the lowest responsible bidder shall be rejected and the bid of the New\n\nYork State resident bidder shall be substituted. In reaching its determination, the committee shall consider whether such action would best promote the public\ninterest of the State of New York, having taken into consideration the extent\nto which competing bidders have economic ties with New York State and\ncontribute to the State's economy, as well as the impact of such action upon\nthe level of employment opportunities for New York State residents and the\nlevel of New York State and local business and personal tax revenues to be\ngenerated by such action. (11)\n\nUpon\na unanimous finding by the Job Retention Advisory Committee that extraordinary\ncircumstances exist warranting the initiative by the Governor to recommend that\nthe bid of the lowest responsible bidder should be rejected and the bid of the\n\nNew York State resident bidder should be substituted and that such action would\nbest promote the public interest of the State of New York having taken into\nconsideration the extent to which competing bidders have economic ties with New\n\nYork State and contribute to the State's economy, as well as the impact of such\naction upon the level of employment opportunities for New York State residents\nand the level of New York State and local business and personal tax revenues to\nbe generated by such action, the Commissioner of General Services shall\nimmediately notify the Job Retention Board of such determination. (12)\n\nSuch notification shall constitute an\ninitiative and recommendation by the Governor, pursuant to subdivision (2) of\nsection 174 of the State Finance Law, and shall constitute a request by the\n\nGovernor for a meeting of the Job Retention Board, which shall take place\nwithin 10 days thereof, as set by the Commissioner of General\n\nServices. (13)\n\nThe procedure\nestablished by this Order is intended solely to implement the power of the\n\nGovernor pursuant to subdivisions (2) and (3) of section 174 of the State\n\nFinance Law and subdivision (4) of section\n857\nof the Labor Law\nand shall not be construed to alter, supplement or otherwise modify any\npractice or procedure required by law, regulation, or otherwise in connection\nwith the awarding of State contracts.
