The required minimum cohort size\nfor smaller districts (Mount Vernon and Schenectady) is five principal\ncandidates. Projects may enroll more than the minimum in each cohort. However, projects need not enroll a cohort every year. Pilot projects may only admit and\nenroll candidates who do not currently hold SBL certification; (f) provide extended (at least one academic\nyear long) internship learning experiences for aspiring principals that are\ngrounded in a competency-based and well-supervised set of practical\nexperiences. Consistent with the purpose of exposing candidates to the full\nbreadth of knowledge, skills, and experiences involved in leading schools, the\nprincipal-intern shall engage in sustained and rigorous clinical learning with\nsubstantial leadership responsibilities and an opportunity to practice and be\nevaluated in an authentic school setting, consistent with the PSELs. The\ninternship must be designed to encompass the full-day experience throughout the\nregular school year, when students are in session, and may not be conducted\n\"around the edges\" of a candidate's employment; (g) define the qualifications, expectations, and professional responsibilities of mentors and coaches of aspiring principals\nand the role of each partner (IHE, district, and LDP) in assuring high quality\nmentoring/coaching. The program shall also pair each candidate with\nhigh-quality coaching and mentoring support throughout the internship and\ncontinuing through the first full year that the candidate is in the principal\njob; (h) monitor the\nidentification, development, and placement of school leader candidates and\nprovide updates on these candidates to the department so that the department\ncan ensure projects are successfully fulfilling program aims and requirements\nand quantify model impact. The department may specify which data must be\ncollected and submitted by each project for this evaluation to be\nconducted; (i) provide sufficient\nspace and other resources for the effective operation of the project\nactivities; (j) design into the\npilot ways to build sustainability and progressively shift financial\nresponsibility from the candidates and title IIA funding to the partnership. In\nbudgeting and planning for sustainability, the partnership should be certain to\nsupport these established activities through reliable and stable funding\nsources. In budgeting and planning for sustainability, title IIA funds should\nsupport but not serve as the sole source of funding for this work. The\ndepartment will monitor project success, with the intention of registering\nsuccessful programs to continue in operation beyond the pilot grant period if\nthey meet the regulatory requirements established by the department for this\nprogram. If successful, a program may be allowed to expand to include\nadditional school districts and/or other partners; (k) ensure that candidates complete two clock\nhours of coursework or training in school violence prevention and intervention, in accordance with section\n3004\nof the\n\nEducation Law.

However, projects need not enroll a cohort every year. Pilot projects may only admit and enroll candidates who do not currently hold SBL certification; (f) provide extended (at least one academic year long) internship learning experiences for aspiring principals that are grounded in a competency-based and well-supervised set of practical experiences. Consistent with the purpose of exposing candidates to the full breadth of knowledge, skills, and experiences involved in leading schools, the principal-intern shall engage in sustained and rigorous clinical learning with substantial leadership responsibilities and an opportunity to practice and be evaluated in an authentic school setting, consistent with the PSELs. The internship must be designed to encompass the full-day experience throughout the regular school year, when students are in session, and may not be conducted \"around the edges\" of a candidate's employment; (g) define the qualifications, expectations, and professional responsibilities of mentors and coaches of aspiring principals and the role of each partner (IHE, district, and LDP) in assuring high quality mentoring/coaching. The\nprogram\nshall also pair each candidate with high-quality coaching and mentoring support throughout the internship and continuing through the first full year that the candidate is in the principal job; (h) monitor the identification, development, and placement of school leader candidates and provide updates on these candidates to the\ndepartment\nso that the\ndepartment\ncan ensure projects are successfully fulfilling\nprogram\naims and requirements and quantify model impact. The\ndepartment\nmay specify which data must be collected and submitted by each project for this evaluation to be conducted; (i) provide sufficient space and other resources for the effective operation of the project activities; (j) design into the pilot ways to build sustainability and progressively shift financial responsibility from the candidates and title IIA funding to the partnership. In budgeting and planning for sustainability, the partnership should be certain to support these established activities through reliable and stable funding sources. In budgeting and planning for sustainability, title IIA funds should support but not serve as the sole source of funding for this work. The\ndepartment\nwill monitor project success, with the intention of registering successful programs to continue in operation beyond the pilot grant period if they meet the regulatory requirements established by the\ndepartment\nfor this\nprogram.
