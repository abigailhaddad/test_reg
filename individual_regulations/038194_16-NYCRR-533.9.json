Tit. 16 § 533.9 - Billing disputes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every\nwaterworks corporation shall establish procedures whereby any complaint filed\nwith such corporation by any customer thereof in regard to any bill for service\nrendered or any deposit required will be promptly investigated in an\nappropriate and fair manner, with the result of such investigation being\npromptly reported to the complaining customer. Such procedures shall allow the\nacceptance and processing of complaints submitted in simple manner and form. Regardless of whether a notice of discontinuance has previously been sent, the\nutility's procedures shall provide that pending the utility's investigation it\nshall not discontinue service or issue a notice of discontinuance; provided, however, the consumer may be required to pay the undisputed portion of a\ndisputed bill or deposit to prevent discontinuance or the issuance of a notice\nof discontinuance. (b) If, after\nthe completion of such an investigation, the utility determines that the\ndisputed service has been rendered, or that the disputed charge or deposit is\nproper, in whole or in part, the utility may require the full bill or deposit\nor the appropriate portion thereof to be paid; in such event, appropriate\nnotice of the determination shall be given to the customer, and where notice of\ndiscontinuance of service has previously been sent, or is served with the\ndetermination, such notice shall include a statement advising the customer of\nthe availability of the commission's complaint handling procedures. The\nutility's procedures may provide for discontinuance of service if the customer\nfails to pay such required amount after receipt of proper notice, provided that\na customer's service will not be discontinued until at least five days after\nnotice of the utility's determination, where personal service is made upon the\nperson supplied, or at least eight days after mailing of such a notice; and\nprovided further that a customer's service shall not be discontinued, nor shall\na notice of discontinuance be issued, if a complaint regarding a bill or\ndeposit has been made to the commission and the customer pays the undisputed\nportion of any bill for service, including bills for current usage, during the\ncommission's investigation of such complaint, unless the commission shall\notherwise order. (c) The utility's\nprocedures shall provide that, where the complaint procedures of the commission\nhave been invoked and it is determined that the disputed service has been\nrendered, or that the disputed charge or deposit is proper, in whole or in\npart, a customer's service will not be discontinued for failure to pay the\namount found appropriate until at least 15 days after notice of the\ncommission's determination. (d) The\nprocedures required to be established under this section shall be filed with\nthe commission for review.
