  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 182.12 - Incidental take permit issuance standards; conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Before an incidental take permit is\nissued, the department must determine that: (1)\nthe proposed activity is an otherwise\nlawful activity, and the taking of a species listed as endangered or threatened\nin this Part is incidental to, and not the purpose of, the activity; (2)\nthe applicant has submitted to the\ndepartment an endangered and threatened species mitigation plan and an\nimplementation agreement that have been approved by the department in\nwriting; (3)\nthe implementation of\nthe conditions in the incidental take permit and the measures set forth in the\nendangered and threatened species mitigation plan will result in a net\nconservation benefit to the species in question. This determination will be\nbased upon the best scientific and other information that is reasonably\navailable to the department, and shall include the following: (i) consideration of the species' capability\nto survive and reproduce, and any adverse impacts of the taking on those\nabilities based upon: (a) known population\ntrends; (b) known threats to the\nspecies; and\n(c) reasonably\nforeseeable impacts on the species from other related projects or\nactivities. (b) Permit denial. An application for an\nincidental take permit will be denied when the department determines that the\nproposed activity is likely to result in the loss of occupied habitat, loss of\nindividuals, or interference with essential behavior of a species listed as\nendangered or threatened in this Part such that a net conservation benefit\ncannot be achieved. (c) Permit\nterm. The permit term of an incidental take permit issued pursuant to this Part\nwill run concurrently with the duration of an implementation agreement approved\nby the department pursuant to section 182.11(e) of this Part. (d) Renewal. A permittee whose activity may\nresult in an incidental take beyond the period of time covered in the\napplicable incidental take permit or implementation agreement must file for\nrenewal of the permit at least 60 days prior to its expiration. Filing for\nrenewal shall be made by the permittee on forms provided by the department. A\nfiling for renewal shall be subject to the procedures and standards for review\nof an application for a new incidental take permit. (e) Transfer. An incidental take permit\nissued by the department pursuant to this Part may be transferred at the\ndiscretion of the department, provided that the approved implementation\nagreement and mitigation plan are adopted by the new permittee in their\nentirety.
