  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 300.10 - Adjournment of hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If\nthe claimant or his or her attorney or representative fails to appear at the\nfirst hearing, the referee may adjourn the hearing, except that the referee may\ndecide an uncontroverted claim if there be in the file a claim and substantial\nevidence supporting such claim and the referee finds that the information\ntherein is sufficient. The notice to the claimant for the second hearing shall\ninform him or her that such adjourned hearing is being held because of his or\nher failure to appear at the first hearing, and that if he or she or his or her\nattorney or representative fails to appear the case may be decided in his or\nher absence. If the claimant or his or her attorney or representative again\nfails to appear at the second hearing, the referee shall then proceed to make a\ndecision unless he or she finds sufficient basis for further adjournment, which\nreasons shall be noted on the record. Where the claim has been controverted the\ncase may be adjourned and the file referred to the supervising referee for\ninvestigation as to the cause of the claimant's nonappearance. (b) If the employer or its carrier, or a\nspecial fund created under the Workers' Compensation Law, fails to present\nevidence including the testimony of witnesses as directed or scheduled by the\nboard or chair, the referee, upon request of such party, may adjourn the\nhearing and reschedule the case. If the employer or its carrier or a special\nfund again fails to present or submit evidence at the second hearing, the\nreferee shall proceed to make a decision unless he or she finds upon\nextraordinary circumstances shown at such hearing that a further adjournment is\nwarranted. The denial of adjournments under this rule shall not be grounds for\napplication for review to the board. (c) When the employer or its carrier or\nspecial fund desires to produce for cross-examination an attending physician\nwhose report is on file, the referee shall grant an adjournment for such\npurpose. If the physician is not produced at such adjourned hearing, a further\nadjournment shall be granted only when the referee finds there is sufficient\nexcuse for the physician's nonappearance, which excuse shall be noted on the\nrecord and conditioned upon the resort by the employer or its carrier, or\nspecial fund to a subpoena for the next hearing. If such adjournment is granted\nand the physician does not appear, unless extraordinary circumstances are\nshown, the referee shall proceed to determine the claim upon the evidence in\nthe record. The obligation to invoke court action for the enforcement of the\nsubpoena shall be that of the employer or its carrier or special\nfund. (d) Whenever the records in a\nclaim clearly indicate that the claim is not within the jurisdiction of New\n\nYork State the referee may at the first hearing disallow the claim for lack of\njurisdiction and shall state the reasons for his action.
