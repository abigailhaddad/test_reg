Tit. 20 § 529.5 - Diplomatic missions, diplomatic personnel and foreign government-owned enterprises and agencies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Diplomatic missions. Permanent missions to the United Nations and foreign\nembassies and consulates are hereinafter referred to as diplomatic\nmissions. (b) Diplomatic personnel. Foreign embassy and consular officials, certain foreign embassy and consular\nemployees, certain officers and employees of the United Nations, of\ninternational organizations and of permanent missions to the United Nations and\ncertain employees of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs are\nhereinafter referred to as diplomatic personnel. (c) Exemption federally determined. Diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel are exempt from sales and use\ntaxes when they are the purchaser, consumer or user of tangible personal\nproperty or services or when they are the occupant of hotel rooms or a patron\nat a place of amusement, club, roof garden, cabaret or similar place only to\nthe extent of the exemption granted to them by the United States Department of\n\nState or pursuant to the authority granted to the American Institute in\n\nTaiwan. (d) Nature and extent of\nexemption generally. (1)\n\nDiplomatic missions\nand diplomatic personnel seeking exemption from State and local sales and use\ntaxes should apply to the United States Department of State or, in the case of\nemployees of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs, to the\n\nAmerican Institute in Taiwan for the appropriate tax exemption card or other\nproper documentation evidencing their entitlement to and the extent of their\nexemption. (2)\n\nThe United States\n\nDepartment of State or the American Institute in Taiwan will issue the\nappropriate tax exemption card or other proper documentation to diplomatic\nmissions and diplomatic personnel evidencing their entitlement to and the\nextent of their exemption. (3)\n\nTax\nexemption cards and other documentation evidencing entitlement to exemption\nissued to diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel by the United States\n\nDepartment of State or the American Institute in Taiwan will specifically\nidentify the extent of the exemption to be allowed. In general: (i) A tax exemption card with a blue stripe\nwill entitle the individual authorized thereon to exemption at time of purchase\nfrom all sales and use taxes, including hotel room taxes. (ii)\nA tax exemption card with a green stripe\nwill entitle the individual authorized thereupon to exemption at time of\npurchase from all sales and use taxes except hotel room taxes. (iii)\nA tax exemption card with a red stripe\nwill entitle the individual authorized thereon to exemption at time of purchase\nfrom sales and use taxes, including hotel room taxes, on purchases greater than\nthe amount specified on the card (e.g., $50, $100, $150, $200, etc.). (iv)\n\nTax exemption cards may not be used by\ndiplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel to purchase motor fuel or diesel\nmotor fuel exempt from State and local sales and use taxes and motor fuel or\ndiesel motor fuel tax at the time of purchase. Diplomatic missions and\ndiplomatic personnel entitled to exemption from such taxes will receive\nexemption as described in subdivision (i) of this section. (4)\n\nDiplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel who are not holders of tax exemption cards but who are otherwise\ndetermined by the United States Department of State or American Institute in\n\nTiawan to be eligible for exemption from sales and use taxes imposed upon\npurchase of certain tangible personal property or services shall pay tax at the\ntime of purchase and apply directly to the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance for a refund of such taxes paid. See subdivision (k) of\nthis section concerning refund procedures. (e) Purchases of tangible personal property\nand services by diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel. (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise specifically provided\nin subdivision (i) of this section with respect to the purchase of motor fuel\nand diesel motor fuel and in subdivision (j) with respect to the purchase of\nutility services, the following rules are applicable to purchases of tangible\npersonal property and services by diplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel. (2)\n\nDiplomatic missions\nand diplomatic personnel must be the direct purchaser, occupant or patron of\nrecord and payer of record in order to exercise their entitlement to exemption\nfrom sales and use taxes. Direct purchaser, occupant or patron of record for\npurposes of this section means: (i) the holder\nof a valid tax exemption card issued by the United States Department of State; or the American Institute in Taiwan and whose photograph appears on such card; or\n(ii)\nthe holder of such other\nproper documentation evidencing entitlement to exemption as provided by the\n\nUnited States Department of State if any such other documentation is so\nprovided, and does not include any agent or employee of either such cardholder\nor holder of other proper documentation. A diplomatic mission or the diplomatic personnel is the\ndirect payer of record where payment is made by the holder of such card or\nother proper documentation or by the diplomatic mission to which the holder is\nattached, if any, or from the mission's funds, directly to the vendor. (3)\n\nTo make a purchase\nexempt from tax at the time of sale, the holder of a tax exemption card is\nrequired to: (i) furnish the vendor with a\nproperly completed certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions\nand personnel--single purchase certificate or, in the case of charge purchases\nby holders of a tax exemption card with a blue stripe or green stripe, a\nblanket purchase certificate (see subdivision [g] of this section regarding\nproper completion of such certificates); (ii)\ndisplay to the vendor at the time of\npurchase the tax exemption card so that the vendor may (a) record the following\ninformation on every invoice: name of purchaser entitled to exemption, tax\nexemption number on the tax exemption card of the purchaser, (b) verify that\nthe tax exemption card has not expired, and (c) verify that a purchaser making\na charge purchase holds a tax exemption card with a blue stripe or green\nstripe; and\n(iii)\nsign the invoice\nat the time of purchase in the presence of the vendor. Diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel must\npersonally issue a certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions\nand personnel to the vendor and must allow the vendor to compare the\ninformation on the issuer's tax exemption card to the information on the\ncertificate presented. See section\n532.4\nof this Title regarding use of exemption certificates and purchaser's and\nvendor's liabilities. (4)\n(i) Diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel who hold a tax exemption card with\neither a blue stripe or green stripe should furnish vendors with a certificate\nof sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and personnel-- blanket purchase\ncertificate covering the first and subsequent purchase transactions when the\nmethod of payment is by a charge either to an in-house charge account, such as\nan account established with a department store for its customers, or by a\ncharge to a third-party charge account, such as that provided by a bank or\nfinancial services company. Even when a blanket purchase certificate is on file\nwith the vendor, however, each purchase must meet the requirements of\nsubparagraphs (3)(ii)-(iii) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nPossession of a tax exemption card with\na green stripe shall not be the basis for exemption from the tax imposed by Tax\n\nLaw, section\n1105\n(e) on rent for\noccupancy of a room or rooms in a hotel, motel or similar\nestablishment. (iii)\n\nHolders of a\ntax exemption card with a red stripe may not issue a certificate of sales tax\nexemption for diplomatic missions and personnel-- blanket purchase certificate\nunder any circumstances. (iv)\nA\ncertificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and\npersonnel--blanket purchase certificate expires on the date that the issuer's\ntax exemption card expires. (v) A\nholder of an expired tax exemption card must obtain a new tax exemption card\nbefore such holder may issue any new certificate of sales tax exemption for\ndiplomatic missions and personnel to make purchases exempt from tax. (5)\n\nIf the method of payment is by\ncash or cash-equivalent, such as by check or travelers check, a separate, properly completed certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions\nand personnel--single purchase certificate must be given to the vendor for\nevery purchase transaction, including cash or cash-equivalent purchase\ntransactions by the holder of a tax exemption card with a green or blue stripe\nwho has previously furnished the vendor with a blanket purchase certificate in\naccordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision. However, see subdivision (j)\nof this section with regard to the use of a single purchase certificate for the\npurchase of utility services by holders of a tax exemption card with a red\nstripe or a diplomat identification card. (f) Purchase transaction defined. For\npurposes of this section, a purchase transaction means a purchase in one\ncalendar day of one or more items or services from a single vendor, whether or\nnot the services are to be performed in a single day, and covered by a single\ninvoice or bill. See section\n532.4\nof this Title regarding use of exemption certificates and purchaser's and\nvendor's liabilities. (g) Proper\ncompletion and use of exemption certificates. (1)\n\nThe certificate of sales tax exemption\nfor diplomatic missions and personnel is properly completed when it includes\nthe: (i) name of the mission; (ii)\nname of the authorized\nindividual; (iii)\ntax exemption\nnumber on the tax exemption card; (iv)\nexpiration date of tax exemption\ncard; (v) type of tax exemption\ncard issued by the United States Department of State or American Institute in\n\nTaiwan (blue stripe, green stripe or red stripe with dollar\nrestriction); (vi)\nsignature of\nissuer; (vii)\ndate\nprepared; (viii)\namount of\npurchase, if a single purchase certificate; and\n(ix)\nvendors name. (2)\n\nCertificates of sales tax exemption for\ndiplomatic missions and personnel may not be used to purchase motor fuel or\ndiesel motor fuel exempt from taxes, regardless of the type of tax exemption\ncard held by the diplomatic mission or personnel. See subdivision (i) of this\nsection for special provisions related to purchases of motor fuel and diesel\nmotor fuel. (h) Vendor\nrequirements. (1)\nA vendor may not make sales\nexempt from tax to diplomatic missions or diplomatic personnel unless (i) the\npurchaser displays a valid tax exemption card, issues to the vendor a properly\ncompleted certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and\npersonnel and signs the invoice at the time of sale in the presence of the\nvendor; and (ii) the vendor at the time of sale records on each invoice the\nname and address of the purchaser entitled to exemption, tax exemption number\nof the purchaser, and date of sale and verifies that the purchaser is the same\nindividual whose photograph appears on the tax exemption card and that the tax\nexemption card has not expired. In addition to the foregoing, a vendor may not\nmake charge sales exempt from tax to diplomatic missions and personnel unless\nthe purchaser displays a valid tax exemption card with a blue or green\nstripe. (2)\nA vendor must receive a\nseparate certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and\npersonnel--single purchase certificate for every cash or cash-equivalent\npurchase transaction, even if the diplomatic mission or diplomatic personnel\nholds a tax exemption card with a green or blue stripe and such mission or\nperson has previously issued a certificate of sales tax exemption for\ndiplomatic missions and personnel--blanket purchase certificate to that\nvendor. (3)\n\nAt the time of\naccepting a certificate of sales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and\npersonnel, each vendor must, for verification purposes, (i) compare the\nphotograph on the tax exemption card of the issuer of the certificate to the\nindividual presenting such certificate, and find them to be the same and (ii)\ncheck the expiration date on the tax exemption card. If the vendor finds from\nsuch comparison that the individual presenting the certificate is not the\nperson whose photograph appears on the tax exemption card, or if the vendor\nfinds that the tax exemption card has expired, the vendor should not accept the\ncertificate or make sales exempt from tax to such person. (4)\n\nEach vendor accepting a certificate of\nsales tax exemption for diplomatic missions and personnel must, for\nverification purposes, maintain a method of associating sales made to\ndiplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel with the certificate of sales tax\nexemption for diplomatic missions and personnel furnished to the vendor\nconcerning such sales. (5)\n\nEach\nvendor making a sale to diplomatic missions or diplomatic personnel exempt from\ntax pursuant to this section must retain, for the full period required by\nsection\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle, a copy of the invoice, sales slip, statement and any other original\nsales document as well as the exemption certificate issued by the purchaser to\nverify all transactions claimed exempt, including sales where the method of\npayment is by charge to a third-party charge account, such as that provided by\na bank or other financial services company. (6)\n\nVendors have the same obligations to\nretain records relating to sales to diplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel as they do with regard to other tax exempt sales. See Part 533 of\nthis Title with regard to vendor's obligations. (i) Retail purchases and sales of motor fuel\nand diesel motor fuel. (1)\n(i) Diplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel may not purchase motor fuel or diesel motor fuel exempt from tax at\nthe retail level at the time of sale regardless of the type of tax exemption\ncard held by such mission or person. Vendors of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel\nmay not sell motor fuel or diesel motor fuel to diplomatic missions or\npersonnel exempt from the taxes on such fuels at the time of sale. (ii)\n\nIn order for diplomatic missions and\ndiplomatic personnel to receive exemption from the taxes imposed on the retail\npurchase of motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, (a) the United States Department\nof State or American Institute in Taiwan must certify to a major oil company\nwhich issues credit cards that the diplomatic mission or personnel is exempt\nfrom sales and motor fuel or diesel motor fuel taxes and (b) the diplomatic\nmission or personnel must obtain a credit card from such an oil company and\npurchase the motor fuel or diesel motor fuel with such credit card. Retail\npurchases of motor fuel and diesel motor fuel charged to such authorized credit\ncards will be billed to such diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel\nexclusive of sales and use taxes and motor fuel or diesel motor fuel tax as the\ncase may be. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision in this Part, no tax exemption shall be provided nor shall\na refund be granted where diplomatic missions or diplomatic personnel purchase\nmotor fuel or diesel motor fuel by any means other than through the use of an\nauthorized oil company credit card in accordance with this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nDiplomatic\nmissions and diplomatic personnel purchasing tangible personal property other\nthan motor fuel or diesel motor fuel, such as tires, batteries, oil, windshield\nwasher fluid or antifreeze or services such as repairs, from a vendor of such\nfuels must comply with all provisions of this section with respect to the\npurchase of tangible personal property in order to make such purchases exempt\nfrom tax, whether such purchase is made with an authorized oil company credit\ncard or otherwise. (2)\n(i) Vendors which are issuers of oil company\ncredit cards may, in agreement with the United States Department of State or\nthe American Institute in Taiwan, issue authorized credit cards to diplomatic\nmissions and diplomatic personnel, open credit card accounts for such missions\nand personnel, sell motor fuel or diesel motor fuel to such credit card\naccountholders, and bill such missions and personnel exclusive of the sales and\nmotor fuel or diesel motor fuel taxes imposed on such purchases through such\ncredit cards. Such vendors shall be entitled to a refund or credit of such\ntaxes in the amount (a) which they have reimbursed directly or indirectly the\nretail vendor of such fuel or (b) for which they themselves may be liable to\nremit directly to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (ii)\n\nSuch refunds or credits shall otherwise\nbe taken or allowed in accordance with the provisions of Part 560 of this\n\nTitle. (iii)\n\nVendors which sell\nmotor fuel or diesel motor fuel shall maintain records so as to verify the\namounts of refunds and credits for sales and motor fuel or diesel motor fuel\ntax claimed and in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (h)(6) of this\nsection and Part 533 of this Title. (3)\n(i) The\nfollowing provisions of this section do not apply to purchases of motor fuel\nand diesel motor fuel made in accordance with this subdivision: subparagraphs\n(e)(13)(i)-(ii), the concluding undesignated paragraph of such paragraph (3); subparagraphs (e)(4)(i), (ii) and (iv); paragraph (e)(5) and paragraphs\n(h)(1)-(5) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe other provisions of this section are applicable to purchases of motor fuel\nand diesel motor fuel to the extent not inconsistent with this\nsubdivision. (j) Utility services. (1)\n\nDiplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel which have been duly accredited by the United States Department of\n\nState shall be exempt from the tax imposed by subdivision (b) of section\n1105 of the Tax Law upon certain utility\nservices in accordance with the provisions of this subdivision and the other\nprovisions of this section not inconsistent with this subdivision. The\n\nDepartment of State will furnish a list of such duly accredited diplomatic\nmissions and personnel to providers of utility services and to the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. (2)\n(i) Diplomatic missions and personnel, to\nestablish the tax exempt status of their account with a provider of utility\nservices, must display to the provider of such service a valid tax exemption\ncard of a diplomatic identification card issued by the United States Department\nof State Office of Protocol. Holders of a tax exemption card with a blue stripe\nor green strip should also furnish such vendors a certificate of sales tax\nexemption for diplomatic missions and personnel--blanket purchase certificate. Holders of either a tax exemption card with a red stripe or of a diplomat\nidentification card should also furnish such vendors a certificate of sales tax\nexemption for diplomatic missions and personnel--single purchase certificate, which shall be treated as a blanket purchase certificate for purposes of this\nsubdivision only. (ii)\n\nThe holder\nof a tax exemption card with a red stripe is exempt from payment of the tax\nimposed upon utility services regardless of any monetary restrictions noted on\nsaid card and regardless of the amount of any single purchase transaction of\nutility services. (3)\n(i) The provisions of subparagraphs\n(e)(4)(i), (ii) and (iv) and paragraph (e)(5) of this section are not\napplicable to purchases of utility services. (ii)\nA certificate of sales tax exemption for\ndiplomatic missions and personnel issued by the holder of a tax exemption card\nwith a red stripe or of a diplomat identification card for the purchase of\nutility services may be accepted by the vendor of the utility services as a\nblanket purchase certificate regardless of whether payment for such services is\nby cash or cash-equivalent or otherwise. (iii)\n\nVendors of utility services, in order\nto accord exempt status to diplomatic missions and personnel for the purchase\nof utility services, must verify (a) that the purchaser's name has been\nfurnished to the vendor on a list of duly accredited diplomatic missions and\npersonnel provided by the United States Department of State or the Department\nof Taxation and Finance and (b) that the purchaser is an authorized holder of a\ntax exemption card or a diplomat identification card which has not expired as\nof the date of such diplomatic mission or diplomatic personnel opens an account\nand initiates purchase of such services. Once and account has been properly\nestablished as exempt from tax, the provider of utility services may continue\nto provide such service exempt from tax on its periodic billings to such\ndiplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel until notified in writing by the\naccount holder, the United States Department of State, the American Institute\nin Taiwan or the Department of Taxation and Finance that the diplomatic mission\nor personnel is no longer entitled to such exemption. (4)\n\nDiplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel which have been duly accredited by the United States Department of\n\nState to be exempt from the tax on utility services but whose name has not yet\nbeen furnished by such Department to the provider of utility services shall be\nentitled to a refund of taxes paid to such provider from the time of such\naccreditation upon proper application to the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. Any such application for refund should be accompanied by\na copy of the tax exemption card or diplomat identification card issued by the\n\nUnited States Department of State evidencing entitlement to exemption or\nrefund.

Diplomatic missions and\npersonnel entitled to exemption at the time of purchase but who pay tax\nerroneously may also apply to the department for refund of such taxes paid in\nerror. Any such application for refund should be accompanied by a copy of the\ntax exemption card, diplomat identification card or other documentation issued\nby the United States Department of State or American Institute in Taiwan\nevidencing entitlement to exemption or authorizing such refund of tax paid upon\nparticular purchase transactions, together with copies of pertinent sales\ndocuments to verify the transaction and amount of tax paid. See Part 534 of\nthis Title concerning refunds. (l) Nondiplomatic activities. Any diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel\nengaged in a trade, business, occupation or profession beyond their diplomatic\nactivities are subject to tax in the same manner as any other person engaged in\na trade, business, occupation or profession within this State with respect to\nsuch activities. (m) Foreign\ngovernment-owned enterprises and agencies. (1)\n\nForeign government-owned enterprises and agencies are not exempt from sales and\nuse taxes or motor fuel and diesel motor fuel taxes unless so determined by the\n\nUnited States Department of State or pursuant to the authority granted to the\n\nAmerican Institute in Taiwan. Where foreign government-owned enterprises and\nagencies are determined exempt from tax, the provisions of this section shall\napply as far as such provisions can be made applicable to such foreign\ngovernment-owned enteprises and agencies and the vendors from whom they make\npurchases with such modifications as are necessary in order to adapt such\nlanguage to such enterprises, agencies and vendors. (2)\n\nHowever, unless otherwise prohibited by\nthe United State Department of State, such enterprises and agencies are\nentitled to the other exemptions and exclusions generally provided in the Tax\n\nLaw. Example 1:A foreign government tourist or travel office\nwhich furnishes in formation, booklets, pamphlets, etc., about its country\nand/or acts as a full service travel agency (booking reservations on\ntransportation and accommodations) is not exempt from sales and use taxes, unless so determined by the United States Department of State. Example 2:A foreign government-owned steamship line or\nairline is generally not exempt from the sales and use taxes on its purchases, unless so determined by the United States Department of State, but may\notherwise qualify for the exemptions for commercial vessels and commercial\nairlines provided for by section 1115 of the Sales Tax Law.
