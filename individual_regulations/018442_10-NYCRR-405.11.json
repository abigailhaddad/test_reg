  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 405.11 - Infection control\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe hospital shall provide a sanitary environment to\navoid sources and transmission of nosocomial infections and of communicable\ndiseases which may lead to morbidity or mortality in patients and hospital\npersonnel. The hospital shall establish an effective infection control program\nfor the prevention, control, investigation and reporting of all communicable\ndisease and increased incidence of infections, including nosocomial infections, consistent with current acceptable standards of professional practice. The\nhospital-wide infection control program shall be reviewed as frequently as\nnecessary but not less than once per year, and updated as necessary to promote\noptimal effectiveness. (a) Organization. The hospital shall designate an infection control\nprofessional who is responsible for the development and implementation of a\nhospital-wide infection control program. This individual shall be qualified by\ntraining in infection surveillance, prevention and control and also have\nknowledge or job experience in epidemiological principles, infectious diseases\nand infection control practices. (b) Nosocomial surveillance, prevention\nand control. The hospital-wide infection control program shall include\nprocesses designed to reduce the risk of endemic and epidemic nosocomial\ninfections and communicable diseases in patients and hospital personnel. Such\nprocesses shall include methods to: (1)\ncollect and analyze surveillance data including case findings and\nidentification of epidemiologically important nosocomial infections and\ncommunicable disease; (2)\nprevent\nor reduce the risk of nosocomial infections; and\n(3)\ncontrol the spread of infection and\ncommunicable diseases and epidemiologically important organisms. (c) Reporting of infections\nand communicable diseases. There shall be written policies and procedures for\nidentifying, reporting and investigating infections, and communicable disease\nof patients and hospital personnel both community acquired and nosocomial. The\nprofessional responsible for the hospital-wide infection control program shall\nreport to the Department of Health, in a manner specified by the Commissioner\nof Health, any increased incidence of nosocomial infections, as designated in\nsection\n2.2\nof this Title and defined by\nthe department, or nosocomially acquired communicable disease designated in\nsection\n2.1\nof this Title. This individual\nshall also report, immediately, the presence of any communicable disease as\ndefined in section\n2.1\nof this Title, to the city, county, or district health officer. (d) Integration with the quality\nassurance program. The professional responsible for the hospital-wide\ninfection control program shall ensure that all hospital infection control\nactivities are integrated with the quality assurance program required by\nsection\n405.6\nof this Part, including\nidentification, assessment and correction of problems related to infection and\ncommunicable disease control. (e) Infection control education. The hospital shall require compliance with written\nrequirements for orientation and ongoing education programs that are relevant\nto the hospital's infection control program for all personnel whose activities\nare such that they are at risk of directly or indirectly contributing to the\ntransmission of infection or communicable disease from or to patients, other\nhealth care personnel or themselves. (f) Corrective action plans. The hospital shall be responsible for the implementation\nof acceptable corrective action plans related to infection control and\nresulting from problems identified through quality assurance or regulatory\noversight activities and the professional responsible for the hospital-wide\ninfection control program shall report to the chief executive officer progress\nin correcting identified problems. (g) (1) The hospital shall possess and maintain a supply of\nall necessary items of personal protective equipment (PPE) sufficient to\nprotect health care personnel, consistent with federal Centers for Disease\n\nControl and Prevention guidance, for at least 60 days, by August 31, 2021. (2) The 60-day stockpile requirement set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall be determined by the Department as\nfollows for each type of required PPE: (i) for single gloves, fifteen percent, multiplied by the\nnumber of the hospital's staffed beds as determined by the Department, multiplied by 550; (ii) for gowns, fifteen percent, multiplied by the number\nof the hospital's staffed beds as determined by the Department, multiplied by\n41; (iii) for surgical masks, fifteen percent, multiplied by\nthe number of the hospital's staffed beds as determined by the Department, multiplied by 21; and\n(iv) for N95 respirator masks, fifteen percent, multiplied by the number of the hospital's staffed beds as determined by the\n\nDepartment, multiplied by 9.6. (3) A hospital shall be considered to possess and\nmaintain the required PPE if: (i) it maintains all PPE on-site; or\n(ii) it maintains PPE off-site, provided that the\noff-site storage location is within New York State, can be accessed by the\nhospital within at least 24 hours, and the hospital maintains at least a 10-day\nsupply of all required PPE on-site, as determined by the calculations set forth\nin paragraph (2) of this subdivision. A hospital may enter into an agreement\nwith a vendor to store off-site PPE, provided that such agreement requires the\nvendor to maintain unduplicated, facility-specific stockpiles; the vendor\nagrees to maintain at least a 60-day supply of all required PPE, or a 90-day\nsupply in the event the Commissioner increases the required stockpile amount\npursuant to this subdivision (less the amount that is stored on site at the\nfacility); and the PPE is accessible by the facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a\nweek, year round. In the event the Department finds a hospital has not\nmaintained the required PPE stockpile, it shall not be a defense that the\nvendor failed to maintain the supply. (iii) Any PPE stored outside of New York State shall not\ncount toward the facility's required 60-day stockpile. (4) The Commissioner shall have discretion to increase\nthe stockpile requirement set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision from\n60 days to 90 days where there is a State or local public health emergency\ndeclared pursuant to Section\n24\nor\n28\nof the\n\nExecutive Law. Hospitals shall possess and maintain the necessary 90-day\nstockpile of PPE by the deadline set forth by the Commissioner. (5) The Department shall periodically determine the\nnumber of staffed beds in each hospital. Hospitals shall have 90 days to come\ninto compliance with the new PPE stockpile requirements, as set forth in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, following such determination by the\n\nDepartment. Provided further that the Commissioner shall have discretion to\ndetermine an applicable bed calculation for a hospital which is different than\nthe number of staffed beds, if circumstances so require. (6) In order to maximize the shelf life of stockpiled\ninventory, providers should follow the appropriate storage conditions as\noutlined by manufacturers, and providers are strongly encouraged to rotate\ninventory through regular usage and replace what has been used in order to\nensure a consistent readiness level and reduce waste. Expired products should\nbe disposed of when their expiration date has passed. Expired products shall\nnot be used to comply with the stockpile requirement set forth in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision. (7) Failure to possess and maintain the required supply\nof PPE may result in the revocation, limitation, or suspension of the\nhospital's license; provided, however, that no such revocation, limitation, or\nsuspension shall be ordered unless the Department has provided the hospital\nwith a fourteen-day grace period, solely for a hospital's first violation of\nthis section, to achieve compliance with the requirement set forth\nherein. (8) In the event a new methodology relating to PPE in\nhospitals is developed, including but not limited to a methodology by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, and the Commissioner determines that\nsuch alternative methodology is appropriate for New York hospitals and will\nadequately protect hospital staff and patients, the Commissioner shall amend\nthis subdivision to reflect such new methodology.
