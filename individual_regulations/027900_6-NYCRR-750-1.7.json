(b) Dischargers that are not POTWs. Additional application requirements for facilities that\nare not POTWs for individual SPDES permits. Application requirements are set by\napplication forms. Requirements include: (1)\n\nOutfall location. The latitude and\nlongitude to the nearest two seconds and the name of the receiving\nwater. (2)\n\nLine drawing. A line\ndrawing of the water flow through the facility with a water balance, showing\noperations contributing wastewater to the effluent and treatment units. Similar\nprocesses, operations, or production areas may be indicated as a single unit, labeled to correspond to the more detailed identification under paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision. The water balance must show approximate average flows at\nintake and discharge points and between units, including treatment units. If a\nwater balance cannot be determined (for example, for certain mining\nactivities), the applicant may provide instead a pictorial description of the\nnature and amount of any sources of water and any collection and treatment\nmeasures. (3)\n\nAverage flows and\ntreatment. A narrative identification of each type of process, operation, or\nproduction area that contributes wastewater to the effluent for each outfall, including process wastewater, cooling water, and stormwater runoff; the average\nflow that each process contributes; and a description of the treatment the\nwastewater receives, including the ultimate disposal of any solid or fluid\nwastes other than by discharge, including all significant losses of water to\nproducts and atmosphere. Processes, operations, or production areas may be\ndescribed in general terms (for example, dye-making reactor, distillation\ntower). For facilities that are not POTWs, but receive wastewater or storm\nwater from other persons, this information shall include the identity of each\nuser of the treatment works. The average flow of point sources composed of\nstorm water may be estimated. The basis for the rainfall event and the method\nof estimation must be indicated. Where the flow during the permit term is\nexpected to differ from the historical flow, the projected flow must also be\nprovided. (4)\n\nIntermittent flows. If any of the discharges described in paragraph (3) of this subdivision are\nintermittent or seasonal, a description of the frequency, duration and flow\nrate of each discharge occurrence (except for storm water runoff, spillage or\nleaks). (5)\n\nProduction. If an\neffluent limitation guideline promulgated under section 304 of the act (see\nsection\n750-1.25\nof this Subpart) applies\nto the applicant and is expressed in terms of production (or other measure of\noperation), a reasonable measure of the applicant's actual production reported\nin the units used in the applicable effluent guideline must be provided. The\nreported measure must reflect the actual production of the facility as\ndescribed in the application form provided by the department. Where production\nis expected to change during the permit term, the projected changed production\nmust also be provided. (6)\n\nImprovements. If the applicant is subject to any present requirements or\ncompliance schedules for construction, upgrading or operation of waste\ntreatment equipment, an identification of the abatement requirement, a\ndescription of the abatement project, and a listing of the required and\nprojected final compliance dates. (7)\n\nEffluent characteristics. Information on\nthe discharge of pollutants specified in this paragraph must be provided. (i) Analytical methods. When quantitative\ndata for a pollutant are required, the applicant must collect a sample of\neffluent and analyze it for the pollutant in accordance with analytical methods\napproved under 40 CFR part\n136\n(see section\n750-1.25\nof this Subpart). When no\nanalytical method is approved under 40 CFR part\n136, the applicant may request\nthat the department identify available analytical methodologies or use any\nsuitable method but must provide a description of the method. (ii)\n\nIdentical outfalls. When an applicant\nhas two or more outfalls with substantially identical effluents, the department\nmay allow the applicant to test only one outfall and report that the\nquantitative data also apply to the substantially identical outfalls. (iii)\n\nIntake pollutants. The requirements in\nsubparagraphs (vii) and (viii) of this paragraph that an applicant must provide\nquantitative data for certain pollutants known or believed to be present do not\napply to pollutants present in a discharge solely as a result of their presence\nin intake water; however, an applicant must report such pollutants as\npresent. (iv)\n\nSample type. (a) Any mixture of process wastewater and\nstorm water. Grab samples must be used for pH, temperature, cyanide, volatile\norganics, total phenols, residual chlorine, oil and grease, fecal coliform and\nfecal streptococcus. For all other pollutants, 24-hour composite samples must\nbe used. However, a minimum of one grab sample may be taken for effluents from\nholding ponds or other impoundments with a retention period greater than 24\nhours or for discharges that take place over a two-hour or shorter period\nduring any one calendar day. In addition, the department may waive composite\nsampling for any outfall for which the applicant demonstrates that the use of\nan automatic sampler is infeasible and that the minimum of four grab samples\nwill be a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. The\ndepartment may allow or establish appropriate site-specific storm water\nsampling procedures or requirements that are different than those described in\nthis clause, provided that the monitoring results would be sufficiently\nrepresentative for the use of the resulting data. (b) Storm-water only. In accordance with\nrequirements set forth in 40 CFR Part\n122.21(g)(7) (see section\n750-1.25\nof this\n\nSubpart). (v) Representative samples. Effluent characteristics reported in the permit\napplication must be representative of normal operations at the discharging\nfacility. (vi)\n\nPollutants present. An applicant is expected to know or have reason to believe that a pollutant is\npresent in an effluent based on an evaluation of past practices at the site, the expected use, production, or storage of the pollutant as listed on the\napplicant's industrial chemical survey, or on any previous analyses for the\npollutant. (vii)\n\nConventional and\nnon-conventional pollutant monitoring. (viii)\n\nQuantitative toxic pollutant\nmonitoring. Except as provided in subparagraph (x) of this paragraph, each\napplicant must report quantitative effluent monitoring data, from analysis\nperformed by a laboratory certified by the State as able to perform wastewater\nanalysis, for the following pollutants in each outfall containing process\nwastewater: (a) for discharges from processes\nin one or more industry category subject to an effluent limitation guideline in\naccordance with section 307 of the act (see section\n750-1.25\nof this Subpart), priority\npollutants required to be tested in accordance with 40 CFR part\n122\n(see\nsection\n750-1.25\nof this Subpart) for the\napplicant's industrial category; (b) pollutants directly or, by an effluent\nlimitation guideline's express terms, indirectly limited through limitations on\nan indicator in the effluent limitation guideline as set forth in\n40 CFR\nparts\n405-471 (see section\n750-1.25\nof this\n\nSubpart); (c) priority pollutants\nthe applicant knows or has reason to believe are discharged from the\noutfall; (d) other significant\npollutants, subject to department water quality standards or guidance values, with USEPA and/or department approved analytical methods, that the applicant\nknows or has reason to believe are discharged from the outfall; and\n(e) other significant pollutants, with\nUSEPA/department promulgated analytical methods, which the applicant knows or\nhas reason to believe are discharged from the outfall. (ix)\n\nQualitative toxic pollutants reporting. Each applicant must indicate whether it knows or has reason to believe that any\nother toxic pollutants or hazardous substances are discharged from each\noutfall. For every pollutant expected to be discharged, the applicant must\nbriefly describe the reasons the pollutant is expected to be discharged, and\nreport any quantitative data it has for that pollutant. (x) Qualitative monitoring for extremely\ntoxic substances. Each applicant must report qualitative data, generated using\na screening procedure not calibrated with analytical standards, for 2,3,7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) if it: (a) uses or manufactures\n2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4,5,-T); 2(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)\npropanoic acid (Silvex, 2,4,5,-TP); 2-(2,4,5-trichlorophenoxy)\nethyl,2,2-dichloropropionate (Erbon); 0,0-dimethyl 0-(2,4,5-trichlorophenyl)\nphosphorothioate (Ronnel); 2,4,5-trichlorophenol (TCP); or hexachlorophene\n(HCP); or\n(b) knows or has reason\nto believe that TCDD is or may be present in an effluent and is due to or a\nconsequence of activities related to the facility producing the\ndischarge.
