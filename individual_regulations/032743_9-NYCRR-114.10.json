If a cannabinoid hemp product fails, the processor may elect to re-formulate the failing batch to reduce the total\n[DELTA] 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol of the batch to not more than three-tenths of a\npercent (0.3%) total [DELTA] 9-Tetrahydrocannabinol. If the re-formulated batch\nstill exceeds the three-tenths of a percent (0.3%) total [DELTA]\n9-Tetrahydrocannabinol the processor shall destroy the batch in compliance with\nsubdivision (d) of section\n114.7\nof this Part.
