Tit. 12 §§ 56-4.12 - Unsatisfactory clearance air sample results\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the regulated abatement work area clearance air\nsampling results are unacceptable, the following requirements apply: (a) If the results of the inside work area\ngroup of air samples are unsatisfactory, recleaning of regulated abatement work\narea surfaces using wet methods, followed by another drying time period and\nthen collection and analysis of an additional full set (both inside and outside\nwork area samples) of clearance air samples is required (see section\n56-9.2\nof this Part). (b) If only the results of the outside work\narea group of air samples is unsatisfactory, clean-up of surfaces outside of\nthe regulated abatement work area using HEPA-vacuums and wet-cleaning methods\nshall be performed prior to collection and analysis of an additional group of\noutside work area clearance air samples as required by section\n56-9.2\nof this Part. (c) This recleaning/clean-up and sampling\nprocess shall be repeated until satisfactory clearance air sampling results\nhave been achieved for all asbestos project non-exempt regulated abatement work\nareas throughout the entire work site.
