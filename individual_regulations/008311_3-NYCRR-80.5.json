  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 80.5 - Notification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At least 30 but\nnot more than 120 days prior to a payment adjustment and at least 90 but not\nmore than 120 days prior to the expected maturity of a balloon-payment\nmortgage, a lender shall provide the borrower with notice in writing or, where\nthe borrower has consented in advance, via electronic media, of the adjustment\nor of maturity. However, where the loan contract provides that changes in the\ninterest rate shall occur more frequently than changes in the payment, the\nlender need not notify the borrower of changes in the rate, nor of changes in\nthe loan balance or term resulting from a rate change, until notice of a\npayment adjustment is given. (For purposes of notification, either in writing\nor, where the borrower has consented in advance, via electronic media, a\npayment adjustment is considered to occur as of the date of the interest-rate\nchange immediately preceding the due date of the adjusted payment.) In\naddition, where the loan contract sets out a schedule of payment adjustments, notice need not be given of payment changes made pursuant to that\nschedule. (b) In the case of a\nrevolving credit line secured by a junior mortgage, written or, where the\nborrower has consented in advance, electronic notification of payment changes\nneed only be given at the time the adjusted payment is due. (c) With regard to the electronic\ntransmission of notices, a hard-copy of such notice shall be mailed to each\napplicant who indicates that he or she does not have the computer capacity to\ndown-load and print such notice. In those instances in which a hard-copy of the\nnotice is not mailed to the applicant, the lender must be able to demonstrate\nthat information was obtained as to the applicant's computer capacity to\ndown-load and print such notice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n80.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
