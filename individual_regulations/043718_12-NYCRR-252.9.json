Allegations of new\nmatter in the answer shall be deemed denied without the necessity of a\nreply. (b) If the statement of\nfacts supporting any affirmative defense is believed by a charging party to be\nso vague and indefinite that such charging party cannot reasonably be expected\nto address them in an expeditious manner at a hearing, such charging party may, within 10 working days after receipt of the answer, file electronically with\nthe hearing officer a motion for an order directing the responding party to\nfile a verified statement supplying specified information. Such a motion must\nbe served upon all parties simultaneously with its filing with the hearing\nofficer; proof of service must accompany the filing of the motion with the\nhearing officer. The responding party may file electronically a response to the\nmotion within seven working days after its receipt thereof, with proof of\nservice of a copy of the response on all other parties. The failure of a party\nto timely comply with an order of particularization may, in the discretion of\nthe hearing officer, constitute ground for precluding the party from offering\nany evidence as to the matters dealt with by the order.
