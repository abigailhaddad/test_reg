  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 22.5 - Method of valuation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following method shall be used in the valuation of\ninvestments: (a) Investments shall be\nvalued by reference to appropriate valuations applied by a generally accepted\npricing service, or by the methods set forth in this section. All estimates, quotation sheets and valuations used for valuation shall be retained in the\nrecords of the common trust fund. (b) (1)\n\nIn\nthe case of an obligation of the United States, or of an obligation for which\nthe faith of the United States is pledged for the payment of interest and\nprincipal, the trust investment committee may use for the valuation of such\ninvestment the mean of the most recent dealer bid and asked prices appearing\nwithin the five business days next preceding the valuation date in newspapers\nof general circulation published in the City of New York, in standard financial\nperiodicals or in current dealer communications. Obligations of the United\n\nStates which may be redeemable at less than par prior to maturity, or which are\nnot salable without exchange, shall be valued at par. (2)\n\nIn the case of a security listed on a\nnational securities exchange registered under section 6 of the Federal\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934 or on the NASDAQ National Market, the trust\ninvestment committee shall use for the valuation thereof the last reported\nsales price, unless there have been no reported sales within the five business\ndays preceding the valuation date in which event the most recent bid price\nshall be used. For the purposes of this paragraph, reported sales prices and\nbid prices shall be those appearing in newspapers of general circulation\npublished in the City of New York, in standard financial periodicals, or on the\nrecords of a registered national exchange or the National Association of\n\nSecurities Dealers. If the trust investment committee believes that the last\nreported sales price or bid price does not fairly represent the value of the\nsecurity, then the committee may, after expressing that view in writing for its\nrecords along with the reasons for it, use as an alternative, the valuation\nmethod in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nIf neither recorded sales nor bid and\nasked prices are available, and in the case of all investments other than those\nmentioned above, except investments in mortgages, the trust investment\ncommittee shall obtain written estimates of the value of any such investment as\nof the valuation date from not less than two bankers, brokers, dealers or other\npersons qualified in the opinion of the trust investment committee to give an\nopinion as to the value of the investment in question. The average of such\nestimates shall be used. (c) For the purposes of this section, a\nbusiness day shall mean a day when the New York Stock Exchange or the American\n\nStock Exchange is open for business. (d) In the case of investment in any mortgage\nat least 50 percent of which is guaranteed pursuant to the provisions of the\n\nAct of Congress entitled the \"Servicemen's Readjustment Act of 1944,\" as from\ntime to time amended, and in investments in mortgages insured by the Federal\n\nHousing Commissioner, the trust investment committee shall obtain from not less\nthan two bankers, brokers, or other persons qualified in the opinion of the\ntrust investment committee to give an opinion as to the value of the investment\nin question a written estimate of the value of such investment as of the\nvaluation date. The average of such estimates shall be used and each such\nestimate shall be retained in the records of the common trust fund. (e) In the case of investments in other\nmortgages, the trust investment committee shall secure, prior to any valuation\ndate, from not less than two persons qualified in the opinion of the trust\ninvestment committee to give an opinion as to the value of the mortgage in\nquestion a written estimate of the value of such mortgage. At least one of the\npersons making such valuation shall not have participated in the making of the\nlast preceding valuation. The average of such estimates shall be used and each\nsuch estimate shall be retained in the records of the common trust fund. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the trust company shall have\nin its files such a written estimate of value made within one year of the\nvaluation date, such estimate may be used. The real estate securing each such\nmortgage investment shall be appraised at least once every three years by two\npersons, one of whom shall not have participated in the last preceding\nappraisal of such real estate. Such persons shall be appointed by the trust\ninvestment committee and shall, in the opinion of such committee, be familiar\nwith real estate values in the vicinity in which such real estate is situated\nand qualified to make such appraisals. The persons so appointed shall actually\ninspect such real estate and shall so certify in a written certificate of\nappraisal, which shall be filed and preserved in the records of the common\ntrust fund. In preparing a written estimate of the value of any mortgage, due\nconsideration shall be given, by the persons making such valuation, to the last\nwritten certificate of appraisal of the property covered by such\nmortgage. (f) In the case of a\nstock where a dividend has been declared but has not been paid and the amount\nof such dividend has been considered as income under the provisions of the plan\nof operation of the common trust fund, the amount of such dividend shall be\ndeducted from the price of the stock in determining its value unless such price\nshall be an ex-dividend price. (g) An investment purchased and awaiting payment against delivery shall be included\nfor valuation purposes as a security held, and the cash account shall be\nadjusted to reflect the purchase price, including brokers' commissions and\nother expenses incurred in the purchase thereof but not disbursed as of the\nvaluation date. (h) An investment\nsold but not delivered pending receipt of proceeds shall be valued at the net\nsales price. (i) For the purpose of\nvaluation of an investment, except an investment sold but not delivered, it\nshall not be necessary to deduct from the value ascertained as provided above\nbrokers' commissioners or other expenses which would be incurred upon a sale\nthereof.
