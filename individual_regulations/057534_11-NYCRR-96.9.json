Tit. 11 § 96.9 - Accounting requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At the end of each calendar year, each insurer that has established a surplus management account but does not report the account as a separate line of business on the insurer's annual statement shall file a report with the superintendent at the same time as it files its annual statement, consisting of the \"Analysis of Operations by Lines of Business\" page, as given in the annual statement, but modified so as to incorporate a column for the surplus management account \"line\".
