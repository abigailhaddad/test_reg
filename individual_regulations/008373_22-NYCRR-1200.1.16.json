Tit. 22 § 1200.1.16 - Declining or terminating representation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A lawyer shall not accept\nemployment on behalf of a person if the lawyer knows or reasonably should know\nthat such person wishes to: (1)\nbring a legal action, conduct a defense, or assert a position in a matter, or\notherwise have steps taken for such person, merely for the purpose of harassing\nor maliciously injuring any person; or\n(2)\npresent a claim or defense in a\nmatter that is not warranted under existing law, unless it can be supported by\na good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing\nlaw. (b) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer shall withdraw from the\nrepresentation of a client when: (1)\nthe lawyer knows or reasonably\nshould know that the representation will result in a violation of these Rules\nor of law; (2)\nthe\nlawyer's physical or mental condition materially impairs the lawyer's ability\nto represent the client; (3)\nthe lawyer is discharged; or\n(4)\nthe lawyer\nknows or reasonably should know that the client is bringing the legal action, conducting the defense, or asserting a position in the matter, or is otherwise\nhaving steps taken, merely for the purpose of harassing or maliciously injuring\nany person. (c) Except as stated in paragraph (d), a lawyer may withdraw from representing a client when: (1)\nwithdrawal can be accomplished\nwithout material adverse effect on the interests of the client; (2)\nthe client persists in a\ncourse of action involving the lawyer's services that the lawyer reasonably\nbelieves is criminal or fraudulent; (3)\nthe client has used the lawyer's\nservices to perpetrate a crime or fraud; (4)\nthe client insists upon taking\naction with which the lawyer has a fundamental disagreement; (5)\nthe client deliberately\ndisregards an agreement or obligation to the lawyer as to expenses or\nfees; (6)\nthe client\ninsists upon presenting a claim or defense that is not warranted under existing\nlaw and cannot be supported by good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; (7)\nthe client fails to cooperate in\nthe representation or otherwise renders the representation unreasonably\ndifficult for the lawyer to carry out employment effectively; (8)\nthe lawyer's inability to\nwork with co-counsel indicates that the best interest of the client likely will\nbe served by withdrawal; (9)\nthe lawyer's mental or physical\ncondition renders it difficult for the lawyer to carry out the representation\neffectively; (10)\nthe client knowingly and freely assents to termination of the\nemployment; (11)\nwithdrawal is permitted under Rule 1.13(c) or other law; (12)\nthe lawyer believes in\ngood faith, in a matter pending before a tribunal, that the tribunal will find\nthe existence of other good cause for withdrawal; or\n(13)\nthe client insists that\nthe lawyer pursue a course of conduct which is illegal or prohibited under\nthese Rules. (d) If permission for withdrawal from\nemployment is required by the rules of a tribunal, a lawyer shall not withdraw\nfrom employment in a matter before that tribunal without its permission. When\nordered to do so by a tribunal, a lawyer shall continue representation\nnotwithstanding good cause for terminating the representation. (e) Even when withdrawal is\notherwise permitted or required, upon termination of representation, a lawyer\nshall take steps, to the extent reasonably practicable, to avoid foreseeable\nprejudice to the rights of the client, including giving reasonable notice to\nthe client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, delivering to the\nclient all papers and property to which the client is entitled, promptly\nrefunding any part of a fee paid in advance that has not been earned and\ncomplying with applicable laws and rules.
