  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-2.15 - Analysis of aggregate full values\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section shall apply to measurements\nof full value described in sections\n8186-1.15\nand\n8186-1.16\nof this Part. (b) Confirmation of\naggregate full value estimates for assessment rolls implementing revaluation or\nupdates. (1)\nORPTS shall review the valuation\ndata and processes used in a revaluation or update project in order to confirm\nthat the aggregate full value appearing on the assessment roll implementing the\nrevaluation or update represents a reasonable estimate of the aggregate full\nvalue of the assessing unit as of the valuation date of the revaluation or\nupdate. In addition, where sufficient data is available, ORPTS shall conduct\nappropriate statistical tests as provided in the procedures of the appropriate\nmarket value survey to confirm the level of assessment. (2)\nORPTS will perform, as a minimum, the\nfollowing as part of the process to confirm the aggregate full value of the\nassessing unit. (i) For revaluations or\nupdates implemented on assessment rolls with final completion dates on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 1997, ORPTS may review the valuation processes or data as they are\nbeing implemented or compiled. At the conclusion of this process ORPTS may\naccept, in whole or in part, the aggregate full value of the assessing unit\ndetermined through the revaluation or update. (ii)\n\nFor revaluations or updates which ORPTS\nhas not reviewed while being undertaken as provided in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, ORPTS will review the documentation used in the valuation of\nparcels. In addition, ORPTS may review the changes in value which occur between\nthe time of the initial valuation and the final assessment roll implementing\nthe revaluation or update. At the conclusion of this process, ORPTS may accept, in whole or in part, the aggregate full value of the assessing unit. (iii)\n\nFor revaluations or updates implemented\non assessment rolls with final completion dates in 1994, ORPTS will use any\nreview of valuation data which was done as part of the 1994 market value\nsurvey. Where the revaluation or update valuation data was used for the 1994\nsurvey, it will be accepted for use in determining the 1996 full value\nmeasurement. (iv)\n\nFor revaluations\nor updates implemented on assessment rolls with final completion dates in 1995\nor subsequent years, sales may be used to confirm the valuation work in a major\ntype in accordance with the appropriate market value survey\nprocedures. (v) For reassessments\ncompleted in 2001 and later, ORPTS may provide, as described in \"Local\n\nReassessment Project Review and Analysis\" or a similar publication or\nprocedure, for an analysis of uniformity of assessments in each reassessment. This analysis may include, but is not limited to, statistical tests recognized\nby professional appraisal and assessment administration organizations for the\ndetermination of uniformity of assessments. Specific provision shall be made\nfor the recognition of parcels or classes for which a well-defined market does\nnot exist. This analysis shall include a determination of whether the\nreassessment involved sufficient data, accepted valuation methodologies and\nrational valuation judgments. (3)\n\nWhen the aggregate full value from the\nrevaluation or update cannot be used in its entirety, ORPTS may adjust the\naggregate full value or determine an independent estimate of full value. The\nadjustment or independent estimate may be done for the entire assessing unit, a\nset of properties, or an individual parcel. When making adjustments or\ndetermining independent estimates ORPTS may rely upon the use of appraisals, sales or other available data. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
