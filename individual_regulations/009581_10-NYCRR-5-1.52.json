Fecal indicator: E. coli, and/or enterococci, and/or coliphage\n8\n\nUntreated Water from a Ground Water Source\nTTV\nNo fecal indicator in samples collected from raw source water from a ground\n9\nw\n10\nater source., A TTV occurs when a raw water sample is positive for the fecal indicator contaminant and system does not provide and document, through process compliance monitoring, 4-log virus treatment during peak flow at first customer. If repeat sampling of the raw water is directed by the State and all additional samples are negative for fecal indicator, there is no TTV. 9, 13\n\nOther trigger or violation\nTTV\n4\nA TTV occurs when a system exceeds a TTT and then fails to conduct the required assessment or corrective actions. 12\nTTV\n4\nA TTV occurs when a seasonal system fails to complete a State-approved start-up procedure prior to serving water to the public. 14\n1\n\nAll samples collected in accordance with Table 11 footnotes 1 and 2 and Table 11B of this section and samples collected in accordance with subdivision\n5-1.51\n(g) of this Subpart shall be included in determining compliance with the MCL, TTT, and/or TTV unless any of the samples have been invalidated by the State. In accordance with 40 CFR\n141.852(a)(2)\nsystems need only determine the presence or absence of total coliforms and E. coli; a determination of density is not required. 2\n\nTotal coliform method additions or modifications to approved methods. For total coliform (TC) samples collected from untreated surface water or GWUDI sources, the time from sample collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 8 hours and the samples must be held below 10 degrees C during transit to the laboratory. For other TC samples, the time from collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 30 hours. Systems are encouraged, but not required, to hold TC samples below 10 degrees C during transit. If the Total Coliform Fermentation Technique using standard methods 9221A or B is used, and if inverted tubes are used to detect gas production, the media should cover these tubes at least one half to two-thirds after the sample is added. Also, no requirement exists to run the completed phase on 10 percent of all TC-positive confirmed tubes. Additionally, lactose broth, as commercially available, may be used in lieu of lauryl tryptose broth, if the system conducts at least 25 parallel tests between this medium and lauryl tryptose broth using the water normally tested, and this comparison demonstrates that the false-positive rate and falsenegative rate for TC, using lactose broth, is less than 10 percent. If Membrane Filter Technique Standard Methods 9222A, B, and optionally C are used, MI agar also may be used. Verification of colonies is not required. * If the Standard Methods Presence-Absence (P-A) Coliform Test, 9221D is used, six-times formulation strength may be used if the medium is filter-sterilized rather than autoclaved. * If the Total Coliform Membrane Filter Technique, Standard Methods 9222 A, B, C is used, MI agar also may be used. Verification of colonies is not required. * For any TC testing it is strongly recommended that laboratories evaluate the false-positive and negative rates for the method(s) they use for monitoring TC. Laboratories are also encouraged to establish false-positive and false-negative rates within their own laboratory and sample matrix (drinking water or source water) with the intent that if the method they choose has an unacceptable false-positive or negative rate, another method can be used. It is suggested that laboratories perform these studies on a minimum of 5% of all TC-positive samples, except for those methods where verification/ confirmation is already required. Methods for establishing false-positive and negative-rates may be based on lactose fermentation, the rapid test for [BETA]-galactosidase and cytochrome oxidase, multi-test identification systems, or equivalent confirmation tests. False-positive and false-negative information is often available in published studies and/or from the manufacturer(s). 3\n\nThe system must complete a Level 1 assessment as soon as practical after exceeding a Level 1 TTT. The system must submit the completed Level 1 assessment form to the State within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger. Corrective actions shall be addressed in accordance with section\n5-1.71\n(e) of this Subpart. 4\n\nSee Table 13 for public notification requirements. 5\n\nIf any total coliform or E. Coli sample is positive, repeat samples must be collected in accordance with Table 11B of this section. 6\nA Level 2 assessment must be completed within 30 days after the system learns that it has exceeded a trigger. Corrective actions shall be addressed in accordance with section\n5-1.71\n(e) of this Subpart. 7\n\nFor notification purposes, an E. coli MCL violation in the distribution system is a public health hazard requiring Tier 1 notification. At a ground water system, Tier 1 notification is required after initial detection of E. coli or other fecal indicator in raw source water, if the system does not provide 4-log virus treatment and process compliance monitoring, even if not confirmed with additional sampling. 8\n\nFor any fecal indicator sample collected as described in section\n5-1.52, Table 6, the time from sample collection to initiation of analysis may not exceed 30 hours. The system is encouraged but is not required to hold samples below 10°C during transit. 9\n\nIf raw water source sample is fecal indicator positive, the water system, in consultation with the State, may collect an additional 5 samples within 24 hours at each source that tested fecal indicator positive. If none of the additional samples are fecal indicator positive, then there is no TTV. Note that Tier 1 notification must be made after the initial raw water fecal indicator positive sample, even if it is not confirmed with additional sampling. 10\n\nFailure to take every required routine or additional routine sample in a compliance period is a monitoring violation. 11\n\nFailure to analyze for E. coli following a total coliform positive routine sample is a monitoring violation. 12\n\nFailure to submit a monitoring report or completed assessment form after a system properly conducts monitoring or assessment in a timely manner is a reporting violation. 13\n\nFailure to notify the State following an E. coli-positive sample as required by 5-1.52 Table 13 and 5-1.77(a) of this Subpart in a timely manner is a reporting violation. 14\n\nFailure to submit certification of completion of State approved start-up procedure by a seasonal system is a reporting violation. Footnote 4 of section\n5-1.52\n\nTable 11A is amended to read as follows: 4\n\nSamples must be taken and analyzed every day the system serves water to the public and the turbidity of the raw water exceeds 1 NTU. The samples count toward the weekly sampling requirement.

The waiver must be renewed by the State every nine years. The basis for a waiver must include the following: a. Lack of potential asbestos contamination of the water source. b. No use of asbestos cement pipe for finished water distribution and noncorrosive nature of the water. 2\n\nIf asbestos monitoring data collected after January 1, 1990 are consistent with the requirements of this table, the State may allow systems to use that data to satisfy the initial monitoring requirement beginning January 1, 1993. 3\n\nIf a system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination due to source water and corrosion of asbestos cement pipe or solely to corrosion of asbestos cement pipe, it shall take one sample at a tap served by asbestos cement pipe and under conditions where asbestos contamination is most likely to occur. 4\n\nIf a system is vulnerable to asbestos contamination due to source water only, monitoring shall be conducted as follows: Groundwater -Collect a minimum of one sample at each entry point to the distribution system representative of each well after treatment. Surface water - Collect a minimum of one sample at each entry point to the distribution system after any application of treatment or in the distribution system at a point which is representative of each source after treatment. 5\n\nFor both types of water sources the system shall take each sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant. If a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions when water is representative of all sources. 6\nA system which exceeds the MCL for asbestos shall monitor quarterly beginning in the next quarter after the violation occurred. 7\n\nThe State may decrease the quarterly monitoring requirement to the initial sampling requirement provided that the State has determined that the system is reliably and consistently below the MCL on the basis of a minimum of two quarterly groundwater samples and a minimum of four quarterly samples for surface water.

The State, at its discretion may require confirmation samples for positive and negative results. 2\n\nNoncommunity water systems must sample annually beginning 1/1/93 regardless of the water source. 3\n\nThe frequency may be reduced to annual if the State determines the system's contaminant concentration is consistently and reliably less than the MCL and annual samples are collected during the quarter(s) having the highest analytical results. 4\nA surface water shall return to quarterly monitoring if any one sample is GT 50 percent of MCL. 5\n\nState discretion shall mean requiring monitoring when the State has reason to believe the MCL has been violated, the potential exists for an MCL violation or the contaminant may present a risk to public health. 6\n\nFor both types of water sources the system shall take each sample at the same sampling point unless conditions make another sampling point more representative of each source or treatment plant. If a system draws water from more than one source and the sources are combined before distribution, the system must sample at an entry point to the distribution system during periods of normal operating conditions when water is representative of all sources. The average of the initial and confirmation sample contaminant concentration at each sampling point shall be used to determine compliance with the MCL.

Effective January 14, 2005 systems serving fewer than 10,000 persons must record the results of individual filter monitoring every 15 minutes, and combined filter effluent every four hours. Until January 14, 2005, systems serving fewer then 10,000 persons must continuously monitor the composite filter effluent turbidity, or record the turbidity every four hours. The State may allow systems with two filters to monitor the combined filter effluent continuously (recording every 15 minutes) in lieu of monitoring individual filter turbidity. Results of individual filter monitoring must be maintained for at least three years. 3\n\nIf there is a failure in the continuous turbidity monitoring equipment, the system must conduct grab sampling every four hours instead of continuous monitoring, but for no more than five working days following the failure of the equipment. 4\n\nFor systems using slow sand filtration or filtration treatment, other than conventional treatment, direct filtration or D.E. filtration, the State may reduce sampling frequency to once per day if it determines that less frequent monitoring is sufficient to indicate effective filtration performance. 5\n\nIf a system uses continuous monitoring, it must use the turbidity values recorded every four hours to determine if an MCL violation occurs, unless the State has approved in writing a different time interval. 6\n\nState discretion shall mean requiring monitoring when the State has reason to believe the MCL has been violated, the potential exists for an MCL violation or the contaminant may present a risk to public health.

Public water supply systems must collect total coliform samples at sites that are representative of water throughout the distribution system and throughout the reporting period, in accordance with a written monitoring plan which is subject to State review and revision as described in section\n5-1.51\n(c) of this Subpart. A public water system that uses only groundwater and serves 4,900 or fewer people may collect all required samples on a single day if they are taken from different sites. 2. Public water systems using surface water or groundwater directly influenced by surface water, and which do not provide filtration, must collect and analyze at least one sample for total coliforms near the first service connection each day the turbidity level of the raw water exceeds 1.49 NTU. This sample shall be collected within 24 hours. Results of this sample must be included in determining compliance with the MCLs and TTTs in Table 6 of this section. 3. Samples taken to determine disinfection practices after pipe repair, replacement, or similar activity are not to be used for determining compliance with the MCLs or TTTs in Table 6 of this section. 4. See Table 11B for repeat sampling requirements following any total coliform or E. Coli positive samples. 5. If chlorine or chloramines are used as the disinfectant, a chlorine residual determination shall be made at the same time and location that the sample is collected for total coliform analysis. Monitoring for heterotrophic bacteria may be substituted for free chlorine residuals. The State may allow a public water system that uses both: (1)\na surface water source, or a ground water source under direct influence of surface water, and\n(2)\na ground water source, to take disinfectant residual samples at points other than the total coliform sampling points if the State determines that such points are more representative of treated (disinfected) water quality within the distribution system. A heterotrophic plate count result equal to or less than 500 colonies per milliliter is considered to be equivalent to a measurable free chlorine residual. 6. The State may, in writing, reduce the monitoring frequency to quarterly for a community water system serving 1,000 or fewer persons and using ground water only if the system is in compliance with 10 NYCRR Subpart\n5-4; has a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12-months; is free of sanitary defects; and has a protected water source. The system must meet at least one of the following criteria: an annual site visit by the State or State-approved party that is equivalent to a Level 2 assessment and correction of all identified sanitary defects; cross connection control, as approved by the State; continuous disinfection entering the distribution system and a residual in the distribution system in accordance with criteria specified by the State; or demonstration of maintenance of at least a 4-log removal or inactivation of viruses. Systems that have been granted a disinfection waiver are not eligible for reduced monitoring frequency. 7. A community water system on quarterly monitoring must begin monthly monitoring if it meets any of the following conditions: a Level 2 assessment is triggered; two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-month period are triggered; an E. coli MCL violation; a coliform TTV; or two total coliform monitoring violations in a rolling 12-month period. Monthly monitoring must begin in the month following the event. 8. A noncommunity water system on quarterly monitoring must begin monthly monitoring if it meets any of the following conditions: a Level 2 assessment is triggered; two Level 1 assessments in a rolling 12-month period are triggered; an E. coli MCL violation; a coliform TTV; two total coliform monitoring violations; or one total coliform monitoring violation and one Level 1 assessment in a rolling 12-month period. Monthly monitoring must begin in the month following the event. 9. A noncommunity water system may return to quarterly monitoring if they meet the following criteria: within the last 12 months, the system must have a completed sanitary survey or Level 2 assessment, be free of sanitary defects, have a protected water source; and the system must have a clean compliance history for a minimum of 12 months. 10. Fecal indicators include E. coli, enterococci, and coliphage. Only E. coli testing will be required, unless otherwise directed by the State. 11. State discretion shall mean that monitoring is required when the State has reason to believe the MCL or TT has been violated, the potential exists for an MCL violation or TTV; or the contaminant may present a risk to public health.

An additional sample must be collected from each raw water source or according to State approved sampling plan. 6, 7, 8\n\nWholesale System of any size\n\nAfter notification by consecutive system of total coliform-positive sample\n6, 7, 9, 11\n\nCollect one raw water sample at each source or in accordance with a State-approved sampling plan. 6, 7, 9\n\nAs directed by State\n10\n\nSource water sample(s) fecal indicator\npositive\n7, 10\n\nGround water system or ground water source not providing or not documenting 4-log virus treatment\n\nAll\n\nFive raw water samples for fecal indicator or immediate corrective action as directed by State\n6, 9, 11\n\nFecal indicator sampling from source or sources with initial fecal indicator positive samples\n6, 7\n\nAs directed by State\n10, 11\n1. After any total coliform positive sample from the distribution system, the system must collect repeat samples on the same day and within 24 hours of being notified. 2. The month following a total coliform positive sample, systems collecting samples quarterly must collect a minimum of three routine distribution system samples. The State may waive, in writing, the requirement to collect three routine samples the following month the system provides water to the public, if the State carries out an onsite visit before the end of the following month and the State determines why the sample was total coliform positive and establishes that the system has corrected the problem. The State cannot waive the requirement to collect three routine samples solely on the basis that all the repeat samples were total coliform negative. Before the end of the following month the system serves water to the public, at least one routine sample to determine compliance with the MCLs and TTTs must be collected by the system as required in Table 11. 3. Results of all routine and repeat microbiological samples not invalidated by the State must be used to determine whether a coliform TTT specified in Table 6 has been exceeded. 4. The State may allow a system with a single service connection to collect the required set of repeat samples over a three-day period or to collect a larger volume repeat sample(s) in one or two more sample containers of any size, as long as the total volume collect is at least 300 mL. If E. coli is used as the fecal indicator at a ground water system with a single well, a single sample of two (2) times the minimum sample volume or two (2) bottles of minimum required sample volume may be collected consecutively from the tap and the third sample collected from the raw water source. This source water sample result must be used to determine compliance with all Table 6 requirements. 5. If a consecutive system purchasing (or otherwise obtaining) ground water from a wholesale system has a total coliform-positive sample from the distribution system, the system must notify the wholesale system and collect distribution system repeat samples as specified in Table 11B within 24 hours. The wholesale system must collect raw source water sample(s) unless the system provides 4-log virus treatment at peak flow before or at the first customer as confirmed through process compliance monitoring. 6. Sampling plan requirements are given in section\n5-1.51\n(c) of this Subpart. 7. Fecal indicators include E. coli, enterococci and coliphage. Sampling for fecal indicators other than E.coli is at State discretion. 8. A system with a single well or a ground water source serving 1,000 or fewer persons may collect a single raw water sample to serve as both a distribution repeat sample to replace the upstream location sample and a raw water sample taken following a routine total coliform positive sample, if E. coli is used as the fecal indicator. If this dual-purpose source water sample is collected, the sample result must be used to determine compliance with all Table 6 requirements. 9. Wholesale system source water sampling requirements are in addition to distribution system sampling requirements for consecutive systems. 10. In the event of a fecal indicator positive sample from the raw source water, the state must be notified immediately and may require immediate corrective action. In no case will notification be later than 24 hours as described in section\n5-1.78\n(d)(4)\nof this Subpart. 11. If a ground water wholesale system does not perform 4-log virus treatment and process compliance monitoring, and has a fecal indicator positive sample from a raw source water, the system must notify any consecutive systems as well as any of its own customers. TABLE 12-RADIOLOGICAL MINIMUM MONITORING REQUIREMENTS\nContaminant\n\nType of water system\n\nMonitoring Requirement\n1\n\nInitial\n\nReduced monitoring\n2, 3\n\nCombined radium-226 and radium-228 and gross alpha particle activity\n\nCommunity\n\nFour consecutive quarterly samples at every entry point before December 31, 2007, 4, 5, 6\n\nOne sample every nine years at every entry point when monitoring results are below the detection limit. 7,8\n\nOne sample every six years at every entry point when monitoring results are at or above the detection limit but below half of the MCL. 7, 8\n\nOne sample every three years at every entry point when monitoring results are above half of the MCL but at or below the MCL. 7, 8\n\nNoncommunity\n\nNot applicable\n\nBeta particle and photon radioactivity from manmade radionuclides\n\nCommunity systems designated by the State as vulnerable\n9\n\nQuarterly samples for beta particle and annual samples for tritium and Sr-90, beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State. 10, 11\n\nIf the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally occurring K-40 beta particle activity at a sampling point has a running annual average (computed quarterly) less than or equal to 50 pCi/L (screening level), the State may reduce the frequency of monitoring at that sampling point to once every 3 years. 14, 15\n\nCommunity systems designated by the State as utilizing waters contaminated by effluents from nuclear facilities\n9\n\nQuarterly samples for beta emitters and I-131 and annual samples for tritium and Sr-90, beginning within one quarter after being notified by the State. 10, 11, 12, 13\n\nIf the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally occurring K-40 beta particle activity at a sampling point has a running annual average (computed quarterly) less than or equal to 15 pCi/L (screening level), the State may reduce the frequency of monitoring at that sampling point to once every 3 years. 14, 15\n1\n\nAll radiological samples must be collected at every entry point to distribution system (EPTDS). 2\n\nThe State may allow systems to reduce the frequency of monitoring based on initial monitoring or historical results as noted in footnote 4 below. 3\n\nSystems on a reduced monitoring schedule must perform quarterly sampling if a sample result exceeds the MCL. 4\n\nThe State may allow historical monitoring data collected between June 2000 and December 8, 2003 for systems with: (1)\nonly one entry point to the distribution system; (2)\nmultiple entry points and having appropriate historical monitoring data for each entry point to the distribution system; (3)\nappropriate historical data for a representative point in the distribution system, provided that the State finds that the historical data satisfactorily demonstrate that each entry point to the distribution system is expected to be in compliance based upon the historical data and reasonable assumptions about the variability of contaminant levels between entry points. 5\n\nThe State may waive the final two quarters of initial monitoring for a sampling point if the results of the samples from the previous two quarters are below the detection limit. 6\n\nIf the average of the initial monitoring results for a sampling point is above the MCL, the system must collect and analyze quarterly samples at the sampling point until the system has results from four consecutive quarters that are at or below the MCL. 7\nA gross alpha particle activity measurement may be substituted for the required radium-226 measurement provided that the measured gross alpha particle activity does not exceed 5 pCi/L. A gross alpha particle activity measurement may be substituted for the required uranium measurement provided that the measured gross alpha particle activity does not exceed 15 pCi/L. The gross alpha measurement shall have a confidence interval of 95 % (1.65[SIGMA], where [SIGMA] is the standard deviation of the net counting rate of the sample) for radium-226 and uranium. When a system uses a gross alpha activity measurement in lieu of a radium-226 and/or uranium measurement, the gross alpha particle activity analytical result will be used be determine the future monitoring frequency for radium-226 and/or or uranium. If the gross alpha particle activity result is less than detection, 1/2 the detection limit can be used to substitute to radium-226 and determine compliance for future monitoring frequency. 8\n\nRadium-228 measurement can not be substituted by the gross alpha particle activity result. 9\n\nFor systems in the vicinity of a nuclear facility, the State may allow the CWS to utilize environmental surveillance data collected by the nuclear facility in lieu of monitoring the systems entry point(s), where the State determines that such data is applicable. 10\n\nSystems already designed by the State must continue to sample until the State reviews and either reaffirms or removes the designation. 11\n\nQuarterly monitoring for gross beta particle activity shall be based on the analysis of monthly samples or the analysis of a composite of three monthly samples. 12\n\nAnnual monitoring for Sr-90 and tritium shall be conducted by means of the analysis of a composite of four consecutive quarterly samples or analysis of four quarterly samples. 13\n\nFor iodine-131, a composite of five consecutive daily samples shall be analyzed once each quarter. As ordered by the State, more frequent monitoring shall be conducted when iodine-131 is identified in the finished water. 14\n\nSystems must collect all samples for beta emitters, tritium and strontium-90 during the reduced monitoring period. 15\nA system that exceeds the gross beta particle activity minus the naturally occurring potassium-40 beta particle screening level (50 pCi/L for vulnerable systems or 15 pCi/L for systems utilizing waters contaminated by effluents from nuclear facilities), must further analyze the sample for the major radioactive constituents. The potassium-40 beta particle activity must be calculated by multiplying elemental potassium concentrations in mg/L by a factor of 0.82.

TABLE 15A-DISINFECTANT RESIDUAL MINIMUM DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM MONITORING REQUIREMENTS FOR SYSTEMS USING CHEMICAL DISINFECTION\nDisinfectant\n\nType of water system\n\nRoutine monitoring\n\nChlorine\n\nCommunity and nontransient\n\nSample at the same time and same points in\n\nChloramines\nnoncommunity\nthe distribution system as total coliform\nsampling. 1\n\nChlorine dioxide\n2\n\nCommunity, nontransient\n\nDaily sample at the entrance to the\nnoncommunity and transient\ndistribution system\n3\nnoncommunity\n1\n\nCommunity Water Systems using surface water or ground water under the direct influence of surface water may use heterotrophic plate count results of equal to or less than 500 colonies per milliliter as equivalent to a free chlorine residual as outlined in table 11, footnote 5, in lieu of taking separate samples for disinfection residuals. 2\n\nMonitoring is required if chlorine dioxide is used for either oxidation or disinfection. 3\n\nIf the Maximum Residual Disinfectant Level (MRDL) of 0.8 mg/L is exceeded, the system must take three samples in the distribution system on the following day. If chlorine dioxide or chloramines are used to maintain a disinfectant residual in the distribution system, or if chlorine is used and there are no rechlorination stations, the system must take three samples as close to the first customer as possible, at intervals of at least six hours. If chlorine is used and there is a rechlorination station, the system must take one sample as close to the first customer as possible, one sample representing average residence time, and one sample representing maximum residence time.
