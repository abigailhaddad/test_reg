  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.25 - Obd ii emissions inspection waiver\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a vehicle fails, after proper repair, the reinspection of the emissions portion, a certificate of inspection must be\noffered by the official emissions inspection station if all of the following\nconditions are met: (1)\n\nThe safety inspection\nhas been passed. (2)\n\nAll emissions\ncontrol devices have passed inspection. The cost for replacement of missing\nemissions control devices, safety items or warranty repairs does not count\ntowards the emissions waiver cost limits. (3)\n\nRepairs and adjustments have been\nproperly made and documented and cost at least $450, based on the cost of such\nrepairs if performed in 1989. Provided, however, that the waiver amount will be\nadjusted to account for increases in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) since\n\nJanuary 1989 and will be adjusted each year in accordance with the\nCPI. (b) If all of the\nabove conditions are met, the CVIS will allow the inspector to issue an\ninspection certificate for the vehicle. If issuing a \"safety/emissions\" sticker\nVS-1082SE, check the \"repair waiver issued\" box on the reverse side of the\nsticker and punch the appropriate expiration month. The NYVIP CVIS will print a\nwaiver certification form that must be filled out by the station, and signed by\nboth the customer and the certified inspector. The station must attach the\nfollowing documentation to the waiver certification form: copies of invoices\nand receipts for all of the diagnostic and repair work performed and used to\nqualify for the waiver; copies of all vehicle inspection receipts for the\ninitial emissions inspection failure and all subsequent emissions inspection\nfailures. This documentation must be kept by the station for two years for\npossible review by NYS. (c) The\ncommissioner or an agent of the commissioner reserves the right to inspect a\nvehicle before or after the waiver is issued to verify that proper repairs have\nbeen made and have been documented, including documentation of diagnosis\nprocedures. The repair cost must meet the minimum waiver cost as calculated in\nparagraph (a)(3) of this section. Repairs made to qualify for the waiver must\naddress the reason for the emissions failure and follow acknowledged industry\nstandards for diagnosis and repair. (d) Official inspection stations fleet (see\nsection\n79.15\nof this Part) may only apply\nthe cost of parts towards a waiver; no labor may be applied. All diagnosis and\nrepairs must be documented, as described in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (e) Vehicles sold by a\ndealer that must be inspected prior to delivery are not eligible for a\nwaiver. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n79.25\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
