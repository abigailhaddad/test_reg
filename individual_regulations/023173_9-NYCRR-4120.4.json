Tit. 9 § 4120.4 - Trainer's responsibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ntrainer shall be responsible at all times for the condition of all horses\ntrained by him or her. No trainer shall start or permit a horse in his or her\ncustody, care or control to be started if such trainer knows, or might have\nknown cause to believe, that the horse has received any drug or other\nrestricted substance that could result in a positive test. The trainer shall be\nheld responsible for any positive test unless such trainer can show by\nsubstantial evidence that neither such trainer nor any employee nor agent was\nresponsible for the administration of the drug or other restricted substance. Every trainer must guard each horse trained by him or her in such manner and\nfor such period of time prior to racing the horse so as to prevent any person\nwhether or not employed by or connected with the owner or trainer from\nadministering any drug or other restricted substance to such horse contrary to\nthis Part. (b) Trainers shall\nmaintain accurate records of all corticosteroid joint injections to horses\ntrained by them. The record(s) of every corticosteroid joint injection shall be\nsubmitted, in a form and manner approved by the commission, by the trainer to\nthe commission within 48 hours of the treatment. The trainer may delegate this\nresponsibility to the treating vet- erinarian, who shall make these reports\nwhen so designated. The reports shall be accessible to the examining\nveterinarian for the purposes of as- sisting with pre-race veterinary\nexaminations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
