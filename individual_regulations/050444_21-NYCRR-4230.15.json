(h) The loan application is divided into two\nsections. Section I requests basic information, from the categories of\ninformation set forth in subdivision (g) of this section, regarding the\napplicant and the proposed project which will enable corporation staff to\ndetermine the eligibility of the applicant and the proposed project for program\nfunding, to make a preliminary determination of the feasibility of the proposed\nproject and the creditworthiness of the applicant and to determine whether\ntechnical assistance in the structuring of the transaction may be necessary or\ndesirable. Section II requests more detailed information which will permit\ncorporation staff to perform a full credit analysis and to determine the\nproposed project's compliance with program requirements and its feasibility, so\nas to formulate a funding recommendation. (i) Applicants have the option of completing\nboth sections of the loan application and submitting them simultaneously to the\ncorporation for a full review. Alternatively, applicants may complete section I\nand obtain a preliminary determination by the corporation regarding eligibility\nand feasibility. (j) If an applicant\nopts to submit section I for preliminary analysis, the corporation will review\nthe information for completeness, eligibility, preliminary feasibility and the\nneed for technical assistance. If staff determine that the project appears to\nbe eligible for funding, and that funding for such project appears to be\nfeasible, the applicant will receive a written invitation to submit section II\nof the loan application. (k) Each\napplicant will receive written acknowledgment by the corporation of its\nreceipt, within 20 days thereof, of either section I from an applicant that has\nreceived a preliminary determination of eligibility and feasibility or of\nsections I and II from an applicant opting to submit them simultaneously. The\nacknowledgment will comment specifically on the completeness of the information\nsubmitted. Applicants that have not supplied all of the required information\nwill be notified of what is missing and asked to provide it. (l) If staff determines a proposal is\nappropriate for funding under the criteria set forth in this section it will be\npresented to the corporation's directors for approval. The directors generally\nmeet once a month. Loans and loan guarantees in an amount of less than $100,000\nmay be authorized by the president and chief executive officer of the\ncorporation, acting on behalf of the corporation, subject to such\nauthorization's being ratified by the directors of the corporation prior to\nsubmission of the prospective financing to the State Public Authorities Control\n\nBoard (\"PACB\") for approval, if necessary. In the event a project is approved\nor ratified by the directors, in the manner required for the particular\nproject, it will, if necessary, then be reviewed by PACB, which also generally\nmeets once a month. (m) Upon the\ncompletion of the approval process, the corporation will issue, by letter, a\ncommitment of limited time duration for approved program assistance. The\ncommitment letter will set forth the terms and conditions for the authorized\nassistance and will specify the date by which such assistance must be closed or\nthe commitment therefor will expire.
