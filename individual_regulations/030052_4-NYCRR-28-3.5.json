  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 §§ 28-3.5 - Medical documentation\n\nState Regulations\n\nBefore absence for personal illness may be charged\nagainst donated leave credits, the appointing authority may require such proof\nof illness as may be satisfactory to it, or may require the employee to be\nexamined, at the expense of the department or agency, by a physician designated\nby the appointing authority. In the event of failure to submit proof of illness\nupon request, or in the event that, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the\nreport of medical examination, the appointing authority finds that there is not\nsatisfactory evidence of illness sufficient to justify the employee's absence\nfrom the performance of his/her duties, such absence may be considered as\nunauthorized leave and shall not be charged against donated leave credits. Abuse of leave privileges shall be cause for disciplinary\naction. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4\n§§\n28-3.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
