  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 249.3 - Requirements for sources subject to case-by-case bart determinations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or\noperator of a source that is determined to be BART-eligible and whose emissions\nof visibility-impairing pollutants result in a visibility impairment equal to\nor greater than 0.1 deciviews in any Federal Class I Area must conduct an\nanalysis to determine the appropriate emission limitation necessary to meet\nBART requirements. The analysis must consider, with respect to each\nvisibility-impairing pollutant emitted by the source, the following factors: (1)\nthe costs of compliance; (2)\nthe energy and non-air quality\nenvironmental impacts of compliance; (3)\nany existing pollution control technology\nin use at the source; (4)\nthe\nremaining useful life of the source; and\n(5)\nthe degree of improvement in visibility\nwhich may reasonably be anticipated to result from the use of such\ntechnology. (b) The\nanalysis must evaluate retrofit control options for each visibility-impairing\npollutant unless facility-wide emissions for the relevant visibility-impairing\npollutant are at or below the de minimis level. The facility-wide de minimis\nemissions levels are 40 tpy of SO\n2\nor NO\nx, and 15 tpy of PM\n10. (c) Any required BART analysis must be\nsubmitted to the department by October 1, 2010. (d) Control equipment or other emission\nreduction methods approved by the department as BART must be installed and\noperating no later than January 1, 2014. (e) Before commencing any required\nconstruction or process changes, the owner or operator must submit an\napplication for a permit or permit modification as required under Part 201 of\nthis Title. (f) Each BART\ndetermination established by the department will be submitted to the United\n\nStates Environmental Protection Agency for approval as a revision to the State\n\nImplementation Plan.
