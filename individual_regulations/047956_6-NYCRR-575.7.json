  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 575.7 - Petitions to add a species to the invasive species list or remove a species from the invasive species list\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person may\npetition the department to have a species added to the invasive species list or\nremoved from the invasive species list found in this Part. Persons who submit a\npetition to add a species to the invasive species list or remove a species from\nthe invasive species list must provide his or her name, address, telephone\nnumber, and e-mail address (if available). The department may only classify\nadditional nonnative species that meet the established criteria in section\n575.5\nof this Part for prohibited\nor regulated as invasive species and may classify them as prohibited or\nregulated invasive species if the commissioner, with the approval of the New\n\nYork State Department of Agriculture and Markets determines the established\ncriteria are met. Persons who submit a petition to remove a species from the\ninvasive species list must provide his or her name, address, telephone number, and (if available) e-mail address. The department, with the approval of the New\n\nYork State Department of Agriculture and Markets, may only remove classified\ninvasive species if those invasive species no longer meet the established\ncriteria in section\n575.5\nof this Part. Persons who\nsubmit a petition to add a species to the invasive species list or remove a\nspecies from the invasive species list are encouraged to provide the following\ninformation, which can facilitate the review process. (b) Identification and background of the\nspecies: (1)\nthe species scientific\nname; (2)\nspecies taxonomic\nclassification; (3)\ncommon\nsynonyms; (4)\ncommon\nnames; (5)\nsummary of life\nhistory; (6)\nnative and world\ndistribution; (7)\ndistribution in\n\nNew York State, if any; (8)\ndescription of control efforts, if established in New York State; and\n(9)\nwhether the species is regulated at the\n\nFederal or local level. (c) Potential consequences of the species'\nintroduction or spread: (1)\nthe species'\nhabitat suitability in New York State; (2)\ndispersal potential (biological\ncharacteristics associated with invasiveness); (3)\npotential economic impacts\n(\ne.g., potential to reduce crop yields, lower commodity\nvalues, or cause loss of markets for New York State goods); and\n(4)\npotential environmental impacts\n(\ne.g., impacts on ecosystem processes, natural community\ncomposition or structure, human health, recreation patterns, property values, or use of chemicals to control the species). (d) Likelihood of the species introduction or\nspread: (1)\npotential pathways for the\nspecies movement into and within New York State; (2)\ndescription of control efforts either\nwithin New York or nearby areas where this species is present; and\n(3)\nthe likelihood of survival and spread of\nthe species within each pathway. (e) Evidence that the species is distributed\nthroughout its potential range or has spread too far to implement effective\ncontrol. (f) Evidence that control\nefforts have been unsuccessful and further efforts are unlikely to\nsucceed. (g) For cultivars of a\nlisted invasive species, scientific evidence that the cultivar has a\ncombination of risk elements that result in a low risk. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n575.7\n\nAdopted, New\n\nYork State Register September 10, 2014/Volume XXXVI, Issue 36, eff. 9/10/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
