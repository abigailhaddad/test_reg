  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.23 - Additional siting criteria for underground mined repositories\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of section\n382.21\nof this Part, any site used\nfor an underground mined repository must meet the requirements of this\nsection. (a) General. The site must\ninclude a buffer zone on all sides of the underground mined repository of\nsufficient thickness to protect the underground mined repository from\naccidental disturbance or penetration from outside intrusion and to allow for\nredundant monitoring. (b) Surface\nwater and hydrology. The underground mined repository's surface facilities must\nnot be placed in a 100-year floodplain, coastal erosion hazard area, or\nwetland, as defined in Executive Order 11988, Floodplain Management Guidelines, 42 Fed. Reg. 26951\n(1977) (see section\n382.99\nof this Part). (c) Groundwater and hydrogeology. (1)\n\nThe present and projected local and\nregional groundwater flow systems must be capable of being defensibly\ncharacterized, modeled and analyzed. (2)\n\nThe disposal site must not be located in\nan area where subsurface hydrogeologic processes, such as dissolution, occur\nwith such frequency and extent as to adversely affect the ability of the\nunderground mined repository to meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (d) Geology. (1)\n\nThe geologic formations and hydrogeologic\nfeatures of the site must permit the safe construction, operation and closure\nof an underground mined repository. (2)\n\nThe geologic unit in which the\nunderground mined repository is to be located must have adequate thickness and\nlateral extent to contain the disposal units. (3)\n\nThe geologic unit in which the\nunderground mined repository is to be located must not contain features, such\nas faults, fractures or other discontinuities, which could adversely affect the\nunderground mined repository's ability to meet the performance objectives of\nsections\n382.10\n- 382.15 of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nThe site must be located\nin an area where subsidence and related impacts will not adversely affect the\nunderground mined repository's ability to meet the performance objectives of\nsections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nThe site must not be\nlocated where any instability may develop in the geologic unit that may\nadversely affect the ability of the underground mined repository to meet the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n382.23\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
