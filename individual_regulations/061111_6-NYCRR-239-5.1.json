  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 239-5.1 - Innovative products\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A portable fuel\ncontainer or spout or both portable fuel container and spout may be exempted\nfrom one or more of the requirements of Subpart 239-3 of this Part if a\nmanufacturer demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that, due to the\nproduct's design, delivery system, or other factors, the use of the product\nwill result in cumulative VOC emissions below the highest emitting\nrepresentative spill-proof system or representative spill-proof spout in its\nproduct category as determined from applicable testing. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, representative spill-proof system or a representative spill-proof spout means a\nportable fuel container or spout or both portable fuel container and spout\nwhich, at the time of application in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, meets\nthe performance standards specified in Subpart 239-3 of this Part. (2)\nA manufacturer (applicant) must apply in\nwriting to the director, Division of Air Resources, Department of Environmental\n\nConservation for an innovative product exemption. The application must include\nthe supporting documentation that quantifies the emissions from the innovative\nproduct, including the actual physical test methods used to generate the data. In addition, the applicant must provide any information necessary to establish\nenforceable conditions for granting the exemption. All information including\nproprietary data submitted by a manufacturer pursuant to this Section shall be\nhandled in accordance with the procedures specified in Part 616 of this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nWithin 30 days of\nreceipt of the exemption application the department shall determine whether an\napplication is complete. (4)\n\nWithin\n90 days after an application has been deemed complete, the department will\ndetermine whether, under what conditions, and to what extent, an exemption from\nthe requirements of Subpart 239-3 of this Part will be permitted. The applicant\nand the department may mutually agree to a longer time period for reaching a\ndecision. An applicant may submit additional supporting documentation before a\ndecision has been reached. The department will notify the applicant of the\ndecision in writing and specify such terms and conditions that are necessary to\nensure that emissions from use of the product will meet the emissions\nreductions specified in this subdivision, and that such emissions reductions\ncan be enforced. (5)\n\nIn granting an\ninnovative product exemption for a portable fuel container or spout or both\nportable fuel container and spout, the State of New York shall specify the test\nmethods for determining conformance to the conditions established. The test\nmethods may include criteria for reproducibility, accuracy, and sampling and\nlaboratory procedures. (6)\n\nFor any\nportable fuel container or spout or both portable fuel container and spout for\nwhich an innovative product exemption has been granted pursuant to this\n\nSubpart, the manufacturer shall notify the department in writing at least 30\ndays before the manufacturer changes a product's design, delivery system, or\nother factors that may effect the VOC emissions during recommended usage. The\nmanufacturer must also notify the department within 30 days after the\nmanufacturer learns of any information that would alter the emissions estimates\nsubmitted to the department in support of the exemption application. (7)\n\nIf the performance standards specified in\n\nSubpart 239-3 of this Part are amended for a product category, all innovative\nproduct exemptions granted for products in the product category, except as\nprovided in paragraph (8) of this subdivision, have no force and effect as of\nthe effective date of the amended performance standards. (8)\n\nIf the department believes that a\nportable fuel container, spout, or both portable fuel container and spout for\nwhich an exemption has been granted no longer meets the criteria for an\ninnovative product specified in this subdivision, the department may hold a\npublic hearing in accordance with the procedures specified in Part 621 of this\n\nTitle, to determine if the exemption should be modified or revoked.
