  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.281 - Plastic pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A plastic\npipe joint that is joined by solvent cement, adhesive or heat fusion may not be\ndisturbed until it has properly set. (b) Plastic pipe may not be joined by a\nthreaded joint or miter joint. (c) The quality of the joints shall be checked visually. If there is any reason to\nbelieve the joint is defective, it shall be removed and replaced. (d) Each solvent cement joint on plastic pipe\nmust comply with the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe mating surfaces of the joint must be clean, dry, and free of material which\nmight be detrimental to the joint. (2)\n\nThe solvent cement must conform to ASTM\nSpecification D2513 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (3)\n\nThe safety requirements of Appendix A of\nASTM Specification D2513 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title) must be\nmet. (4)\n\nThe joint may not be\nheated to accelerate the setting of the cement. (e) Each heat-fusion joint on a PE pipe or\ncomponent, except for electrofusion joints, must comply with ASTM F2620 (as\ndescribed in Section\n10.3\nof this Title) or an approved\nalternative written procedure that has been demonstrated to provide an\nequivalent or superior level of safety and has been proven by test or\nexperience to produce strong gas tight joints, and the following criteria. (1)\nA butt heat-fusion joint must be joined\nby a device that holds the heater element square to the ends of the pipe or\ncomponent, compresses the heated ends together, and holds the piping in proper\nalignment in accordance with the appropriate procedure qualified under\n255.283. (2)\nA socket heat-fusion\njoint must be joined by a device that heats the mating surfaces of the pipe or\ncomponent, uniformly and simultaneously to establish the same temperature. The\ndevice used must be the same device specified in the operator's joining\nprocedure for socket fusion. (3)\n\nAn\nelectrofusion joint must be made using the equipment and techniques prescribed\nby the fittings manufacturer or equipment and techniques shown, by testing\njoints to the requirements of section\n255.283\n(a) (1)\n(iii)\nof this Part, to be equivalent or\nbetter than the requirements of the fitting manufacturer. (4)\n\nHeat may not be applied with a torch or\nother open flame. (f) Each adhesive joint on plastic pipe must comply with the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe adhesive must conform to ASTM\nSpecification D2517 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (2)\n\nThe materials and adhesive must be\ncompatible with each other. (g) Each compression type mechanical joint on\nplastic pipe must comply with the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe gasket material in the coupling must\nbe compatible with the plastic. (2)\nA rigid internal tubular stiffener, other than a split tubular stiffener, must\nbe used in conjunction with the coupling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
