  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 226.9 - Large volume meters-in-test programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Large volume meter in-test\nprogram. After installation, all large volume meters shall receive\nan in-test at least once every seven years, except as otherwise provided in\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. In-tests of meters shall be made at\nambient temperature conditions at the same open and check test flow rates as\nused for out-tests specified in section\n226.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Where possible, each in-test shall be performed within 60 working days\nafter removal from a customer's premises. (b) Alternate large volume meter\nin-test program. (1)\n\nInitial\nnotification. In lieu of the schedule of testing set forth in subdivision (a)\nof this section, any utility may apply to department staff for approval to\nadopt the alternate large volume meter in-test program described in this\nsubdivision. The initial application for approval and any subsequent revisions\nshall include full formulation of said program complying with paragraphs (2)\nthrough (8) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nTest groups. Test groups shall be formed\nin accordance with section\n226.8\n(b) (2) (ii), (iii) and\n(3)\nof this Part. (3)\n\nEach approved utility shall test its\nlarge volume meters as follows: (i) Except as\nprovided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the required annual test rate\nwill be used to determine the minimum number of meters to be tested from each\ntest group for each approved utility in an ensuing calendar year and shall be\nbased on meter performance at the check rate during the three preceding\ncalendar years. For example, the performance of meters in the calendar years\n1991-1993 shall determine the test rate for the meters in the calendar year\n1995. The required annual test rate for each meter type shall be four percent\nof such meters in service where 100 percent of the meters are within +2.0\npercent of 100 percent proof. For each one percent of the meters found over 2.0\npercent slow, the test rate shall increase 0.133 percent. For each one percent\nof the meters found over 2.0 percent fast, the test rate shall increase 0.267\npercent. (ii)\n\nWhere the calculated\ntest rate is between 8 and 14 percent, the test rate shall be determined from\ntable 1 of Appendix 7-A of this title, infra. (iii)\n\nWhere the calculated test rate exceeds\n14 percent in table 1 of Appendix 7-A of this Title, infra, the following test rate shall apply: test rate = 2x+y36, where x = percentage\nof meters fast and y = percentage of meters slow. (4)\n\nThe meters tested shall be from all age\ngroups, the majority to be selected from those longest in service since last\ntest. (5)\n\nMeters tested for reasons\nother than the requirements set forth in paragraphs (3) and (4) of this\nsubdivision may be included for compliance therewith, provided that: (i) the number of meters removed for fault, or found faulty, that may be credited against the test requirements for any\nmeter type shall not exceed the number of meters tested and found to be in\nsound conditions; and\n(ii)\nmeters\nfound to be inoperative or leaking shall be reported as such. (6)\n\nNo annual rate of test shall\ndecrease from the required annual rate of the preceding year by a factor\ngreater than three percent per year during each of the first two years of\nparticipation in the alternate large volume accuracy maintenance in-test\nprogram. (7)\n\nUpon submission of a\nprogram satisfactory to the department staff, as described in subdivision (c)\nof this section, any utility may retire or accelerate the repair of any group\nof meters identifiable by make, type or any other factor which affects\nperformance. The number of meters that are removed in excess of the number that\nis required may be credited to those meters with a history of superior test\nrates. The number credited to each test group shall be limited to quantities\nwhich will assure a two-percent sample of the superior test rate meters. Meters\nto be retired shall be in-tested at the rate specified in subdivision (c) of\nthis section. In-test results for retirement and accelerated repair programs\nshall be reported separately. (8)\n\nAny utility that does not meet its annual test requirements, in any test group, shall schedule such deficits in the following year's test requirements. Where a\nutility has exceeded its test requirements in any test group, such meters may\nbe credited toward any deficits in current year requirements, providing that\nthe credits are applied to meters with a history of superior performance. A\nmaximum of two percent or 200 meters, whichever is less, in any test group may\nbe credited toward the following year's test requirements, provided that they\nare credited to those meters having superior test rates. (9)\n\nRotary meter differential testing. In\nlieu of paragraph (5) of this subdivision, a utility may elect to differential\ntest rotary type meters as an indicator of meter condition. An increase of 50\npercent in the pressure differential reading between the inlet and outlet of\nthe meter from readings supplied by the manufacturer or readings taken at the\ntime of the meter's installation will require maintenance to the meter to bring\nit back into specification or the performance of an in-test. Differential tests\nshall be done at least once every 10 years or at one half the meter's scheduled\nin-test interval, whichever is greater. (c) Retirement program. If a utility files with the department staff a satisfactory\nretirement program for any group of meters identifiable by make, type or any\nfactor which affects performance, the annual testing requirements of said type\nmeter may be made as follows for the program's duration set forth in the\nfiling: Period of retirement program, years\n\nMinimum percent of\nretired meters to be tested per year\n\nNot more than 15\n20.0\n\nNot more than 10\n15.0\n\nNot more than 5\n10.0\n\nNot more than 2\n0.0\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n226.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
