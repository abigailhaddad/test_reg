  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 36.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nPublic trust in the judicial process demands that\nappointments by judges be fair, impartial and beyond reproach. Accordingly, these rules are intended to ensure that appointees are selected on the basis of\nmerit, without favoritism, nepotism, politics or other factors unrelated to the\nqualifications of the appointee or the requirements of the case. The rules cannot be written in a way that foresees every\nsituation in which they should be applied. Therefore, the appointment of\ntrained and competent persons, and the avoidance of factors unrelated to the\nmerit of the appointments or the value of the work performed, are fundamental\nobjectives that should guide all appointments made, and orders issued, pursuant\nto this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
