Direct GME costs shall be those costs defined in section\n86-1.15\n(f)(1)\nof this Subpart, derived from the same base period used to calculate the statewide base price for the applicable rate period and trended forward to such rate period in accordance with applicable provisions of section\n2807-c (10)\nof the Public Health Law, and shall be excluded from the cost included in the statewide base price. (b) (1)\n\nAn indirect GME payment per discharge shall be added to the case payment rates of teaching general hospitals after the application of SIW and WEF adjustments to the statewide base price and shall be calculated by multiplying such rates by the indirect teaching cost percentage determined by the following formula: where \"r\" equals the ratio of residents and fellows to beds based on the medical education statistics for the hospital for the period ended June 30, 2005 as contained in the survey document submitted by the hospital to the department as of June 30, 2009 and the staffed beds for the general hospital reported in the 2005 institutional cost report and submitted to the department no later than June 30,2009, but excluding exempt unit beds and nursery bassinettes.

The amount of such exclusion shall be determined by multiplying the total reported Medicaid costs less reported direct GME costs by the following formula: 1.03(((1 + r) [CIRCUMFLEX ACCENT]0.0405) -1)\n(b) where \"r\" equals the ratio of residents and fellows to beds as determined in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (c) A non-comparable payment per discharge shall be added to case payment rates after the application of SIW and WEF adjustments to the statewide base price and shall be calculated for each hospital by dividing the facility's total reported Medicaid costs for qualifying non-comparable cost categories by its total reported Medicaid discharges pursuant to section\n86-1.16\n(b)(2)\nof this Subpart. Non-comparable hospital costs are those costs defined in section\n86-1.15\n(l) of this Subpart, derived from the same base period used to calculate the statewide base price for the applicable rate period and trended forward to such rate period in accordance with applicable provisions of section\n2807-c (10)\nof the Public Health Law, and shall be excluded from the cost included in the statewide base price.
