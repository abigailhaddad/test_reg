  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 400.7 - Rules for testing steam meters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All meters shall be adjusted to register accurately with a tolerance of not\nmore than two percent. (b) Steam\nflow meters--area and velocity types. (1)\n\nSteam flow meters of the area and velocity types shall be tested using air or\nsteam as the testing medium except as provided in section\n400.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nIn tests employing steam\nas the testing medium, the steam used shall in no case contain more than one\npercent moisture and may be slightly superheated. (3)\n\nIn tests employing either air or steam as\nthe testing medium and flow tubes with orifices as the reference standards, the\ntest equipment and test procedure shall conform with the applicable provisions\nset forth in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standards, covering\nflow measurement (presently designated PTC 19.5; 4-1959), in effect at the time\nof test. (4)\n\nIn tests conducted in\naccordance with paragraph (3) of this subdivision, meters shall be tested at\nthe load points specified below: (i) Area type\nmeters. One test shall be made at each of six load points starting at\napproximately one-sixth load and continuing in equal steps to 100 percent of\nmeter rating. (ii)\n\nVelocity type\nmeters. Two tests shall be made at each of three load points approximately\nequal to 50 percent, 60 percent and 70 percent of meter rating. (5)\n\nIn tests employing steam as\nthe testing medium and a condensate weighing scale as the reference standard, meters shall be tested at the load points specified below: (i) Area type meters. Two tests shall be made\nat each of six load points starting at approximately one-sixth load and\ncontinuing in equal steps to 100 percent of meter rating. (ii)\n\nVelocity type meters. Two tests shall be\nmade at each of three load points approximately equal to 50 percent, 75 percent\nand 100 percent of meter rating. (6)\n\nEach main line metering orifice plate\nused in conjunction with a steam flow meter of the velocity type shall be\ninspected and its diameter measured for conformity with the original\ninstallation at least once every five years. (7)\n\nThe diameter of each main line metering\norifice plate removed from service shall be measured and entered on a record\nwhich shall be retained for a period of at least one year. (c) Steam flow meters--head type. (1)\n\nThe test made in accordance with section\n400.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart of steam flow meters of the head type shall consist of the following: (i) Certification of the primary element, including the orifice plate, for conformance with the applicable provisions set\nforth in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers Standards, covering flow\nmeasurement (presently designated PTC 19.5; 4-1959), in effect at the time of\nthe test. (ii)\n\nVerification of the\ncorrectness of the meter constant. (iii)\n\nThe test of the secondary element (flow\nmechanism) shall be made in place on the customer's premises at each of five\nload points approximately equal to 20 percent, 40 percent, 60 percent, 80\npercent and 100 percent of meter rating. (2)\n\nOn subsequent tests, the procedure in\nsubparagraph (1)(iii) of this subdivision shall be followed. (3)\n\nEach metering orifice plate shall be\ninspected and its diameter measured for conformity with the original\ninstallation at least once every five years. (4)\n\nThe diameter of each metering orifice\nplate removed from service shall be measured and entered on a record which\nshall be retained for a period of at least one year. (d) Steam condensate meters. (1)\n\nSteam condensate meters shall be tested\nusing water as the testing medium. (2)\n\nTwo tests shall be made at each of two\nload points with the meter passing a known quantity of water at rates of flow\napproximately equal to first, 100 percent and second, 50 percent of meter\nrating. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n400.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
