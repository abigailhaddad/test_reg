  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.18 - Deferred reduction in formula earnings - hold harmless provision\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnder certain circumstances where an unspecified public\ntransportation system reduces the number of vehicle miles of service, the\n\nDepartment of Transportation may approve (for one year) the deferral of any\ncorresponding reductions in service payments. In order for the Department of\n\nTransportation to approve, with the concurrence of the Director of the Budget, such a deferred reduction in service payments, the following conditions must be\nmet: (a) hold harmless eligibility\ncriteria defined: (1)\n\nThe public\ntransportation system must be a county, or city. (Services contracted directly\nby the Department of Transportation are not eligible.)\n(2)\n\nThe city or county must contribute an\nenhanced cash match as described below, toward covering the operating expenses\nincurred by the public transportation system. A cash match contributed by a\nprivate transportation provider to the city or county and returned by the\npublic transportation system to the private transportation provider for the\npurpose of meeting the cash match requirement will not be considered an\neligible cash match for the purposes of this provision. (b) Procedure defined: (1)\n\nThe public transportation system must\nsubmit to the Department of Transportation a service and fare policy plan. This\nplan is required in order that the Department can assess whether the service\nreductions are fair and equitable and whether essential services are being\nmaintained. In order to accomplish these objectives, the plan should contain\nthe following information. (i) a description\nof the services provided prior to the service reductions; (ii)\na description of the service\nreductions; (iii)\nan explanation of\nthe process and/or criteria used to identify the particular service reductions\nselected; (iv)\nwhere an entire\nroute is being eliminated, a discussion of the transit alternatives remaining\nfor the affected riders; (v) a\nbudget for the year following the service reductions showing estimates of\npassengers, vehicle miles, operating cost, fare levels, operating revenue, and\nanticipated local, State, and Federal subsidy levels; (vi)\ndocumentation of the sponsoring agency's\ncontribution of the required cash match as described in 975.18(a) (2)\nabove. (2)\n\nThe service\nand fare policy plan must be approved by the Commissioner of the Department of\n\nTransportation. (c) Payment calculation process: In carrying out this provision for deferred\nreductions in service payments, the Department intends to follow the procedures\ndescribed below: (1)\n\nOnce the Commissioner has\napproved a service and fare policy plan, each of the following four service\npayments would then be based on the preceding year's equivalent quarter\npassenger and vehicle mile statistics. (As an example, the October-December\n1987 payment would normally be based on the July-September 1987 statistics. If\nan approved service and fare policy plan were in effect, the July-September\n1986 statistics would determine the October-December 1987 payment level.)\n\nSubsequent service payments will be based in the usual way on the passenger and\nvehicle mile statistics of the immediately-preceding quarter. (2)\n\nThe actual cash match required each\nquarter from the sponsoring agency will consist of two components: (1)\nthe 18-b cash match required by the State\nservice payment generated by the statistics of the quarter occurring one year\nprior to the most recent quarter, plus; (2)\nthe difference between the total State service\npayment generated by the passenger and vehicle miles statistics of the quarter\noccurring one year prior to the most recent quarter and the total State service\npayment that would normally have been generated by the passenger and vehicle\nmile statistics of the most recent quarter, less the difference between the\n18-b match required by the State service payment generated by the statistics of\nthe quarter occurring one year prior to the most recent quarter and the 18-b\nmatch that would normally have been required by the passenger and vehicle mile\nstatistics of the most recent quarter. (3)\n\nFor any public transportation system\ncontracting with more than one transit operator that chooses to take advantage\nof this provision, the Department will compute the additional amount of service\npayments earned under this provision and the required local cash match for the\nentire system not for individual transit operators. In such cases, the public\ntransportation system's service and fare policy plan must address the service\nof all of the sponsored operators and must also propose a method for allocating\nservice payments.
