  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 214.6 - Waste heat (underfire) stacks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Particulate emissions from any waste heat stack must not exceed 0.050 grains\nper dry standard cubic foot and the average opacity of emissions from such\nstack must not exceed 20 percent as measured in accordance with the procedures\nset forth in subdivision (b) of this section. (b) For the purpose of determining compliance\nwith subdivision (a) of this section, the observer must stand at a distance\nsufficient to provide a clear view of the waste heat stack with the sun\noriented in the 140° sector of his back. The observer will, as much as\npossible, make his observations from a position where his line of vision is\nperpendicular to the plume direction. The opacity of emissions will be computed\nby averaging the results of 24 consecutive opacity observations made at\n15-second intervals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n214.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
