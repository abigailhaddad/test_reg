  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 174.3 - Computation of tuition charges for pupils who have received a high school diploma\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe charge for the instruction of each pupil of not more\nthan 21 years of age, who has received a high school diploma and who is not a\nveteran, shall not exceed the actual net cost of educating such pupil. If the\naccounting records of the school district providing such instruction are not\nmaintained in a manner which would indicate the net cost of educating such\npupil, a board of education, board of trustees or sole trustee of each school\ndistrict shall compute the tuition to be charged for the instruction of each\npupil admitted to the schools of such district, or for the education of whom\nsuch district contracts with a board of cooperative educational services, in\naccordance with the following formulae: (a) The tuition to be charged by a school\ndistrict which provides full-day instruction for such pupil shall be computed\nas follows: (1)\n\nThe total general fund\nappropriation shall be ascertained from the district budget for the school\nyear. The amount of such appropriation shall be reduced by the amount of the\nappropriations for transportation, including debt service for buses, adult\neducation, special schools, community services, and any other appropriations\nwhich do not benefit such student. General fund revenue and interfund revenue, as well as Federal aid which is not paid to the district on behalf of such\npupil, shall also be deducted from such total general fund\nappropriation. (2)\n\nThe cost of\ninstruction for such pupil shall be determined on the basis of such total\ngeneral fund appropriation, as reduced in accordance with the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, which is attributable to the instructional\nprogram offered by the district to pupils in grades 7 through 12. If the\nrecords of the school district do not accurately reflect the actual\nappropriation to such program, a portion of the total general fund\nappropriation shall be attributed to such program in the same proportion as the\ncost of teachers' salaries for such instructional program bears the total\namount of teachers' salaries on a district-wide basis. (3)\n\nThe maximum tuition which may be charged\nshall be determined by dividing the cost of instruction attributed to the\nprogram of instruction for pupils in grades 7 through 12 by the estimated\naverage daily attendance of pupils in such grade level. (b) The tuition to be charged by a school\ndistrict for the instruction of such pupil who is enrolled in an instructional\nprogram operated by a board of cooperative educational services shall include\nthe tuition charged by the board of cooperative educational services for such\ninstruction, and the cost of any instruction which such district may also\nprovide such student, to be determined in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (c) The tuition to be charged by a school\ndistrict for instruction of such pupil who is enrolled on a part-time basis in\nsuch district, shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nThe cost of such instruction on a\nfull-time basis shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (a) or (b) of this section. (2)\n\nThe cost of such instruction shall be\nmultiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of class\nperiods per week in which such pupil received such instruction and the\ndenominator of which shall be the total number of class periods, not to exceed\n25, operated by the same school district during the week. (3)\n\nThe product of the computation made in\naccordance with the preceding paragraph shall be the maximum tuition which may\nbe charged. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
