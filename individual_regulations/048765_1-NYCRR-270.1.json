For the purpose of this\nsection, the following terms shall have the following meanings, unless the\ncontext clearly indicates otherwise: (1)\n\nLight transmittance means the fraction of incident light at a specified\nwavelength that passes through a representative sample of a particular\nsub-grade of Grade A maple syrup. (2)\n\nSoluble solids, expressed as a\npercentage, means the proportion of maple sap solids in the applicable\nsolvent. (3)\n\nTc means the\npercentage of light transmission through maple syrup, measurable by a\nspectrophotometer, using matched square optical cells having a 10-millimeter\nlight path at a wavelength of 560 nanometers, the color values being expressed\nin percent of light transmission as compared to A.R. Glycerol fixed at 100\npercent transmission. (b) Standards of identity. (1)\n\nMaple syrup is the liquid made by the\nevaporation of pure sap or sweet water obtained by tapping a maple tree. Maple\nsyrup contains minimum soluble solids of 66.0 percent and maximum soluble\nsolids of 68.9 percent. Maple syrup includes, and is either, Grade A Maple\n\nSyrup or Processing Grade Maple Syrup, as defined in paragraphs (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision. (2)\n\nGrade A maple\nsyrup means maple syrup that is not fermented, is not turbid, and contains or\nhas no objectionable odors, off-flavors or sediment. Grade A maple syrup must\nfall within one of the color and taste sub-grades of Grade A maple syrup set\nforth in subparagraph (i), (ii), (iii), or (iv) of this paragraph. (i) Grade A golden color and delicate taste\nmaple syrup has a uniform light golden color, a delicate to mild taste, and a\nlight transmittance of 75 percent Tc or more. (ii)\n\nGrade A amber color and rich taste maple\nsyrup has a uniform amber color, a rich or full-bodied taste, and a light\ntransmittance of 50 percent - 74.9 percent Tc. (iii)\n\nGrade A dark color and robust taste\nmaple syrup has a uniform dark color, a robust or strong taste, and a light\ntransmittance of 25 percent - 49.9 percent Tc. (iv)\n\nGrade A very dark and strong taste maple\nsyrup has a uniform very dark color, a very strong taste, and a light\ntransmittance of less than 25 percent Tc. (3)\n\nProcessing grade maple syrup means maple\nsyrup that does not meet the requirements for Grade A maple syrup set forth in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. Processing Grade Maple Syrup may not be\nsold, offered for sale or distributed in retail food stores or directly to\nconsumers for household use. (c) Nomenclature label statement. (1)\n\nThe name of the food defined in paragraph\n(b)(2) of this section is \"Grade A Maple Syrup\". The name \"Grade A Maple Syrup\"\nmust conspicuously appear on the principal display panel of the food's label, and the words \"golden color and delicate taste\", \"amber color and rich taste\", \"dark color and robust taste\", or \"very dark color and strong taste\", as\nappropriate, must also conspicuously appear on the food's principal display\npanel in close proximity to the food's name and in a size reasonably related to\nthe size of the name of the food. (2)\n\nThe name of the food defined in paragraph\n(b)(3) of this section is \"Processing Grade Maple Syrup\". The name \"Processing\n\nGrade Maple Syrup\" must conspicuously appear on the principal display panel of\nthe food's label, and the words \"For Food Processing Only\" and \"Not for Retail\n\nSale\" must also conspicuously appear on the food's principal display panel in\nclose proximity to the food's name and in a size reasonably related to the size\nof the name of the food.
