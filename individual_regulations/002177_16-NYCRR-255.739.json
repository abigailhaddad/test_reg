  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.739 - Pressure-limiting and -regulating stations: inspection and testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\npressure-limiting station, relief device (except rupture discs), and\npressure-regulating station and its equipment must be subjected, at intervals\nnot exceeding 15 months, but at least once each calendar year, to inspections\nand tests to determine that: (1)\nit is in\ngood mechanical condition; (2)\nit\nis adequate from the standpoint of capacity and reliability of operation for\nthe service in which it is employed; (3)\nexcept as provided in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, it is set to function at the correct pressure consistent with the\npressure limits of section\n255.201\n(b) of\nthis Part; and\n(4)\nit is properly\ninstalled and protected from dirt, liquids or other conditions that might\nprevent proper operation. (b) For steel pipelines whose MAOP is\ndetermined under section\n255.619\n(c) of\nthis Part, if the MAOP is 60 psi (414 kPa) gauge or more, the control or relief\npressure limit is as follows: If the MAOP produces a hoop stress that\nis: Then the pressure limit is: Greater than 72 percent of SMYS\nMAOP plus 4 percent\n\nUnknown as a percentage of SMYS\nA pressure that will prevent unsafe operation of\nthe pipeline considering its operating and maintenance history and MAOP. (c) If during the annual or any other\nregulating station inspection, the inspector finds that the regulator is not\nadequately protected from dirt or liquids, or does not respond properly to\nperformance tests, an internal inspection shall be conducted and parts thereof\noverhauled to the extent necessary. (d) The operating condition of all operating\npressure regulator stations except field regulators shall be inspected at least\nonce each month. Such inspection shall include proper tests for gas leaks. A\ntest with a combustible gas indicating instrument shall be conducted in all\noperating regulator stations contained in vaults, pits or other enclosed below\ngrade and any unventilated aboveground building areas. (e) All stations shall be inspected\nperiodically for excessive vibration in control piping. All suspect\nconfiguration shall be corrected promptly. (f) All combustible gas alarm systems shall\nbe inspected in accordance with the manufacturer's recommended\ninstructions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.739\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
