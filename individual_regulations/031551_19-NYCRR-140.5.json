  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 140.5 - Rejection and resubmission of applications\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf an application is found not entitled to registration, the department will advise the applicant and give the reasons for the\nrejection. The applicant has six months following the rejection within which to\nreply or amend the application, which will then be re-examined. This procedure\nmay be repeated until: (a) the\ndepartment finally refuses registration; or\n(b) the applicant allows the six-month\nresponse period to lapse without filing a reply, amendment, or appeal. If the applicant fails to file a proper response within six\nmonths, the application is deemed abandoned. An abandoned application may be\nrevived as a pending application if it is shown to the satisfaction of the\ndepartment that the delay was unavoidable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n140.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
