  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 33.3 - The index\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General provisions. Lending institutions may use any single index from among\nthe indices approved by the Superintendent of Banks pursuant to Part 333 of\nthis Title on the terms stated therein. The loan rates may be based directly on\nthe index values, may be based upon the index values plus or minus additional\npercentage points, or may be separately established and stated; provided, however, that variations in the rates shall correspond directly to the\nmovements of the index. While only a single index shall be used for the life of\na loan, the lending institution may provide for the use of a substitute index\nsimilar to the initial index in the event that the initial index should become\nunavailable during the term of the loan. This Part imposes no requirement on\nlending institutions to place limitations on the adjustment in the loan rate, as such adjustment would otherwise be allowed by movements in the index. Interest rate adjustments may be rounded, as determined by the lending\ninstitution, to the nearest percentage point or fraction thereof, provided that\nrounding applies equally to decreases and increases in rates. Subject to the\nrounding provisions, increases in the index need not be reflected on each\nadjustment date but may be accumulated to the next adjustment date, but\ndecreases in the index must be reflected on each adjustment date. (b) Information and disclosures with respect\nto the history of the index. The disclosure shall identify the index and shall\ncontain a statement that past changes in the index are not necessarily\npredictive of future changes in the index. The lending institution shall\nprovide the high and low figures for the index and the dates at which these\nlevels were reached, for each of the three calendar years preceding the\ncalendar year in which the loan is made. In addition, if a loan is made after\n\nAugust 31st of any calendar year, the disclosure shall include the high and low\nfigures for the index's performance through June 30th of that year, and such\ndisclosure may be used as the disclosure of the high and low in index\nperformance for the calendar year next preceding the calendar year in which the\nloan is made, for any loan made prior to March 1st of a calendar\nyear. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n33.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
