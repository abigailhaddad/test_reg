  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 8.13 - Advance for travel expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nGenerally, agencies are expected to provide each agency\ntraveler with a credit care enabling the traveler to charge traveling expenses\ndirectly to the State and to avoid the need for the agency to make an advance\npayment to a traveler for traveling expenses. However, an agency may advance\nfunds to a traveler for traveling expenses when it is in the best interests of\nthe State to do so, and a traveler shall account for such a payment upon\ncompletion of the travel for which the payment was advanced. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n8.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
