  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 75.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, the terms hereinafter listed\nshall mean as follows: (a) Landing\narea. Any locality, either of land or water, including airports and\nintermediate landing fields, which is used or intended to be used for the\nlanding and takeoff of aircraft, whether or not facilities are provided for\nshelter, servicing or repair of aircraft or for receiving or discharging\npassengers or cargo. (b) Airport. Any landing area used regularly by aircraft for receiving or discharging\npassengers or cargo; or for the landing and takeoff of aircraft being used for\npersonal or training purposes. (c) Airport improvement. The extension, alteration, addition to or realignment of\nthe runway(s) of an existing airport, or the modification in any way of the\nlanding or takeoff directions at such an airport. (d) Approach surface. (1)\n\nFor airports used by fixed-wing aircraft. An imaginary plane sloping upward from a point at the same elevation as, and\n200 feet from, the appropriate runway end to provide the required clearances\nabove roads, waterways and railroads. (See Exhibit A [Appendix A-6, infra] for\napplicable approach surface dimensions.)\n(2)\n\nFor heliports. An imaginary plane sloping\nupward from the helipad primary surface to provide the required clearances\nabove roads, waterways and railroads. (See Exhibit B [Appendix A-6, infra] for\napplicable approach surface dimensions.)\n(e) Approach zone. A trapezoidal area formed\nby the projection of the approach surface onto the ground directly below the\napproach surface. Approach zone dimensions are the same as those of the\nassociated approach surface and vary according to runway category, as shown in\n\nExhibit C for airports and Exhibit D for heliports (Appendix A-6, infra) (see\n\"approach surface\", subdivision [d] of this section). (f) Primary surface. That surface which is\nlongitudinally centered on a runway or landing area centerline extending the\nfull length of either side of, and 200 feet beyond the ends of, a runway. It is\nthe same elevation as the nearest point of the runway centerline. The primary\nsurface width will vary according to the runway category (see dimension A on\n\nExhibit A). The primary surface of a helipad is the overall size of the landing\narea (see dimensions R & S on Exhibit B) (Appendix A-6, infra). (g) Lateral transition surface. An area on\neach side of the primary surface of the runway or landing area and approach\nsurface. The lateral transition surface slopes upward and outward on a\nseven-to-one plane for airports and a two-to-one plane for heliports (see\n\nExhibits C and D [Appendix A-6, infra] for applicable lateral transition\nsurface dimensions for airports and heliports, respectively). The same\nclearances apply for lateral transition surfaces as apply for approach surfaces\n(see Exhibits A and B [Appendix A-6, infra]). (h) Lateral transition zone. An area on the\nground formed by the projection of the lateral transition surface onto the\nground directly below the lateral transition surface. Lateral transition zone\ndimensions are the same as those of the associated lateral transition surface\nand vary according to runway category, as shown in Exhibit C for airports and\n\nExhibit D for heliports (Appendix A-6, infra) (see \"lateral transition\nsurface\", subdivision [g] of this section). (i) Visual runway. A runway intended solely\nfor the operation of aircraft using visual approach procedures, with no\nstraight-in instrument approach procedure and no instrument designations. There\nare two types of visual runways: (1)\n\nUtility\nrunway. A runway that is constructed for, and intended to be used by, propeller-driven aircraft of 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight and\nless. (2)\n\nLarger than utility\nrunway. A runway that is constructed for, and intended to be used by, propeller-driven aircraft of more than 12,500 pounds maximum gross weight, and\nturbofan and turbojet aircraft. (j) Non-precision instrument runway. A runway\nhaving an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing air navigation\nfacilities with only horizontal guidance, or area-type navigation equipment, for which a straight-in, non-precision instrument approach procedure has been\napproved, or planned, and for which no precision approach facilities are\nplanned, or indicated on an approved FAA planning document. (k) Precision instrument runway. A runway\nhaving an existing instrument approach procedure utilizing an Instrument\n\nLanding System (ILS). It also means a runway for which a precision approach\nsystem is planned and is also indicated on an FAA-approved airport layout plan\nor any other FAA planning document. (l) Instrument Landing System (ILS). An\n\nInstrument Landing System (ILS) is a system which provides aircraft the\nlateral, longitudinal and vertical guidance necessary for a landing. (m) Aircraft operation. Either a landing or\ntakeoff by an aircraft. (n) Aircraft. Any contrivance, now or hereafter invented, for avigation of or\nflight in the air, except a parachute or other contrivance designed for use as, and carried primarily for, safety equipment. (1)\n\nFixed-wing aircraft. An aircraft, the\nsupport of which in the air is normally derived from airfoils that are\nstationary. (2)\n\nHelicopter/rotary-wing aircraft. An aircraft, the support of which in the air\nis normally derived from airfoils mechanically rotated about an approximately\nvertical axis. (3)\n\nBalloon. An\naircraft, the support of which in the air is normally derived from its own\nbuoyancy. (o) Heliport/helipad. An airport used exclusively by helicopters (see \"airport\", subdivision [b] of this section). (p) Seaplane operational area. That part of a\nbody of water on which seaplane operations take place. (q) Approach/departure paths. The centerline\nof approach surfaces (see \"approach surface\", subdivision [d] of this\nsection). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n75.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
