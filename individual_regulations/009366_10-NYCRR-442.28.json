  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.28 - Physician remuneration\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1680 ]\n(a) Due to the numerous types of financial\nand work arrangements between hospitals and hospital-based physicians, comparability of costs between hospitals may be significantly impaired. This\nsection deals with the methods to be used in recording costs and revenues\nrelated to the services of hospital-based physicians. (b) Financial arrangements. [ 1681 ]\n(1)\n\nAlthough the variations in financial arrangements between hospitals and\nhospital-based physicians are endless, there are five general types of such\narrangements: (i) Agency arrangement. The\nhospital bills patients for the physician's professional services, but records\nthese billings as liabilities and the subsequent payment to the physician as a\nreduction of that liability. The hospital reflects no operating revenue or\nexpense relative to the professional component. (ii)\n\nCompensation arrangement. The hospital\nbills patients for the physician's contractual professional services, including\nthis amount as hospital revenue. All cost center expenses are paid by the\nhospital. The hospital remits a fee or pays a salary to the physician which is\nincluded in hospital expense. The compensation arrangement can be either fixed\nor variable. Under a fixed compensation arrangement the physician is paid a\nspecific dollar amount (salary) unrelated to volume of services rendered. Under\nthe variable compensation arrangement the physician's compensation will be a\npercentage of departmental gross charges or net collections. The actual\ncompensation received by the physician will vary in proportion to the number of\nprocedures performed and to the total charges made by the hospital. This\narrangement includes those physicians providing patient services in the Daily\n\nHospital Services cost centers. (iii)\n\nContracted arrangement. Under this\narrangement, the physician may pay any or all expenses of the cost center. The\nhospital bills patients for the departmental services and remits a fee to the\nphysician. This fee would typically be designed to cover the expenses incurred\nby the physician and are recorded as Professional Fees (Natural classification\nof expense.31) regardless of the expenses incurred by the physician. (iv)\n\nRental arrangement. The physician bills\nthe patients for certain of the Part A and Part B component (as defined by\n\nMedicare) and incurs all substantial direct expenses. The physician remits a\nfee to cover certain hospital expenses. This fee is recorded as operating\nrevenue in the appropriate revenue center. (v) Independent/separate arrangement. The\nfunctions are provided by an independent physician or group of physicians. Neither revenues nor expenses are incurred by the hospital. The hospital refers\npatients and/or specimens to the physician or group, which is usually located\non separate premises. No costs are incurred and no revenue is received under\nthis arrangement. (2)\n\nNote. Compensation paid to interns and residents is not to be\nincluded in the revenue producing cost centers, but must be charged to the\n\nPostgraduate Medical Education cost centers, accounts 8240 and 8250. (c) Work\narrangement. [ 1682 ]\n(1)\n\nThe services provided by hospital-based physicians may be categorized into six\ngeneral types. (i) Professional\ncomponent-providing direct patient care. (ii)\n\nEducation-teaching and supervising\nstudent activity in educational programs. (iii)\n\nResearch-working on research\nprojects. (iv)\n\nMedical care\nreview-serving on the hospital's Medical Care Review Committee. (v) Hospital administration-administering\noverall hospital activities (including hospital committees). (vi)\n\nCost center supervision-supervision and\nother activities of the cost center. (2)\n\nWhen physicians are involved in more than\none of the above functional activities, their remuneration, if any, must be\nrecorded in the cost center for which services are paid. Prior to a trial\nbalance under the Federal uniform reporting system, their remuneration must be\nreclassified to the appropriate cost centers. (3)\n\nFor example, if a physician is paid and\nspends 40 percent of his time in direct care of patients, 10 percent in\neducational activities, 15 percent in research, 5 percent in medical care\nreview activities, 10 percent in administrative duties outside the department, and 20 percent in supervision of the department, the reclassification of his\nremuneration would be as follows: (i) Distribution. 40 percent Physician's Professional Component (this\namount must be reported in the Medical Staff Services cost center, account\n8730). 10 percent Education Costs (to account\n8220-8299). 15 percent Research Projects (to account\n8010-8199). 5 percent Medical Care Review (to account 8740). 10 percent Hospital Administration (to account\n8610). 20 percent Cost Center Supervision (remains in the cost\ncenter). (ii)\n\nComputation. If the above physician is assigned to the Coronary Care cost center and is paid\n$50,000 annually, including employee benefits, the following reclassifications\nwould be required for reporting purposes: Professional Component\n40% of $50,000 = $20,000-to account\n8730\n\nEducation\n10 of $50,000 = $5,000-to account\n8220-8299\n\nResearch\n15% of $50,000 = $7,500-to account\n8010-8199\n\nMedical Care Review\n5% of $50,000 = $2,500-to account\n8740\n\nHospital Administration\n10% of $50,000 = $5,000-to account\n8610\n\nCost Center Supervisor\n20% of $50,000 = $10,000-remains in assigned\ncost center. (4)\n\nThe reclassification of the professional\ncomponent from the assigned cost centers to the Medical Staff Services cost\ncenter, account 8730 is necessary in order to obtain comparable direct costs\nbetween hospitals which employ physicians and hospitals which do not. (5)\n\nThe reclassification of the other\ncomponents is to obtain functional\ncomparability. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
