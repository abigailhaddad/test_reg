  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4410.2 - Out-of-state double exacta\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndouble exacta (or other approved name) is a form of pari-mutuel wagering\nconducted by an off-track betting corporation on out-of-state races. Each\nbettor selects, in order, the first and second placed horses in each of the two\nraces designated and advertised by the corporation as the double exacta races. To win, except as hereinafter provided, a ticket must bear, in exact order, the\nfirst and second placed horses in each double exacta race as designated on the\nticket. The double exacta pool shall be held entirely separate from all other\npools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, triple or other wagering\npool. (b) Resale of double exacta\ntickets from one individual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for\nejection, and may be deemed illegal gambling. (c) Races in which double exacta pools shall\nbe conducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly\ndesignated in the program and racing cards and mutuel tickets issued by the\ncorporation. (d) The design of\ndouble exacta tickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from\nother pari-mutuel tickets. (e) Scratch. (1)\n\nIf a horse is scratched or\ndeclared a nonstarter in either of the two races designated as the double\nexacta races before the running of the first of those races, no further double\nexacta tickets may be issued designating such horse and all double exacta\ntickets previously issued designating such horse shall be refunded and the\nmoney deducted from the gross pool. (2)\n\nShould any horse be scratched or declared\na nonstarter in the second half of the double exacta after the first half of\nthe double exacta has been raced, all tickets combining the scratched horse\nwith the winning combination of the first half shall become consolation tickets\nand shall be paid at a price per dollar bet determined as follows: the net\ndouble exacta pool (gross pool less commission) shall be divided by the total\npurchase price of all double exacta tickets combining the winners of the first\nhalf of the double exacta, and the result obtained shall constitute the\nconsolation prize to be paid per dollar bet. The total amount payable on\nconsolation tickets shall be deducted from the net double exacta\npool. (f) Failure to\nselect a winning combination. (1)\n\nIf no\ndouble exacta ticket is sold combining the winner and second place horse in\norder in the first half of the double exacta, all double exacta tickets\ndesignating the winner to win in the first half shall be considered a winning\ncombination and shall be eligible for participation in the second half of the\ndouble exacta. In the event one horse only finishes and is declared winner, all\ndouble exacta tickets designating that horse to win in the first half shall be\nconsidered winning combinations and shall be eligible for participation in the\nsecond half of the double exacta. (2)\n\nIf no double exacta ticket is sold\ndesignating the winner of the first half of the double exacta to win, all\ndouble exacta tickets shall be eligible for participation in the second\nhalf. (3)\n\nIf the first half of the\ndouble exacta is cancelled or declared \"no race\", the double exacta shall be\ndeclared off and the gross pool refunded. (4)\n\nIf no double exacta ticket is sold\ncombining the winner and second place horse in order in the second half of the\ndouble exacta, the net double exacta pool shall be distributed to holders of\ndouble exacta tickets designating the winning combination of the first half and\nthe second half winner to win. If no double exacta ticket is sold designating\nthe winning combination of the first half and the winner to win in the second\nhalf of the double exacta, the net pool shall be distributed as a win pool to\nholders of those tickets designating the winning combination of the first half\nof the double exacta. (5)\n\nIf for\nany reason, the second half of the double exacta races is cancelled or declared\n\"no race\", the net pool shall be distributed as in a win pool to holders of\ntickets designating the winning combination of the first half of the double\nexacta. (g) Dead heats. (1)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat for win in\nthe first half of the double exacta, all double exacta tickets designating the\nwinners in any combination are eligible for participation in the second half of\nthe double exacta pool in accordance with established pari-mutuel practice\nrelative to dead heats in win pools. (2)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat for win in\nthe second half of the double exacta, the double exacta pool shall be\ndistributed to each combination of winners separately as in a win pool dead\nheat in accordance with established pari-mutuel practice relative to dead\nheats. (3)\n\nIn the event of a dead\nheat for place in the first half of the double exacta, all double exacta\ntickets combining the winner with each second place horse are eligible for\nparticipation in the second half of the double exacta pools in accordance with\nestablished pari-mutuel practice relative to dead heats in win pools. (4)\n\nIn the event of a dead heat for place in\nthe second half of the double exacta, the double exacta pool shall be divided\nas in a win pool dead heat among holders of double exacta tickets combining the\nwinner with each second place horse in accordance with established pari-mutuel\npractice relative to dead heats. (h) In the event of occurrences not\nencompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall\nbe formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel practice and in\naccordance with the distribution philosophy set forth herein; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made on the basis of\noutstanding tickets, the method of formulation announced by the corporation and\nupon which basis payments have been made shall be deemed conclusively correct\nand not subject to review. (i) Coupled entries and fields for betting purposes shall not be allowed in the\ndouble exacta, and all horses, even if so coupled at the out-State track, shall\nbe deemed separate betting interests by the corporation; provided, however, that such fact shall be advertised to the public in each betting\nfacility. (j) Copies of this\nsection shall be made available free of charge to the public in each betting\nfacility of the corporation. (k) Placing of horses shall follow the official placing for betting purposes at the\nout-of-state track and such placing shall be conclusive for distribution\npurposes herein. (l) Pools of all\noff-track betting corporations conducting a double exacta on the same races\nshall be combined into a single statewide pool for the calculation of odds and\nthe determination of payouts which shall be uniform throughout the\n\nState.
