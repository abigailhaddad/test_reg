Tit. 7 § 305.4 - Restraint orders\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any inmate\nassigned to an SHU who has history of assaultive behavior and/or who presents a\nthreat to the safety or security of himself/herself, other persons, or State\nproperty may be placed under a restraint order by the deputy superintendent for\nsecurity or, in his/her absence, the O.D. or higher ranking\nauthority. (b) A restraint order\nwill be valid for no more than seven days and may be renewed by the deputy\nsuperintendent for security or, in his/her absence, the O.D. or higher ranking\nauthority. (c) A copy of the\nrestraint order and any renewal thereafter must be forwarded to the\nsuperintendent and the inmate within 24 hours. The order and any renewal\nthereafter must briefly state the reason(s) for the order or renewal and\ncontain the following notice to the inmate: \"You may write to the deputy\nsuperintendent for security or his/her designee to make a statement as to the\nneed for continuing the restraint order.\"\n(d) A restraint order will describe the types\nof restraints to be used and the manner in which they are to be applied (e.g., handcuffed in front or in back, with or without waist chain, with or without\nleg irons). (e) If an inmate is\nunder a restraint order directing that he/she be mechanically restrained\nwhenever he/she leaves the SHU cell for any reason, the inmate will remain\nmechanically restrained during the entire period of time he/she is out of the\nSHU cell, except: (1)\nupon request of a\nphysician, nurse practitioner, or a physician's assistant (P.A.) when removal\nis necessary to permit medical treatment; (2)\nupon request of the Parole Board at a\nparole hearing; (3)\nupon the\nrequest of a judge or magistrate; (4)\nwhen the inmate can be secured in a\nshower room during the scheduled shower period; (5)\nwhen the inmate has been secured in the\nexercise area, unless the restraint order (or renewal) includes a written\ndetermination stating the reason(s) why the removal of restraints in the\nexercise area would, in the light of the particular circumstances relative to\nthe affected inmate, present a treat to the safety or security of the inmate, other persons or State property. Such a determination, in any restraint order\nor renewal, shall only remain in effect for three days unless approved in\nwriting by the superintendent or acting superintendent, based upon his or her\nreview of the relevant facts. Note: This paragraph does not apply to Southport\n\nCorrectional Facility; (6)\nupon\norder of the deputy superintendent for security services or higher ranking\nauthority; or\n(7)\nwhen in a general\npopulation visiting room and not in a noncontact area. (f) When mechanical restraints are removed\npursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, they will be reapplied as\nspecified in the restraint order prior to return to the SHU cell. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n305.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
