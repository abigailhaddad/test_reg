(b) Certification. (1)\n\nAn enterprise that applies for program\nassistance may obtain certification through any certification program\nadministered by the State Certification Director or a certifying\nagency. (2)\n\nAn enterprise shall be\ndeemed to be a certified minority and/or women-owned business enterprise if the\nenterprise has had its application for certification rejected by the State\n\nCertification Director on the ground that such enterprise is a start up\nbusiness and is ineligible for certification until such time as it can document\nbusiness activity and operational control as a minority-owned business\nenterprise or as a women-owned business enterprise as evidenced by the written\ndetermination of the State Certification Director. Denial of certification on\nany ground will make an applicant ineligible for any form of program\nassistance. In any such instance where financial assistance is approved and\ncertification is rejected on the ground that the start up enterprise cannot\ndocument business activity and operational control as a minority- owned\nbusiness enterprise or women-owned business enterprise, the corporation will\nrequire a completed application for certification to be submitted to the State\n\nCertification Director within one year from the date on which the corporation\nmakes its first disbursement of funds in connection with the project. The\nfailure to so submit an application for certification, the rejection of such\napplication, or the denial of certification and the failure of the enterprise\nto appeal successfully the denial decision in the manner authorized pursuant to\nthe certification guidelines published by the State Certification Director at 9\nNYCRR Part\n544, as in effect from time to time, shall constitute a default by\nthe enterprise. Such default shall release the corporation from all obligations\nwith respect to its assistance under the program and all amounts disbursed or\notherwise paid out or deposited by the corporation in connection with any\nfinancial assistance under the program shall become immediately due and payable\nto the corporation. (c) The following enterprises are ineligible for program assistance: (1)\neducational institutions; and\n(2)\nhospitals or residential health care\nfacilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
