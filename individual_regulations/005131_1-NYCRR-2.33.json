Tit. 1 § 2.33 - Separate rooms-item 5p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pasteurizing, processing, cooling and packaging are conducted in a single\nroom(s), but not in the same room(s) used for the cleaning of milk cans, bottles and cases, or the unloading and/or cleaning and sanitizing of milk tank\ntrucks; provided, that in a receiving station, cooling may be done in the\nroom(s) where milk tank trucks are unloaded and/or cleaned and\nsanitized. (b) All bulk milk\nstorage tanks are vented into a room used for pasteurization, processing, cooling or packaging operations, or into a storage tank gallery room; provided\nthat vents located elsewhere, which are adequately equipped with air filters so\nas to preclude the contamination of the milk, shall be considered\nsatisfactory. (c) Solid doors\ninstalled in required partitions are self-closing. (d) Facilities for the cleaning and\nsanitizing of milk tank trucks are properly equipped for manual and/or\nmechanical operations. When such facilities are not provided on the plant\npremises, these operations shall be performed at a receiving station, transfer\nstation or separate tank-washing installation.

The milk plant must: (1)\n\nProvide\nadequate space for placement of equipment and storage of materials as is\nnecessary for maintenance, sanitary operations, and the production of safe\nfood. (2)\n\nPermit the taking of\nadequate precautions to reduce the potential for allergen cross-contact and for\ncontamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials with\nmicroorganisms, chemicals, filth, and other extraneous material. The potential\nfor allergen cross-contact and for contamination shall be reduced by adequate\nfood safety controls and operating practices or effective design, including the\nseparation of operations in which allergen cross-contact and contamination are\nlikely to occur, by one or more of the following means: location, time, partition, air flow systems, dust control systems, enclosed systems, or other\neffective means.
