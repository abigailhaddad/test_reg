  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-2.3 - Standards for used oil generators\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nGeneral. Except as provided in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, this\nsection applies to all used oil generators. A used oil generator is any person, by site, whose act or process produces used oil or whose act first causes used\noil to become subject to regulation. (i) Household \"do-it-yourselfer\" used oil generators. Household \"do-it-yourselfer\"\nused oil generators are not subject to regulation under this Subpart. (ii)\n\nVessels. Vessels at sea or at port are\nnot subject to this section. For purposes of this section, used oil produced on\nvessels from normal shipboard operations is considered to be generated at the\ntime it is transported ashore. The owner or operator of the vessel and the\nperson(s) removing or accepting used oil from the vessel are co-generators of\nthe used oil and are both responsible for managing the waste in compliance with\nthis section once the used oil is transported ashore. The co-generators may\ndecide among themselves which particular co-generator will fulfill the\nrequirements of this section. In the event of a violation of this section, the\nco-generators are jointly and severally liable for the violations. (iii)\n\nDiesel fuel. Mixtures of used oil and\ndiesel fuel mixed on site by the generator of the used oil for use in the\ngenerator's own vehicles are not subject to this Subpart once the used oil and\ndiesel fuel have been mixed. Prior to mixing, the used oil fuel is subject to\nthe requirements of this section. (iv)\n\nFarmers. Farmers who generate an average\nof 25 gallons or less per month of used oil from vehicles or machinery used on\nthe farm in a calendar year are not subject to the requirements of this\n\nSubpart, if the used oil is used in normal farming operations. Normal farming\noperations do not include land application or land disposal of used\noil. (2)\n\nOther applicable\nprovisions. Used oil generators who conduct the following activities are\nsubject to the requirements of other applicable provisions of this Subpart as\nindicated in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph: (i) Generators who transport used oil, except\nunder the self-transport provisions of paragraphs (e)(1) and (2) of this\nsection, must also comply with section\n374-2.5\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nGenerator processing. (a) Except as provided in clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, generators who process or re-refine\nused oil must also comply with section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart. (b) Generators who perform the following\nactivities are not processors provided that the used oil is generated on-site\nand is not being sent off-site to a burner of on-specification or\noff-specification used oil fuel: (1)\nfiltering, cleaning or otherwise reconditioning used oil before returning it\nfor reuse by the generator; (2)\nseparating used oil from wastewater generated on-site to make the wastewater\nacceptable for discharge or reuse pursuant to section 402 or section 307(b) of\nthe Federal Clean Water Act, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, or other applicable Federal or State regulations governing the\nmanagement or discharge of wastewaters; (3)\nusing oil mist collectors to remove small\ndroplets of used oil from in-plant air to make plant air suitable for continued\nrecirculation; (4)\ndraining or\notherwise removing used oil from materials containing or otherwise contaminated\nwith used oil in order to remove excessive oil to the extent possible pursuant\nto section\n374-2.2\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart; or\n(5)\nfiltering, separating or otherwise reconditioning used oil before burning it in a space\nheater pursuant to subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nGenerators who burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery, except\nunder the on-site space heater provisions of subdivision (d) of this section, must also comply with section\n374-2.7\nof this Subpart. (iv)\n\nGenerators who direct shipments of\noff-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner, or who are\nthe first to claim that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets\nthe used oil fuel specifications, set forth in section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart, must also comply with section\n374-2.8\nof this Subpart. (v) Generators who dispose of used oil must\nalso comply with section\n374-2.9\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) Hazardous waste mixing. (1)\n\nMixtures of used oil and hazardous waste must be managed in accordance with\nsection\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nThe rebuttable\npresumption for used oil as provided in section\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)(i)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart applies to used oil managed by generators. Under the rebuttable presumption for used oil, used oil containing greater than\n1,000 ppm total halogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste and must be\nmanaged as hazardous waste and not as used oil unless the presumption is\nrebutted. However, the rebuttable presumption does not apply to certain\nmetalworking oils/fluids and certain used oils removed from refrigeration\nunits. Laboratory analyses completed for purposes of addressing the rebuttable\npresumption must be performed by a laboratory currently certified under the\nappropriate approval categories by the New York State Department of Health's\n\nEnvironmental Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP).

(iii)\n\nWithin two\nhours of detecting a spill, discharge, or release of used oil, the generator\nmust notify the department Spill Hotline at (800) 457-7362, or, if calling from\nout of state, (518) 457-7362. (d) On-site burning in space\nheaters. Generators may burn used oil in used oil-fired space\nheaters provided that: (1)\nthe heater\nburns only used oil that the owner or operator generates or used oil received\nfrom household do-it-yourselfer used oil generators; (2)\nthe heater is designed to have a maximum\ncapacity of not more than 0.5 million Btu per hour; and\n(3)\nthe combustion gases from the heater are\nvented to the outside ambient air. (e) Off-site shipments. Except as provided in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision, generators must ensure that their used oil is transported only by\ntransporters who have obtained an EPA identification number and are authorized\nunder Part 364 of this Title to transport used oil, if applicable. (1)\n\nSelf-transportation of small amounts to\napproved collection centers. Generators may transport, without an EPA\nidentification number, used oil that is generated at the generator's site and\nused oil collected from household do-it-yourselfers to a used oil collection\ncenter provided that: (i) the generator\ntransports the used oil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an\nemployee of the generator; (ii)\nthe\ngenerator transports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and\n(iii)\nthe generator transports\nthe used oil to a used oil collection center that is permitted pursuant to\nsection\n374-2.4\n(b)(2)(ii)\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nSelf-transportation of small amounts to aggregation points owned by the\ngenerator. Generators may transport, without an EPA identification number, used\noil that is generated at the generator's site to an aggregation point provided\nthat: (i) the generator transports the used\noil in a vehicle owned by the generator or owned by an employee of the\ngenerator; (ii)\nthe generator\ntransports no more than 55 gallons of used oil at any time; and\n(iii)\nthe generator transports the used oil\nto an aggregation point that is owned and/or operated by the same\ngenerator. (3)\n\nTolling\narrangements. Used oil generators may arrange for used oil to be transported by\na transporter without an EPA identification number if the used oil is reclaimed\nunder a contractual agreement pursuant to which reclaimed oil is returned by\nthe processor/re-refiner to the generator for use as a lubricant, cutting oil, or coolant. The contract (known as a \"tolling arrangement\"), must indicate: (i) the type of used oil and the frequency of\nshipments; (ii)\nthat the vehicle\nused to transport the used oil to the processing/re-refining facility and to\ndeliver recycled used oil back to the generator is owned and operated by the\nused oil processor/re-refiner; and\n(iii)\nthat reclaimed oil will be returned to\nthe generator. (f) Service and retail\nestablishments. A\nservice establishment\nis any\nautomobile service station, including gas only outlets, or any other retail\noutlet and boat marina, selling at least 500 gallons of lubricating oil\nannually and having an on-premises oil changing operation. A\nretail\nestablishment\nis every vendor that sells lubricating oil at retail in\nquantities in excess of 1,000 gallons per year. Generators who are service\nestablishments or retail establishments must also comply with the following\nrequirements: (1)\n\nService\nestablishments. (i) An owner or an employee\nof every service establishment who is present on the premises must accept, at\nno charge, used petroleum-based or synthetic lubricating oil in quantities not\nto exceed five gallons per day from any household do-it-yourselfer, in\naccordance with the following requirements: (a) the service establishment must maintain a\ntank or container with sufficient capacity to provide adequate service to\nindividuals, for the temporary storage of used oil; (b) the service establishment may refuse to\naccept used oil if the used oil tank or container is temporarily filled to\ncapacity. If filled to capacity, the service establishment must proceed\nexpeditiously to have the used oil emptied by a used oil transporter authorized\nunder Part 364 of this Title, and must inform individuals when used oil can be\nbrought back to the establishment for collection. (c) the service establishment must accept\nused oil only during the normal business hours of the establishment; (d) the service establishment may require\nused oil to be dropped off in rigid screw-top closed containers; (e) the service establishment may refuse to\naccept used oil if it has been contaminated through other than ordinary and\nnormal use; (f) the service\nestablishment may not impose a separate charge or fee upon any individual for\nacceptance or disposal of used oil, whether or not the individual is a customer\nfor service; and\n(g) the service\nestablishment must conspicuously post a sign in a location which is always open\nto public view, stating: \"WE ACCEPT USED OIL FOR RECYCLING AT NO CHARGE\".
