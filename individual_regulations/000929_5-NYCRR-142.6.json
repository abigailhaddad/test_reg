(b) In the case of any bid\nsubmission, utilization plans shall be submitted after the opening of bids, but\nin no case more than ten (10) business days after the contractor receives\nnotice from a State agency that the contractor has submitted a low bid, provided the agency may adopt a longer time period for submission of\nutilization plans as to all or particular categories of its contracts upon\nfiling of such period and any supporting justification with the director, and\nsubject to rejection or modification by the director. Any such modification or\nrejection shall apply to contract solicitations on or after the date of the\nrejection or modification. (c) The\n\nState agency shall review a utilization plan submitted by a contractor and\nissue a written notice of acceptance or deficiency regarding the utilization\nplan no later than twenty (20) days after receipt of the utilization plan, and\nprior to the execution of the contract resulting from said procurement. A State\nagency may accept a utilization plan if: (1)\nthe contract goals, as determined by the State agency in the solicitation or\nbid, are to be provided by one or more certified minority and/or women-owned\nbusiness enterprises; (2)\nthe\ncontractor submits a utilization plan which only partially satisfies the\ncontract goals set forth in the solicitation, but is supported by the\ncontractor's documented good faith efforts to submit a utilization plan as\nrequested; (3)\nthe contractor is a\njoint venture, teaming agreement, or other similar arrangement, with a\ncertified minority or women-owned business enterprise whose value added or\nparticipation is equal to the percentage of the contract goals set forth in the\nsolicitation; (4)\nthe contractor\nsubmits a mentor-protege agreement acceptable to the agency, which does not\nmeet the goals set forth in the solicitation, but reflects an investment by the\nmentor in the protege roughly equal to the difference between the contract\ngoals set forth in the solicitation and the percentage of value added\nparticipation provided by the protege. (d) The notice of deficiency regarding the\nutilization plan shall include the following information: (1)\na statement that the contract shall not\nbe awarded until a utilization plan has been approved or a waiver\ngranted; (2)\na specific request for\nthe reasons why any certified minority or women-owned business enterprise was\nnot selected to perform the scope of work which the State agency has determined\ncan be reasonably structured by the contractor into subcontract(s) or other\ncomponent(s) for purposes of complying with the State contract certified\nenterprise goal(s); and\n(3)\nany\nother facts relevant to the utilization plan. (e) Unless otherwise specified in the\ninformation, instructions or requirements and any addenda provided to\ncontractors for purposes of soliciting bids or proposals, a contractor must\nprovide a State agency with a written remedy in response to a notice of\ndeficiency within seven (7) business days of its receipt. (f) If the contractor's written remedy to a\nnotice of deficiency is not timely provided or if the written notice is found\nby the State agency to be inadequate such a failure to remedy the deficiency\nmay be grounds for disqualification for non-responsiveness or the State agency\nmay notify the contractor and request the contractor to submit a waiver form\nwithin five (5) business days. Failure to file the waiver form in a timely\nmanner may be grounds for disqualification of the bid for\nnon-responsiveness.

(h) The time requirements of this section\nshall apply unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the State agency and the\ncontractor. (i) If a contractor\nchanges its utilization plan after submission, it shall be required to notify\nthe State agency in writing of such change and obtain approval from the State\nagency in accordance with this section and section\n142.8\nof this Part.
