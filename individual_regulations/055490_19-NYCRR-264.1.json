  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 264.1 - Nature of remedies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A petition\nfor declaratory ruling and request to pass on validity of rules as provided in\nthis Part and in sections 204 and 205 of the State Administrative Procedure Act\n(SAPA) are not the exclusive procedures to secure the relief sought. Both the\napplication of rules and statutes and the validity of rules may be raised in\nadjudicatory proceedings conducted by this agency or in other judicial\nproceedings. If no such proceedings from which a judicial review lies are\npending however, a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules (CPLR) or an action for declaratory judgement may not be maintained with\nrespect to a rule unless a petition for declaratory ruling or a request to pass\non the validity of a rule has first been filed. In both instances, if the\n\nSecretary fails to act within 30 days, the petition or request is deemed denied\nand judicial proceedings may be commenced. (b) Generally, a declaratory ruling is a\nbinding advisory opinion as to the applicability of a rule or statute to a\nparticular state of facts, the purpose of which is to give guidance before\nrather than after the conduct in question occurs. Most often, it addresses a\nset of operable facts which the petitioner poses as a future plan of action and\ncan give binding assurance to the petitioner that certain consequences will\nflow from future conduct unless the declaratory ruling is set aside or modified\nby a court of competent jurisdiction or the law is changed by act of the\n\nLegislature. A declaratory ruling, however, will not extend or limit a rule or\nstatute beyond that which might be reasonably educed from the language of the\nrule or the statute in question. Where a declaratory ruling would be, in\neffect, a regulation then regulations will be published and properly\npromulgated. (c) A request to pass\non the validity of a rule is a necessary step under the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, section 205 before the rule may be judicially challenged under\narticle 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules or in an action for declaratory\njudgement. The grounds upon which the validity of a rule may be challenged are\nthat it violates constitutional provisions, is without statutory authority or\nhas been adopted without substantial compliance with required rule making\nprocedure. Under State Administrative Procedure Act, section 202(8), this last\nground of invalidity, (that of substantial noncompliance with required rule\nmaking procedure) a rule must be judicially challenged within four months of\nthe effective date of the rule. Because the Secretary is bound by the rules and\nregulations of the department, the Secretary can only determine that the\nchallenge itself is meritorious and proceed to give notice of proposed agency\naction to amend or repeal the rule in question or, if the determination is that\nthe challenge is not meritorious, deny the request. After a notice has been\npublished in the State Register, the Secretary may receive comment on the\nproposed agency action and thereafter may or may not take final agency action\non the amendment or repeal. Even if the Secretary initially agrees that the\nrequest is meritorious and commences the rule making process to amend or repeal\nthe rule, this is not final action by the Secretary. The person making the\nrequest is not precluded from commencing judicial proceedings as a protective\nmeasure. If the amendment or repeal of the rule becomes final, the judicial\nproceeding would become moot and would be discontinued. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n264.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
