  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 290.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nCertain inmates serving either a determinate or\nindeterminate sentence for a crime that is not a merit eligible offense as\ndefined in Correction Law section 803, may be eligible to earn a six-month\n\nLimited Credit Time Allowance (LCTA) against their sentences pursuant to\n\nCorrection Law section 803-b, provided that they have achieved certain\nsignificant programmatic accomplishments, have not committed a serious\ndisciplinary infraction or maintained an overall poor institutional record, and\nhave not filed any frivolous lawsuits. In the case of an inmate serving a\nsentence with a maximum term of life for an eligible A-I felony, the six-month\nLCTA benefit is subtracted from the minimum period to establish the inmate's\nLCTA date. In the case of all other LCTA eligible offences, the LCTA benefit is\nsubtracted from the conditional release date to establish the inmate's LCTA\ndate. An LCTA benefit is a privilege to be earned by the inmate and no inmate\nhas the right to demand or require that any such allowance be granted. This\ndirective sets forth the policy and procedures for granting or withholding an\nLCTA benefit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n290.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
