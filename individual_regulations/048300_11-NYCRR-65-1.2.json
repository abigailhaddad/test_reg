  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-1.2 - Requirements for optional basic economic loss coverage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Optional Basic Economic Loss Coverage Endorsement (New York), set out below is approved and promulgated for use by an insurer and, except as provided in section\n65-1.7\nof this Subpart, must be furnished to all insureds who purchase Optional Basic Economic Loss (OBEL) coverage. OPTIONAL BASIC ECONOMIC LOSS COVERAGE ENDORSEMENT\n(New York)\n\nThe Company agrees with the named insured, subject to all of the provisions, exclusions and conditions of the MANDATORY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT (New York) not expressly modified in this Endorsement, as follows: The definition of Basic Economic Loss contained in the MANDATORY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT (New York) or the MANDATORY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT-MOTORCYCLES (New York) is replaced by the following: Basic Economic Loss: Basic economic loss shall consist of medical expense, work loss, other expense and, when death occurs, a death benefit as herein provided. Except for such death benefit, basic economic loss shall not include any loss sustained on account of death. Basic economic loss of each eligible injured person on account of any single accident shall not exceed $75,000, the last $25,000 of which represents optional basic economic loss coverage, payable after the first $50,000 of basic economic loss has been exhausted, that the eligible injured person or that person's legal representative may specify will be applied to one of the following four options: (a) basic economic loss; (b) loss of earnings from work; (c) Psychiatric, physical or occupational therapy and rehabilitation; or\n\nAny death benefit hereunder shall be in addition thereto. Exclusion (c) set forth in the MANDATORY PERSONAL INJURY PROTECTION ENDORSEMENT (New York) is replaced by the following: (c) the named insured or relative while occupying, or while a pedestrian through being struck by, a motor vehicle in New York State, other than the insured motor vehicle, with respect to which the coverage required by the New York Comprehensive Motor Vehicle Insurance Reparations Act is in effect; however, this exclusion does not apply to: (1) the Optional Basic Economic Loss coverage provided under this endorsement, unless OBEL coverage is provided by the policy covering the other motor vehicle; or\n(2) to personal injury sustained in New York State by the named insured or relative while occupying a bus or school bus, as defined in sections 104 and 142 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law, unless that person is the operator, an owner, or an employee of the owner or operator, of such bus or school bus. Election\n\nElection of the OBEL option shall be made by the eligible injured person or that person's legal representative after such person has incurred expense aggregating $30,000 in basic economic loss and after receiving the required notices from the Company that an OBEL election may be made. Failure of the eligible injured person or that person's legal representative to respond to the second notice within 15 calendar days after its mailing shall be considered an election by the eligible injured person to apply OBEL coverage to all elements of basic economic loss. Once made by the eligible injured person or that person's legal representative, an OBEL election cannot be changed. However, if claims payable under OBEL coverage have not yet been received by the Company, an eligible injured person who has failed to respond to the second notice in a timely manner may make an election. Notice\n\nIf OBEL coverage is payable under this policy, but Mandatory PIP is being paid under a policy covering another motor vehicle, then the named insured or relative shall notify the Company no later than 90 days after Mandatory PIP benefits under that other policy have been exhausted. The Company shall then send its OBEL election notice. (b) The insurer shall in connection with new policy applications offer applicants OBEL coverage by sending the applicant the following letter: Dear Applicant: Optional Basic Economic Loss (OBEL) coverage is being offered to you as an enhancement of the Basic No-Fault coverage you are presently required to purchase. But before we describe this coverage, we would like to advise you what benefits Basic No-Fault coverage does and does not provide. No-Fault coverage, otherwise known as Personal Injury Protection or \"PIP\" coverage, pays for expenses incurred by persons injured in a motor vehicle accident. This coverage does not pay to repair damage to your automobile. Basic No-Fault, which you are required by law to purchase, provides coverage of up to $50,000 per person in benefits for: 1. all necessary doctor and hospital bills and other health service expenses, payable in accordance with fee schedules established or adopted by the New York State Insurance Department; and\n2. 80% of lost earnings up to a maximum monthly payment of $2,000 for up to three years following the date of accident; and\n3. up to $25 per day for a period of one year from the date of the accident for other reasonable and necessary expenses the injured person may have incurred because of an injury resulting from the accident, such as the cost of hiring a housekeeper or necessary transportation expenses to and from a health service provider; and\n4. a $2,000 death benefit, payable to the estate of a covered person, in addition to the $50,000 coverage for economic loss described above. No-Fault benefits will be reduced by other benefits that are payable under Workers' Compensation, Social Security Disability, New York State Disability, and certain employer \"wage continuation\" plans where an employee does not lose any future sick leave benefits. [In addition to the basic No-Fault coverage described, higher limits of up to ___________, including payments of up to __________ for loss of earnings and up to ___________ for other reasonable and necessary expenses, are available for purchase upon request.] [FN13]\nOPTIONAL COVERAGE AVAILABLE\nIn addition to Basic No-Fault Coverage, you may also purchase OBEL coverage that will pay certain expenses, up to $25,000, above the Basic No-Fault limit of $50,000. OBEL coverage is different from other coverages in that a claimant can select the kinds of benefits to be paid under OBEL. If you purchase OBEL coverage and if it appears likely that a claimant will use up the Basic No-Fault coverage, your insurer will send the claimant a form for the claimant to choose what expenses the $25,000 in OBEL coverage will be used to pay. Under No-Fault, a claimant could include you, family members, passengers in your car, or pedestrians, if injured in an auto accident. The claimant will be able to choose one of the following four OBEL options and thereby direct the insurer to pay expenses for: 1. basic economic loss, whether health care expenses, loss of earnings from work, or other reasonable and necessary expenses; 2. loss of earnings from work; 3. psychiatric, physical or occupational therapy and rehabilitation; or\n4. a combination of options 2 and 3. The additional $25,000 of OBEL coverage will be used only for costs incurred under the chosen option, which, once selected, the claimant cannot change. If you have any questions, please contact your Company or agent. [FN13] This Additional PIP language may be deleted at the insurer's option. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
