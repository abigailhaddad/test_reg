  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 380-11.4 - Table II Effluent Concentrations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The columns in Table II of this Subpart\ncaptioned \"Effluents,\" \"Air,\" and \"Water,\" are applicable to the assessment and\ncontrol of dose to the public, particularly in the implementation of the\nprovisions of section\n380-5.2\nof this Part. The\nconcentration values given in Columns 1 and 2 of Table II are equivalent to the\nradionuclide concentrations which, if inhaled or ingested continuously over the\ncourse of a year, would produce a total effective dose equivalent of 0.05 rem\n(50 millirems or 0.5 millisieverts) to reference man, except for noble gasses. For noble gasses, the concentration values given in Column 1 of Table II are\nequivalent to the radionuclide concentration that would produce a total\neffective dose equivalent of 0.10 rem (100 millirems or 1 millisieverts) due to\nsubmersion. (b) Consideration of\nnon-stochastic limits has not been included in deriving the air and water\neffluent concentration values because non-stochastic effects are presumed not\nto occur at the dose levels established for individual members of the public. For radionuclides, where the non-stochastic limit was governing in deriving the\noccupational DAC, the stochastic ALI was used in deriving the corresponding\nairborne effluent limit in Table II. For this reason, the DAC and airborne\neffluent limits are not always proportional. (c) The air concentration values listed in\n\nTable II, Column 1 were derived by one of two methods. For those radionuclides\nfor which the stochastic limit is governing, the occupational stochastic\ninhalation ALI was divided by 2.4 x 10\n9, relating\nthe inhalation ALI to the DAC, as explained above, and then divided by a factor\nof 300. The factor of 300 includes the following components: a factor of 50 to\nrelate the 5-rem annual occupational dose limit to the 0.1-rem limit for\nmembers of the public; a factor of 3 to adjust for the difference in exposure\ntime and the inhalation rate for a worker and that for members of the public; and a factor of 2 to adjust the occupational values (derived for adults) so\nthat they are applicable to other age groups. (d) For those radionuclides for which\nsubmersion (external dose) is limiting, the occupational DAC in Table I, Column\n3, was divided by 219. The factor of 219 is composed of a factor of 50, as\ndescribed above, and a factor of 4.38 relating occupational exposure for 2,000\nhours per year to full-time exposure (8,760 hours per year). Note that an\nadditional factor of 2 for age considerations is not warranted in the\nsubmersion case. (e) The water\nconcentrations were derived by taking the most restrictive occupational\nstochastic oral ingestion ALI and dividing by 7.3 x\n10\n7. The factor of 7.3 x\n10\n7\n(ml) includes the following components: the\nfactors of 50 and 2 described above and a factor of 7.3 x\n10\n5\n(ml) which is the annual water intake of\n\nReference Man. (f) Note 2 in\nsection\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart provides\ngroupings of radionuclides which are applicable to unknown mixtures of\nradionuclides. These groupings (including occupational inhalation ALIs and\nDACs, air and water effluent concentrations and sewerage) require demonstrating\nthat the most limiting radionuclides in successive classes are absent. The\nlimit for the unknown mixture is defined when the presence of the one of the\nlisted radionuclides cannot be definitely excluded as being present either from\nknowledge of the radionuclide composition of the source or from actual\nmeasurements.
