Nevertheless, no party may refer to, introduce into evidence, or otherwise use at a hearing, except in its prefiled written testimony or in response to cross-examination, any information obtained through informal discovery unless that party first\nshows that all other active parties received or had a reasonable opportunity to\nreceive that response reasonably in advance of the hearing at which such use is\nproposed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n5.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
