Tit. 18 § 408.8 - Contract requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each social services district which does\nnot directly operate a residential program for victims of domestic violence\nwith a length of stay policy of 30 days or more must negotiate and enter into a\ncontract with at least one residential program for victims of domestic violence\nlocated within the district or within a contiguous district. In addition to any\ncontract with a residential program with a length of stay policy of less than\n30 days (safe home networks), the social services district must also negotiate\nand enter into a contract with a residential program with a length of stay\npolicy of 30 days or more (domestic violence shelters, domestic violence\nprograms, and/or domestic violence sponsoring agencies), to the extent there is\nsuch a residential program for victims of domestic violence located within the\nsocial services district or within a contiguous social services district. Contract negotiations must be carried out in good faith. Any contract entered\ninto by a social services district and a residential program may not abrogate\nthe obligation of the social services district to offer and provide temporary\nshelter, emergency services and care to victims of domestic violence pursuant\nto section\n408.3\nof this Part. (b) Each contract between a social services\ndistrict and a residential program must: (1)\nremain in effect for no more than 12 months; (2)\ninclude all the terms of the contract in\none instrument, be dated and executed by an authorized representative of each\nparty to the contract prior to the date of implementation; (3)\nhave a definite effective and termination\ndate; and\n(4)\nspecify the\nfollowing: (i) the approved rate established\nby the department; (ii)\nwhether, at\nthe time of the initial determination of eligibility, victims of domestic\nviolence will be authorized to stay for either 90 days or a period of less than\n90 days; if the length of stay is initially authorized for a period of less\nthan 90 days, the intervals at which eligibility will be redetermined must be\nspecified in the contract, pursuant to section\n408.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart; (iii)\nthe frequency of the\nassessments of need for temporary shelter, emergency services and care and the\nresponsibility of the social services district and the residential program to\nconduct such assessments, pursuant to section\n408.6\n(c) of this\n\nPart; and\n(iv)\nthe time frames\nwithin which a residential program must notify a social services district of an\nextension of a resident's stay beyond the 90-day maximum length of stay and the\nresponsibility of the district and the residential program to assist such\nresident in securing alternative housing, pursuant to section\n408.6\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (c) The\nterms of such contract will only apply to those residents who were residing in\nthe social services district at the time of their domestic violence\nincidents. (d) The terms of such\ncontract cannot require disclosure of identifying information regarding safe\nhome providers, including the information specified in section\n454.11\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, or on-site access by social services districts or their agents to a safe\nhome. However, nothing herein precludes a local child protective service from\nhaving access to a safe home or other residential program for victims of\ndomestic violence pursuant to section\n452.10\nof this Title to\ninvestigate a report of suspected child abuse or maltreatment involving a safe\nhome provider or a resident of a safe home named as a subject of the\nreport. (e) When a not-for-profit\norganization, as defined in section\n452.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, operates more than one residential program for victims of domestic\nviolence, a social services district may enter into one contract with such\nnot-for-profit organization rather than entering into a separate contract with\neach of the residential programs. However, such contract must specify a\nseparate per diem rate established in accordance with the requirements of\nsection\n408.7\n(a) of this\n\nPart for each such residential program. Notes\nN.Y.
