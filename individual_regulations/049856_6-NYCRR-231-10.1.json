  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-10.1 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An ERC may\nbe used in a net emission increase determination, internal offset, or as an\nemission offset. (b) An ERC may be\nused as an internal offset or emission offset, as applicable, without time\nlimit or restriction within New York State. In another state in the ozone\ntransport region, an ERC may be used as an emission off set in accordance with\nthat state 's requirements if New York State h as established a reciprocal\ntrading agreement with that state. (c) An ERC, to be used for purposes of\nnetting, must be the same regulated NSR contaminant as the emission increase\nrequiring the ERC. (d) An ERC, to be\nused as an offset, must be the same regulated NSR contaminant as the emission\nincrease requiring the ERC unless a precursor is allowed under sections 231-5.5\nor\n231-6.6\nof this Part. (e) In areas where NO\nx\nis a regulated precursor for ozone and PM-2.5, NO\nx\noffsets that occurred on or after April 5, 2005 and meet all applicable\nlocation requirements can be used to offset NO\nx\nemissions in both ozone and PM-2.5 nonattainment areas, with the amount of\noffsets required determined by the higher of the applicable offset\nratios. (f) An ERC may include\nemission reductions from control or elimination of fugitive emissions, provided\nthese emissions are contained in the New York State emissions\ninventory. (g) An ERC, or portion\nthereof, which was used to avoid a determination of a significant net emission\nincrease, as an internal offset, or as an emission offset cannot subsequently\nbe used for demonstrating attainment with ambient air quality standards or\nreasonable further progress in a federally approved SIP. (h) An ERC, or portion thereof, which was\nused to avoid a determination of a significant net emission increase, cannot\nsubsequently be used as an internal offset, emission offset, or in any\nsubsequent netting determinations. (i) An ERC, or portion thereof, which was\nused as an internal offset or an emission offset cannot be used again for any\npurpose. (j) An ERC of\nNO\nx, P M -10, or VOC used as an emission off set or for\nnetting, for compliance with Subpart 231-5 or 231- 6 of this Part, must have\nphysically occurred on or after November 15, 1990. (k) An ERC of PM-2.5 or\nSO\n2\nused as an emission offset or for netting, for\ncompliance with Subpart 231-5 or 231- 6 of this Part, must have physically\noccurred on or after April 5, 2005. (l) An ERC used as an internal offset for\nNO\nx\nor VOC emissions must have physically occurred on or\nafter November 15, 1990 but need not be contemporaneous. (m) The department will approve applications\nfor ERCs submitted on or after the effective date of this regulation on an\nemission source basis. Applications submitted prior to the effective date of\nthis regulation will be processed according to the provisions of Subpart 231-2\nof this Part. (n) ERCs may be\ncreated from past or future emission reductions resulting from facility\nshutdown, emission source shutdown, curtailment, emission source reduction, over control of emissions beyond an applicable limit, or any other reduction\nmechanism acceptable to the department. (o) The department may approve future\nemission reductions only if they are designated for a specific facility. The\nfacility seeking to establish the future emission reductions must submit an\napplication to the department for modification of its Part 201 permit. The\npermit of the facility proposing to use the future emission reductions must\nidentify the source(s) of the reductions. The permit of the facility\nestablishing the future emission reductions is subject to modification by the\ndepartment to remove the approval of the future emission reductions if the\nfacility proposing to use the future emission reductions does not commence\nconstruction within the time period specified in this Part, or if the applicant\nnotifies the department of its intent to abandon the proposed new or modified\nfacility and the applicant surrenders the permit prior to commencement of\noperation. (p) Emission reductions\nresulting from the shutdown of an unpermitted emission source which was subject\nto the requirement to obtain a permit pursuant to Part 201 of this Title will\nnot be certified as ERCs. (q) Unpermitted emission sources that are operational may be considered for ERCs in\naccordance with this Part subsequent to being permitted in accordance with Part\n201 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y.
