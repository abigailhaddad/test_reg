The carrier shall set forth the specific basis for its nonpayment of the bill\nand explain in detail the reasons supporting its objections. Any objection\nwhich sets forth the specific basis for nonpayment but does not explain in\ndetail the reasons supporting the objection shall not be considered sufficient\nnotification in writing for purposes of this section.

In\nlieu of providing such notices to the hospital, the carrier may send the\nhospital a sufficiently detailed written explanation raising legal objections\nto the bill. If the carrier has timely submitted such notices with the chair\nand served a copy of the notice upon the hospital or sent the hospital a\nsufficiently detailed written explanation raising legal objections to the bill, the carrier shall notify the hospital in writing that the bill is not being\npaid and explain the reasons for nonpayment, in the same manner as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, within 30 days after all questions duly and\ntimely raised with respect to the carrier's liability for such bill have been\nfinally determined adversely to the carrier; provided, however, that the\nexplanation for nonpayment shall not be on the basis of any issues previously\nadjudicated by the Workers' Compensation Law judge or the board which have been\nfinally determined adversely to the carrier. If the carrier files an\napplication for review of a decision by a Workers' Compensation Law judge, the\ncarrier shall serve a copy of the application for review, together with the\nprescribed cover sheet (form RB-89) on the hospital simultaneously with its\nservice on all other parties required to be served. The carrier may notify the\nhospital in writing that it has filed an application for review, in lieu of\nserving a copy of the application and cover sheet on the hospital.

(b) If the hospital wishes to\narbitrate, it shall complete and sign the request form for arbitration and\nforward it to the address specified on such form.
