  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.3 - General rules\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No agency involved in an action may undertake, fund or approve the action until\nit has complied with the provisions of SEQR. A project sponsor may not commence\nany physical alteration related to an action until the provisions of SEQR have\nbeen complied with. The only exception to this is provided under section\n617.5\n(c) (24), (27), and (34) of this Part. An involved\nagency may not issue its findings and decision on an action if it knows any\nother involved agency has determined that the action may have a significant\nadverse impact on the environment, until a final EIS has been filed. The only\nexception to this is provided under section\n617.9\n(a) (5)(i)\nof this Part. (b) SEQR does not change the existing\njurisdiction of agencies nor the jurisdiction between or among state and local\nagencies. SEQR provides all involved agencies with the authority, following the\nfiling of a final EIS and written findings statement, or pursuant to section\n617.7\n(d) of this Part to impose substantive conditions upon an action to ensure that the\nrequirements of this Part have been satisfied. The conditions imposed must be\npracticable and reasonably related to impacts identified in the EIS or the\nconditioned negative declaration. (c) An application for agency funding or\napproval of a Type I or Unlisted action will not be complete until: (1)\na negative declaration has been issued; or\n(2)\nuntil a draft EIS has been\naccepted by the lead agency as satisfactory with respect to scope, content and\nadequacy. When the draft EIS is accepted the SEQR process will run concurrently\nwith other procedures relating to the review and approval of the action, if\nreasonable time is provided for preparation, review and public hearings with\nrespect to the draft EIS. (d) The lead agency will make every\nreasonable effort to involve project sponsors, other agencies and the public in\nthe SEQR process. Early consultations initiated by agencies can serve to narrow\nissues of significance and to identify areas of controversy relating to\nenvironmental issues, thereby focusing on the impacts and alternatives\nrequiring in-depth analysis in an EIS. (e) Each agency involved in a proposed action\nhas the responsibility to provide the lead agency with information it may have\nthat may assist the lead agency in making its determination of significance, to\nidentify potentially significant adverse impacts in the scoping process, to\ncomment in a timely manner on the EIS if it has concerns which need to be\naddressed and to participate as may be needed, in any public hearing. Interested agencies are strongly encouraged to make known their views on the\naction, particularly with respect to their areas of expertise and\njurisdiction. (f) No SEQR\ndetermination of significance, EIS or findings statement is required for\nactions which are Type II. (g) Actions commonly consist of a set of activities or steps. The entire set of\nactivities or steps must be considered the action, whether the agency\ndecision-making relates to the action as a whole or to only a part of it. (1)\n\nConsidering only a part or segment of an\naction is contrary to the intent of SEQR. If a lead agency believes that\ncircumstances warrant a segmented review, it must clearly state in its\ndetermination of significance, and any subsequent EIS, the supporting reasons\nand must demonstrate that such review is clearly no less protective of the\nenvironment. Related actions should be identified and discussed to the fullest\nextent possible. (2)\n\nIf it is\ndetermined that an EIS is necessary for an action consisting of a set of\nactivities or steps, only one draft and one final EIS need be prepared on the\naction provided that the statement addresses each part of the action at a level\nof detail sufficient for an adequate analysis of the significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts. Except for a supplement to a generic environmental\nimpact statement (see section\n617.10\n(d) of this Part), a supplement to a draft or final EIS will only be required in\nthe circumstances prescribed in section\n617.9\n(a)(7)\nof this Part. (h) Agencies must carry out the terms and requirements of this Part with minimum\nprocedural and administrative delay, must avoid unnecessary duplication of\nreporting and review requirements by providing, where feasible, for combined or\nconsolidated proceedings, and must expedite all SEQR proceedings in the\ninterest of prompt review. (i) Time\nperiods in this Part may be extended by mutual agreement between a project\nsponsor and the lead agency, with notice to all other involved agencies by the\nlead agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
