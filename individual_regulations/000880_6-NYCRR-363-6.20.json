Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.20 - Above ground and on-ground leachate storage tank requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\ndescribed in the transition requirements in section\n360.4\nof this Title, only a storage\ntank system may be used to store leachate. The aboveground and on-ground\nleachate storage tank system must be capable of containing a minimum of three\nconsecutive months combined primary and secondary leachate flow based on\ncalculations required by section\n363-4.3\n(e) of this\n\nPart unless an alternate storage and transport system is approved by the\ndepartment and must have a secondary containment system capable of retaining\nleachate in the event of a leachate spill. (1)\n\nThe design volume for the secondary\ncontainment system must be at least 110 percent of the volume of either the\nlargest tank within the containment system or the total volume of all\ninterconnected tanks, whichever is greater. (2)\n\nThe secondary containment system must be\nconstructed of a one-foot layer of compacted soil with a hydraulic conductivity\nof 1 x 10\n-7\ncentimeters per second or less, a\nconcrete pad of sufficient thickness to maintain integrity for the lifetime of\nthe tank with a corrosion-resistant coating, or a geosynthetic liner of a\nminimum thickness equal to 60 mils. If a geomembrane is used, construction and\ncertification must meet the requirements of subdivisions\n363-6.8\n(b) and (c)\nof this Subpart, except for the electrical resistivity testing provisions of\nsubparagraph 363-6.8(c)(3)(vii) of this Subpart. (3)\n\nAll aboveground and on-ground tanks must\nbe equipped with an overfill prevention system. (4)\n\nAll uncovered tanks must maintain a\nminimum of two feet of freeboard. (5)\n\nAppurtenances should be detailed\nillustrating the ability for filling and draining the containment system, including design details for draining uncontaminated precipitation from the\nsecondary containment system, Notes\nN.Y.
