  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-9.9 - Power buggies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Assigned operator. No person other than a trained and competent operator\ndesignated by the employer shall operate a power buggy. (b) Defective machines. No power buggy shall\nbe operated unless it is in compliance with this Part (rule) and is in good\noperating condition. (c) Mechanical\nrequirements. (1)\n\nStability. Every power\nbuggy shall be so designed and constructed as to withstand without tilting the\nfollowing: (i) A 45 degree turn at full rated\nload and maximum designed forward speed. (ii)\nA collision stop against wheel blockage\non a level grade at full rated load and one-half maximum designed forward or\nfull reverse speed. (iii)\n\nLateral\ntraversal of 10 percent grade slopes at full rated load and maximum designed\nspeed. (2)\n\nBraking\npower. (i) Every power buggy shall be\nprovided with brakes and tire surfaces capable of bringing such buggy to a full\nstop within 25 feet on a level dry plank surface or frictional equivalent at\nfull rated load and maximum designed speed. (ii)\n\nBrakes shall be capable of being fixed\nin engagement to hold the full load stationary on a 25 percent grade. (3)\n\nAccidental starting. The\ncontrols of every power buggy shall be so arranged, shielded or located that\nthey cannot be accidentally engaged. (4)\n\nWarning devices. Every power buggy except\nthose having maximum speeds of three miles per hour and upon which no person\nrides shall be equipped with an easily operable horn or other audible warning\nsignal. Such audible horn or other signal shall be capable of being heard above\nthe normal noise level in the area. (5)\n\nSeats and visibility. Every power buggy\nof the riding type shall be provided with an operator's seat or standing\nplatform designed and secured to prevent slipping off and located that the\noperator may have maximum practicable driving visibility. (6)\n\nSpeed. Every power buggy of the riding\ntype shall be designed or equipped that it cannot travel faster than 12 miles\nper hour on a level surface. (d) Operation. (1)\n\nParking on grades. No power buggy shall\nbe left unattended on any grade sufficiently steep to cause such buggy to coast\nif free of engine and brake resistance. (2)\n\nProhibited operation. No power buggy\nshall be operated: (i) at a speed greater\nthan 12 miles per hour; (ii)\nwhen\ncarrying more than its full rated load; (iii)\non insecure or slippery surfaces or on\nsurfaces so inclined or uneven as to endanger stability; (iv)\non grades steeper than 25 percent; or\n(v) on ramps, runways or other\nsurfaces not in compliance with this Part (rule). (e) Special requirements for\nrunways and ramps. Runways, ramps, platforms and other surfaces upon which\npower buggies are operated shall conform to the following requirements: (1)\n\nThey shall be substantially constructed\nand securely supported, braced and fastened to prevent movement. (2)\n\nThey shall be constructed to sustain\nwithout failure at least four times the maximum load for which they are\nintended. (3)\n\nThe minimum width\ninside of curbs for any ramp, runway or platform for single lane power buggy\ntraffic shall be two feet wider than the outside width of any power buggy\noperated thereon and two feet wider than twice such buggy width in places where\npassing or two lane traffic occurs. (4)\n\nRamps shall be limited to maximum grades\nof one on four. (5)\n\nAll runways\nshall be substantially level transversely. (6)\n\nCurbs in compliance with this Part (rule)\nshall be provided along the edges of surfaces upon which power buggies are\noperated as follows: (i) Curbs shall be\nfurnished along all edges which are nearer than 10 feet horizontally to the\nedge of any unenclosed floor area, shaft or other open space into or through\nwhich a fall from such surface of more than 24 inches vertically is possible, except as set forth in subparagraph (iii) below. (ii)\n\nWhere curbs are not required because the\nbuggy is operated on a surface not over 24 inches above any floor or equivalent\nsurface below, such lower surface shall be strong enough to sustain the loaded\npower buggy in event of a fall thereon. (iii)\n\nCurbs may be omitted at actual dumping\npoints more than 24 inches above any floor or equivalent surface below if the\nedge over which the dumping occurs is provided with bumpers or other means\nwhich will effectively stop the buggy from running over the edge while\ndumping. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-9.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
