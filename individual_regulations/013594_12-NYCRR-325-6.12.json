  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 325-6.12 - Decisions of the arbitrator; awards; interest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The arbitrator shall make a decision in\nwriting no later than 30 days after completion of a hearing. The decision shall\ncontain a dollar amount of an award or a denial of the claim, and shall specify\nthe basis of the decision on the form prescribed by the dispute forum for such\npurpose. The decision may include any stipulation made by the parties, including stipulations as to payment of fees. The decision shall be delivered\nto each party in accordance with section\n325-6.15\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (b) In the event the\narbitrator's decision is in favor of the health insurer in the full amount\nrequested, the amount of the award shall be increased by the amount of any\nfiling fee, or any additional fee paid by the health insurer including any fee\nfor manual searches as provided in section\n325-5.6\n(b) of\nthis Part, except attorney's fees, for oral hearings. In the event the claim\nfor reimbursement is denied in full, the arbitrator shall make an award in\nfavor of the carrier for any filing fees or additional fees, except attorney's\nfees, paid by the carrier. In all other cases, the arbitrator shall, in his or\nher discretion, determine whether such fees shall be allocated and the manner\nof such allocation provided, however, that in all cases in which the\narbitrator's decision is based in whole or in part upon objections or documents\nreceived and accepted by the arbitrator as newly-discovered evidence pursuant\nto section\n325-6.11\n(c) of\nthis Subpart, and is entirely or partly in favor of the party which served the\nobjections or documents untimely, any filing fees shall be chargeable to such\nparty in whole or in part. In any such case the arbitrator, when allocating\nsuch fee, shall consider the extent to which the other party may have been\nprejudiced by the prevailing party's failure to serve the objections or\ndocumentation in a timely manner. If payment is made to the health insurer\nafter the time within which the carrier was required to object or making\npayments has expired and the carrier submits proof of payment after the health\ninsurer has served a request for arbitration, the arbitrator shall make an\naward to the health insurer for any filing fees paid by it. (c) If the arbitrator determines that the\ncarrier's objection to or non-payment of the reimbursement or the health\ninsurer's request for arbitration was frivolous or was not made in good faith, he or she may impose in his or her discretion a penalty of no greater than\n$1,000 against the party whose position was frivolous or not made in good\nfaith. Such determinations shall be limited to instances where the objection to\nnon-payment or request for arbitration had no basis in fact, or was not\nwarranted by existing law or good faith argument for the extension, modification, or reversal of existing law. Any penalty shall be issued in the\nform of an arbitrator award payable to the opposing party by the party whose\nposition was deemed frivolous or not made in good faith. (d) Within 15 days of the date of the\narbitrator's decision, either party may serve a request for reconsideration by\nserving a written request for reconsideration on the opposing party and by\nserving two copies of the written request with proof of service of the request\nfor reconsideration and an additional filing fee of $150 on the dispute forum. The party seeking reconsideration shall have the burden of establishing that\nthe original decision is incorrect as a matter of law or fact. The party\nopposing reconsideration shall have fifteen days to serve its written response\non the serving party and two copies on the dispute forum. Such reconsideration\nshall be conducted by the arbitrator who issued the underlying decision. The\narbitrator shall issue a written decision on the request for reconsideration in\naccordance with subdivision (a) of this section. The arbitration decision, including payment of arbitrator's awards and reimbursement of filing fees, shall not become final for purposes of subdivision (e) of this section during\nthe pendency of a request for reconsideration and shall be stayed during the\npendency of such request for reconsideration. If the arbitrator determines that\nthe request for reconsideration was frivolous, he or she may impose in his or\nher discretion a penalty of no greater than $1,000 against the party seeking\nreconsideration. The proceeds of the penalty shall be paid in equal parts to\nthe dispute forum and the other party. In no case shall the arbitrator impose\nthe additional filing fee for a request for reconsideration on the party\nopposing reconsideration. (e) Awards shall be paid to the prevailing party no later than 30 days after\nservice of the decision upon the parties. Any awards remaining unpaid after\nsaid 30-day period shall draw simple interest from 30 days after the making of\nthe award at the rate provided in section\n5004\nof the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules.
