  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 62-5.3 - Filing requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to the filing requirements set forth in Subpart 62-3 of this Part, all insurers are required within seven days after receipt of a fire loss claim (Form NYFC-1, Part 1), to contact the central registry maintained by the designated agency for information concerning whether the fire or explosion which is the subject of the claim has been determined to be of an incendiary nature. If, within such seven-day period, the insurer is notified by the agency that the fire or explosion has been determined to be incendiary, unless the insurer is reasonably satisfied that neither the insured, nor any of its agents, officers, directors, or persons in control of or controlled by the insured, intentionally started the fire or caused the explosion or acted in concert with another individual to start the fire or cause the explosion, the insurer shall require the insured to submit Supplemental Claim Form NYFC-1 (Part 3). In such a case, the insurer shall send the claim form to the insured within seven days of being notified by the agency, and shall withhold payment of the claim until the completed supplemental claim form has been received. (b) Within 20 days after receiving a completed supplemental claim form from an insured, the insurer shall file a copy with the designated fire investigation agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n62-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
