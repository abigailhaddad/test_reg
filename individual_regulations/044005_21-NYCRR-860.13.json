(c) Stream\nquality objectives. (1)\n\nDissolved oxygen: (i) not less than 5.0 mg/l at any\ntime; (ii)\nminimum 24-hour average\nof 6.0 mg/l; and\n(iii)\nnot less\nthan 7.0 mg/l in spawning areas whenever temperatures are suitable for trout\nspawning. (2)\n\nTemperature. Except in designated heat dissipation areas (see section\n861.12\n[f][5]\nof\nthis Title): (i) not to exceed 5° F (2.8° C)\nrise above ambient temperature until stream temperature reaches 50° F (10.0°\nC); (ii)\nnot to exceed 2° F (1.0°\nC) rise above ambient temperature when stream temperature is between 50° F\n(10.0° C) and 58° F (14.4° C); and\n(iii)\nnatural temperature will prevail above\n58° F (14.4° C). (3)\npH. Between 6.0 and 8.5. (4)\n\nPhenols. Not to exceed 0.005 mg/l, unless due to natural conditions. (5)\n\nThreshold odor number. Not to exceed 24\nat 60° C.

Not to exceed 200 per 100\nmilliliters as a geometric average; samples shall be taken at such frequency\nand location as to permit valid interpretation. (9)\n\nTotal dissolved solids. Not to exceed: (i) 133 percent of background; or\n(ii)\n500 mg/l, whichever is less. (d) Effluent quality\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAll discharges shall meet\nthe effluent quality requirements of this Part. (2)\n\nThe carbonaceous oxygen demand from an\noutfall (exclusive of storm water bypass) shall not exceed that assigned by the\ncommission to maintain stream quality objectives. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
