  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 897.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Oswego River and Lower Seneca River watershed and has been closely followed\nin connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation\n\nDepartment at the time of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced\nherein. Conversely, a few streams now shown on the older maps but appearing on\nthe new maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Oswego River and Lower Seneca River drainage\nbasin may be illustrated as follows: Waters Index\n\nNumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt.-66\n\nOswego River\n\nEnters Lake Ontario from southeast at south shore\nin eastern portion of lake at City of Oswego (map G-13b). Ont.-66-3\n\nTannery Creek\n3rd trib. entering Oswego River from west, 1.2\nmiles upstream from Black Creek (map G-14c). Ont.-66-3-P 9\n\nLake Neatahwanta\n\nAt source of Tannery Creek, begining 0.6 mile\nupstream from trib. 2 (map G-14c). Ont.-66-3-P 9-1\n\nTrib. 1 of Lake Neatahwanta\n\nTrib. 1 enters Lake Neatahwanta from southeast (map\nG-14c). Ont.-66-3 P 9-1-9-1-2\n\nSubtrib. of trib. 1\n\nSubtrib. 2 enters trib. 1 from southwest, upstream\nof subtrib. 1 (map G-14c). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. The following maps were produced from original maps which may be\nprocured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map. Ref.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C or D opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class AA, A, B, C or D as the case may be, as set forth in Part\n701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standard as the waters to which it is directly\ntributary. (l) The Oswego River and\n\nLower Seneca River drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following\nareas: All land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which\nis directly or indirectly tributary to Oswego River and Lower Seneca\n\nRiver. (m) Notwithstanding the\nitems indicated in table I which, in some instances, indicate assignment of\nclassifications for waters contained within the boundaries of the State-owned\nforest preserve lands and, therefore, controlled under the provisions of the\n\nState Constitution\nand the Conservation Law, such waters are\nhereby excluded from classification to the extent that any part of such waters\nmay be located within the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve land. All waters within 100 feet of the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve\nlands shall have a classification of A and be governed by the rules and\nregulations promulgated by the Water Pollution Control Board.
