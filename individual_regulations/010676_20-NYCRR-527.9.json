  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.9 - Hotel occupancy\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(e)\n(a) Imposition. (1)\nA sales tax is imposed on the rent for\nevery occupancy of a room or rooms in a hotel, motel, or similar establishment\nin New York State. The tax is imposed at the combined State and local sales tax\nrate in effect at the location of such establishment. However, the tax does not\napply to: (i) rent for occupancy of a\npermanent resident; (ii)\nrent of $2\nor less per day; or\n(iii)\nrent for\nany occupancy that is otherwise excluded or exempted from tax under the Tax Law\nor under any other provision of law. (2)\n(i) Except as otherwise provided in this section, reference to tax includes the\n\nState and local sales taxes that are imposed on rent received for hotel\noccupancy under article 28 and pursuant to the authority of article 29 of the\n\nTax Law that are administered by the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (ii)\n\nExcept as otherwise\nprovided in this section, reference to tax also includes the fee imposed by\nsection\n1104\nof the Tax Law on every occupancy of a\nunit in a hotel located in New York City. This fee is administered and\ncollected by the commissioner in the same manner as the tax imposed on rent\nreceived for hotel occupancy. The hotel unit fee is not included in the amount\nof rent upon which the tax is computed. (b) Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall\nmean: (1)\n\nHotel. A\nhotel\nis a building, or portion of it, that is regularly used\nand kept open for the lodging of guests. The term\nhotel\nincludes, but it not limited to, an apartment hotel, a motel, bungalow or\ncottage colony, boarding house, or club, whether or not meals are served. A\nbuilding, or portion of the building, falls within this definition if, among\nother factors: (i) sleeping accommodations are\nprovided for the lodging of paying occupants on a regular basis; (ii)\ntypical occupants are transients or\ntravelers; (iii)\nhousekeeping, linen, or other customary hotel services are provided for occupants; and\n(iv)\nthe relationship between\nthe operator of the establishment and the occupant is that of an innkeeper and\nguest, not that of a landlord and tenant (\ne.g., the occupant\ndoes not have an exclusive right or privilege with respect to any particular\nroom or rooms, but instead merely has an agreement for the use or possession of\nthe room or rooms). (2)\n\nOperator. Any person operating a hotel. (3)\n\nOccupancy. The use or\npossession of, or the right to use or possess, any room in a hotel. (4)\n\nOccupant. A person who, for a consideration, uses, possesses or has the right to use or possess, any\nroom in a hotel under any lease, concession, permit, right of access, license\nto use or other agreement, or otherwise. (5)\n\nRoom. Any room or rooms\nof any kind in any part or portion of a hotel, which is available or let out\nfor any purpose other than as a place of assembly. The term\nroom\nalso includes dormitory-type sleeping facilities\nfurnished at ski lodges, dude ranches and similar establishments. (6)\n\nPlace of assembly. A\nroom or suite of rooms containing no sleeping accommodations and intended to be\noccupied and used by persons for purposes other than as sleeping and living\nquarters, such as education, recreation, amusement or business or religious\nmeetings. A suite of rooms, some of which contain sleeping accommodations, is\nnot a place of assembly, even though some of the rooms may be used for purposes\nother than living quarters, since the occupant has the right to use all of the\nrooms. (7)\n\nRent. (i) Rent\nis the\nconsideration received for hotel occupancy valued in money, whether received in\nmoney or otherwise. The term\nrent\nincludes charges for\naccommodations, services, facilities, amenities, and items that are incidental\nto the occupancy of the room or rooms, whether those charges are separately\nstated or included as one sum in the rate for the room or rooms. This includes, but is not limited to, charges for the use of furnishings and equipment; charges for housekeeping service, towel and linen service, local telephone\nservice (not billed on a per-call basis); and other similar incidental charges. See, also, subdivision (i) of this section concerning miscellaneous\ntransactions. (ii)\n\nReasonable and\nseparately stated charges that are not incidental to the occupancy of a room or\nrooms in a hotel are not considered to be rent. For example, reasonable and\nseparately stated charges for food and drinks, entertainment, valet and laundry\nservice, theater ticket service, parking, and transportation do not constitute\nrent, but may be taxable under other sections of the Tax Law. See, for example, subdivisions (h) and (i) of this section concerning food services and other\nmiscellaneous transactions. (8)\n\nPermanent resident. (i) (a) Except as provided in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, any\noccupant of any room or rooms in a hotel for at least 90 consecutive days is\nconsidered a permanent resident with regard to the period of such occupancy. There is no tax on the rent for occupancy of a hotel room by a permanent\nresident. A hotel operator must collect the tax from an occupant until the\noccupancy reaches 90 consecutive days. When continuous occupancy has reached 90\ndays, the sales tax is no longer imposed and the tax previously collected is\nrefundable to the occupant. If any part of the tax refunded by the operator to\nthe occupant has been paid to the Department of Taxation and Finance, the\noperator may take a credit in the amount of the tax paid on the operator's next\ntimely filed sales tax return. If the tax is not refunded to the occupant by\nthe hotel operator, the occupant may apply directly to the department for a\nrefund. See Part 534 of this Title for general information concerning refunds\nand credits. Example: A corporation contracts with a hotel operator for five\nrooms on a continuing basis for use by its employees, and it uses additional\nrooms at the hotel as the need arises. The operator is required to collect tax\non the rent for occupancy that is received from the corporation. When 90\nconsecutive days of occupancy have passed, the corporation will be considered a\npermanent resident with respect to the five rooms occupied continuously for 90\ndays. At that time, the hotel operator is no longer required to collect tax on\nthe rent for the five rooms and the corporation is entitled to a refund of the\ntax previously paid on the rent for these occupancies. As to the additional\nrooms that the corporation occupies, it is not a permanent resident and is not\neligible for a sales tax exclusion or refund. (b) For purposes of the local sales tax\nimposed in New York City under section\n1210\nof the Tax Law, any occupant of any\nroom or rooms in a hotel for at least 180 consecutive days is considered a\npermanent resident with regard to the period of such occupancy. Accordingly, the provisions of clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph do not apply\nto this tax until occupancy reaches 180 consecutive days. (ii)\n\nThe change of rooms within the same\nhotel does not alter a person's status as a permanent resident nor interrupt\nthe number of consecutive days necessary in order to establish permanent\nresidency. (iii)\nA permanent\nresident who transfers from one hotel to another hotel, whether or not the\nhotels are run by the same operator, loses permanent resident status and must\ncomplete the required number of days at the new establishment before becoming a\npermanent resident there. Similarly, a change of hotels by an occupant who is\nnot yet a permanent resident interrupts the number of consecutive days\nnecessary in order to establish permanent residency. (iv)\n\nWhen a hotel room has more than one\noccupant that pays rent for the right to occupy the room, the status of\npermanent resident is determined individually for each occupant. (v) An occupant who is a permanent resident\nof a hotel and who permits the operator to rent the occupant's room during the\noccupant's temporary absence will no longer be considered a permanent resident\nif during the period of absence the occupant no longer has the right to use or\npossess another room in the same hotel. In which case, upon the occupant's\nreturn, the occupant must reestablish permanent resident status. The new\noccupant to whom the room is rented during the temporary absence is liable for\ntax until occupancy is maintained by the new occupant for the required number\nof consecutive days. (vi)\n\nWhen a\nhotel room is rented by a business entity for use by an employee, customer, client, or other authorized person, the days that the person occupies the room\nfor which the business pays the rent to the hotel operator are considered to be\ndays that the room is occupied by the business, provided the business is not\nreimbursed or otherwise paid for the right to occupy the room. Days when the\nroom is rented but remains unoccupied and for which no one reimburses or\notherwise pays the business for the right to occupy the room are also\nconsidered to be days that the room is occupied by the business. Cross-reference: For definition of terms as applicable to room remarketers, see section\n1101 (c)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (c) Computation. (1)\n\nRent for the occupancy of a hotel room or\nrooms is taxable if the rate is more than $2 per day. When rent is charged on a\nweekly, monthly, or other basis, the daily rate is computed by dividing the\nnumber of days in the rental period into the total amount of rent for the\nperiod. (2)\n\nIf there is an increase\nor decrease in the tax rate, tax must be collected at the new rate on rent\nreceived for any occupancies that occur on and after the effective date of the\nrate change. If rent is charged at other than a daily rate, the tax must be\napportioned on a \"pro rata\" basis. (3)\n\nRent for the occupancy of dormitory-type\nsleeping facilities furnished at ski lodges, dude ranches, and similar\nestablishments is subject to tax on the rate charged each occupant if the rent\nis more than $2 per day per person. In all other types of hotel rooms, taxability is determined by the daily rate for the room, not the charge per\nperson. (4)\n\nCertain local\njurisdictions are authorized to impose and administer additional taxes on hotel\nor motel occupancy (see, for example, section 1202-a\net seq. of the Tax Law). Such a locally administered tax is not included in the amount\nof rent upon which the sales tax is imposed. (d) Exemptions from tax on rent for\nhotel occupancy. The persons and organizations described in section\n1116\nof the Tax Law and Part 529 of this\n\nTitle are exempt from sales tax imposed on rent for hotel occupancy. See Part\n529 of this Title, Exempt Organizations. (1)\n\nNew York State and its agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations, and political subdivisions (New York\n\nState governmental entities). (i) Where\npayment of rent is made by a representative or employee of a New York State\ngovernmental entity while on official business, the exemption from tax is\nestablished by furnishing the hotel operator with a properly completed\nexemption certificate. (ii)\n\nWhere\ndirect payment is made to the hotel operator by the State governmental entity\nfor occupancy of its representative or employee while on official business, no\nexemption certificate is required in order to establish the exemption. However, proof of the payment, such as a copy of the voucher or check received, must be\nretained by the hotel operator. (2)\n\nThe United States of America and its\nagencies and instrumentalities (United States governmental entities). (i) Where payment of rent is made by a\nrepresentative or employee of a United States governmental entity while on\nofficial business, the exemption from tax is established by furnishing the\nhotel operator with a properly completed exemption certificate. (ii)\n\nWhere direct payment is made to the\nhotel operator by the United States governmental entity for occupancy of its\nrepresentative or employee while on official business, no exemption certificate\nis required in order to establish the exemption. However, proof of the payment, such as a copy of the voucher or check received, must be retained by the hotel\noperator. (3)\n\nThe United\n\nNations, any international organization of which the United States is a member, and diplomatic missions and personnel. (i) Where payment of rent is made by a representative or employee of the United\n\nNations or of any international organization of which the United States is a\nmember, while the representative or employee is on official business, the\nexemption from tax is established by furnishing the hotel operator with a\nproperly completed exemption certificate. (ii)\n\nWhere payments are made by diplomatic\nmissions and personnel (including members of their families), the exemption\nfrom tax is established by furnishing the hotel operator with properly\ncompleted exemption certificates. (iii)\n\nIn addition to the exemption\ncertificates required by this paragraph and notwithstanding any other provision\nof this Title, the exemption from tax on rent received for hotel occupancy\napplicable to diplomatic missions and personnel may be administered in\nconjunction with the United States Department of State's or the American\n\nInstitute in Taiwan's, as the case may be, most current tax-exemption program. Where the United States Department of State has extended its tax-exemption\nprogram to the United Nations or to any international organizations of which\nthe United States is a member, the exemption from the tax on hotel occupancy\nmay also be administered in conjunction with that program. (4)\n\nOrganizations determined to be exempt\nunder section\n1116 (a)(4) and (5)\nof the Tax Law (exempt organizations). (i) Where payment of rent is made to a hotel\noperator by an exempt organization for the occupancy of rooms for its own use\nor for use by its officers, employees, members, or other representatives in the\nconduct of the organization's activities, the exemption from tax is established\nby furnishing the hotel operator with a properly completed exemption\ncertificate. (ii)\n\nWhere the exempt\norganization rents rooms from a hotel operator for the specific purpose of\nre-renting the rooms to its officers, employees, members, or other\nrepresentatives participating in the organization's activities, it is not\nliable for tax if a properly completed exemption certificate is submitted to\nthe operator. The exempt organization is not required to collect tax on the\ncharges for occupancy that it receives. (iii)\n\nWhere payments are made directly to the\noperator for hotel occupancy by use of personal funds or personal credit/debit\ncards of officers, employees, members, or other representatives of an exempt\norganization, other than duly authorized representatives acting on behalf of a\npost, organization, or affiliate as described in section\n529.8\n(j) of this Title, there is no exemption from the tax on hotel occupancy. (iv)\n\nAn exempt organization described in\nsection\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nthat operates its own hotel (or operates a leased hotel) in furtherance of the\npurposes for which it was organized is not required to collect tax on the rent\nfor occupancy that it receives from its members or other guests if it carries\non activities in furtherance of such purposes within the same premises. When\nsuch activities are not carried on within the same premises, the rent received\nfrom its members and guests is subject to tax. (v) Notwithstanding subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph, any hotel operated by a college or university that offers 100 or\nmore rooms for occupancy must collect the tax on rent received from occupants\nunless the occupants are otherwise excluded or exempted from tax. (e) Nontaxable\nfacilities. The following facilities are not subject to the tax imposed\non rent received for hotel occupancy: (1)\n\nPlaces of assembly. A room or suite of\nrooms containing no sleeping accommodations and used solely as a place of\nassembly (see paragraph [b][6] of this section) is not a room or rooms in a\nhotel upon which the occupancy tax is imposed. However, the rental of a place\nof assembly in conjunction with the sale of food or drink may be subject to tax\nunder section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law. See subdivision (h) of this section and section\n527.8\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nHealth-care and\nsimilar facilities. A nursing home, rest home, family care home, or similar\nfacility that is registered with or under the supervision of a New York or\n\nFederal governmental agency, whether the facility is publicly or privately\nowned and operated, that accepts persons who require special care on account of\nage, illness, mental or physical condition, or the like and that provides this\nspecial care is not a hotel with respect to such individuals. (3)\n\nSummer camps and other overnight camps\nfor children. (i) A camp for children that\nprovides overnight sleeping accommodations and a program of instructions, training, or other organized activities that the campers are required to pursue\nunder the supervision of counselors or other supervisory personnel is not a\nhotel. The fee paid for a child to attend such a camp is not subject to the tax\non rent received for hotel occupancy nor the tax imposed on meals pursuant to\nsection\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law. However, unless otherwise excluded or exempted from tax, if guest facilities\nare provided for parents or others, taxes are due on any rent of more than $2\nper day for these occupants and on any receipts from the sales of meals to\nthese occupants. (ii)\n\nSales tax is\nnot imposed on rentals of campsites, trailer sites, or other real\nproperty. (4)\n\nCollege\ndormitories and other student-housing facilities. A dormitory, apartment, house, or other facility operated\nby a school, college, or university in which its students reside is not a\nhotel. However, unless otherwise excluded or exempted from tax, if facilities\nare provided for parents, alumni, or others, any rent that is charged for their\noccupancy is taxable if it is more than $2 a day. (5)\n\nBungalows and similar living units. A bungalow or similar furnished living unit limited to a\nsingle-family occupancy is not a hotel provided no housekeeping, food, or other\ncommon hotel services, such as entertainment or planned activities, are\nprovided by the lessor. The furnishing of linen by the lessor without the\nservice of changing the linen does not alter the nontaxable status of any\nrental charges. (f) Complimentary\naccommodations. (1)\n\nWhen a hotel\nfurnishes complimentary accommodations for which there is no consideration paid\nand no rental charged, the hotel operator need not collect the tax on the\nnormal rent for the room. (2)\n\nWhere\nthere is consideration, such as bringing future business to the hotel by a tour\nguide, travel representative, or other person in exchange for an accommodation\nfree of charge, the accommodation is subject to the tax on the normal rent for\nthe room, except where the normal rent is $2 or less a day or is otherwise\nexcluded or exempted from tax. (g) Employee lodging. (1)\n\nLodging furnished by an employer to\nemployees is not subject to tax if the employer receives no cash (or other\nconsideration) for the lodging from the employees and the value of the lodging\nis not income for the employees under the Federal or State income tax\nlaws. (2)\n\nAn employer furnishing\nlodging to employees, as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, is not\nrequired to collect or pay a tax on the value assigned to the lodging. However, the employer is liable for tax for any expenses incurred that would ordinarily\nbe taxable to the operator of a hotel. (3)\n\nAny charge by an employer to a employee\nfor lodging is subject to tax, whether paid in cash by the employee or withheld\nfrom the employee's wages. (4)\n\nThis\nsubdivision shall apply only to lodging furnished to employees of hotels, motels and similar establishments. (h) Food services offered by\nhotels. (1)\n\nThe American plan and other\nsimilar plans. (i) A hotel operating on the\n\nAmerican plan, modified American plan, or other similar plan that combines\nhotel occupancy and food services for a single charge must collect tax on the\ntotal charge (if the charge is more than $2 a day). Once an occupant becomes a\npermanent resident, the hotel operator should discontinue collecting tax on the\namount charged for the room, but must continue to collect tax under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law on\nthe charge for meals. In lieu of establishing a separate charge for meals, the\noperator may use the schedule shown below to determine the percentage of the\ntotal charge to be apportioned to meals and may collect tax based on that\namount. SCHEDULE\nTotal charge\nincludes\n\nRoom\n\nMeals\n\nRoom, breakfast, lunch, dinner\n50%\n50%\nRoom, lunch, dinner\n60%\n40%\nRoom, breakfast, dinner\n60%\n40%\nRoom, breakfast, lunch\n70%\n30%\nRoom, dinner\n75%\n25%\nRoom, lunch\n85%\n15%\nRoom, breakfast\n85%\n15%\n(ii)\n\nIf the hotel operator neither separately\nstates the charge for the room and the charge for meals nor uses the above\nschedule, the entire charge is taxable whether the occupant is a permanent\nresident or not. (iii)\nA hotel\noffering a free continental breakfast (\ne.g., juice, pastry, and coffee) may not separately state a reasonable value for the breakfast or\nuse the schedule set forth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph because the\nentire charge is subject to tax as rent for occupancy of the room. (2)\n\nSeparately stated charges for\nfood and drink served at a restaurant, tavern, or other establishment operated\nby a hotel are taxable under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law. (See section\n527.8\nof\nthis Part.)\n(3)\n\nCharges for room\nservice constitute part of the receipt from the sale of food and drink and are\ntaxable under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (4)\n\nThe rental of a place of\nassembly in a hotel in conjunction with the sale of food and drink is subject\nto tax under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law. However, if the hotel merely provides incidental snacks during a break from an\nactivity and the charges for providing the snacks are reasonable and separately\nstated, only such charges are subject to tax. Examples of these incidental\nsnacks are coffee, tea, donuts, cookies, candy, and ice cream. (i) Miscellaneous\ntransactions. (1)\n\nThe following\ncharges made by hotels are taxable: (i) Charges for basic telephone services are incidental to hotel occupancy and are\ntaxable as part of the rent for such occupancy. A hotel may not claim a credit\nor refund for taxes paid to a telecommunications provider on that portion of\nthe service that has been furnished to guests. Charges on a per-call basis for\nlocal and intrastate telephone calls are not considered incidental to hotel\noccupancy, but are taxable under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law. A\nhotel may claim a credit or refund for taxes it paid to a telecommunications\nprovider on local and intrastate telephone calls resold to guests on a per-call\nbasis. Charges for interstate and international telephone calls and charges for\n\nInternet access are not subject to tax. (ii)\n\nCharges for basic television services\n(regardless of the means by which the services are provided) and charges for\nthe in-room use of movies, videos, or other forms of entertainment (including\nseparately stated charges for video games, pay-per-view movies and events, premium channels, and other optional programming) are taxable as part of the\nrent for occupancy. (iii)\n\nCharges\nfor the rental of tangible personal property, such as recreational equipment, are taxable under section\n1105 (a)\nof the Tax Law as\nreceipts from the sales of tangible personal property. (iv)\n\nCharges for the safekeeping of guests'\nvaluables, including the use of safe deposit boxes, are taxable under section\n1105 (c)(4)\nof the Tax Law\nas storage charges. (v) Charges of\na roof garden, cabaret, or other similar facility operated by a hotel are\ntaxable under section\n1105 (f)(3)\nof the Tax Law. (See section\n527.12\nof this Part.)\n(vi)\n\nCharges for\nparking, garaging, or storing motor vehicles are taxable under section\n1105 (c)(6)\nof the Tax Law. Cross reference: See all of the sections\nin this Part and articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law for additional charges that\nmay be subject to tax. (2)\n\nThe following are examples of purchases\nmade by hotels that are subject to tax: (i) fuel, gas, electricity, steam, basic telephone (not billed on a per-call basis)\nand telegraph, and other utilities; (ii)\nfurniture and appliances used in guest\nrooms and elsewhere at the hotel; (iii)\nsoap, paper products, and other\nsupplies used in the operation of the hotel; and\n(iv)\nitems of tangible personal property that\nwill be used by occupants for recreational purposes, such as golf carts, pool\nchairs, or other recreational equipment, provided these items are not\nexclusively rented to occupants.
