In deciding whether or not to apply for such an order, the social\nservices district must determine if the information provided by the referral\nsource and other persons familiar with the situation and the observations of\nstaff of the social services district warrant such an action. (c) Situations in which a social\nservices official decides not to apply for an order to gain access. When a\nsocial services official determines that it is not appropriate to apply for an\norder to gain access to a person who may be in need of PSA, the reasons for his\nor her decision must be documented in the case record along with the efforts\nmade by the district to gain access to the person believed to be in need of PSA\nin accordance with paragraph (b)(1) of this section and all other relevant\ninformation related to the social services district's response to the referral. In addition, the district shall notify the client and known relatives, friends\nand interested agencies of the continued willingness of the district to\ncomplete an assessment and provide appropriate services if the person agrees to\naccept such services. (d) Situations in which a social services official decides to apply for an order to\ngain access. In those situations in which a social services official decides to\napply for an order to gain access to a person who may be in need of PSA, an\napplication must be prepared which states, to the extent that the facts or\ncircumstances can be verified or determined: (1)\nthe name and address of the person who\nmay be in need of PSA and the premises at which such person may be\nfound; (2)\nthe reason the social\nservices official believes that such person may be in need of PSA, which may\ninclude information provided by other agencies or individuals who are familiar\nwith that person; (3)\nthe person or\npersons who are responsible for preventing the social services official from\ngaining access to the person who may be in need of PSA; (4)\nthe efforts made by the employees of a\nsocial services district to gain access to the person who may be in need of PSA\nas set forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section; (5)\nthe names of any individuals, such as\nphysicians or nurses, or other health or mental health professionals qualified\nto participate in the assessment, who will accompany and assist the social\nservices official in conducting the PSA assessment; (6)\nthe manner in which the proposed\nassessment is to be conducted; (7)\nthat the social services official seeks an order solely for the purpose of\nassessing the need of a person for PSA; and\n(8)\nthat no prior application has been made\nfor the relief requested or for any similar relief, or if prior application has\nbeen made, the determination thereof, and the new facts, if any, that were not\npreviously shown which warrant a renewal of the application.
