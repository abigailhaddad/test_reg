(1)\n\nThe sum of\nmass mercury emissions (in lb) from each applicable existing MRP unit at a MRP\nfacility identified in Table 1 below shall not exceed the facility-wide mercury\nemission limitation (in lb/year) set forth in Table 1 beginning in the MRP\ncontrol period of 2010 and continuing through 2014. (2)\n\nCompliance with the facility-wide mercury\nemission cap for each MRP control period will be based upon a 12-month total, rolled monthly, reported quarterly. (c) Forty pounds of mercury emissions are set\naside for new MRP units and existing MRP units not in Table 1 of this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
