Publications\ndepicting nude children in a non-pornographic context, but which would promote\nor encourage prurient interest in the sexual performance of children, are\nunacceptable. Publications which, taken as a whole, by the average person\napplying contemporary community standards, appeal to prurient interest, and\nwhich depict or describe in a patently offensive way sexual bestiality, sadism, masochism, necrophilia, or incest and which taken as a whole, lack serious\nliterary, artistic, political or scientific value are obscene and are\nunacceptable. (c) The publication\nshould not incite violence based on race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, creed, or nationality. Incite violence, for purposes of this guildeline, means\nto advocate, expressly or by clear implication, acts of violence. (d) Any publication which advocates and\npresents a clear and immediate risk of lawlessness, violence, anarchy, or\nrebellion against governmental authority is unacceptable. (e) The publication should not incite\ndisobedience towards law enforcement officers or prison personnel. Incite\ndisobedience, for purposes of this guideline, means to advocate, expressly or\nby clear implication, acts of disobedience. (f) The publication should not give\ninstruction in the use or manufacture of firearms, explosives, and other\nweapons, or depict or describe their manufacture.

Note:The above paragraph includes written material that, if\nobserved by a fellow inmate in the inmate's possession, could result in an\ninference being drawn about the inmate's gang affiliation and thereby target\nhim or her for assault or result in other disruptive conduct. It also includes\ncertain written material that could facilitate organizational activity within\nan institution by an organization that has not been approved by the deputy\ncommissioner for program services to operate within that institution. Material\nthat could facilitate organizational activity includes, but is not limited to, a membership roster, organizational chart, constitution or bylaws. All such\nmaterial can be disallowed although otherwise determined not to incite or\nadvocate for violence or disobedience.

Such items shall be\nreferred to the Facility Media Review Committee, and if appealed, referred to\nthe Central Office Media Review Committee, for decision. (j) Publications which discuss different\npolitical philosophies and those dealing with criticism of governmental and\ndepartmental authority are acceptable as reading material provided they do not\nviolate the above guidelines. For example, publications such as Fortune News, The Militant, The Torch/La Antorcha, Workers World, and Revolutionary Worker\nshall generally be approved unless matter in a specific issue is found to\nviolate the above guidelines.
