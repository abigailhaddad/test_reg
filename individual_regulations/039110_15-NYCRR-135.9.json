  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 135.9 - Restricted license\n\nState Regulations\nA restricted license will be issued only by the department\nwhich will establish the conditions applicable to each individual license based\nupon information submitted by the applicant. (a) Form of restricted license. The\nrestricted license will be a two-part form. One part shall be\ncomputer-generated and will bear a notation indicating that it is a restricted\nlicense. The other part will be manually generated and will contain the\nspecific conditions applicable to that particular restricted license. The\nholder of a restricted license, when required to display such license, must\ndisplay both parts of such license. Such license must be amended whenever there\nis a change in the licensee's situation. (b) Establishment of conditions. Each\nrestricted license shall contain the condition that such license shall be\nsubject to revocation for operation outside of the limitations appearing on\nsuch license. Each restricted license will contain the limitations or use of\nsuch license as prescribed by the department, and as accepted by the holder. Such license shall be limited to operation: to and from the holder's place of\nemployment or education; during the course of employment or education, when\nrequired; to and from a medical examination or treatment as part of a necessary\nmedical treatment for such participant or member of his household, as evidenced\nby a written statement to that effect from a licensed medical practitioner; to\nand from a driver rehabilitation program which the holder is required to\nattend; to and from offices of the department in conjunction with the driver\nrehabilitation program or the issuance or amendment of a restricted license or\ndriver's license, or en route to and from a place including a school, at which\nthe child or children or the holder are cared for on a regular basis and which\nis necessary for the holder to maintain such holder's employment or enrollment\nat an accredited school, college or university or at a State-approved\ninstitution of vocational or technical training. Any restricted license issued\non or after February 19, 1991, shall be limited to the operation of vehicles\nwhich are not commercial motor vehicles as defined in section\n501-a\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law or which are not for-hire vehicles as set forth\nin section 530 of such law; provided, however, except for a commercial motor\nvehicle as defined in subdivision four of section\n501-a\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, that the restrictions on types of vehicles\nwhich may be operated with a restricted license contained in this paragraph\nshall not be applicable to a restricted license issued to a person whose\nlicense has been suspended pursuant to paragraph 3 of subdivision 4-e of\nsection 510 of such law. (c) Revocation of restricted license. A restricted license which has been issued\nshall be revoked upon: the holder's conviction of any traffic violation, other\nthan parking, stopping, standing, equipment, inspection or other nonmoving\nviolations where such violation occurred during the period of validity of the\nrestricted license; or for the holder's failure to attend any portion or\nportions of the alcohol and drug rehabilitation program where such attendance\nis required by section\n135.5\n(d) of this\n\nPart. A revocation for any of the above reasons shall be issued without a\nhearing based upon receipt of a certificate or certificates of conviction. In\naddition, the commissioner may revoke a restricted license after a hearing, based upon a complaint that the holder is operating or has operated a motor\nvehicle in violation of the conditions imposed in his restricted use license. The commissioner may also revoke a restricted license without a hearing upon\nreceipt of a certificate of conviction which indicates that the applicant has\ndriven in violation of the conditions of such license. (d) Extra-territorial effect of restricted\nlicense. Whether a restricted license will be honored by other states will be\ndependent upon the laws of each such other state. This State will honor a\nsimilar type license issued by another state to a resident of the issuing state\nto the extent of the conditions imposed. The holder of a restricted license\nissued pursuant to article 21-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law should check\nwith the appropriate motor vehicle authorities of any other state in such other\nstate. (e) Period of validity of\nrestricted use license. Unless otherwise revoked by the commissioner, or\nvoluntarily surrendered to the commissioner, a restricted use license will be\nvalid from the date of its issuance until the expiration date contained thereon\nor until the holder's driver's license is returned to him, whichever occurs\nfirst. (f) Limitation on renewal of\nrestricted license. A restricted license shall not be renewed more than one\nyear after the issuance of the restricted license if the revocation, upon which\nthe restricted license was based, was issued pursuant to section\n318\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law and if the holder of the restricted license has not\npaid the civil penalty required by article 6 of the Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw.
