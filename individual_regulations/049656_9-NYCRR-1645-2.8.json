  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.8 - State Housing Fund investments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nState Comptroller may, from time to time, invest the proceeds of an issue of\n\nState housing bonds. These investments are investments of development funds but\nare designated as State Housing Fund investments to distinguish them from\ndevelopment funds invested directly by the local agency and under its custody\nand control. The local agency will be notified, through the division, when the\ninvestments are made, as to the amounts invested in the various securities. No\naccounting entry shall be made on the books of the local agency to reflect\ninvestments made by the Comptroller. The balance in account 1123, State Housing\n\nFund, may therefore represent cash held by the Comptroller, or cash and\ninvestments. The Comptroller does not amortize premium or discount on\ninvestments made by him and interest thereon is ordinarily paid into the State\n\nHousing Debt Fund. The balance in account 1123, State Housing Fund, will\ntherefore ordinarily remain undisturbed. State Housing Fund investments are\nprimarily of a short-term nature and are on a yield basis. The interest earned\nrepresents the difference between the amount expended on acquisition and the\nproceeds received on disposition of the security. (b) The Comptroller does not accrue interest\nearned on State Housing Fund investments, but records them on a cash basis, as\nreceived. Accordingly, interest earned on State Housing Fund investments shall\nnot be accrued periodically by the local agency but shall be recorded, on a\ncash basis, whenever the local agency is notified by the division of the\nreceipt of the interest by the Comptroller. Upon receipt of such notice, a\njournal entry is made charging account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund, and\ncrediting the appropriate interest earned account, apportioning the interest\nearned to the applicable period, as follows: (1)\n\nInterest applicable to the period up to\nthe date of substantial completion--credit account 1420.2, Interest\n\nIncome. (2)\n\nInterest applicable to\nthe period beginning with the date of substantial completion--credit account\n3610, Interest Earned, for interest applicable to the current fiscal year; credit account 2710, Prior Years Adjustments, for interest applicable to prior\nfiscal years. The local agency will be expected to propose the disposition of\nthe credit to account 2710 to the division for approval prior to the end of the\ncurrent fiscal year, along with the disposition of other charges and credits to\nthe prior years adjustments account. (c) The Comptroller will ordinarily apply the\ninterest received on the State Housing Fund investments to the payment of\ninterest on State housing bonds. The local agency will be notified by the\ndivision as to the amount so to be applied and the local agency will then\nproceed to make the entries recording the application of the interest, as\ndescribed in Part 1644, Debt Service. However, as previously noted, in the\nevent of a loss on disposition of State Housing Fund investments, the\n\nComptroller will apply the interest to the loss to the extent that such\ninterest is available in the State Housing Debt Fund. In the event that such\ninterest has been recorded on the books of the local agency as having been\nreceived by the Comptroller but not yet applied by him to the payment of\ninterest on State Housing bonds, a reversing entry charging the interest earned\naccount and crediting account 1124, State Housing Debt Fund, for the interest\napplied to the loss will be necessary. It is evident that if the Comptroller\nhas received interest which has not yet been recorded on the local agency's\nbooks and has applied it to a loss on disposition, the entry on the local\nagency's book recording the interest will be for the net amount. The division's\nletter of notification to the local agency will contain full instructions for\nthe accounting treatment of these items. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
