(5)\nA customer moving within the service\nterritory of a utility and requesting service within 60 calendar days of the\nclosing of the customer's prior account is eligible to receive service at the\nnew location, in accordance with this section, and such service must be\nconsidered a continuation of service in all respects, with any existing payment\nagreement honored; provided, however, that such customer's prior service had\nnot been terminated for nonpayment at the time of such request. (b) Service application. (1)\n\nAn application for service may be made\neither orally or in writing.

(3)\n\nIf a written application is not required\nas a prerequisite to providing service, an oral application for service will be\nconsidered complete when the applicant provides his or her name, address and, if the applicant has a prior account, either the address or account number, and\nanswers questions relevant to identifying the applicant's use of water on the\npremises, including whether the service will be used primarily for residential\npurposes. (4)\nA written application\nfor service will be considered complete when information has been provided as\nrequired under paragraph (3) of this subdivision, along with proof of the\napplicant's identity and responsibility for the water bills for the premises, through submission of appropriate documents.

If\na utility fails to provide service to an applicant within the time required by\nthis section, the utility must pay to the applicant $25 per day for each day or\nportion of a day that service is not supplied, unless the commission or its\ndesignee determines that the utility had good cause for not providing service\nwithin the required time.
