Tit. 9 § 32.3 - Restrictions upon issuance of use of permits\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny manufacturer or wholesaler to whom an annual\ntemporary solicitor's employment permit has been issued by the authority may\ntemporarily employ persons, eligible for such employment, as solicitors for a\nperiod not to exceed 60 consecutive working days provided that: (a) Simultaneously with the commencement of\nsuch employment, the manufacturer or wholesaler shall issue to such temporary\nemployee a letter certifying to his employment. Such letter shall be on a\nletterhead setting forth the name, address and license number of the said\nmanufacturer or wholesaler. (b) Within 30 days after such employee has been employed as a solicitor, such\nemployee shall file his application for a solicitor's permit with the Liquor\n\nAuthority. In the event that the authority shall notify any manufacturer or\nwholesaler that it does not approve the employment of any such temporary\nemployee as a solicitor, the said manufacturer or wholesaler shall forthwith\nterminate the employment of such person. (c) No manufacturer or wholesaler shall\nemploy or reemploy any person as a solicitor subsequent to receipt of notice\nfrom the Liquor Authority advising that the employment of such individual has\nbeen disapproved by the authority. (d) No person shall be approved for\nemployment as a solicitor contrary to the provisions of subdivision 2 of\nsection\n102\nof the Alcoholic Beverage Control\n\nLaw. (e) This requirement does not\napply to the employment of a person already holding a valid solicitor's permit\nfor the current year. In such cases, a record of the change in employers will\nbe endorsed on the authority's records and upon the solicitor's permit upon its\nsubmission to the authority's zone office with appropriate authorization by the\nnew employer. The application for endorsement of such solicitor's permit must\nbe submitted to the authority within five days after the solicitor has been\nemployed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
