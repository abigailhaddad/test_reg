Absolute pressure of the air above the water shall then be reduced to one inch\nof mercury. Lowered pressure shall be maintained for one minute or until air\nbubbles cease to be given off by the water, whichever is the longer. Pressure\nshall then be increased to normal atmospheric pressure. Any device which leaks\nas evidenced by bubbles emanating from within the device, or water entering the\ndevice, shall be considered as a defective unit; (b) the immersion test water from the\npreceding test in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph shall be\nmeasured for tritium or promethium-147 content by an apparatus that has been\ncalibrated to measure tritium or promethium-147, as appropriate. If more than\n0.1 percent of the original amount of tritium or promethium-147 in any device\nis found to have leaked into the immersion test water, the leaking device shall\nbe considered as a defective unit; and\n(c) the levels of radiation from each device\ncontaining promethium-147 shall be measured. Any device which has a radiation\nlevel in excess of 0.5 millirad per hour at 10 centimeters from any surface\nwhen measured through 50 milligrams per square centimeter of absorber, shall be\nconsidered as a defective unit. (iii)\n\nAn application for a license, or for\namendment of a license, may include a description of procedures proposed as\nalternatives to those prescribed by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, and\nproposed criteria for acceptance under those procedures. The department will\napprove the proposed alternative procedures if the applicant demonstrates that: (a) they will consider defective any sampled\ndevice which has a leakage rate exceeding 0.1 percent of the original quantity\nof tritium or promethium-147 in any 24-hour period; and\n(b) the operating characteristic curve or\nconfidence interval estimate for the alternative procedures provides a \"Lot\n\nTolerance Percent Defective of 5.0 percent\" at the consumer's risk of\n0.10. (iv)\n\nNo person\nlicensed under this subdivision shall transfer to persons generally licensed\nunder section\n38.41, Table 3, item (e) of this\n\nPart: (a) any luminous safety device which has\nbeen tested and found defective under the criteria and procedures specified in\nthis section, unless the defective units have been repaired or reworked and\nhave then met the tests set out in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph; or\n(b) any inspection lot which has\nbeen rejected as a result of the procedures in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, or alternative procedures in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph; unless the defective units have been sorted and removed or have been repaired\nor reworked and have then met the tests set out in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph.
