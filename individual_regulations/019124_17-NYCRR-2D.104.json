  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2D.104 - Snowmobile Route Sign (NYM7-1)\n\nState Regulations\n\nStandard: 01 The Snowmobile Route (NYM7-1) sign (see Sign Drawing\nSD-G14) shall be used on highways where snowmobiles are permitted to use the\nroadway, shoulder, or inside bank by official designation, in accordance with\n\nSection\n25.05\nof the Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation Law. Support: 02 New York State law provides four types of permitted\nhighway use for snowmobiles: Operation of snowmobiles on highways customarily unplowed\nand unused for vehicular travel during winter months. Operation of snowmobiles on shoulders and inside banks of\nplowed highways. Operation of snowmobiles on roadways of plowed highways\nwhere the shoulder, inside bank, and outside bank are determined\nunusable. Operation of snowmobiles on sections of highways, not\nexceeding 1,500 feet in length, to allow access to areas or trails that are\notherwise unreachable. Guidance: 03 Snowmobile Route signs should be displayed on a seasonal\nbasis (see Section\n2A.03\n). Option: 04 Although Snowmobile Route signs ordinarily need not be\nused where snowmobiles are permitted by statute on the outside bank, the signs\nmay be desirable in some instances for guidance continuity. Standard: 05 All auxiliary signs supplementing the Snowmobile Route\nsign shall have white legends and green backgrounds. Guidance: 06 Snowmobile Route signs should be used in combinations\nand assemblies similar to other route signs, except that Junction assemblies\nshould not be used, and Advance Route Turn assemblies are normally\nunnecessary. 07 Snowmobile Route signs should be supplemented by the\nBEGIN (M4-14) auxiliary sign (see Section 2D.23) at the beginning of a route\nand the END (M4-6) auxiliary sign (see Section 2D.22) at the end of a\nroute. Support: 08 Figures 2D-103 and 2D-104 show examples of signing for\nsnowmobile routes. Option: 09 A Snowmobile Route sign supplemented by a M6-4\n\nDirectional Arrow auxiliary sign may be used on a highway to identify a\nsnowmobile trail crossing. Guidance: 10 Snowmobile route sign assemblies should be\nlongitudinally located to clearly mark the permitted travel path. They should\nbe placed in advance of and beyond route turns (in directional and confirming\nassemblies), at intersections with other snowmobile routes, and at intermediate\nlocations, as necessary. The distance between successive signs along a route\nshould be no more than 3000 feet. On unplowed highways, Snowmobile Route sign\nassemblies should be laterally placed three feet to the right of the edge of\nroadway or shoulder. 11 Where snowmobile operation is permitted on the shoulder\nand inside bank of a plowed highway, Snowmobile Route sign assemblies should be\nplaced approximately 3 feet to the right of the crest of the snow bank. Where\nsnowmobile operation is permitted on the roadway of a plowed highway, Snowmobile Route sign assemblies should be placed approximately three feet to\nthe right of the roadway edge. 12 Signs used where operation is restricted to the outside\nbank should be placed a suitable distance to the right of the snow bank crest\nnear the highway right-of-way line. Snowmobile Route sign assemblies should be\nat least seven feet above the ground surface. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2D.104\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
