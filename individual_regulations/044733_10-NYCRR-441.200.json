Tit. 10 § 441.200 - Medical record\n\nState Regulations\nA record kept on patients which properly contains\nsufficient information to identify the patient clearly, to justify his/her\ndiagnosis and treatment, and to document the results accurately. The purposes\nof the record are to serve as the basis for planning and continuity of patient\ncare; provide a means of communication among physicians and any professional\ncontributing to the patient's care; furnish documentary evidence of the\npatient's course of illness and treatment; serve as a basis for review, study\nand evaluation; serve in protecting the legal interests of the patient, hospital and responsible practitioner; and provide data for use in research and\neducation. Medical records and their contents are not usually available to the\npatient himself. The content of the record is usually confidential.
