(e) If\ncondensed whey contains at least 40 percent total solids and has been partially\ncrystallized by cooling, it may be transported to a separate drying plant for\ndrying without repasteurization, provided that: (1)\nthe condensed, partially crystallized\nwhey is cooled and maintained at 45° F (7° C) or less; (2)\nmilk transport tanks used to transport\nthe condensed, partially crystallized whey shall be washed and sanitized\nimmediately prior to filling and shall be sealed immediately after filling\nuntil unloading; and\n(3)\nseparate\nunloading pumps and pipelines shall be provided and used only for the unloading\nof the condensed, partially crystallized whey. Such pumps and pipelines shall\nbe cleaned and sanitized as a separate cleaning circuit.
