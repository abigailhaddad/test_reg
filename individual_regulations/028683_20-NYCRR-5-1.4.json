  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 5-1.4 - Re-computation of investment tax credit on property disposed of or property that ceases to qualify\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-B(1))\n(a) If property on which investment tax\ncredit has been claimed is disposed of or ceases to be in qualified use prior\nto the end of its useful life, the difference between the credit taken and the\ncredit allowed for actual use must be added back to the tax otherwise due in\nthe year of disposition or disqualification. (b) The amount of investment tax credit to be\nadded back is computed as follows: (1)\ndivide\nthe total number of months in qualified use of the property by the total number\nof months of useful life; (2)\nmultiply the amount computed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision by the amount\nof the credit claimed on the property to ascertain the credit allowed for\nactual use; (3)\nsubtract the credit\nallowed for actual use from the credit claimed on the property to determine the\namount of investment tax credit to be added back; and\n(4)\nadd the amount to be added back to the\ntax due for the year the property was disposed of or ceases to\nqualify. (c) A\ndisposition of qualified property includes: (1)\na sale of the property; (2)\na liquidation other than as part of a\nstatutory merger or consolidation; see subdivision (e) of this section for the\nexception; (3)\na legal dissolution\nof the corporation; (4)\na trade-in\nof the property; (5)\na gift of the\nproperty; (6)\ntransfer upon\nforeclosure of a security interest in the property; (7)\nretirement of the property before\nexpiration of its useful life; (8)\ncondemnation of the property; (9)\nloss of the property due to fire, theft, storm or other casualty; and\n(10)\ntransfer of the property to a\ncorporation not taxable under article 9-A. (d) Property that ceases to be in qualified\nuse includes: (1)\nproperty that initially\nqualified, but no longer meets the requirements of section\n5-1.2\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart, such as property that no longer has situs in New York State or\nproperty that no longer is used in the production of goods; and\n(2)\nproperty on which a credit was allowed\nthat was subsequently leased to others. (e) For purposes of this section, a\ndisposition does not occur where property is transferred from a corporation as\npart of a transaction to which IRC section 381(a) applies: e.g., a complete\nliquidation of a subsidiary under I R C section 332, or a reorganization under\nI R C section 361 and I R C section 368 (a)(1)(A) (statutory merger or\nconsolidation), IRC section 368 (a)(1)(C) (certain acquisitions of property\nfrom one corporation by another), IRC section 368 (a)(1)(D) (certain transfers\nof as sets), I R C section 368 (a)(1)(F) (mere change in identity, form or\nplace of organization, however effected) or IRC section 368 (a)(1)(G)\n(bankruptcy reorganizations). As there is no disposition in these cases, an add\nback is not required provided that the property continues in qualified use and\nis acquired by a corporation subject to tax under article 9-A. Generally, in\nthese cases, the acquiring or surviving corporation cannot claim an investment\ntax credit because it takes over such property at the adjusted basis of the\ntransferor and the transfer therefore does not qualify as a purchase pursuant\nto IRC section 179(d)(2). If the property in the hands of the acquiring\ncorporation is not in qualified use for its entire life or for more than 12\nconsecutive years, a recovery from the acquiring corporation is required. In\nmeasuring the period of qualified use, the period during which the property was\nheld by the transferor corporation and the acquiring corporation are to be\ntaken into account. (f) There is no\nadd-back of the investment tax credit if the property is disposed of or ceases\nto be in qualified use after it has been in qualified use for more than 12\nconsecutive years or after the end of its useful life. (g) As used in this section, the useful life\nof property shall be the same number of years as the corporation uses for\n\nFederal depreciation purposes. (h) If property that qualifies for the investment tax credit is disposed of or\nceases to be in qualified use prior to the end of the taxable year in which the\ncredit is to be taken, an investment tax credit is allowed for the period the\nproperty was in qualified use. The credit that will be allowed is that part of\nthe credit that would have been allowed for the entire taxable year multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is the total number of months in\nqualified use of the property and the denominator of which is the total number\nof months of the property's useful life.
