(2)\n\nIn any claim controverted by the\ninsurance carrier pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 25(2), where\nthe insurance carrier will not reimburse the diagnostic testing network, or\nother party for diagnostic examinations and tests administered to the claimant\nuntil the controversy is resolved and the claim established, including under\nthe provisions of Workers' Compensation Law section 21-a, the insurance carrier\nshall provide notice of this decision to the claimant with the notice that the\nright to compensation is controverted. Such notice shall be in the form\nprescribed by the chair, and shall state that the insurance carrier does not\nintend to reimburse any designated diagnostic testing network or affiliated\nnetwork provider while the claim is controverted and until it is established, and the claimant may elect to use a diagnostic examination and testing facility\nnot designated pursuant to this Part during the period that the claim is\ncontroverted. In the event the claimant prevails on his or her claim, the\ninsurance carrier shall reimburse either: (i) the claimant or third party that has made payment for such diagnostic\nexamination or test; or\n(ii)\nthe\ndiagnostic examination and testing facility that administered the diagnostic\nexamination or test to the claimant where the diagnostic examination and\ntesting facility has not charged the claimant or any third party for payment.

(c) Affiliated network providers, or to the extent permitted by law a diagnostic\ntesting network, shall supply a copy of the diagnostic examination and testing\nreport to the treating medical provider who ordered the diagnostic examination\nand tests and other parties of interest as specified in section\n325-7.5\n(e) of\nthis Subpart.
