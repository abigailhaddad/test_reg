  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 220.4 - Incarcerated Individual Eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Preconditions. An Incarcerated Individual\nmust meet the following preconditions to be eligible to participate in the FRP: (1)\n\nTime. (i) New Incarcerated Individual: The\n\nIncarcerated Individual has been in the department's custody for at least six\nmonths, excluding initial reception, and is at the time of application a\nresident of a facility that offers the program. (ii)\n\nTransferred Incarcerated Individual: An\n\nIncarcerated Individual who has successfully participated in the FRP at one\nfacility and is transferred to another facility where the program is offered\nmay apply immediately for participation. An incarcerated individual who has not\nparticipated at his or her previous facility must wait 30 days to apply for the\nprogram. This will give the incarcerated individual time to have an assessment\nat the new facility. (iii)\n\nIf an\nincarcerated individual is within 90 days to an approved release date, an\napplication will not be accepted. If an incarcerated individual has already\nbeen approved by central office and received a date prior to the 90-day mark, the superintendent has the discretion to approve or deny the visit. (2)\n\nAdjustment. The Incarcerated\n\nIndividual has exhibited a pattern of good institutional adjustment and has not\nhad any major, chronic, severe, or excessive disciplinary problems. Any\nincarcerated individual serving disciplinary sanctions, to include loss of\nprivileges, that run concurrently with a scheduled FRP visit, will have that\nvisit cancelled. Upon completion of disciplinary sanctions, the visit may be\nrescheduled. Satisfactory behavior must be maintained throughout the duration\nof the application /appeal. Any major disciplinary problems incurred during the\napplication/appeal process will result in a denial or termination of the\napplication/appeal. The incarcerated individual will become ineligible to\nreapply for 60 days from the date the major disciplinary sanction is completed. If the incarcerated individual has a chronic disciplinary problem, a new\napplication may be submitted 180 days from the date the chronic disciplinary\nsanction is completed. If the incarcerated individual has a Tier II severe\ndisciplinary problem, a new application may be submitted 180 days after the\nsanction is completed; if it is a Tier III severe disciplinary problem, an\napplication may be submitted 1 year after the sanction is completed. Reapplication is contingent upon the incarcerated individual\nmeeting all criteria noted in the application process. If the criteria are met, the application must be sent to central office for a full-cycle review. (i) Major disciplinary problem. Shall be\ndefined as any Tier II or III disciplinary disposition in the 60 days prior to\nthe application, resulting in confinement to cell, room, or dorm\ncontinuously, on certain days or during certain hours, for 15 days or more, or\nany loss of good time. Reapplication can be made 60 days from the confinement\nrelease date. Satisfactory behavior must be maintained throughout the duration\nof application and/or appeal. Any major disciplinary problems incurred during\nthe application/appeal process will result in denial or termination of the\napplication/appeal. The incarcerated individual will become ineligible to\nreapply for 60 days, as defined above. (ii)\n\nChronic disciplinary problem. Shall be\ndefined as three or more Tier II or III disciplinary dispositions in the 180\ndays prior to the application, or an accumulation of 45 days or more\nkeeplock/SHU in the 180 days prior to the application. Reapplication may be\nmade 180 days from the confinement release date. (iii)\n\nSevere disciplinary problem. Shall be\ndefined as a conviction for a federal or state crime while incarcerated or any\n\nTier II or III disciplinary report for the following rule violations regardless\nof the length of the sanction: (a) a penal law\noffense; (b) rioting; (c) escape; (d) use or possession of drugs or alcohol; (e) unauthorized group\nactivities; (f) gangs; (g) assault on incarcerated\nindividual; (h) assault on\nstaff; (i) assault on\nother; (j) sex offense; (k) forcible touching; (l) lewd exposure; (m) lewd conduct; (n) explosives; (o) arson; (p) escape paraphernalia; and/or\n(q) unhygienic act. A conviction or disciplinary finding for any of these severe\ninfractions will render the incarcerated individual ineligible to participate\nin the program as follows: Tier II infractions will result in a 180-day ineligibility\nsanction, Tier III infractions will result in a 1-year ineligibility sanction. The sanction will begin after any disciplinary confinement is served. Applications will not be accepted until sanction is completed. A federal or\nstate crime conviction, while incarcerated, will require immediate suspension\nand full-cycle review for any possible future participation. (iv)\n\nExcessive disciplinary\nproblems. Shall be defined as having 20 percent or more of the past 36 months\nprior to the application spent in disciplinary confinement. If, at the time of\nthe application, the incarcerated individual has been incarcerated less than 36\nmonths, the standard will be 20 percent of that time of incarceration. The\nincarcerated individual may reapply for FRP consideration 24 months after\ncompletion of any disciplinary sanction, provided all other eligibility\nrequirements are met. (3)\n\nProgram participation. The Incarcerated\n\nIndividual applicant must have participated in or pursued required programs as\nidentified on his or her program/earned eligibility plan. Program/earned\neligibility plan refusals, negative removals, or regressions make an applicant\nineligible until that need is addressed. Any disciplinary behavior which has\nbeen exhibited in the incarcerated individual's social, criminal, or\ninstitutional history will be factored into the option of participating in\ntherapeutic services. Formal therapeutic programs sanctioned by DOCCS, such as\nthe Alcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment Program (ASAT), Comprehensive\n\nAlcohol and Substance Abuse Treatment (CASAT), Driving While Intoxicated (DWI), or other approved specialized substance abuse treatment programs and the\n\nAggression Replacement Training (ART) Program for aggression/violence, are the\nstandards that must be met. Additionally, approved therapeutic self-help\nservices such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) may be\nconsidered. Attendance at volunteer led self-help groups is the preferred\noption and will be evaluated as such. Participation in self-help services is\nvoluntary and is seen as a supplement to, and not a substitute for, a\nformalized substance abuse treatment need. I ncarcerated individual's who have\nactively pursued their plan yet who have not completed programs and satisfied\ntheir needs, will be evaluated according to their entire record. However, dependent on his or her criminal, disciplinary, and programming history, active\nparticipation or actual completion of a specific therapeutic or treatment\nprogram may be required to satisfy this precondition. When directed to complete\na program, incarcerated individuals must wait until that program is completed\nprior to reapplication to FRP. Satisfactory completion of any program does not\nimply FRP approval. (b) Disqualifying conditions. An Incarcerated Individual is not eligible to\nparticipate in the FRP if any of the following conditions exists: (1)\nthe Incarcerated Individual is eligible\nfor the temporary release program (unless th at incarcerated individual's\napplication for temporary release has been denied); (2)\nthe Incarcerated Individual has a higher\nsecurity designation than permitted at the program site; (3)\nthe Incarcerated Individual is assigned\nto a special housing unit (SHU) for disciplinary reasons or is in\nadministrative segregation, or in a mental health unit (MHU) with concurrent\nSHU time ( Behavioral Health Unit (BHU), Therapeutic Behavioral Unit (TBU), or\n\nRegional Mental Health Unit (RMHU)); (4)\nthe incarcerated individual has not been\nin general population for the required period of time; (5)\nthe incarcerated individual has not been\nin current facility for the required period of time; (6)\nthe application is submitted prior to\nmeeting the conditions set in previous denial; (7)\nan Incarcerated Individual participant\nfound in violation of the FRP regulations/standards will have his or her\neligibility suspended. Tier II violations impose a 180-day suspension; Tier III\nviolations impose a 1-year suspension. A new application must be reviewed and\napproved by central office prior to the incarcerated individual's future FRP\nparticipation. Prior approval does not guarantee readmission; (8)\nthe incarcerated individual or requested\nvisitor is serving any suspension, restriction, or modification to visitation\nrelated to section\n201.4\nof this title. This includes non-contact visit sanctions; (9)\nif it is determined that a visitor\ncommits or attempts to commit to introduce the following contraband into a\ncorrectional facility, that visitor may be denied by central office, thereby\nmaking the visitor ineligible for participation in the program for a minimum of\n2 years. Once the visitor completes the 2-year period of ineligibility, a FRP\napplication can be submitted by the incarcerated individual with the visitor's\nname, if the incarcerated individual meets the basic eligibility standards. (a) any electronic device that can be\nused/modified for contact outside of the department/correctional facility\n(e.g., I-pad, laptop, cell phones, electronic charging devices, pagers, etc.)\n(b) drugs or\nintoxicants; (c) weapons, including\nexplosives and/or incendiary material/devices; (d) maps; (e) tools; (f) any item determined to be escape\nparaphernalia. Note: If any event in 1-8 above occurs, the incarcerated\nindividual is considered ineligible at the facility level. The application\nshould not be processed. The FRP ORC will notify the incarcerated individual, via an ineligible facility form, as to the reason for the ineligibility and any\napplicable corrective action and/or reapply date. A copy of this notice will be\nplaced in the incarcerated individual's facility FRP file. In the event of number 9, a-f, the case must be forwarded to\ncentral office for review and decision by the deputy commissioner for program\nservices or designee. If it is determined that the incarcerated individual\nconspired to have contraband smuggled into the FRP site, the incarcerated\nindividual may be denied participation in the program for a minimum of two\nyears. Once the incarcerated individual completes the two-year period of\nineligibility, an FRP application can be submitted, if the incarcerated\nindividual meets the basic eligibility standards. (c) Special review/ Incarcerated\n\nIndividual. (1)\nA special review will be\nconducted by central office staff that will include consideration of the\nspecifics of the crime, the age of the Incarcerated Individual at the time of\nthe offense, progress in programs, custodial adjustment, victim impact, and\nthe entire case record to determine eligibility if an Incarcerated Individual: (i) has been designated a central monitoring\ncase (CMC); (ii)\nhas any\noutstanding warrants, show cause order (e.g., Bureau of Immigration &\nCustoms Enforcement); (iii)\nhas\nbeen convicted of a heinous or unusual crime; (iv)\nhas been convicted of a sex offense, including a sexually motivated felony, or any other offense where behavior of a\nsexual nature occurred during the commission of the crime; (v) has been convicted of a violent crime\nagainst an elderly person, family member, or a child; (vi)\nhas been convicted of escape or an\nescape attempt; (vii)\nhas a history\nof domestic violence or Order of Protection; (viii)\nis a returned parole\nviolator; (ix)\nis in or has a\nhistory of protective custody; (x) Requested visitor is a minor step-child; (xi)\nprior participation has been\nsuspended/terminated; (xii)\nis in a\nspecial program such as the Assessment and Program Participation Unit (APPU) or\nassigned to a mental health unit; (a) review\nmust include consideration of evaluation by psychiatric staff; (xiii)\nis diagnosed as having a\ncommunicable disease. (2)\n\nSuch special review shall be conducted\nonly for those incarcerated individuals who ha ve been otherwise approved in\naccordance with the process set forth in section\n220.6\nof this Part. (3)\n\nFacility health\nservices staff will notify the facility FRP ORC of any Incarcerated Individual\napproved for FRP who is diagnosed as having a communicable disease that may\npose a health risk to a visitor. A FRP visit will not be denied solely on the\nbasis of the HIV status of an incarcerated individual /applicant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
