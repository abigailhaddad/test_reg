(b) At any scheduled call of a\ncalendar or at a pretrial conference, if all parties do not appear and proceed\nor announce their readiness to proceed immediately or subject to the engagement\nof counsel, the judge presiding may note the default on the record and enter an\norder as follows: (1)\n\nIf the\nplaintiff appears but the defendant does not, the judge may grant judgment by\ndefault or order an inquest. (2)\n\nIf the defendant appears but the\nplaintiff does not, the judge may dismiss the action and may order a severance\nof counterclaims or cross-claims. (3)\n\nIf no party appears, the judge may\nstrike the action from the calendar or make such other order as appears\njust.

A motion\nmust be supported by affidavit by a person having firsthand knowledge, satisfactorily explaining the reasons for the action having been stricken and\nshowing that it is presently ready for trial.

A copy of the order shall be served on the\ncalendar clerk and the case shall receive a new calendar number followed by the\nletter \"R\" to designate the case as having been restored. Absent exceptional\ncircumstances, if a restored case is not ready when reached, it shall forthwith\nbe dismissed or an inquest or judgment ordered as provided in subdivision (b)\nof this section.
