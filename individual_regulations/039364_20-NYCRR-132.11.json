Accordingly, where an individual not domiciled in New York State is paid\ncompensation by the United States for active service in the Armed Forces of the\n\nUnited States, such compensation received by such individual does not\nconstitute income derived from New York State sources even though the service\nis performed in whole or in part within New York State. (See section\n631[e] of the Tax\n\nLaw.)\n(b) Compensation of employees\nof interstate rail carriers, interstate motor carriers and interstate motor\nprivate carriers. Compensation paid by: (1)\na\nrail carrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nInterstate Commerce Commission under subchapter I of chapter\n105\nof title 49 of\nthe United States Code; (2)\na motor\ncarrier providing transportation subject to the jurisdiction of the Interstate\n\nCommerce Commission under subchapter II of chapter\n105\nof title 49 of the\n\nUnited States Code; or\n(3)\na motor\nprivate carrier; to an employee who performs regularly assigned duties\nin two or more states shall constitute income derived from sources within such\nemployee's state of residence.

For purposes of the preceding sentence, an employee shall be\ndeemed to have earned more than 50 percent of such employee's compensation in\nany state in which such employee's scheduled flight time in such state is more\nthan 50 percent of such employee's total scheduled flight time in the calendar\nyear while so employed. Accordingly, where an individual, who is not a resident\nof New York State for income tax purposes under section\n605 (b)(1)\nof the Tax Law, is paid compensation as an employee by an interstate air carrier for performing\nsuch employee's regularly assigned duties on an aircraft in two or more states, such compensation received by such employee will not constitute income derived\nfrom New York State sources unless such employee earned more than 50 percent of\nsuch compensation in New York State.
