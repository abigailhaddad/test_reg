  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 603.1 - Authority, intent and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is adopted under authority of sections 913, 915, 915-b and 922 of\narticle 42 of the Executive Law to implement the provisions of the Waterfront\n\nRevitalization of Coastal Areas and Inland Waterways Act. (b) In chapter 791 of the Laws of 1992, the\n\nLegislature emphasized the importance of New York State's navigable waters and\nunderwater lands, and acknowledged the need to control uses, projects and\nstructures in or over these areas. The Legislature specifically identified the\nregulation of such projects and structures as necessary to meet the State' s\nobligations, founded principally on the Public Trust Doctrine, to responsibly\nmanage the State's proprietary interests, protect vital assets held in the name\nof the People of the State, and guarantee common law and sovereign rights. To\nthis end, the Legislature declared that the reasonable exercise of riparian or\nlittoral rights by waterfront owners shall be consistent with the public\ninterest in reasonable use and responsible management of navigable waters and\nlands underwater for purposes of navigation, commerce, fishing, bathing, recreation, environmental and aesthetic protection, and access. Along with\nrecognizing the importance of State agency actions in fulfilling these\nobligations, the Legislature also recognized the significant role New York's\ncities, towns and villages are capable of taking in the regulation and\nmanagement of activities in or over the State's navigable waters and underwater\nlands if granted clear authority to regulate these areas. Accordingly, the\n\nLegislature has provided for the development and approval of local\ncomprehensive harbor management plans (HMPs) and the local laws or ordinances\nnecessary to implement these plans. It is the intention of this Part to enable\ncities, towns and villages to exercise this new authority in a manner which\nmeets local needs while accommodating the significant interest of the State, on\nbehalf of the public, in lands underwater and navigable waters. It is the\npurpose of this Part to provide the procedural and substantive requirement for\napproval of HMPs and local laws and ordinances necessary to implement these\nplans. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n603.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
