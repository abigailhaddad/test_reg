  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 624.8 - Conduct of the adjudicatory proceeding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Order of events.' The ALJ has discretion\nto determine and adjust the order of events and presentation of evidence, and\nto establish procedures to promote the conduct of a fair and efficient\nproceeding. In general, the order of events at an evidentiary hearing will be\nas follows: (1)\n\nFormal opening. The ALJ will\nconvene the evidentiary hearing by opening the record, identifying the\napplications involved, and making appropriate procedural\nannouncements. (2)\n\nNoting\nappearances. The ALJ will call the name of each person who has been granted\nstatus as a party. (3)\n\nOpening\nstatements. At the discretion of the ALJ, prior to the commencement of the\nevidentiary hearing each party will be provided with the opportunity to offer a\nbrief opening statement of position on the application. (4)\n\nAdmission of evidence. The applicant will\npresent its direct case first and will start by identifying all documents that\nconstitute the application and the DEIS (where applicable) and all supporting\ndocuments that are relevant to the issues to be adjudicated. A panel of\nwitnesses may be used for presenting testimony or for cross-examination at the\nALJ's discretion. Cross-examination will be conducted by parties in a sequence\nto be established by the ALJ, which normally will be the sequence in which the\nparties will present their direct cases. The evidence will be confined to that\nwhich is relevant to issues identified in the ALJ's determination following the\nissues conference. (5)\n\nClose of\nrecord. Closing statements of position will be dealt with in the same manner as\nopening statements. At the concluding session of the evidentiary hearing, the\nALJ will determine whether to allow the submission of written post-hearing\nbriefs. The hearing record will be officially closed upon the receipt of the\nstenographic record by the ALJ, the receipt of additional technical data or\nother material agreed at the hearing to be made available after the hearing, receipt of a summary of substantive comments pursuant to subdivision\n621.10\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, or the submission of briefs and reply briefs, conclusions of law, memoranda, and exceptions, if any, by the various parties, whichever occurs\nlast. The ALJ will notify the parties in writing, immediately upon official\nclosing of the hearing record. (6)\n\nWhere the ALJ permits the filing of briefs, the ALJ will also determine whether\nreplies will be permitted and the schedule for filing. Simultaneous filing will\nnormally be required. A party must give specific reference to the portions of\nthe record, whether transcript or otherwise, relied upon in support of the\nrespective statements of fact made throughout the brief. Briefs will be\nconsidered only as argument and must not refer to or contain any evidentiary\nmaterial outside of the record. (b) 'The ALJ.'\n(1)\n\nIn proceedings pursuant to this Part, the\nALJ has power to: (i) rule upon all motions\nand requests, including those that decide the ultimate merits of the\nproceeding; (ii)\nset the time and\nplace of all hearings or issues conferences, recesses and adjournments, including conducting any public comment hearings, issues conferences or\nevidentiary hearings by video conference, telephone conference or other similar\nservice allowing for attendance from remote locations; (iii)\nadminister oaths and\naffirmations; (iv)\nissue subpoenas\nupon request of a party not represented by an attorney admitted to practice in\n\nNew York State; (v) upon the\nrequest of a party, issue a subpoena duces tecum to be served upon a library, other department or bureau of a municipal corporation or of the State, or an\nofficer thereof, requiring the production of any books, papers or other\nthings; (vi)\nupon the request of a\nparty, quash and modify subpoenas except that in the case of a non-party\nwitness the ALJ may quash or modify a subpoena regardless of whether or not a\nparty has so requested; (vii)\nsummon and examine witnesses; (viii)\nestablish rules for and direct\ndisclosure at the request of any party or upon the ALJ's own motion pursuant to\nthe procedures set out in section\n624.7\nof this Part; (ix)\nadmit or exclude evidence including the\nexclusion of evidence on grounds of privilege or confidentiality; (x) hear and determine arguments on fact or\nlaw, except that a purely legal issue involving no factual dispute and which is\na matter of first impression or is precedential in nature may be referred to\nthe General Counsel for a determination in accordance with Part 619 of this\n\nTitle (declaratory ruling) upon motion by any party or upon the ALJ's own\ninitiative; (xi)\npreclude\nirrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious, tangential or speculative\nevidence, argument, examination or cross-examination; (xii)\ndirect the consolidation of parties\nwith similar viewpoints and input; (xiii)\nlimit the number of\nwitnesses; (xiv)\nutilize a panel of\nwitnesses for purposes of direct testimony or cross-examination; (xv)\nallow oral argument, so long as it is\nrecorded; (xvi)\ntake any measures\nnecessary for maintaining order and the efficient conduct of the\nproceeding; (xvii)\ntake any\nmeasures necessary to ensure compliance with SEQRA and UPA not inconsistent\nwith section\n624.4\nof this Part; (xviii)\nin the case of water supply rate\ndisputes, issue directives modifying any incompatible provisions of this Part, consistent with the spirit and intent of these regulations; (xix)\nissue orders limiting the length of\ncross-examination, the form, length and content of motions and briefs and\nsimilar matters; (xx)\norder a site\nvisit, on notice to all parties; (xxi)\nexercise any other authority available\nto ALJs under this Part or to presiding officers under SAPA article 3; and\n(xxii)\nwhen a request for an\nadjudicatory proceeding is made by an applicant for a permit not governed by\nthe UPA based upon department staff's denial of a permit or permit renewal\napplication, and unless otherwise required by law or unless a significant\ndegree of public interest exists, ('a')\nlimit\nparticipation at an evidentiary hearing to department staff and the applicant; and\n('b')\nwaive some or all of the\nprovisions of sections\n624.3, 624.4, 624.5\nand\n624.11\nof this Part. (2)\n\nImpartiality of the\nALJ and motions for recusal. (i) The ALJ will\nconduct the adjudicatory proceeding in a fair and impartial manner. (ii)\n\nAn ALJ must not be assigned to any\nproceeding in which the ALJ has a personal interest. (iii)\n\nAny party may file with the ALJ a\nmotion in conformance with section\n624.6\nof this Part, together with\nsupporting affidavits, requesting that the ALJ be recused on the basis of\npersonal bias or other good cause. A motion requesting recusal will be\ndetermined as part of the record of the adjudicatory proceeding. (iv)\n\nUpon being notified that an ALJ declines\nor fails to serve, or in the case of the ALJ's death, illness, resignation, retirement, removal or recusal, the Chief ALJ must designate a successor within\nthirty (30) days of being notified. (3)\n\nThe designation of an ALJ as the\ncommissioner's representative must be in writing and filed in the Office of\n\nHearings and Mediation Services. (c) 'Appearances.'\n(1)\nA party may appear in person or be\nrepresented by an attorney licensed in New York State or any other\njurisdiction, or by a non-attorney chosen by the party. Any representative of a\nparty who is other than an attorney licensed to practice in New York State must\ndisclose the representative's qualifications in writing to the party. Nothing\nin this paragraph authorizes a nonlawyer to engage in the practice of\nlaw. (2)\n\nAny person appearing on\nbehalf of a party in a representative capacity may be required by the ALJ to\nshow and state on the record the person's authority to act in a representative\ncapacity and to file a written notice of appearance with the ALJ. (3)\n\nIf there is a change or withdrawal of a\nparty's attorney or authorized representative, the party must provide written\nnotice of the change or withdrawal to the ALJ and the attorneys or authorized\nrepresentatives of all other parties, or, if a party appears without an\nattorney or authorized representative, to the party, within ten (10) days of\nthe change or withdrawal. (d) 'Appeals of ALJ rulings.'\n(1)\n(i) Any\nALJ ruling, except a ruling denying party status, may be appealed to the\ncommissioner after the completion of all testimony as part of a party's final\nbrief or by notice of appeal and appeal where no final brief has been\nauthorized. Where no final brief has been authorized, the appellant must file\nthe notice of appeal and appeal within ten (10) days after service of the\nwritten notice that the hearing record is closed pursuant to paragraph\n624.8(a)(5) of this Part. (ii)\n\nAny\nALJ ruling pursuant to paragraph 624.4(c)(5) of this Part that finally resolves\nall issues in a proceeding may be appealed to the commissioner by notice of\nappeal and appeal. The appellant must file the notice of appeal and appeal\nwithin ten (10) days of the ALJ's ruling. (iii)\n\nThe notice of appeal and appeal must be\nserved on all parties and filed with the commissioner c/o the deputy\ncommissioner for hearings and mediation services within ten (10) days after\nservice of the written notice that the hearing record is closed. Responses to a\nnotice of appeal and appeal must be served on all parties and filed with the\ncommissioner c/o the deputy commissioner for hearings and mediation services\nwithin ten (10) days of service of the notice of appeal. One original and three\ncopies of the notice of appeal, appeal and responses must be filed with the\ncommissioner c/o the deputy commissioner for hearings and mediation services. Only the commissioner will determine whether further responsive pleadings after\nthe responses will be allowed. (2)\n\nDuring the course of the proceeding, in\nconformance with subdivision\n624.6\n(e) of this\n\nPart, the following rulings may be appealed to the commissioner on an\ninterlocutory basis: (i) a ruling denying\nparty status; or\n(ii)\nany ruling in\nwhich the ALJ has denied a motion for recusal; and\n(iii)\nany other ruling of the ALJ that does\nnot finally resolve all issues in the proceeding, by seeking permission to file\nan interlocutory appeal. (3)\nA motion for permission to file an\ninterlocutory appeal, pursuant to subdivision\n624.6\n(e) of this\n\nPart, must demonstrate that the failure to decide the appeal on an\ninterlocutory basis would be unduly prejudicial to one of the parties or would\nresult in significant inefficiency in the hearing process. In all such cases, the commissioner's determination to consider the appeal on an interlocutory\nbasis is discretionary. (4)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may review any ruling of the ALJ on an interlocutory basis upon\nthe commissioner's determination or upon a determination by the ALJ that the\nruling should be appealed. (5)\n\nWhenever the commissioner grants permission to file an interlocutory appeal, the parties must be notified. The appellant must be provided the opportunity to\nfile a brief on appeal and the other parties must be provided with the\nopportunity to file a response to the appeal. (6)\n\nExcept for failure to file an\ninterlocutory appeal from a ruling denying party status, failure to file an\ninterlocutory appeal or the denial of permission to file an interlocutory\nappeal will not preclude an appeal from the ruling to the commissioner after\nthe evidentiary hearing. (7)\n\nThe\nevidentiary hearing and any ruling of the ALJ will not be adjourned or stayed\nwhile an appeal or motion for permission to appeal is pending except by\npermission of the ALJ or the commissioner. (e) 'Joint adjudicatory proceedings.' A\nproject may require submission of applications for more than one permit, or to\nmore than one government agency, and adjudicatory proceedings may be required\nfor more than one purpose. Whenever practicable, all required proceedings will\nbe consolidated into a single proceeding. (f) If the department is the lead agency for\npurposes of SEQRA, the permit hearing proceedings will be consolidated with the\nhearing on the DEIS. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
