  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-3.8 - Income analysis ledger\n\nState Regulations\nA separate income analysis ledger, using the 3000 group\nof detailed income accounts, and controlled (subsequent to the date of\nsubstantial completion) by an account or accounts in the general ledger\n(depending on whether single or multiple general ledger controls are being\noperated) shall be maintained for each project, beginning with the first day of\nthe initial operating period, to record the income derived from project rentals\nand other sources of revenue. Separate income analysis ledgers, using the 3000\ngroup of detailed income accounts to record the rental and other income derived\nfrom the operation of the respective properties, and controlled by the\nrespective development cost subaccounts, shall also be maintained for each\nrelated program and for the project site prior to demolition and construction. The division may further require, depending on the circumstances, that separate\nincome analysis ledgers be maintained, prior and subsequent to construction, for each site included in a multiple development project, in which case the\nlocal agency will be so advised. The income analysis ledger set up to record\nrent and other revenues from the operation of the site prior to demolition and\nconstruction may also be used subsequent to construction, but it is preferable\nto set up a new income analysis ledger upon the initial occupancy of the newly\nconstructed buildings and to carry this ledger forward into the operating\nperiod. During the initial operating period, account 1470.3 shall control both\nthe income and the expense analysis ledgers. If desired, however, the local\nagency may set up one account, say 1470.3 (3000), to control the income during\nthe initial operating period, and another account, say 1470.3 (4000) to control\nthe expense. These accounts may then be closed at the end of each month into\naccount 1470.3, which will then operate as a profit and loss account. The\ngeneral ledger controls, i.e., account 3000, the Income Control Account, and\naccount 4000, the Expense Control Account, come into operation only with the\ndate of substantial completion of the project proper. Postings to income\nanalysis ledgers will originate almost exclusively from journal vouchers. Occasional postings may originate from the books of original entry. The income\nanalysis ledger may consist of a card or a loose leaf sheet for each income\naccount, as per Exhibit 14 of Appendix S-8, or, alternatively, of a loose-leaf\nsheet providing columns for each of the necessary accounts, as per Exhibit 15\nof Appendix S-8. The former is recommended as providing a continuous record of\nall transactions affecting a particular income classification exclusively and\nas affording a better control during the operating period, inasmuch as space is\nprovided for recording the quarterly and annual budget figures for the\nparticular income classification. Income analysis ledger sheets are provided by\nthe local agency, stock forms for either specimen, or forms which may be\nadapted, may be procured at most stationers, either without printing or\noverprinted. At the end of each calendar month, after all postings have been\nmade, the income analysis ledger is footed and the total for each account as of\nthe end of that month is determined. The aggregate cumulative totals to date, as determined by a monthly trial balance, shall agree with the balances\nreflected in the respective control accounts. During the operating period, the\ncumulative totals are stated on a quarterly and on an annual basis as indicated\nby the specimen forms. This procedure produces, in readily available form, the\ncontrolled figures for previous, current, and cumulative income required in\npreparing form DH-621, the operating budget-income control statement filed with\nthe periodic reports to the division. After footing the income analysis ledger\nfor the month, transactions for the succeeding month may be recorded\nimmediately following. It will not be necessary to head up a new income\nanalysis ledger sheet for each new month, if space remains on the sheet for the\nprevious month. Alternative procedures for determining and recording previous, current, and cumulative income, as by a different columnar arrangement of the\nincome analysis ledger sheet or by a machine bookkeeping, may be adopted by the\nlocal agency. Where loose-leaf sheets are used, the income analysis ledger\nshould be kept in the same binder with the related expense analysis ledger. Where the division has directed the maintenance of separate income analysis\nledgers for the various sites included in a multiple development project, consideration may be given to their consolidation when the project as a whole\nhas been substantially completed and bonds have been issued. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-3.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
