  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 878.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portions thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on the watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes, are usually referred to by name or abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered progressing upstream\nfrom the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such\nlakes or ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise\naround the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When isolated lakes and ponds\nare referenced by a waters index number, it it merely for convenience of their\nidentification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not\nnecessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to which no\nsurface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Mohawk-Hudson watershed in 1934 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1934 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the East Canada Creek drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary Waters\nH-240\n\nMohawk River\n\nThe 240th tributary of the Hudson River numbered\nconsecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-144\n\nEast Canada Creek\n\nThe 144th tributary of the Mohawk River numbered\nfrom its confluence with the Hudson River. H-240-144-13\n\nSprite Creek\n\nThe 13th stream tributary of East Canada Creek\nnumbered consecutively upstream from the mouth. H-240-144-13-P 717\n\nCanada Lake\n\nThe 717th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Mohawk-Hudson watershed. H-240-144-13-P 717-3\n\nIrving Pond Outlet\n\nThe 3rd tributary of Canada Lake numbered in a\nclockwise direction from the outlet. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary, and\nsubtributaries\nshall\nmean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any\nother stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters\nindex number, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water referenced by such waters index\nnumber and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof which are shown on the\nreference maps, excluding numbered pond, unless exceptions are expressly\nstated. (d) Name\nas appearing in table I shall mean the name by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In\ncases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named waters to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary are identified as far as\npossible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown.

The symbol (T) appearing after any class designation shall mean that the\ndesignated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved oxygen specification\nfor trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS) after any class\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are suitable for trout\nspawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for trout spawning waters\nshall apply thereto.
