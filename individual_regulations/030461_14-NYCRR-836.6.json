  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 836.6 - Incident reporting, notice, and investigations in facilities and provider agencies certified, licensed or operated by the Office\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless otherwise indicated herein, all\nreportable incidents as defined in this Part shall be reported to the\n\nVulnerable Persons' Register. (b) A\ncustodian of any service provider who personally observes, is advised of, or\notherwise becomes aware of an incident must take immediate and appropriate\naction to intervene and attempt to prevent or limit injury or potential injury\nto any person to the greatest extent possible. (c) In accordance with a provider's incident\nmanagement program, a written incident report must be initiated or a call made\nby a mandated reporter as defined in this Part to the Vulnerable Persons'\nRegister toll-free hotline immediately after a reportable incident is\ndiscovered. (1)\n\nEvery mandated reporter who\nhas direct knowledge of an incident and has reasonable cause to suspect that a\nperson receiving services has been subjected to a reportable incident is\nrequired to make a report to the VPCR unless: (i) he or she has actual knowledge that the\nreportable incident has been reported to the VPCR; and\n(ii)\nthat he or she has been named as a\nperson with knowledge of the incident in such prior report. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this reporting\nobligation, \"discovery\" occurs when a mandated reporter has \"reasonable cause\nto suspect\" that a service recipient has been subjected to a reportable\nincident. This may occur either: (i) when a\nmandated reporter witnesses a suspected reportable incident; or\n(ii)\nwhen another person, including a service\nrecipient, comes before the mandated reporter, in the mandated reporter's\nprofessional or official capacity, and provides the mandated reporter with\nreasonable cause to suspect that a service recipient has been subjected to a\nreportable incident. (3)\n\nFor purposes of this reporting\nobligation, \"reasonable cause to suspect\" does not require conclusive evidence\nthat the incident occurred; a rational or sensible suspicion is sufficient and\nmay be based on the mandated reporter's observations, training and experience, and the mandated reporter's disbelief of an explanation provided for an\ninjury. (d) In addition\nto those reports of reportable incidents that must be made to the Justice\n\nCenter, an initial incident report must be forwarded to the director or\ndesignee for investigation immediately after an incident is discovered. Such an\ninitial incident report shall, at a minimum, contain the following information: (1)\n\nThe exact date and time of the incident\nif known; and\n(2)\na description of\nthe incident, including location, and actions taken in response to it; and\n(3)\nthe name(s), address(es), and telephone number(s) of the victim(s), witness(es), and any other persons\ninvolved; and\n(4)\nthe presence of\ninjuries, if any, and first aid provided to address such injuries. (e) The Justice Center shall\ndetermine whether a reportable incident shall be investigated by the Justice\n\nCenter or delegated to the Office for investigation. If an incident is\ndelegated to the Office by the Justice Center, the Office may investigate such\nreportable incident itself, or may delegate such an investigation to the\nfacility or provider agency. For any investigation of a reportable incident of\nabuse or neglect that is not conducted by the Justice Center, the final report\nof such investigation of abuse or neglect must be provided to the Justice\n\nCenter no later than fifty (50) days after the Justice Center accepts the\ninitial report of the incident, unless an extension of time is granted for\ndocumented good cause. Any final report of a delegated significant incident\nmust be provided to the Justice Center within sixty (60) days after the Justice\n\nCenter accepts the initial report of the incident, unless an extension of time\nis granted for documented good cause. (f) All incidents must be recorded by the\nservice provider and all incident reports and other relevant records made\navailable for inspection by the Office and the Justice Center, when\nappropriate. (g) Upon notice to the\n\nOffice, service providers may delay \"discovery,\" as such term is defined in\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (c) of this section, and immediate reporting for\nno more than twenty-four (24) hours in order to conduct a preliminary review of\nan allegation of abuse or neglect under circumstances in which: (1)\nthe person making the allegation of abuse\nor neglect has a documented history of making false reports of abuse or neglect\nand no other person has come forward as a witness to such allegation; or\n(2)\nthe person making the\nallegation of abuse or neglect has a documented behavioral or psychological\ncondition that would tend to cause such person to make a false report of abuse\nor neglect and no other person has come forward as a witness to such\nallegation. (h) Any\ndelayed discovery of an allegation pursuant to subdivision (g) of this section\nmust be documented, such documentation including: (1)\nthe reasons identified above for such\ndelay in any subsequent report to the Justice Center; or\n(2)\nthe basis for a determination not to\nreport; such documentation shall be available to the Justice Center or the\n\nOffice upon request.
