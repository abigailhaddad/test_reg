  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 679.1 - Introduction and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part\nestablishes standards for participation in the provision of approved clinical\nservices (see glossary and also section\n679.3\n[j]\nof this\n\nPart) in a clinic treatment facility (see glossary) serving persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities (see glossary). The operating certificate issued to\na clinic treatment facility pursuant to this Part shall specify the clinical\nservice areas, by discipline, approved, and the clinic certified setting(s) (by\naddress[es]) under whose auspices said services are approved for\ndelivery. (b) Evidence of\ncompliance with this Part along with Parts 633, 624, and 635 of this Title\nserve as the principal bases for the certification and recertification by the\n\nOffice for People With Developmental Disabilities (OPWDD) (see glossary) of a\nclinic treatment facility serving persons with developmental\ndisabilities. (c) The purpose of a\nclinic treatment facility is to serve principally persons (see subdivision [e]\nof this section) with developmental disabilities and their collaterals (see\nglossary) as stipulated herein, either at a main clinic site certified by OPWDD\nor at a certified satellite site (see glossary) listed by address on the\nfacility's operating certificate or, prior to April 1, 2016, off-site, by: (1)\n\nProviding clinical services of\nprincipally a habilitative clinical nature to ameliorate or limit the disabling\ncondition or other disease, illness, or condition through the provision of\nprofessional assessments and therapies, to persons, who because of their\ndevelopmental disability, require such services to remain in or move to the\nleast restrictive residential and/or day setting; or because such services are\nunavailable or inaccessible in the person's community. (2)\n\nProviding services to a person through\nhis/her collateral(s) for the purposes of enhancing the effectiveness of the\ntreatment; enabling the person to remain in the family or placement setting as\nlong as desired; and/or enhancing the person's quality of life. (3)\n\nProviding convenient access to clinical\nservices, including services available at nontraditional business hours, in\nnontraditional settings, making use of treatments delivered at certified\nsatellite sites and, prior to April 1, 2016, when authorized, off-site. (4)\n\nProviding access to\nclinical services to a person locate d in his/ her residence or other temporary\nlocation via telehealth (see glossary) while the provider is located either at\na main clinic site certified by OPWDD or at a certified satellite site (see\nglossary)\n(5)\n\nProviding clinical\nservices that are not duplicative or substitutive of services provided by\nexisting clinic treatment facilities. However, services described by the same\nclinical procedure code may be provided to address different clinical needs as\ndocumented in the clinic treatment plan. The treatment coordinator must\ndocument in the clinic treatment plan the coordination of similar clinical\nservices provided to ensure there is no duplication of services. (6)\n\nProviding quality services through the\nuse of staff who hold the certification or licensure appropriate to their\ndiscipline and by program and/or staff affiliations with training institutions\nthat can provide a source of continuing education as required to maintain\ncurrent licensure. (7)\n\nOffering\nmanaged health care (see glossary) as part of approved medical services (see\nsection\n679.3\n[j][3]\nof\nthis Part) when serving as the person's principal care provider, by providing\nmedical and/or dental care as well as coordinating tertiary medical care\nservices, where it can be demonstrated that the generic health care system is\neither unavailable, without the specific capacity to provide quality services, inaccessible, and/or unable to serve such persons. (8)\n\nProviding clinical services that are not\nduplicative of early intervention services authorized through an early\nintervention plan (EIP) or school or preschool supportive health services\nauthorized through an individualized education plan; or duplicative of services\navailable through the intermediate care facility for individuals with\nintellectual disabilities program, OPWDD operated or certified residential or\nday programs, or OPWDD funded home and community based services\n(HCBS). (d) This Part is\norganized in a format consisting of principles of compliance and standards of\ncertification. In reviewing the continued eligibility of a facility for an\noperating certificate, OPWDD shall survey for compliance with all \"standards of\ncertification\" herein and any other applicable requirements. OPWDD may make\ninquiries into and evaluate evidence of noncompliance with the applicable\n\"principles of compliance.\" The detailed premises for the principles of\ncompliance and standards of certification format may be found at section\n633.2\nof this Title. (1)\n\nPrinciples of compliance set forth the\nbasic conditions for the operation of a facility. Facilities will not be\nroutinely examined against principles of compliance at surveys for\nrecertification. OPWDD reserves the right to monitor compliance with any\napplicable requirements at any time pursuant to the responsibilities of the\ncommissioner (see glossary) under the Mental Hygiene Law. (2)\n\nStandards of certification are criteria\nspecified by OPWDD as necessary for compliance in order for a facility to\ndemonstrate on a regular and ongoing basis that it can and will continue\nproviding the appropriate environment to assure an adequate level of quality of\ncare, welfare, individual rights, safety, and fiscal accountability. Surveys\nare conducted for the purpose of documenting compliance with standards of\ncertification. Compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, or an\nacceptable plan of correction, is a basis for issuing an operating certificate\nand/or renewing an operating certificate. (e) The OPWDD certification process defined\nin subdivision\n679.1\n(d) of this\nsection is superseded by requirements in Part 619 of this Title, Certification\nof Facilities and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), effective on the\neffective date of these regulations. (f) OPWDD expects ongoing compliance with\nboth principles of compliance and standards of certification included in this\n\nPart. Therefore, such compliance is the responsibility of the agency and is\nnecessary for continued participation as a certified facility or funding as an\napproved program or service. (g) As\nused herein, the terms, people, person(s), and individual(s) shall be\nunderstood to refer to those who have been admitted and are receiving services\nat a clinic treatment facility.
