  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 3.52 - Monthly withholding reports\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach month the Comptroller will send to each withholding\nagency machine-prepared vouchers both for Federal and New York State taxes. These vouchers will show total deductions by payroll of all the agency's\npayrolls processed during the preceding month and also refunds processed to the\ndate of the voucher. The net amount of each voucher, that is, the total of\ndeductions less the total of refunds, represents the amount of taxes actually\npaid the Internal Revenue Service and the New York State Income Tax Bureau for\nthe particular agency for the month involved. The withholding agency will keep\nthese vouchers as its permanent records. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n3.52\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
