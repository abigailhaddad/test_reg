  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 975.12 - Service payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Combined\nservice and usage distribution formula. As authorized by legislation, the\n\nCommissioner may develop a single formula to distribute mass transportation\noperating assistance payments authorized by separate appropriations in order to\nfacilitate program administration and to ensure an orderly distribution of such\nfunds. (b) Calculation of service\npayments for initial or final quarter of service. Service payments for a\nquarter will be based on the statistics of the previous quarter. Estimates of\noperating statistics from a new participant i.e., a public transportation\nsystem, initial quarter may be accepted. Adjustment, based on actual, will be\nmade in the second quarter. In the event that a participant ceases to\nparticipate in the program, operating assistance due for the final quarter that\nservice is provided shall be based upon the actual total number of revenue\npassengers and revenue vehicle miles carried during that quarter. In the event\nthe participant received an overpayment of STOA, the public transportation\nsystem must return the overpayment to the State. The State will take whatever\nsteps are appropriate to recover the overpayments directly from the public\ntransportation system. (c) Discounted payments. Whenever it is determined by the Commissioner that the\namount of money appropriated for service payments or the funds in the\nappropriate account of the Mass Transportation Operating Assistance fund is\nless than the total amount of money for which all public transportation systems\nare eligible, the commissioner shall establish, on a quarterly basis, a maximum\nservice payment limit which is lower than that earned by the formula\ncomponents. This discounting procedure shall be applied so that all unspecified\nsystems within a geographic region as identified by legislation will be\nprovided, to the extent needed, the same \"pro rata\" share of the funds\navailable. Similarly, when authorizing legislation provides separate geographic\nmass transportation operating assistance accounts to fund appropriations, funds\nwithin such appropriations will be evenly distributed on a \"pro rata\" share\nbasis to the \"specified\" as well as the \"unspecified\" systems. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n975.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
