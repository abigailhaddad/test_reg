Tit. 11 § 47.4 - Other nondiscrimination statutes\n\nState Regulations\n\nBefore a life insurer, in connection with an employer-employee benefit plan, issues an individual life insurance policy to an employer, individual employee, or to a trustee of such plan, it is recommended that it remind the employer that the employer is responsible under State and Federal statutes not to discriminate against employees on the basis of gender. The life insurer shall advise the employer that it would be prudent to have the employer's attorney review the proposed life insurance plan in order to determine whether it complies with applicable statutes.
