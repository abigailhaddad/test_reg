  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-2.1 - Provision for payment of interest\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to the issuance of State housing bonds, debt\nservice is limited to the provision for the payment of interest on the\nindebtedness. The local agency's indebtedness outstanding during this period\nwill be temporary (short-term) indebtedness, having maturities not in excess of\none year, whether the funds have been borrowed from the State or from private\ninvestors. The principal amounts of maturing temporary indebtedness will be\nperiodically refunded out of the proceeds of the issue of new short-term\nobligations by the State or by the local agency, depending on the\ncircumstances, and, ultimately, out of the proceeds of an issue of housing\nbonds by the State, as described in Part 1643, Financing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
