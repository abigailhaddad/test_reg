  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.317 - Protection from hazards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\npipelines must be installed where they will be subjected to natural hazards, such as washouts, floods, unstable soil, landslides, or other conditions which\nmay cause serious movement of, or abnormal loads, on the pipeline, reasonable\nprecaution shall be taken to protect the pipeline, such as increasing the wall\nthickness, constructing revetments, preventing erosion, installing anchors, etc. (b) Where pipelines cross\nareas which are normally under water or subject to flooding (i.e., lakes, bays, swamps), sufficient weight or anchorage shall be applied to the line to prevent\nflotation. (c) Because submarine\nriver crossings may be subject to washouts due to the natural hazards of stream\nbed changes, high water velocities, deepening of the channel, or changing of\nthe channel location in the stream bed, design attention shall be given to\nprotect the pipeline at such crossings. The crossing shall be located in stable\nbank and bed locations. The depth of the line, location of the bends in the\nbanks, wall thickness of the pipe, weighting of the line shall be selected\nbased on the characteristics of the river. (d) Where pipelines are exposed, such as at\nspans, trestles, and bridge crossings, the pipelines and mains shall be\nreasonably protected by distance or barricades from accidental damage by\nvehicular traffic or other causes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.317\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
