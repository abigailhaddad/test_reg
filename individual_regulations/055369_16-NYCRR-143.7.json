  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 143.7 - Discontinuance of service to entire multiple dwellings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No electric corporation shall discontinue\nservice to an entire multiple dwelling (as defined in the Multiple Dwelling Law\nor the Multiple Residence Law) where the owner, person, firm or corporation to\nwhom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered, or from whom or which\nthe electric corporation has received payment therefor, has failed to pay such\nutility bills, until it has complied with the following procedure: (1)\n\nThe electric corporation must give 15\ndays' written notice of its intention to so discontinue by personally serving\nsuch notice on the owner of the premises affected or on the person, firm, or\ncorporation to whom or which the last preceding bill was rendered, or from whom\nor which the utility has received payment therefor, and on the superintendent\nor other person in charge of the building, if it can be readily ascertained\nthat there is such superintendent or other person in charge. (2)\n\nThe electric corporation must give 18\ndays' written notice to the owner, person, firm or corporation specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision if such notice is mailed in a postpaid\nwrapper to the address of such persons, firm or corporation. (3)\n\nIn addition to the notice prescribed by\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, 15 days' written notice shall be\nposted in the public areas of such multiple dwelling, and 18 days' notice shall\nbe mailed to the \"Occupant\" of each unit in that multiple dwelling, to the\nlocal health officer and director of the social services district for the\npolitical subdivision in which the multiple dwelling is located; if the\nmultiple dwelling is located in a city or village, to the mayor thereof, or if\nthere be none, to the manager; or, if the multiple dwelling is located in a\ntown, then to the town supervisor; and to the county executive of the county in\nwhich the multiple dwelling is located, or if there be none, then to the\nchairman of such county's legislative body. Notice to mayors, managers, town\nsupervisors, county executives, and chairmen of county legislatures may be\nmailed to the persons specified therein or to their designees. Notice to health\nofficers, directors of social services, mayors managers, supervisors, county\nexecutives and chairmen of county legislatures shall be repeated not more than\nfour working days nor less than two working days prior to such\ndiscontinuance. (4)\n\nWhenever a\nnotice of intention to discontinue electric service has been made pursuant to\nthe provisions of this section and obligations owed the electric corporation\nhave been satisfied, the electric corporation shall notify, in the same manner\nas it gave such notice of intention, the occupant of each unit that the\nintention to discontinue electric service no longer exists. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions\ncontained in subdivision (a) of this section, no electric corporation shall\ndiscontinue services to a multiple dwelling, where the owner, person, firm or\ncorporation responsible for making payment fails to pay utility bills, as long\nas occupants of such multiple dwellings continue to make timely payments for\nsuch service in accordance with procedures filed by the utility and approved by\nthe Public Service Commission. All notices referred to in subdivision (a) of\nthis section shall contain the intended date of discontinuance of service and a\nutility contact, including a telephone number, who will advise occupants of the\namount due for electric service and who will arrange meetings with occupants to\nattempt to work out a mechanism for avoiding discontinuance of service in the\nevent that the owner continues to fail to make requisite payments or\narrangements for such payments. The notice shall also refer to the provisions\ncontained in section 235-a of the New York Real Property Law authorizing\noccupants to set-off, against their rent, payments to utilities in such\ncircumstances. (c) An electric\ncorporation, following the procedure outlined in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, may require occupants in a multiple dwelling to pay no more than the\ncurrent electric charges incurred by the owner, person, firm or corporation to\nwhom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered or from whom or which\nthe utility has received payment therefor. A current charge for purposes of\nthis section means the amount properly billed the owner, etc., for electricity\nused during the most recent billing period covered by the first bill rendered\non or after the date when the disconnect notice is issued. The current charges\nwill not include any arrears for earlier billing periods that may appear on\nsuch a bill. (d) If occupants in a\nmultiple dwelling find they are unable to reach an agreement with the utility\nto avoid discontinuance of service, they may contact the Consumer Service\n\nSection of the commission's Power Division. After such a request is received, a\nrepresentative of the Consumer Service Section of the Power Division will\nattempt to work out such an agreement and will, if necessary, arrange a meeting\nwith occupant representatives, the utility, and the owner, person, firm or\ncorporation responsible for making payment for electric service; provided, however, that such a meeting will be required only if the Consumer Service\n\nSection receives a written petition signed by at least 25 percent of the\noccupants in a multiple dwelling. (e) The Consumer Service Section may stay a\nthreatened disconnection of service to an entire multiple dwelling where it\nconcludes that good faith efforts are being made by the occupants to arrange\nfor the payment of current electric bills. (f) Whenever an owner of a multiple dwelling, or the person, firm or corporation responsible for making payment for electric\nservice, fails to pay two consecutive bills for utility service by the time the\nthird bill has been prepared, the utility must notify the commission within 15\ndays that it has invoked the procedures outlined in subdivisions (a) and (b) of\nthis section. Unless otherwise authorized, the notification should be in the\nform of a semi-monthly report filed with the Consumer Service Section. Such\nreport should be cumulative, specify the total amount due for each overdue\naccount, the period of arrearage, and indicate if a notice of discontinuance\nhas been sent. If these reports demonstrate a need for changes in collection\nprocedures, the Consumer Service Section shall advise the commission. (g) Sections 143.3 through\n143.6\nof this Part shall be\napplicable with respect to the discontinuance of service to entire multiple\ndwellings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
