  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.41 - Executive order no. 41: establishing the executive committee on medical malpractice\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn January of 1975 the State was facing a medical\nmalpractice insurance crisis. Despite increases of 93.5 percent for doctors and\n77 percent for hospitals during the previous year, the principal medical\nmalpractice insurer in the State was requesting additional rate increases of\nclose to 200 percent for both doctors and hospitals. When the proposed rate\nincreases were questioned by the Insurance Department, the insurer gave notice\nthat it would completely withdraw from the medical malpractice market as of\n\nJuly 1, 1975, leaving doctors and hospitals in this State without essential\ninsurance protection. Without such insurance, the delivery of necessary health\ncare services to the people of this State would have been seriously\nthreatened. In order to assure the continued availability of medical\nmalpractice insurance, I proposed legislation creating a Medical Malpractice\n\nInsurance Association, comprised of all insurers writing personal injury\nliability insurance in this State, which would be required to write medical\nmalpractice insurance at rates subject to approval of the Superintendent of\n\nInsurance. In addition, I proposed several measures designed to stabilize the\ncost of malpractice insurance, including appropriate changes in substantive\ntort law, improved court procedures to speed the handling of medical\nmalpractice actions, and a more effective system of professional discipline for\ndoctors. All of these proposals were adopted by the Legislature. In June of 1975, I appointed the Special Advisory Panel on\n\nMedical Practice, headed by Dean William A. McGill of Columbia University, to\nconduct an intensive short-term study of the problem and prepare\nrecommendations in time for the start of the 1976 legislative session. The\n\nMcGill panel submitted its report in January of 1976. Several of the panel's\nrecommendations served as the basis for my 1976 Medical Malpractice Legislative\n\nProgram, which included a statutory limitation on contingency fees for\nattorneys in medical malpractice cases; a requirement that health insurers\nprovide coverage for a second medical opinion as to the need for surgery; itemized verdicts and elimination of the ad damnum clause in medical\nmalpractice actions; and legislation to assist hospitals in forming their own\nmutual insurance company to write medical malpractice insurance. Again, all of\nthese proposals were enacted into law. In addition to the creation of the Medical Malpractice\n\nInsurance Association by statute, doctors in this State, with the assistance of\nthe Insurance Department, have voluntarily formed the Medical Liability Mutual\n\nInsurance Company to write malpractice insurance and, with the aid of newly\nenacted legislation, hospitals are now in the process of forming their own\nmutual insurance company. In 1975 and 1976, annual increases in malpractice\nrates for doctors have been held to 15 to 20 percent above existing rates, as\ncompared to the 200 percent increase which was originally requested in January\nof 1975. The cooperative effort by the Executive and Legislative\n\nBranches over the last 20 months has achieved significant results in assuring\nthe continued availability of medical malpractice insurance and in containing\nthe cost of such insurance. Despite this progress, however, the high cost of\nmalpractice insurance continues to be a serious problem and a significant\nfactor in the overall cost of health care in this State. Consequently, there is\na need for an ongoing study to learn more about basic underlying causes of the\nmedical malpractice problem and to find effective long-term solutions. Therefore, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New\n\nYork, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of\nthe State of New York, do hereby establish an executive committee, to be known\nas the Executive Committee on Medical Malpractice. I. Powers and Responsibilities. The Executive Committee on Medical Malpractice\nshall: 1. Gather and analyze\ninformation and data relating to the medical malpractice insurance\nproblem. 2. Analyze the basic\nunderlying causes of the high cost of medical malpractice insurance. 3. Monitor and evaluate medical malpractice\nlegislation recently enacted in this State, and review proposals for further\nlegislative changes. 4. Review and\nevaluate medical malpractice legislation enacted or proposed in other\nstates. 5. Review and evaluate\nexisting procedures aimed at containing the cost of medical malpractice\ninsurance, such as injury prevention programs and the voluntary arbitration\nproject of the State Medical Society. 6. Make available to appropriate legislative\ncommittees and executive agencies all information gathered and reports made by\nthe committee and its staff. 7. Recommend to the Governor any legislative or administrative action in the area\nof medical malpractice which the committee deems appropriate. II. Membership: The members of the Executive Committee on Medical\n\nMalpractice shall be appointed by the Governor and shall include the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance, who shall serve as Chairman, the Commissioner of\n\nHealth, the Chairman of the State's Health Planning Commission, and\nrepresentatives of the Education Department, the medical and legal professions, the insurance industry and the general public. The members of the Committee\nshall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any\nnecessary expenses incurred in connection with the performance of their\nduties. III. Personnel: The Chairman may employ such staff and assistants as he may\ndeem necessary at a compensation to be fixed by him within the amount of the\nappropriation therefor and subject to the approval of the Division of the\n\nBudget.
