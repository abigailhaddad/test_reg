  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 601.12 - General provisions of a water withdrawal permit\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following provisions apply to water withdrawal permits\nincluding public water supply permits issued prior to April 1, 2013: (a) The water withdrawal system shall not\nsupply or be committed to supply water beyond the amounts approved by the\ndepartment. (b) The permittee\nshall, at all times, properly operate and maintain all facilities which are\ninstalled or used by the permittee to achieve compliance with the conditions of\nthe permit. (c) The permittee shall\nensure that the intake structure for any surface water withdrawal is designed\nand maintained to sustain any passby flow requirement established in the\npermit. (d) The water withdrawal\npermit, or a true copy, shall be kept readily available for reference at the\nfacility. (e) Upon issuance of a\nwater withdrawal permit, a determination has been made on the basis of a\nsubmitted application, plans, or other available information, that compliance\nwith the specified permit provisions will protect classified water use and\nassure compliance with applicable water quality standards. Satisfaction of\npermit provisions notwithstanding, if operation pursuant to the permit causes\nor contributes to a condition in contravention of State water quality standards\nor guidance values, or if the department determines that a modification of the\npermit is necessary to prevent impairment of the best use of the waters or to\nassure maintenance of water quality standards, the department may require such\na modification and the commissioner may require abatement action to be taken by\nthe permittee and may also prohibit such operation until the permit has been\nmodified pursuant to section\n601.15\nof this Part. (f) The provisions of a water withdrawal\npermit are severable, and if any provision of the permit, or the application of\nany provision of the permit to any circumstance, is held invalid, the\napplication of such provision to other circumstances, and the remainder of the\npermit, shall not be affected thereby. (g) For a withdrawal that originates within\nthe jurisdiction of a compact basin commission, the withdrawal must also comply\nwith any applicable water withdrawal standards or requirements of that compact\nbasin commission. (h) The permittee\nmust comply with all terms and conditions of the permit. Any permit\nnoncompliance constitutes a violation of the ECL and this Part and is grounds\nfor: enforcement action; permit suspension, revocation or modification; and\ndenial of a permit renewal application. (i) Where the permittee becomes aware that it\nfailed to submit any relevant facts in a permit application, or submitted\nincorrect information in a permit application or in any report to the\ndepartment, the permittee shall promptly submit such facts or corrected\ninformation to the department. (j) It shall not be a defense, for a permittee in an enforcement action, that it\nwould have been necessary to halt or reduce the permitted activity in order to\nmaintain compliance with the conditions of the permit. (k) The filing of a request by the permittee\nfor a permit modification, termination, transfer, or a notification of planned\nchanges or anticipated noncompliance, does not stay any permit\ncondition. (l) The permittee shall\nfurnish to the department, within a reasonable time as set forth in the\ndepartment request, any information that the department may request to\ndetermine whether cause exists for modifying, suspending, or revoking a water\nwithdrawal permit, or to determine compliance with the permit. The permittee\nshall also furnish to the department, upon request, copies of records required\nto be kept by the permittee. (m) Nothing in a water withdrawal permit relieves the permittee from a requirement\nto obtain any other permits required by law. (n) The issuance of a water withdrawal permit\nby the department and the receipt thereof by the permittee does not supersede, revoke or rescind an order on consent or modification thereof or any of the\nterms, conditions or requirements contained in such order or modification\nthereof unless specifically intended by said order or a modified\norder. (o) The issuance of a water\nwithdrawal permit does not convey any property rights in either real or\npersonal property, or any exclusive privileges, nor does it authorize any\ninjury to private property or any invasion of personal rights, nor any\ninfringement of Federal, State or local laws or regulations; nor does it\nobviate the necessity of obtaining the assent of any other jurisdiction as\nrequired by law for the water withdrawal authorized.
