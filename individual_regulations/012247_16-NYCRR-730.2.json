The\nreport shall not include equipment designed to use the PCB-free mineral oil\ndielectric fluids unless the unit has been serviced with fluid containing 550\nppm or greater of PCBs, or there is any other reason to believe that the unit\ncontains, or was ever mixed with fluid with a concentration level of 500 ppm or\ngreater, or unless testing has specifically shown otherwise. (b) The inventory reports shall be organized\nalphabetically by county for those counties in which the PCB equipment is in\nservice or was last in service. (c) For each county, the reports shall be organized by political jurisdiction. The\ninformation for each political jurisdiction shall be divided into sections, one\nsection each for transformers, capacitors, gas compressors and other equipment\nas applicable. Each section shall then be organized into overhead, underground, substation, power plant and compressor station categories. (d) In the in-service equipment inventory, the equipment in each category shall be organized and identified by location. At each location, the size, quantity, and service date shall be\nreported. (e) A separate summary\nsheet of in-service equipment shall indicate by section, one section each for\ntransformers, capacitors, gas compressors, and other equipment, the total\nnumber of PCB items and the total amount of PCBs in each county and political\njurisdiction.

The\nstorage/processing facilities and the shipping dates or routes need not be\nreported for activities that took place prior to the date the equipment was\ndetermined to contain 500 ppm or greater of PCBs. (g) In the reporting of discoveries by the\ngas corporations of materials with PCB concentrations of 50 ppm or more found\nat custody points or gate stations, reporting forms supplied by the gas unit\nshall be used to provide information on: company name and reporting dates, location and type of collection point, approximate date of delivery, date of\nremoval, volume of material removed, PCB concentration (ppm), source of PCB\nmaterial (supplier if single source can be identified), and method of removal. The reports shall be signed by a responsible company official. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
