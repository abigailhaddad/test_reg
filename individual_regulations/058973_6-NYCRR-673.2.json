(b) Auxiliary spillway means a secondary spillway designed to operate only during\nlarge floods to pass flows, and is in addition to a service spillway.

A lagoon or storage facility, with one or more\nimpoundment structures, that stores waste, or that treats, disposes or contains\nmaterials, other than waters, is not a dam.

(i) Department means the New York State\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation.

(n) Height of a dam means the measurement of\nthe vertical dimension from the downstream toe of a dam at its lowest point to\nthe top of the dam. (o) Inspection\nand maintenance plan means a written plan of procedures to conduct routine\nactivities involved in the upkeep of a dam, which is prepared in accordance\nwith section\n673.6\nof this Part.

(q) Local public corporation means any\nmunicipal corporation or district corporation, as is set forth in ECL article\n1, section 0303, subdivision 15 and further defined in the General Construction\n\nLaw, section 66, subdivisions 2 and 3. (r) Maximum impoundment capacity means the\nmeasurement of volume of waters that are impounded when the water level of the\nimpoundment is at the top of a dam.
