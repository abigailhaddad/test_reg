  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 41.2 - Limitations\n\nState Regulations\nA high cost home loan shall be subject to the following\nlimitations. (a) No call provision. No\nhigh cost home loan may contain a call provision that permits the lender, in\nits sole discretion, to accelerate the indebtedness. This prohibition does not\napply when repayment of the loan has been accelerated in good faith, due either\nto a bona fide default or other failure of the borrower to abide by the\nmaterial terms of the loan, or pursuant to a due-on-sale provision, or pursuant\nto some other provision of the loan agreement unrelated to the payment schedule\nsuch as bankruptcy or receivership. (b) No balloon payment. No high cost home\nloan may contain a scheduled final payment that is more than twice as large as\nthe average of earlier scheduled monthly payments unless such balloon payment\nbecomes due and payable at least 15 years after the loan's origination. This\nprohibition does not apply when the payment schedule is adjusted to account for\nthe seasonal or irregular income of the borrower or if the purpose of the loan\nis a bridge loan connected with the acquisition or construction of a dwelling\nintended to become the borrower's principal dwelling. This subdivision shall\nnot apply to open-end high cost home loans. (c) No negative amortization. Notwithstanding\nany statute or regulation to the contrary, no high cost home loan may contain a\npayment schedule with regular periodic payments that cause the principal\nbalance to increase. This shall not prohibit negative amortization as a\nconsequence of a temporary forbearance sought by the borrower. This subdivision\nshall not apply to open-end high cost home loans. (d) No increased interest rate. No high cost\nhome loan may contain a provision that increases the interest rate after\ndefault. This provision does not apply to periodic interest rate changes in a\nvariable rate loan otherwise consistent with the provisions of the loan\nagreement, provided the change in the interest rate is not occasioned by the\nevent of default or the acceleration of the indebtedness. (e) No oppressive mandatory arbitration\nclause. No high cost home loan may be subject to a mandatory arbitration clause\nthat is oppressive, unfair, unconscionable, or substantially in derogation of\nthe rights of consumers. Arbitration clauses that comply with the standards set\nforth in the Statement of Principles of the National Consumer Dispute Advisory\n\nCommittee, as such statement is on file at the New York State Banking\n\nDepartment, shall be presumed not to violate this subdivision. The Statement of\n\nPrinciples may be viewed at the New York State Department of Banking located at\nthe New York City office of the New York State Banking Department located at\nthe address stated in Supervisory Policy G1 of this Title or through internet\naccess at http:// www.banking.state.ny.us/41.htm. (f) No advance payments. No high cost home\nloan may include terms under which more than two periodic payments required\nunder the loan are consolidated and paid in advance from the loan proceeds\nprovided to the borrower.
