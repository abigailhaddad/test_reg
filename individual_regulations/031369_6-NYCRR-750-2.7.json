  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.7 - Incident reporting and notification requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Anticipated noncompliance. The permittee shall give at least 45 days advance\nnotice to the regional water engineer of any change in the permitted facility\nor activity that the permittee knows or has reason to know would occur as part\nof a construction project, which is part of the permittee's routine maintenance\nprogram, or which the permittee knows or has reason to know about 60 or more\ndays before it occurs, and that is very likely or certain to result in a bypass\nor other noncompliance with permit requirements. (1)\n\nSuch notice shall contain: (i) a description of the treatment units to\nbe effected; (ii)\nthe anticipated\ncharacter and volume of wastewater and/or storm water to be\ndischarged; (iii)\nthe need for the\nchanges; (iv)\nthe anticipated\nduration of the noncompliance; (v) the receiving stream for the noncomplying wastewater and/or storm\nwater; (vi)\nthe anticipated\nbenefits of the change; (vii)\nthe\nalternatives considered; and\n(viii)\nsuch additional information requested by the regional water engineer to assess\nthe effects of and need for such a change. (2)\n\nIn the time between notification of a\nplanned change and the date scheduled for the change the department may choose\nto do one or more of the following: (i) require additional information that can reasonably be used to decide the\nnecessity of such noncompliance; (ii)\nrequire that the permittee delay the\nplanned change up to 45 additional days until the department may adequately\nassess the necessity for the planned change; (iii)\nrequire the permittee to modify the\nplanned change; (iv)\nprohibit the\nplanned change; or\n(v) apply no\nconditions to the planned change. (b) Reporting and notification\nrequirements for bypasses, upsets and discharges of untreated and partially\ntreated sewage. (1)\n\nTwo hour reporting\nrequirements for SPDES permittees that are non-POTWs. For discharges from a\nnon-POTW permittee's wastewater treatment plant or sewer system that would\naffect bathing areas during the bathing season, shellfishing or public drinking\nwater intakes, the non-POTW permittee shall, within two hours of discovery of\nthe discharge, report orally to the regional water engineer and the local\nhealth department of any discharge of untreated or partially treated sewage, except a discharge in accordance with a department approved plan for managing\nwastewater (provided that such plan is in compliance with applicable law and\nregulation). Such report shall include: (i) the date and time of discovery of the discharge and a brief description of the\nreason for the discharge, bypass, upset, or other incident; (ii)\nthe location of the discharge, bypass, upset or other incident including the receiving water effected by the\ndischarge, bypass, upset, or other incident; (iii)\nthe estimated volume and treated state\n(untreated or partially treated) of the discharge at the time of the oral\nreport; (iv)\na brief description of\nthe measures taken and planned to contain the discharge, bypass, upset, or\nother incident; and\n(v) the\nexpected duration of the discharge, bypass, upset, or other incident and the\ntotal expected volume of the discharge. (2)\n\nRequirements for POTWs and POSSs. Owners\nand operators of POTWs and POSSs must comply with the reporting and\nnotification requirements described in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv)\nof this paragraph through use of the department approved form of electronic\nmedia. POTWs and POSSs are in compliance with the reporting and notification\nrequirements in subparagraphs (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph if\nthey register to use the department approved form of electronic media and\nsubmit timely and sufficient reports and notifications when required. A CSO is\nconsidered to be untreated sewage for purposes of the reporting and\nnotification requirements specified in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iii) of\nthis paragraph. The department may temporarily waive or suspend these\nrequirements in instances of emergencies, extreme weather or when other\nconditions present a greater risk to human health. (i) Two hour reporting requirements for POTWs\nand POSSs. Immediately, but in no case later than two hours after discovery of\nthe discharge, owners and operators of POTWs and POSSs must report all\ndischarges of untreated or partially treated sewage, including combined sewer\noverflows, to the department and the local health department, or if there is\nnone, the New York State Department of Health. This reporting requirement\napplies to all untreated and partially treated sewage discharges to waters of\nthe State except partially treated sewage discharged directly from a POTW that\nis in compliance with a department approved plan or permit. These initial\ndischarge reports shall be submitted using appropriate electronic media as\ndetermined by the department and shall, at a minimum, include to the extent\nknowable with existing systems and models the following: (a) the date and time of discovery of the\ndischarge and a brief description of the reason for the discharge; (b) the location of the discharge including\nthe receiving water effected by the discharge; (c) the estimated volume and treated state\n(untreated or partially treated) of the discharge at the time of the\nreport; (d) a brief description of\nthe measures taken and planned to contain the discharge except for wet weather\ncombined sewer overflow discharges; and\n(e) the expected duration of the discharge\nand the total expected volume of the discharge. (ii)\n\nFour hour notification requirements for\nPOTWs and POSSs. (a) Notification to\nmunicipalities. As soon as possible, but no later than four hours from\ndiscovery of the discharge, owners and operators of POTWs and POSSs must notify\nthe chief elected official, or authorized designee, of the municipality in\nwhich the discharge occurred and the chief elected official, or authorized\ndesignee, of any adjoining municipality that may be affected of untreated or\npartially treated sewage discharges, including combined sewer overflows, to\nwaters of the State except underground waters, through appropriate electronic\nmedia as determined by the department. This notification is not required for\npartially treated sewage discharged directly from a POTW that is in compliance\nwith a department approved plan or permit. For purposes of this clause, municipality\nmeans a city, town or village and\nadjoining municipality\nmeans any municipality that is adjacent\nto the municipality in which the discharge occurred. (b) Notification to the general public. As\nsoon as possible, but no later than four hours from discovery of the discharge, owners and operators of POTWs and POSSs must notify the general public of\nuntreated or partially treated sewage discharges, including combined sewer\noverflows, to waters of the State except underground waters, through\nappropriate electronic media as determined by the department. This notification\nis not required for partially treated sewage discharged directly from a POTW\nthat is in compliance with a department approved plan or permit. (iii)\n\nNotification requirements\nfor certain combined sewer overflows. For combined sewer overflows for which\nreal-time telemetered discharge monitoring and detection does not exist, owners\nand operators of POTWs and POSSs must expeditiously issue advisories to the\ngeneral public through appropriate electronic media as determined by the\ndepartment when, based on actual rainfall data or predictive models, enough\nrain has fallen that combined sewer overflows may discharge. Advisories may be\ndone on a waterbody basis rather than by individual combined sewer overflow\npoints. (iv)\n\nDaily and termination\nreports. A daily report shall be made by owners and operators of POTWs and\nPOSSs for each day that the discharge continues after the date the initial\ndischarge report is made, except that on the day the discharge terminates, a\nreport documenting termination of the previously reported discharge may be made\nin lieu of the daily report. Daily and termination reports must be made within\n24 hours of the previous report using an appropriate form of electronic media\nas determined by the department. Daily and termination reports must include, at\na minimum, the criteria required for the initial discharge report, except that\nsubsequent to the initial discharge report the department may modify or waive\nreporting requirements for daily and termination reports on a case by case\nbasis if acceptable alternate reporting methods are available. POTWs and POSSs\nare not required to file daily and termination reports for wet weather CSO\nevents. (c) Twenty-four hour oral reporting of bypass, upset or other\nincident. (1)\n\nNon-POTW SPDES permittees\nshall report, including the same information required to be reported under\nsubdivision (b) of this section, orally to the regional water engineer within\n24 hours from the time the non-POTW permittee becomes aware of a discharge of\nuntreated or partially treated sewage that would otherwise be treated, except a\ndischarge in accordance with a department approved plan for managing wastewater\nand/or storm water (provided that such plan is in compliance with applicable\nlaw and regulation). (2)\n\nAll SPDES\npermittees shall report, including the same information required to be reported\nunder subdivision (b) of this section, orally to the regional water engineer\nwithin 24 hours from the time the permittee becomes aware of any of the\nfollowing incidents: (i) a discharge of\nuntreated wastewater and/or storm water that would otherwise be treated, except\na discharge in accordance with a department approved plan for managing\nwastewater (provided that such plan is in compliance with applicable law and\nregulation). Twenty-four hour reporting is not required if the discharge is\nsewage and the non-POTW SPDES permittee or POTW has fully complied with\napplicable two hour reporting requirements described in this section; (ii)\na spill that may result in a discharge\nthat may: (a) violate permit limitations of\npollutants limited in the SPDES permit; (b) exceed an action level or more than one\naction level in the SPDES permit; (c) cause discharges of pollutants not\nexplicitly listed in the SPDES permit, in amounts in excess of normal effluent\nvariability of the level of discharge that may reasonably be expected for that\npollutant from information provided in the SPDES permit application record; or\n(d) which would result in\ndilution in lieu of treatment of a discharge authorized by a SPDES\npermit; (iii)\na spill to\nwaters of the State of greater than the reportable quantity for releases to\nwater as set forth in Part 597 of this Title; or\n(iv)\na bypass, upset or other incident that a\nreasonable practitioner in water pollution control would consider to be similar\nin severity and consequences to the incidents set forth in this\nsubdivision. (d) Five-day written incident report\nrequirements for SPDES permittees and POSSs. SPDES permittees and owners and operators of POSSs must\nprovide a written report to the department of a discharge, bypass, upset or\nother incident reported under subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section within\nfive days of discovery by the permittee or the owner or operator of the POSS. The written report shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the department\nand, at a minimum, shall contain a description of the discharge, bypass, upset, or other incident and its cause; the period of the discharge, bypass, upset, or\nother incident, including exact dates and times, and if the discharge, bypass, upset, or other incident has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is\nexpected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and\nprevent the discharge, bypass, upset, or other incident and its reoccurrence. The department may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if reports\nhave been received within the time periods required under subdivisions (b) and\n(c) of this section. Five day written incident reports are not required for wet\nweather combined sewer overflows that are in compliance with a department\napproved plan or permit. (e) Additional reporting. The permittee shall report all instances of\nnoncompliance with permit conditions not otherwise required to be reported\nunder these regulations or the SPDES permit, with each submitted copy of its\ndischarge monitoring reports until such noncompliance ceases. Such\nnoncompliance reports shall contain the same information required to be\nsubmitted under subdivision (d) of this section. (f) Duty to mitigate. The permittee shall take all reasonable steps to\nminimize or prevent any discharge in violation of the permit, which has a\nreasonable likelihood of adversely affecting human health or the\nenvironment. (g) Duty to assess. Where a bypass, upset, or other incident occurs as\ndefined in subdivision (b) or (c) of this section that can reasonably be\nexpected to create detectable discharges of a substance where that substance\nwas not detectable prior to the bypass, upset, or other incident or the bypass, upset, or other incident can reasonably be expected to increase the discharge\nof a substance or substances by 20 percent or more, the permittee shall collect\nat least one representative sample for each day of discharge effected by the\nbypass, upset or other incident in a manner that can be used to assess\ncompliance with the permit. Each sample should be monitored for the parameters\nwhich the permittee knows or has reason to believe will be detectable or\nincreased by 20 percent or more in the discharge due to the bypass, upset, or\nother incident.
