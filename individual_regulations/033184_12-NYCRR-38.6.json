  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 38.6 - Applications for specific license\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An application for a specific license shall be made to the commissioner on a\nform prescribed by him. Such application shall set forth such pertinent\ninformation as the commissioner may require. Supplementary statements shall be\nfiled upon the commissioner's request. (b) Each application or supplementary\nstatement shall be signed by either the applicant personally or a parson duly\nauthorized by the applicant to sign for and on the applicant's\nbehalf. (c) As provided by section\n38.7\nof this Part, certain\napplications for specific licenses filed under this Part (rule) must contain a\nproposed decommissioning funding plan or a certification that financial\nassurance for decommissioning has been provided. (d) Emergency plans for responding to a\nrelease of radioactive material. (1)\n\nEach\napplication to possess radioactive materials in unsealed form, on foils or\nplated sources, or sealed in glass in excess of the quantities in Table 7 of\nsection\n38.41\nof this Part (rule)\n\"Quantities of Radioactive Materials Requiring Consideration of the Need for an\n\nEmergency Plan for Responding to a Release,\" must contain either: (i) an evaluation showing that the maximum\ndose to a person offsite due to a release of radioactive materials would not\nexceed 1 rem effective dose equivalent or 5 rems to the thyroid; or\n(ii)\nan emergency plan for responding to a\nrelease of radioactive material. (2)\n\nOne or more of the following factors may\nbe used to support an evaluation submitted under subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision: (i) the radioactive material is\nphysically separated so that only a portion could be involved in an\naccident; (ii)\nall or part of the\nradioactive material is not subject to release during an accident because of\nthe way it is stored or packaged; (iii)\nthe release fraction in the respirable\nsize range would be lower than the release fraction shown in Table 7 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule) due to\nthe chemical or physical form of the material; (iv)\nthe solubility of the radioactive\nmaterial would reduce the dose received; (v) facility design or engineered safety\nfeatures in the facility would cause the release fraction to be lower than\nshown in Table 7 of section\n38.41\nof this Part\n(rule); (vi)\noperating restrictions\nor procedures would prevent a release fraction as large as that shown in Table\n7 of section\n38.41\nof this Part (rule); or\n(vii)\nother factors appropriate\nfor the specific facility. (3)\n\nAn emergency plan for responding to a\nrelease of radioactive material submitted under subparagraph (1)(ii) of this\nsubdivision must include the following information: (i) Facility description. A brief description\nof the licensee' s facility and area near the site. (ii)\n\nTypes of accidents. An identification of\neach type of radioactive materials accident for which protective actions may be\nneeded. (iii)\n\nClassification of\naccidents. A classification system for classifying accidents as alerts or site\narea emergencies. (iv)\n\nDetection of\naccidents. Identification of the means of detecting each type of accident in a\ntimely manner. (v) Mitigation of\nconsequences. A brief description of the means and equipment for mitigating the\nconsequences of each type of accident, including those provided to protect\nworkers onsite, and a description of the program for maintaining the\nequipment. (vi)\n\nAssessment of\nreleases. A brief description of the methods and equipment to assess releases\nof radioactive materials. (vii)\n\nResponsibilities. A brief description of the responsibilities of licensee\npersonnel should an accident occur, including identification of personnel\nresponsible for promptly notifying offsite response organizations and the\ncommissioner; also responsibilities for developing, maintaining, and updating\nthe plan. (viii)\n\nNotification and\ncoordination. A commitment, and a brief description of the means, to promptly\nnotify offsite response organizations and request offsite assistance, including\nmedical assistance for the treatment of contaminated injured onsite workers\nwhen appropriate. A control point must be established and the notification and\ncoordination must be planned so that unavailability of some personnel, parts of\nthe facility, and some equipment will not prevent the notification and\ncoordination. The licensee shall also commit to notify the commissioner\nimmediatelyafter notification of the appropriate offsite response organizations\nand not later than one hour after the licensee declares an emergency. (ix)\n\nInformation to be communicated. A brief\ndescription of the types of information on facility status, radioactive\nreleases, and recommended protective actions, if necessary, to be given to\noffsite response organizations and to the commissioner. (x) Training. A brief description of the\nfrequency, performance objectives and plans for the training that the licensee\nwill provide to workers on how to respond to an emergency; including any\nspecial instructions and orientation tours the licensee would offer to fire, police, medical and other emergency personnel. The training shall familiarize\npersonnel with site-specific emergency procedures. Also, the training shall\nthoroughly prepare site personnel for their responsibilities in the event of\naccident scenarios postulated as most probable for the specific site, including\nthe use of team training for such scenarios. (xi)\n\nSafe shutdown. A brief description of\nthe means of restoring the facility to a safe condition after an\naccident. (xii)\n\nExercises. Provisions for conducting quarterly communications checks with offsite response\norganizations and biennial onsite exercises to test response to simulated\nemergencies. Quarterly communications checks with offsite response\norganizations must include the check and update of all necessary telephone\nnumbers. The licensee shall invite offsite response organizations to\nparticipate in the biennial exercises. Participation of offsite response\norganizations in biennial exercises, although recommended, is not required. Exercises must use accident scenarios postulated as most probable for the\nspecific site and the scenarios shall not be known to most exercise\nparticipants. The licensee shall critique each exercise using individuals not\nhaving direct implementation responsibility for the plan. Critiques of\nexercises must evaluate the appropriateness of the plan, emergency procedures, facilities, equipment, training of personnel, and overall effectiveness of the\nresponse. Deficiencies found by the critiques must be corrected. (xiii)\n\nHazardous chemicals. A certification\nthat the applicant has met its responsibilities under the Emergency Planning\nand Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, Title III, Pub. L. 99-499, if\napplicable to the applicant's activities at the proposed place of use of the\nradioactive material. (4)\n\nThe licensee shall allow the offsite\nresponse organizations expected to respond in case of an accident 60 days to\ncomment on the licensee's emergency plan before submitting it to the\ncommissioner. The licensee shall provide any comments received within 60 days\nto the commissioner with the emergency plan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
