  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.21 - Executive order no. 21: establishing a state program to provide job opportunities to the mentally retarded\n\nState Regulations\n\nNew York State has long recognized that the mentally\nretarded are members of society entitled to all of society's benefits and\nprivileges, as well as to the specialized services they need in order to become\nall they are capable of being. Today New York State is looking to a brighter future for\nthe retarded as increased efforts are being made at both the State and\ncommunity levels to see that each retarded individual is able to develop to the\nfullest extent of his capacity. New York State has been a leader in rehabilitating the\nretarded into employment and placing them in jobs. However, much more remains\nto be done. Many additional employment opportunities must be made available to\nthe retarded, for they are a hidden resource, frequently overlooked, of stable\nand reliable manpower. Through employment the retarded gain greater self-respect\nand community well-being and acquire economic independence. Like all who are\nhandicapped, the retarded ask nothing more than an honest judgment of their\nabilities--not rejection for their disabilities. Experience has demonstrated\nthat the mentally retarded are succeeding in being employed in those\noccupations in which employers have the most difficulty retaining\nworkers. Short of finding means to prevent all mental retardation, nothing is more important than a major assault on the prejudices, misconceptions and ignorance that so often bar the mentally retarded from\nutilizing productively the abilities they do have. Last June I requested that a careful study be conducted and\nprocedures be developed to give employment opportunities for the mentally\nretarded in the State Civil Service system. Such employment, on the basis of\nthe abilities of the retarded to perform skillfully the duties required, will\nlead the way and set an example for other public and private employers\nthroughout the State. The Governor's Council on Rehabilitation, the\n\nInterdepartmental Health and Hospital Council, and the Governor's Committee on\n\nEmploy the Handicapped, in cooperation with the Civil Service Department, have\ncompleted this study and developed procedures to provide the maximum assurance\nof successful employment opportunities for qualified retarded persons in State\nservice. By virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of the\n\nState of New York, and in order to promote greater employment opportunities for\nthe mentally retarded, I, Nelson A. Rockefeller, do hereby establish the\nfollowing procedures to be followed by all State departments and agencies for\nemploying qualified mentally retarded persons in the State Civil Service system\nand hereby establish an annual Governor's Award to be given to the State\ndepartment or agency which shows outstanding effort and accomplishment in\nemploying mentally retarded: 1. The\n\nDivision of Vocational Rehabilitation of the State Education Department shall\nextend its comprehensive service program for all handicapped persons and serve\nas the certifying agency for the employment of the retarded in many competitive\nand labor category Civil Service positions and as such will administer the\nmajor aspects of the program. The Division will: a. maintain information about retarded\npersons adequately trained and ready for employment; b. evaluate the mentally retarded referred to\nthem for employment and certify those capable of performing the duties of\nspecific job vacancies; c. evaluate\nthe specifications and working conditions upon being notified by a department\nor agency of an appropriate job vacancy and refer one or more mentally retarded\nworkers to the department or agency certifying that the individual has--\nthe ability to perform the duties of the position, the necessary physical qualifications, the capacity to get to and from the job and maintain\nregular attendance, the skill to develop appropriate relationships with his\nco-workers and supervisor, and, provide other pertinent personnel data about the\nindividual's health, special aptitudes, interests, etc.; d. make vocational rehabilitation counselors\navailable to an employing agency for consultation on placement and follow-up or\non any other aspect related to the adjustment of the retarded person to the job\nas may be requested; e. provide\nrehabilitation services as may be needed for those retarded not ready for\nemployment but capable of profiting from such; and f. evaluate the\neffectiveness of the program in conjunction with the Interdepartmental Health\nand Hospital Council Committee on Mental Retardation. 2. The Interdepartmental Health and Hospital\n\nCouncil Committee on Mental Retardation shall provide all State departments and\nagencies with a list of the positions which have been evaluated as being\npotentially appropriate for the employment of the mentally retarded. 3. Each department and agency will, upon\nreceipt of the list of positions, determine the number of vacancies and\nestimate how frequently the vacancies occur and submit this information to the\n\nInterdepartmental Health and Hospital Council Committee on Mental\n\nRetardation. 4. Each State\ndepartment and agency shall notify the nearest district office of the Division\nof Vocational Rehabilitation when vacancies occur in the jobs listed as\npotentially appropriate for the retarded. 5. Each State department and agency shall\nnotify the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation counselor of any job-related\nproblems that may result from placement of the retarded. 6. The Committee on Retardation will forward\nto the Division of Vocational Rehabilitation offices the completed list of\nvacant positions initally reported by the departments and agencies and also\nforward to the Education Department's Bureau of Mentally Retarded Children, the\n\nDepartment of Mental Hygiene's Division of Mental Retardation and through the\n\nDivision to appropriate voluntary agency vocational training workshops a list\nof those jobs reported as frequently vacant so that curriculum may be developed\nin special classes, State schools and workshops to train the retarded for the\nskills needed for employment. 7. Each State department and agency will participate in training institutes\nplanned periodically to assure the maximum employment opportunities for the\nmentally retarded in the State Civil Service system.
