(2)\n\nMedical/biological post-neonatal and early childhood risk criteria, including: (i) parental or caregiver concern about developmental status; (ii)\nserious illness or traumatic injury with implications for central nervous system development and requiring hospitalization in a pediatric intensive care unit for 10 or more days; (iii)\nelevated venous blood lead levels (at or above 5 mcg/dl); (iv)\ngrowth deficiency/nutritional problems (\ne.g., significant organic or inorganic failure-to-thrive, significant iron-deficiency anemia); (v) chronicity of serous otitis media (continuous for a minimum of three months); (vi)\nHIV infection; (vii)\nindicated case of child abuse or maltreatment.
