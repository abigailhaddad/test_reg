(1)\n\nMaintaining, servicing\nand\nrepairing\nare terms which are used to cover all activities\nthat relate to keeping real property in a condition of fitness, efficiency, readiness or safety or restoring it to such condition. Among the services\nincluded are services on a building itself such as painting; services to the\ngrounds, such as lawn services, tree removal and spraying; trash and garbage\nremoval and sewerage service and snow removal. (2)\n\nReal property, property and land are\ndefined as in subdivision 12 of section\n102\nof the Real Property Tax Law.

(ii)\n(a) Floor covering is a capital improvement\nonly when it is installed as the initial finished floor covering in new\nconstruction, in a new addition to existing construction or in a total\nreconstruction of existing construction. (b) The term floor covering includes carpet, carpet tile, carpet padding, linoleum and vinyl roll floor covering, linoleum\ntile, vinyl tile and other similar floor coverings. For a detailed discussion\nand description, see section\n541.14\nof this Title. (iii)\nA\nmobile home is not an addition or capital improvement to real property, property or land, regardless of how it is installed. For a detailed discussion\nand description, see Part 544 of this Title. (b) Imposition. (1)\n\nThe tax is imposed on receipts from every\nsale of the services of maintaining, servicing or repairing real property, whether inside or outside of a building. Example 1: The replacement of broken windows is a repair to real\nproperty, which is taxable. Example 2: Company A enters into an agreement to provide periodic\nmaintenance services on elevators and escalators belonging to its customers. The contract provides for inspection, lubrication and the performance of\nnecessary repairs. These services are taxable as maintaining, servicing of real\nproperty which is subject to the sales tax. (2)\n\nAll services of trash or garbage removal\nare taxable, whether from inside or outside of a building or vacant land. Example 3: A carting firm picks up trash and garbage at its customers'\npremises and dumps the materials at sites away from its customers' premises. Receipts from the sale of this service are taxable. Example 4: A contractor who is erecting a building engages a carter to\nhaul away the debris resulting from the construction activities. The amounts\npaid to the carter are not taxable. Example 5: A contractor enters into an agreement with a farmer to\ndemolish an old farm structure and haul away the resulting debris. The charge\nfor demolition and debris removal is not subject to the tax. (3)\n\nWhen the service of maintaining, servicing or repairing real property is performed in conjunction with the\ntransfer of title to tangible personal property, the price of the tangible\npersonal property is also subject to tax. Example 6: The periodic repainting of a building is not a capital\nimprovement. The customer pays tax on the service. The painter pays tax on the\nmaterials he used for painting, subject to a right of refund or credit. Example 7: A landscaping company enters into a contract to mow a\ncustomer's lawn on a regular basis; re-seed in the spring and fall and\nfertilize as needed. The total charge to the customer for labor and materials\nis taxable as maintenance, and the tax paid by the company on materials used in\nperforming the service which become part of the property serviced may be\nclaimed as a credit or refund. Example 8: A customer has a maintenance contract with a heating and\nair conditioning company to supply all parts and emergency services for his\nheating and air conditioning system for one year for a set fee. The cost of the\ncontract is taxable, whether or not any services or parts are actually\nfurnished, as it is a contract for maintenance of real property. The company\nmay apply for a refund or credit of any tax paid on parts purchased for use\nunder the contract which become part of the property serviced for resale, or\nare transferred to the purchaser in performance of the\nservice. (4)\n\nThe imposition\nof tax on services performed on real property depends on the end result of such\nservice. If the end result of the services is the repair or maintenance of real\nproperty, such services are taxable. If the end result of the same service is a\ncapital improvement to the real property, such services are not taxable. Example 9: The replacement of some shingles or patching of a roof is a\nrepair, but a new asphalt shingle roof is a capital improvement. Example 10: A contractor sells and installs an above-ground swimming\npool. The pool consists of a vinyl liner supported by an aluminum and wood\nframe which rests on the ground and a wood and metal deck. The vinyl liner\nrests on a bed of sand to prevent damage. The deep end (hopper) of the pool is\nset approximately two feet into the ground. The pool may be dismantled and\nmoved without substantially damaging the real property. The installation of\nthis pool is not a capital improvement, as it may be dismantled and moved\nwithout substantial injury to the land, there is no intent that it become a\npermanent installation and it has not become affixed so that it has become part\nof the real property. Therefore, the charges for the sale and installation of\nthe pool are subject to the tax. (5)\n\nAny contractor who is making a capital\nimprovement must pay a tax on the cost of materials to him, as he is the\nultimate consumer of the tangible personal property. Cross reference: For special rules concerning the imposition and computation\nof the compensating use tax owed by a manufacturer who incorporates its own\nproduct into real property to the specifications of a capital improvement, see\nsection\n531.3\n(b) of this Title. (c) Exclusions. (1)\n\nRepair and maintenance services are not\ntaxable when rendered by an individual who does not offer these services to the\npublic in a regular trade or business. This exclusion is limited to individuals\nwho do occasional odd jobs in their spare time, and who do not regularly\nperform such services either in their own business or as an employee. Example 1: A homeowner has his lawn mowed by a student on vacation who\ndoes this kind of work only occasionally. The homeowner is not required to pay\nsales tax on such services. Example 2: A person advertises in the newspaper that he is available\nfor repairing concrete walks on weekends and during evening hours. Such person\nis in a regular trade or business, offering his services to the public, and\nmust register as a vendor and charge appropriate tax. Example 3: A company furnishes painters to a customer for painting the\npremises of the customer. The customer's payment to the company consists of the\nlabor cost for the painters and an amount for profit, overhead and commissions. The customer supplies the paint, and all their materials, equipment and\nsupplies. The customer supervises the manner of performing the work and directs\nwhere the painting shall be done. The company warrants that if any of the work\nis unsatisfactory within one year, it will at its own expense repair the\ncondition. The company is responsible for all employment-related taxes, contributions and benefit costs. The company is performing a taxable service of\nmaintaining the customer's property. It is not performing an interior cleaning\nand maintenance service, which is limited in scope to janitorial duties. The\ncompany is required to collect the tax on its entire charge to the customer; the amount for profit, overhead and commission are not deductible. (See Part\n526 of this Title-Receipt.) The customer is required to pay a tax on the paint, and all other materials, equipment and supplies. (2)\n\nWhere repair and maintenance services are\nrendered by an employee for his employer, the wages, salaries and other\ncompensation paid to the employee are not receipts subject to tax for the\nperformance of such services. (3)\n\nInterior cleaning and maintenance services performed on a regular contractual\nbasis for a term of not less than 30 days are excluded from tax, with the\nexception of window cleaning, rodent and pest control and trash removal from\nbuildings. (i) The contract pursuant to which\nthe services are performed may be oral or written; if it is oral, evidence such\nas regular billing listing the date of service will be required. (ii)\n\nIf the contract or billing does not\nseparately state the charges applicable to taxable services and nontaxable\nservices, the entire charge is subject to tax. (iii)\n\nThe person performing the nontaxable\nservice is required to pay the sales tax on the materials he uses in performing\nsuch service. (iv)\n\nInterior\ncleaning and maintenance services include ordinary janitorial services such as\ndusting, cleaning and waxing of the walls and floors of a building, oiling of\ndoor hinges, replacing light bulbs, and simple repairs such as replacement of\nwashers. Example 4: A homeowner who engages a service company to clean the\ncomplete interior of his home on a one-time basis is required to pay the sales\ntax. Example 5: A business concern who engages a service company to provide\nregular interior cleaning and maintenance services in its offices for a period\nof 30 days or more under a contract is not required to pay the tax since the\ncontract covers a period of 30 days or more. However, all tangible personal\nproperty used by the service company, including floor wax, oil, etc., are\ntaxable to the service company as these items are being transferred in\nconnection with an exempt service. (d) Municipal services. (1)\n\nWhen services are provided by a\nmunicipality, which are of a type ordinarily provided by a private person, then\nsuch services shall not be subject to tax when the charge for such services is\na tax based on the assessed valuation of the property in the municipality\nrather than specific charges for such services. (2)\n\nCharges for services rendered by\nmunicipalities are subject to tax when such charges are for services of a type\nordinarily provided by private persons and the charges are arrived at based\nsolely on the services rendered to a specific individual, family or\nlocation. (3)\n\nMunicipalities which\nprovide services subject to tax are required to register as a vendor with the\nbureau and collect the appropriate tax which shall be remitted with a timely\nfiled return. (4)\n\nThe fact that a\ncharge is added to a real property tax bill for the purposes of collection and\nlevy, shall not change the taxability of the charge. Example 1: A town levies a tax based on assessed valuation on all\ntaxpayers for garbage removal services. This tax is not subject to the sales\ntax. Example 2: A town charges a fee to residents who desire garbage\nremoval, at a rate of $15 quarterly, and rents dumpsters for a fee of $5\nquarterly. These fees are subject to tax. Example 3: A municipality charges its property owners $10 for the\nremoval of snow only when the property owner has not removed the snow himself. The $10 charge is taxable. Example 4: A municipality requires that all water meters be tested\nperiodically. If the municipality tests the meter and charges a fee, the fee is\ntaxable. Cross reference: See Part 529 of this Title, with respect to\nmunicipalities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
