Tit. 11 § 13.11 - Underwriting standards\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo insurer shall use underwriting standards for individual risk selection in a mass merchandising plan which are, on the whole, more restrictive than the standards used by such insurer for individual risk selection in the sale of the same kind of insurance in this State other than pursuant to mass merchandising plans.
