  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 931.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adopted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a water index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Susquehanna watershed and has been closely followed in connection with the\nidentification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream\nnumbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams originally\nshown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of its\nsurvey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to this\nidentification of waters in the Susquehanna River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nSR\nSusquehanna River\n\nPrimary waters\nSR-139\n\nTrib. of Susquehanna River\n\nThe 139th tributary entering the Susquehanna River\nnumbered upstream from the New York-Pennsylvania state line. SR-139-9\n\nSubtrib. of Susquehanna River\n\nThe 9th tributary numbered upstream from the mouth\nof the 139th tributary of the Susquehanna River. SR-139-9-P 182\n\nUnnamed pond\n\nThe 182nd pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey area of the Susquehanna River watershed system. (c) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\ngenerally known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of\nspecifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which\nthe unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as possible. (d) Description\nas appearing\nin table I contains designations of sections of waters to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or\nstandards. (e) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I designates the following maps which have\nbeen reproduced in whole or in part in section\n931.6, infra. The\nstreams have been outlined in black and the waters index numbers indicated on\nthese maps. N-14 (Towanda, Penn.-NY) has not been reproduced because of the\nvery small mileage of streams involved on this map. Small portions of L-12\n(Watkins) are reproduced on L-13 (Ithaca). Map Ref. no.

(f) Class\nas appearing in table I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, or C opposite each specifically designated waters, shall mean class AA, A, B, or C, as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra, (g) Standards\nas appearing in table I, and denoted by the letters\nAA, A, B, or C opposite each specifically designated waters, shall mean the\nstandards of quality and purity established for class AA, A, B, or C, as the\ncase may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T)\nafter any class designation shall mean that the designated waters are trout\nwaters and that the dissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply\nthereto. The symbol (TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the\ndesignated waters are suitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen\nspecification for the trout spawning waters shall apply thereto. The term\ntrout\nas used in this Part shall mean any fish in the\nfollowing genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\", and \"Thymallus\". (h) The abbreviations trib., tribs., subtrib. and subtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries\nshall mean any\nstream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water. Where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or body of surface water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly\nstated. (i) all streams or other\nbodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the\nreference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein, shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra. except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (k) The\n\nSusquehanna River drainage basin shall be deemed to include all the land and\nsurface water areas tributary directly or indirectly to the Susquehanna River\nwithin the State of New York.
