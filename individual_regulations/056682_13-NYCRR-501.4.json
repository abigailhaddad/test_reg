  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 13 § 501.4 - Covered policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope of\ncoverage\n(1)\n\nThe preclearance\nrequirement applies to any covered policy, even if it appears to be minor or\nindirect, returns to a prior practice or procedure, purports to expand voting\nrights, or is designed to remove the elements that caused the CRB to deny\npreclearance to a prior submitted change. (2)\n\nThe preclearance requirement applies to\nchanges enacted by or implemented through the Executive, Legislative, or\n\nJudicial branches. (3)\n\nState or\nfederal law\n(i) State and federal laws and\nregulations are not subject to preclearance. (ii)\n\nCovered policies enacted or implemented\nin order to comply with State or federal law are exempt from preclearance\nreview only where such enactment or implementation does not require the use of\ndiscretion by the covered entity. (4)\nA grant of preclearance by the CRB with\nrespect to local legislation that requires, permits, or enables a political\nsubdivision to implement a covered policy (hereinafter the \"parent\nlegislation\") does not exempt the implementation of the particular covered\npolicy that is enabled, permitted, or required from the preclearance\nrequirement, unless such implementation was explicitly included and described\nin the submission of the precleared parent legislation. Such parent legislation\nmay include: (i) Local legislation authorizing\na political subdivision to institute a covered policy described in section\n17-210(2)\nof the\n\nElection Law or designated by this title; (ii)\n\nLocal legislation requiring a political\nsubdivision that chooses a certain form of government to follow specified\nelection procedures; (iii)\n\nLocal\nlegislation requiring or authorizing political subdivisions of a certain size\nor a certain location to institute specified changes; and\n(iv)\n\nLocal legislation requiring a political\nsubdivision to follow certain practices or procedures, unless the political\nsubdivision's charter or local laws specify to the\ncontrary. (5)\n\nCourt-ordered changes\n(i) Covered\npolicies for which approval by a state or federal court is required, or that\nare ordered by a state or federal court, are exempt from preclearance review\nonly where the court prepared the change and the change was not proposed by, and has not been subsequently adopted or modified by, the relevant covered\nentity. (ii)\n\nWhere a court-ordered\nchange at its inception is not subject to preclearance review, a subsequent\nadoption or ratification of the change, implementation in a manner not\nexplicitly required or authorized by the court, or other action by the covered\nentity involving the use of discretion by such covered entity renders the\nchange subject to preclearance review with regard to any future\nimplementation. (iii)\n\nWhere a\ncourt-ordered change is not itself subject to preclearance review, subsequent\nchanges necessitated by the court order but which reflect the use of discretion\nby the covered entity are subject to preclearance. For example, election\ndistrict and polling site changes made necessary by a court-ordered\nredistricting plan, but which are determined through discretion exercised by\nthe covered entity, are subject to preclearance review. (6)\nA change is considered to be made when\nthe determination to make the change, and the discretion involved in the\ndecision, is finalized, even if the change is not made operative until the next\napplicable election. After a previously enacted covered policy has been\nprecleared, implementation of that policy may be required to be precleared\nseparately if it requires discretion to implement. (7)\nA grant of preclearance by the CRB with\nrespect to a procedure for instituting a covered policy does not exempt the\nsubstantive change from the preclearance requirement. For example, if the\nprocedure for the approval of an annexation is changed from City Council\napproval to approval in a voter referendum, preclearance of the new annexation\nprocedure does not exempt an annexation accomplished under the new procedure\nfrom the preclearance requirement. (8)\nA \"poll site\" shall be construed to\ninclude any location at which a vote may be cast in accordance with State law, including but not limited to ballot drop boxes. (b) Recurring practices\n(1)\n\nWhere a political subdivision implements\na policy periodically or upon certain established contingencies, a change is\ndeemed to have occurred upon any of the following circumstances: (i) The first time the policy is implemented\nby the political subdivision; (ii)\n\nWhen the manner in which the policy is implemented by the political subdivision\nis changed; and\n(iii)\n\nWhen the\nrules for determining when the policy will be implemented are\nchanged. (2)\nA grant of\npreclearance by the CRB with respect to a recurrent policy constitutes\npreclearance of the future use of the policy if its recurrent nature is clearly\nstated or described in the submission or is expressly recognized in the report\nand determination of the CRB on the merits of the\nsubmission.
