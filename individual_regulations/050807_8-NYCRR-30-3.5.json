  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 30-3.5 - Standards and criteria for conducting annual professional performance reviews of building principals under Education Law section 3012-d\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Ratings. Annual professional performance reviews conducted under\nthis section shall differentiate principal effectiveness resulting in a\nprincipal being rated highly effective, effective, developing or ineffective\nbased on multiple measures in the following two categories: the student\nperformance category and the school visit category. (b) Student performance category. Such category shall have at least one required subcomponent\nand an optional second subcomponent as follows: (1)\n\nRequired first subcomponent. A district\nmay select, or if applicable, collectively bargain one or more measures for the\nrequired student performance category that shall be applied in a consistent\nmanner, to the extent practicable, across the district. Such measure shall be\nbased on one or more of the following: (i) A\nstudent learning objective (SLO), on a form prescribed by the commissioner, consistent with the SLO process determined or developed by the commissioner, that results in a student growth score based on a State-created or\n-administered assessment or other State-approved student assessment. Such SLO\nmay be either principal- and building- or program-specific or based on\ndistrict-, or BOCES-wide group, team, or linked results. The SLO process\ndetermined by the commissioner shall include a minimum growth target of one\nyear of expected growth, as determined by the superintendent or their designee. Such targets, as determined by the superintendent or their designee, may take\nthe following characteristics into account: poverty, students with\ndisabilities, English language learner status and prior academic history. SLOs\nshall include the following elements, as defined by the commissioner in\nguidance: (a) student population; (b) learning content; (c) interval of instructional time; (d) evidence; (e) baseline; (f) target; (g) criteria for rating a principal highly\neffective, effective, developing or ineffective (HEDI); and\n(h) rationale. (ii)\n\nAn input model where the principal's\nstudent performance rating shall be determined based on evidence of principal\npractice that promotes student growth related to the Leadership Standards. If a\ndistrict uses the input model, the district's evaluation plan as approved by\nthe commissioner shall include, but not be limited to: (a) a description of the areas of principal\npractice that will be evaluated; (b) a description of how the selected areas\nof principal practice promote student growth; (c) a description of the evidence of student\ngrowth and principal practice that will be collected; and\n(d) a description of how the district will\nuse the evidence to differentiate effectiveness resulting in a score from 0 to\n20 and ratings of Highly effective, effective, Developing, or\n\nIneffective. (2)\n\nOptional second subcomponent. A district\nmay select, or if applicable, collectively bargain one or more other measures\nfor the student performance category that shall be applied in a consistent\nmanner, to the extent practicable, across the district based on a State-created\nor administered assessment or State-designed supplemental assessment. Such\nsecond measure shall be either: (i) a second\nSLO, provided that this SLO is different than that used in the required\nsubcomponent of the principal's evaluation; (ii)\na growth score based on a statistical\ngrowth model, where available, for either a State-created or administered\nassessment or a State-designed supplemental assessment; (iii)\na measure of student growth, other than\nan SLO, based on State-created or administered assessments or State-designed\nsupplemental assessments; (iv)\na\nperformance index based on State-created or administered assessments or\napproved student assessments; (v) an achievement benchmark on State-created or administered assessments or\napproved student assessments; (vi)\nfour, five, or six year high school graduation rates; (vii)\nan input model based on evidence of\nprincipal practice that promotes student achievement or growth related to the\n\nLeadership Standards; or\n(viii)\nany\nother collectively bargained measure of student growth or achievement as\ndescribed in the district's evaluation plan, subject to approval by the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nWhere\nappropriate, growth or achievement targets may consider the following\nstudent-level characteristics: poverty, English language learner status, disability status, and/or prior academic history. (4)\n\nThe district shall measure student growth\nor achievement in the optional subcomponent using the same measure(s) for all\nbuilding principals within the same building configuration or\nprogram. (5)\n\nWeighting of\nsubcomponents within student performance category. (i) If a district does not locally select to\nuse the optional second student performance subcomponent, then the mandatory\nsubcomponent shall be weighted at 100 percent. (ii)\n\nIf the optional second student\nperformance subcomponent is selected, then the weighting of the required and\noptional subcomponents shall be determined locally, subject to approval by the\ncommissioner in the submitted evaluation plan. (iii)\n\nEach measure used in the student\nperformance category (i.e., required SLOs, second student performance measures)\nmust result in a score between 0 and 20. Except as otherwise provided in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, districts shall calculate growth scores\nfor SLOs in accordance with the minimum percentages prescribed in the table\nbelow; provided, however, that for principals of a building or program with\nsmall \"n\" sizes as defined by the commissioner in guidance, districts shall\ncalculate scores for SLOs using a methodology prescribed by the commissioner in\nguidance and for principals in the City School District of the City of New\n\nYork, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs using the methodology approved\nby the commissioner in its APPR plan. For all other measures that are not SLOs, scores of 0-20 shall be computed pursuant to a process described in the\ndistrict's evaluation plan as approved by the commissioner. Percent of Students Meeting Target Scoring Range\n0-4% 0\n5-8% 1\n9-12% 2\n13-16% 3\n17-20% 4\n21-24% 5\n25-28% 6\n29-33% 7\n34-38% 8\n39-43% 9\n44-48% 10\n49-54% 11\n55-59% 12\n60-66% 13\n67-74% 14\n75-79% 15\n80-84% 16\n85-89% 17\n90-92% 18\n93-96% 19\n97-100% 20\n(iv)\n\nFor the City School District of the City\nof New York, scores for SLOs that are based on the percentage of students\nmeeting a target shall be calculated in accordance with the minimum percentages\nbelow: SLOs\n\nPercent of Students Meeting Target Scoring Range\n0-9% 0\n10-19% 1\n20-29% 2\n30-39% 3\n40-49% 4\n50-59% 5\n60-62% 6\n63-65% 7\n66-68% 8\n69-71% 9\n72-74% 10\n75-77% 11\n78-80% 12\n81-83% 13\n84-86% 14\n87-89% 15\n90-91% 16\n92-93% 17\n94-95% 18\n96-97% 19\n98-100% 20\n\nAny other district may submit a variance request to the\ndepartment pursuant to section\n30-3.16\nof this Subpart to use the\nscoring ranges described in this subparagraph. (v) Overall rating on student performance\ncategory. Multiple measures shall be combined using a weighted average, to\nproduce an overall student performance category score of 0 to 20. Except as\notherwise provided in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph, based on such score, an overall student performance category rating shall be derived from the table\nbelow: Minimum Maximum\nH 18 20\nE 15 17\nD 13 14\nI 0 12\n(vi)\n\nFor the City School District of the City\nof New York, an overall student performance category rating shall be derived\nfrom the table below: Minimum Maximum\nH 16 20\nE 11 15\nD 6 10\nI 0 5\n\nAny other district may submit a variance request to the\ndepartment pursuant to section\n30-3.16\nof this Subpart to use the\ntable above to compute the overall student performance category rating. (c) Principal school visit category. Principals' professional performance shall be\nevaluated based on a State-approved rubric using multiple sources of evidence\ncollected and incorporated into the school visit protocol. Where appropriate, such evidence may be aligned to building or district goals; provided, however, that professional goal-setting may not be used as evidence of teacher or\nprincipal effectiveness. Such evidence shall reÖect school leadership practice\naligned to the Leadership Standards and selected practice rubric. (d) The school visit category for principals\nshall include up to three subcomponents; two of which are required and one of\nwhich is optional. (1)\n\nTwo required\nsubcomponents. A district shall evaluate a principal based on at least: (i) at least one school visit shall be based\non a State-approved principal practice rubric conducted by the building\nprincipal's supervisor or other trained administrator; and\n(ii)\nat least a second school visit shall be\nconducted by either one or more impartial independent trained evaluator(s)\nselected and trained by the district or in cases where a hardship waiver is\ngranted by the department pursuant to clause (a) of this clause, a second\nschool visit shall be conducted by one or more evaluators selected and trained\nby the district, who are different than the evaluator(s) who conducted the\nevaluation pursuant to clause (b) of this subparagraph. An independent trained\nevaluator may be employed within the district but may not be assigned to the\nsame school building as the principal being evaluated. (a) a rural school district, as defined by\nthe commissioner in guidance, or a school district with only one registered\nschool pursuant to section\n100.18\nof the commissioner's\nregulations may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual\nbasis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by the commissioner, if due to the\nsize and limited resources of the school district, it is unable to obtain an\nindependent evaluator within a reasonable proximity without an undue burden to\nthe school district; (b) a school\ndistrict may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual basis, on a form and in a timeframe prescribed by the commissioner, if the school\ndistrict believes that compliance with this requirement would create an undue\nburden on the district in one or more of the following areas: compliance with\nthe independent evaluator requirement would result in financial hardship; the\ndistrict lacks professionally trained staff to comply with the independent\nevaluator requirement; the district has a large number of principals; and/or\ncompliance with the independent evaluator requirement could impact safety and\nmanagement of a building. A hardship waiver granted by the department under\nthis clause shall excuse, but not prohibit, school districts from conducting\nschool visits by impartial independent trained evaluators for principals who\nreceived a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing in the\npreceding school year (e.g., school districts would be excused, but not\nprohibited, from conducting school visits by impartial independent trained\nevaluators for the 2016-2017 school year for principals who receive a rating of\nhighly effective, effective, or developing for the 2015-2016 school year; school districts would be required to conduct school visits by impartial\nindependent trained evaluators for the 2016-2017 school year for, at a minimum, principals who receive a rating of ineffective for the 2015-2016 school year). For principals who are excused from the impartial independent trained evaluator\nrequirement pursuant to a hardship waiver granted by the department under this\nclause, school districts shall conduct a second school visit, provided that\nsuch second school visit may be conducted by the principal's supervisor or any\nindividual selected and trained by the school district. The two school visits\nfor such principals could be performed by the same individual. As part of its\nhardship waiver request, a school district shall submit a plan for conducting\nschool visits by the principal's supervisor or other individual selected and\ntrained by the school district in lieu of the impartial independent trained\nevaluator subcomponent. For the other principals in the district who must still\nreceive a second school visit by an impartial, independent trained evaluator\n(principals who, at a minimum, received an ineffective rating in the preceding\nschool year), the district must submit a plan for conducting such school\nvisits. Once a hardship waiver is approved by the department, it shall be\nconsidered part of the school district's annual professional performance review\nplan for such school year. (2)\n\nOptional third subcomponent. The school\nvisit category may also include a third optional subcomponent based on school\nvisits conducted by a trained peer administrator rated effective or highly\neffective on their overall rating in the prior school year from the same or\nanother school in the district. (3)\n\nFrequency and duration of school visits. The frequency of school visits shall\nbe established locally. (4)\n\nAll\nschool visits must be conducted using a principal practice rubric approved by\nthe commissioner pursuant to an RFQ process, unless the district has a\ncurrently approved variance from the commissioner. (i) Variance for existing rubric. A variance\nmay be granted to a district that seeks to use a rubric that is either a close\nadaptation of a rubric on the approved list, or a rubric that was\nself-developed or developed by a third-party, upon a finding by the\ncommissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ, and the\ndistrict has demonstrated that it has made a significant investment in the\nrubric and has a history of use that would justify continuing the use of that\nrubric. (ii)\n\nVariance for use of\nnew innovative rubrics. A variance may be granted to a district that seeks to\nuse a newly developed rubric, upon a finding by the commissioner that the\nrubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ and the district has\ndemonstrated how it will ensure inter-rater reliability and the rubric's\nability to provide differentiated results over time. (5)\n\nAll school visits for a principal for the\nyear must use the same approved rubric; provided that districts may locally\ndetermine whether to use different rubrics for a principal assigned to\ndifferent grade level configurations or building types. (6)\n\nAt least one of the required school\nvisits must be unannounced. (7)\n\nSchool visits may not be conducted via video. (8)\n\nNothing in this Subpart shall be\nconstrued to limit the discretion of a board of education, superintendent, or\nother trained administrator from conducting school visits of a principal in\naddition to those required under this section for non-evaluative\npurposes. (9)\n\nThe evaluator may\nselect a limited number of rubric subcomponents on which to focus in a\nparticular school visit, so long as all observable rubric subcomponents are\naddressed across the total number of annual school visits. (10)\n\nLeadership standards and their related\nfunctions that are part of the rubric but not observable during the course of\nthe school visit may be observed through other natural conversations between\nthe principal and the evaluator and incorporated into the school visit\nscore. (11)\n\nPoints shall not be\nallocated based on any artifacts, unless such artifact constitutes evidence of\na rubric subcomponent observed during a school visit. Points shall not be\nallocated based on professional goal-setting; however, organizational\ngoal-setting may be used to the extent it is evidence from the school visit and\nrelated to a component of the principal practice rubric. (12)\n\nEach subcomponent of the selected\npractice rubric shall be evaluated on a 1-4 scale based on a State-approved\nrubric aligned to the leadership standards and an overall score for the school\nvisit subcomponents and category shall be generated between 1-4. Such\nsubcomponent and category scores must incorporate all evidence collected and\nobserved over the course of the school year. Scores for each subcomponent of\nthe school visit category shall be combined using a weighted average, producing\nan overall school visit category score between 1-4. In the event that a\nprincipal earns a score of 1 on all rated components of the practice rubric\nacross all school visits, a score of 0 will be assigned. (13)\n\nWeighting of Subcomponents with\n\nPrincipal School Visit Category. The weighting of the subcomponents in the\nprincipal school visit category shall be established locally within the\nfollowing constraints: (i) school visits\nconducted by a superintendent or other trained administrator shall be weighted\nat a minimum of 80 percent; (ii)\nschool visits conducted by independent impartial trained evaluators or other\nevaluators selected by the district if a hardship waiver is granted, shall be\nweighted at a minimum of 10 percent; (iii)\nif a district selects to use the\noptional third school visit subcomponent, then the weighting assigned to the\noptional school visits conducted by peers shall be established locally within\nthe constraints outlined in clauses (a) and (b) of this subparagraph. (14)\n\nOverall rating on the\nprincipal school visit category. The overall principal school visit score shall\nbe converted into an overall rating, using cut scores determined locally for\neach rating category; provided that such cut scores shall be consistent with the\npermissible ranges identified below: Overall School Visit Category Score and Rating\n\nMinimum Maximum\nH 3.5 to 3.75 4.0\nE 2.5 to 2.75 3.49 to 3.74\nD 1.5 to 1.75 2.49 to 2.74\nI 0 1.49 to 1.74\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
