  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.13 - Procedures for deriving standards and guidance values for protection of wildlife\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Protection\nof the best usage of fishing shall include standards and guidance values for\nprotection of the health of wildlife consumers of aquatic life and water. Such\nvalues are referred to as Wildlife values. (b) Standards and guidance values to protect\nwildlife shall be derived using levels of chemicals known to be toxic to\nwildlife in conjunction with a bioaccumulation factor and wildlife consumption\nrates of aquatic life and water. (c) Where the available data are deemed\ninsufficient for deriving a value on the basis of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, a value may be based on correlation to a chemical for which a standard\nor guidance value has been established pursuant to that subdivision. Values\nbased on chemical correlation may be established where similar toxic effects\nare anticipated because of similarity of functional groups or metabolic or\ntoxicologic pathways. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
