  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 857.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of this Part an item number is assigned to\neach specifically designated water or portions thereof. (b) Waters index no. as\nappearing in table I of this Part shall mean that number or abbreviation which\nhas been assigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for\nthe purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred\nto by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively\nnumbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered\nconsecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the\nletter P. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered progressing\nupstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such\nlakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise\naround the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When isolated lakes and ponds\nare referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their\nidentification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not\nnecessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to which no\nsurface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Wappinger Creek watershed and has been closely followed in connection with\nthe identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of the\nstream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Wappinger Creek drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters Index Number\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH-101\n\nWappinger Creek\n\nThe 101st tributary to enter the Hudson River from\neast at New Hamburg (Map 0-24)\nH-101-18\n\nLittle Wappinger Creek\n\nThe 18th tributary entering Wappinger Creek from\nnorthwest 0.5 mile upstream from trib. H-101-17 and at 0.7 mile southeast of\n\nSalt Pt. (Map N-24)\nH-101-18-13\n\nTrib. of Little Wappinger Creek\n\nThe 13th tributary entering Little Wappinger Creek\n1.4 miles upstream from trib. H-101-18-12 and 0.5 mile west of Bullshead (Map\nN-24)\nH-101-18-13-P 378\n\nSilver Lake\n\nLake located at upstream end of trib. H-101-18-13\nand 1.0 mile northwest of Bullshead (Map N-24)\n(c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs, indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which may appear on the reference\nmaps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named\ntributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I of this part means map reference number\nand indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part, on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. It is to be noted that map 2 of this Part, with\nsuperimposed tracing in black of streams and other waters and waters index\nnumbers, has been made by using parts of the U.S.G.S. topographical sheets\nlisted below and combining them into one map. The following maps were produced\nfrom original maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey. Map ref. no.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I of this Part, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C, or D, opposite\neach specifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and\npurity established for class AA, A, B, C, or D, as the case may be, as set\nforth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any\nstandard designation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and\nthat the dissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated\nwaters are suitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen\nspecification for trout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus and Thymallus. (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I of this Part, shall be\nassigned the same classes and standards of quality and purity as the\nspecifically designated waters to which they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown of the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The\n\nWappinger Creek drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: all land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which is\ndirectly or indirectly tributary to Wappinger Creek.
