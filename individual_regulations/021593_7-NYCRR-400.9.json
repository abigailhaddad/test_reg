When the item(s) is sold, payment will be made according to the\nfollowing standards: (1)\n\nIf the business, farm, etc. is reestablished, but the personal property is replaced with a\ncomparable item at the new location, payment shall be the lesser of: (i) the replacement cost less the net\nproceeds of the sale; or\n(ii)\nthe\nestimated cost of moving the item. (2)\n\nIf the business, etc. is discontinued, or\nthe item is not replaced in the reestablished business, payment shall be the\nlessor of: (i) the depreciated value of the\nitem in place less the net proceeds of the sale; or\n(ii)\nthe estimated cost of moving the\nitem.
