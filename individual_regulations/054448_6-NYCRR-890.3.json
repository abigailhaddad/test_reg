  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 890.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in Table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound is usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the waters\nunder consideration by the New York State Conservation Department in its\n\nBiological Survey of the Lower Hudson Watershed\nand\n\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\nin 1936\nand 1938, respectively, and has been closely followed in connection with the\nnumerical identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on the older maps employed by the Conservation Department at\nthe time of its 1936 and 1938 surveys but not shown on later editions of maps\nreproduced herein. Conversely, streams, lakes and ponds not shown on the older\nmaps but appearing on the newer maps are designated by suffix letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of the designated waters may be outlined as follows: There\nare several primary indices used to identify the designated waters. Those\nwaters that drain Staten Island proper are identified by waters index numbers\nprefixed by the abbreviation SI. Waters draining Long Island proper are\nidentified by waters index numbers prefixed by the abbreviation LI. Waters of\nthe East River are identified by waters index numbers prefixed by ER. Accordingly, those waters within the designated basin that have not been\nassigned waters index numbers, such as New York Bay, Raritan Bay, Arthur Kill, Kill Van Kull and Atlantic Ocean, have been identified by name only. (4)\n\nThe following table will illustrate how\nthe designated waters may be identified through use of the waters index system: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nNone assigned\n\nAtlantic Ocean New York Bay Raritan Bay Arthur Kill\n\nGowanus Bay Gravesend Bay Newark Bay Kill Van Kull\n\nPrimary waters identified by description and not\nused to index tributaries. SI 8-1-1\n\nSpringville Creek\n\nSpringville Creek is the first tributary of SI 8-1\n(Main Creek) and Main Creek is the first tributary of SI 8 (Fresh Kills)\nlocated on Staten Island. LI 253\n\nConey Island Creek\n\nThe 253rd stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton. ER\nEast River\n\nPrimary waters. ER 1\n\nHarlem River\n\nThe first tributary entering East River above the\nmouth. ER 1-5\n\nTibbetts Brook\n\nThe fifth tributary entering Harlem River above the\nmouth. ER 1-5-P 1043\n\nVan Cortlandt Lake\n\nThe 1043rd pond or lake encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Lower Hudson River watershed. ER 1-5 (1.0)\n\nTibbetts Brook\nA point on Tibbetts Brook one mile above the\nmouth. (5)\n\nThere are instances where a parenthetical\ndecimal number appears following the waters index number. Such number appearing\nwithin the parentheses indicates the distance in miles above the mouth to a\npoint on the identified watercourse. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib. and\ntribs., indicating tributary and tributaries, shall mean\nany stream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary or tributaries\nare mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the\nstream, pond or other body of water referenced by such waters index number; where a tributary or tributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body\nof water referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\n\nTable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class or standards shall apply. Also included in this column is\nany useful information pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No., as appearing in Table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely or in part in\nsection\n890.11, infra, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basins or areas. An index for map numbers is shown on Map 2, quadrangle arrangement, reproduced\nin section\n890.8, infra.
