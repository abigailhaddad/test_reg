  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 228-1.6 - Reports, sampling and analysis\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner and/or operator of any emission source subject to the VOC emission\ncontrol requirements of this Subpart must, upon request by the department, use\n\nMethod 311 or Method 24, included in Appendix A of both 40 CFR parts\n63\nand\n60, respectively (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), to measure\nthe volatile content, water content, density, volume of solids, and weight of\nsolids in order to determine the actual VOC content of an as applied coating\nduring a compliance demonstration. (b) When the sampling and analysis methods\nreferenced in subdivision (a) or (e) or paragraph (d)(2) of this section are\nnot applicable, alternate sampling and analysis methods can be used, subject to\nthe approval of the department and the administrator. (c) Representatives of the department must be\npermitted on the facility owner's property, during reasonable business hours, to obtain coating samples for the purpose of determining compliance with this\n\nSubpart. (d) When an owner and/or\noperator of a coating line utilizes control equipment to comply with the\nprovisions of this Part, test methods acceptable to the department must be used\nto determine the overall removal efficiency during a required performance test. (1)\n\nThe overall removal efficiency may be\nmade by directly measuring VOC/solvent recovery and VOC/solvent usage rates\nwhere VOC/solvent recovery is the only control equipment. Methods provided for\nin subdivision (a) or (b) of this section must be used. (2)\n\nFor any control equipment other than\nVOC/solvent recovery, this determination must include provisions to determine\nboth the efficiency of the capture system and the control equipment. The\napproved VOC CE test methods are contained in the following table. Test methods\n204 through 204F (M204 - M204F) are included in appendix M of 40 CFR part\n51\n(see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). The approved\ntest methods for determining the efficiency of the control equipment are listed\nin subdivision (e) of this section.

The\nalternative CE protocols and test methods must be approved in advance by the\ndepartment. Also, the multiple line testing procedures outlined in the above\nguidance document can be used to determine CE if the applicable criteria are\nsatisfied. The multiple line testing CE protocols and test methods must be\napproved in advance by the department. (e) The owner and/or operator of a surface\ncoating line must follow the applicable notification requirements, protocol\nrequirements, and test procedures of Part 202 of this Title for testing and\nmonitoring. Depending upon conditions at a test site, one of the following test\nmethods from appendix A of 40 CFR part\n60\n(see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) must be used\nwhen measuring VOC contents of a gas stream at the inlet and outlet of a\ncontrol device to determine the destruction and/or removal efficiency: (1)\nmethod 18, Measurement of Gaseous Organic\n\nCompound Emissions by Gas Chromatography; (2)\nmethod 25, Determination of Total Gaseous\n\nOrganic Emissions as Carbon; or\n(3)\nmethod 25A, Determination of Total Gaseous Organic Concentration Using a Flame\n\nIonization Analyzer. (f) If an air cleaning device is used, continuous monitors for the following\nparameters must be installed, periodically calibrated, and operated when the\nassociated control equipment is operating: (1)\nexhaust gas temperature of all incinerators; (2)\ntemperature rise across catalytic\nincinerator bed; (3)\nbreakthrough\nof VOCs on a carbon adsorption unit; and\n(4)\nany other continuous monitoring or\nrecording device required by the department. (g) For each emission differential (ED)\ncalculation performed under section\n228-1.5\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator of the coating system must record the following\nand make the records available to the department upon request: the name or\nidentification of each coating; the coating parameters used in equation 7, the\nindividual ED values for each coating, and the ED value calculated for the\ncoating system. (h) Any information\nor record showing noncompliance with the requirements of this Part must be\nreported to the department within 30 days following notice or generation of the\ninformation or record. (1)\n\nAll records\nrequired by this section must be maintained at the facility for a period of\nfive years. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n228-1.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
