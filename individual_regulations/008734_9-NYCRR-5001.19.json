(b) An agent may establish, as an affirmative\ndefense to a suspension or revocation based upon insufficient sales, whether\nunder paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this section or otherwise, that such\nagent's failure to sell a sufficient number of tickets was caused by factors\noutside the control of the agent that the agent has taken reasonable steps to\nmitigate, such as extreme weather, natural disaster, flood, earthquake, war, discharge of hazardous material, blackout or power interruption, civil unrest\nor other events or circumstances and that nevertheless, despite such\nmitigation, reasonably excuse such agent's sales performance. (c) If the commission orders the temporary\nsuspension of a sales agent's license pending any prosecution, investigation or\nhearing, the sales agent shall permit the commission to retrieve lottery\nequipment, tickets and other material provided by the commission that may be in\nthe sales agent's possession. Failure to cooperate in the commission's\nretrieval effort shall constitute separate grounds for suspension or revocation\nof the sales agent's license. A sales agent under a temporary suspension shall\ncontinue to remit amounts owed to the commission when required during such\ntemporary suspension. (d) Upon\ntermination of an agent's license for any reason, the agent shall comply with\nthe commission's instructions in regard to payment of remaining amounts owed by\nthe agent and surrender of the agent's license, lottery equipment, tickets and\nother material provided by the commission. If the agent fails to comply with\nsuch instructions, the commission may take steps to impose such penalties and\nexercise such enforcement powers as may be provided for by law, including\nreferral of the debt for collection or further action. The sales agent may be\nliable in the amount of the debt, plus any collection costs, penalties, interest and attorney fees to which the commission may be entitled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
