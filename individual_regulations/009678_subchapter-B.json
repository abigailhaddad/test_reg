B - Petroleum Business Tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nPart 450 - Petroleum Business Bond Or Other Security (§ 450.1 to 450.2)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 20, ch. III, subch. B\nPart 450 contained in this Subchapter was renumbered as part\nof a reorganization of the Department's regulations. This Part was previously\n\nPart 63. The rulemaking which renumbered this Part did not make substantive\nchanges and did not seek to incorporate intervening changes in the law. The\nregulations should be read in conjunction with current\nlaw. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
