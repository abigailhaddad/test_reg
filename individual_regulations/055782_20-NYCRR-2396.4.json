(1)\n\nBy June 1st of each year, the\ndepartment shall, by certified mail, send a notice to taxpayers newly\nidentified as being required to participate in the program for the immediately\nfollowing July 1st-June 30th period.

(2)\n\nIf a\nnewly identified taxpayer believes that it is exempt from participation in the\nprogram because its aggregate tax withheld, pursuant to its most recent\nreconciliation of withholding, is less than $100,000, or because it is a health\ncare provider, the taxpayer must submit a Statement of Exemption from Mandatory\n\nParticipation, with all information necessary to prove that it qualifies for\nexemption. The taxpayer must submit this statement to the department within 20\ncalendar days of the postmark date of the notice described in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. The statement shall be signed by the chief fiscal officer of\nthe taxpayer. The department shall notify the taxpayer of the decision to grant\nor deny the exemption within 14 calendar days of receipt of the taxpayer's\nstatement. If the department denies the exemption, the denial notice will also\nadvise the taxpayer of the procedural steps which must be then taken to enroll\nin the program. (3)\nA taxpayer\nnewly required to participate in the program shall transmit a completed\nenrollment form to the department. The taxpayer shall, at this point in the\nenrollment process, select its chosen payment option from ACH debit, ACH\ncredit, fedwire, or certified check. (4)\n\nIf a taxpayer newly required to\nparticipate in the program has not enrolled within 20 calendar days of the\npostmark date of the notice described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, or\nwhere a taxpayer files for a hearing and such protest is not sustained, and the\ntaxpayer does not enroll in the program within 10 calendar days of the postmark\ndate of the notification thereof, the department shall send, by certified mail, another notice, in addition to making other reasonable attempts (including\nfollow-up telephone calls and correspondence which shall be sent by certified\nmail) to inform the taxpayer of the civil penalty that has been assessed for\nfailure to enroll, of the opportunity for abatement of such penalty, and of the\nfuture penalties that may result from continued failure to enroll. (5)\n\nTaxpayers no longer required to\nparticipate. By June 1st of each year, the department shall notify currently\nparticipating taxpayers identified as no longer meeting the program eligibility\ncriteria. The notice will inform taxpayers that they will continue in the\nprogram as voluntary participants unless they choose not to participate. The\nnotice will include information explaining how taxpayers can notify the\ndepartment of the choice not to participate. (6)\n\nTaxpayers whose eligibility has not\nchanged. The department will not provide notice to participating taxpayers\nwhose eligibility status for the program has not changed. If a taxpayer\nbelieves that its eligibility status has changed, it may submit a Statement of\n\nExemption from Mandatory Participation to the department. (See paragraph [2] of\nthis subdivision for a description of the information needed in the statement.)\n\nThe department shall notify the taxpayer of the decision within 14 calendar\ndays of receipt of the statement. If it grants the exemption, the notice shall\nalso advise the taxpayer of the earliest possible date for final filing and\npayment by EFT method. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
