Tit. 17 § 131.11 - Existing utility facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department has the right to construct, reconstruct, repair, operate and maintain State highways and other transportation facilities\nas provided by law, without interference from utility facilities. Utilities\nshall permanently or temporarily remove, relocate, repair, modify, shield or\notherwise protect their facilities, upon notice from the department, so as to\navoid interference with the rights and obligations of the department. The\ndepartment, whether or not in conjunction with a highway construction or\nmaintenance project, may require the relocation of utility facilities which may\ninterfere with the free and safe flow of traffic or which are located within\nthe clear zone or deflection zone. Utilities shall be required to provide such\ninformation and make such certifications as the department shall require, in\nconnection with existing facilities and the impact of the highway project on\nsuch facilities. In instances in which the department is concerned about\npotential impacts of department or contractor activity on utility facilities a\ncertification from a licensed professional engineer on behalf of the utility, attesting to the fact that the proposed department or contractor activity is\ncompatible with the integrity and safety of the utility facility may be\nrequired. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n131.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
