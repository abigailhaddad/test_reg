(b) In the event the parties\nwish to deviate from the form set forth in Appendix B, they shall submit to the\n\nCourt a red-line of the proposed changes and a written explanation of why the\ndeviations are warranted in connection with the pending matter. (c) In the event the parties wish to\nincorporate a privilege clawback provision into either (i) the confidentiality\norder to be utilized in their commercial case, or (ii) another form of order\nutilized by the Justice presiding over the matter, they shall utilize the text\nset forth in Appendix B, Paragraph 18 to these Rules of the Commercial\n\nDivision. In the event the parties wish to deviate from the language in\n\nAppendix B, Paragraph 18, they shall submit to the Court a red-line of the\nproposed changes and a written explanation of why the deviations are warranted\nin connection with the pending matter.
