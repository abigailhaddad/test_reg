Tit. 10 §§ 69-8.6 - Responsibilities of institutions caring for infants in special circumstances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the event that an infant is transferred from one facility to another such facility, the facility discharging the infant to home shall be responsible for ensuring that infant hearing screening services are provided to the infant and reported to the department in a manner consistent with the applicable provisions set forth in this Subpart. If the infant fails the inpatient infant hearing screening and any follow-up outpatient infant hearing screening, the infant shall be referred for an evaluation to the early intervention official in his or her county of residence, according to the procedures set forth in section\n69-4.3\nof this Part unless the parent objects. The parent's objection to a follow-up screening must be entered into EHDI-IS or any successor system. (b) Medically unstable infants shall receive infant hearing screening prior to discharge to home and as early as development or medical stability will permit such screening. In instances where the medical condition of the infant contraindicates infant hearing screening, a decision to forgo such screening may be made and documented in the medical record and reported to the department in a manner consistent with the applicable provisions set forth in this Subpart.
