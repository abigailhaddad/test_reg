Tit. 18 § 628.2 - Conditions for reimbursement for foster care\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No portion of any claim for reimbursement\nmay be supported solely with State funds if reimbursement may be claimed from a\nprogram for which there is Federal participation. (b) Any claims for reimbursement from a\nprogram or activity for which there is Federal participation which were not\nfully reimbursed as claimed and which were properly made at the time they were\noriginally submitted to the department may be claimed as child care services\nfor which Federal financial participation may be claimed as foster care and\nadoption assistance pursuant to title IV-E of the Social Security Act or aid to\nfamilies with dependent children (AFDC) or other expenditures for which such\nparticipation is available if they could have been so claimed when originally\nsubmitted, provided that the revised claim is timely and that an adjustment\nmade to reduce the original claim is simultaneously submitted to the\ndepartment. (c) Any claims for\nreimbursement made from a program or activity for which there is Federal\nparticipation which were not reimbursed and which were properly made at the\ntime they were submitted to the department may be claimed as if Federal\nparticipation was not available if the claims were appropriate at the time they\nwere originally submitted, provided that the revised claim is timely and that\nan adjustment is simultaneously submitted to the department to reduce the\noriginal claim.
