  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 7000.4 - Use in subsequent proceedings of letter of dismissal and caution or letter of caution\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A letter of dismissal and caution\nissued in lieu of a formal written complaint may be used in subsequent\nproceedings as follows: (1)\n\nThe fact that a judge had received a letter of dismissal and caution may not be\nused to establish the misconduct alleged in a subsequent proceeding. However, the underlying conduct described in the letter of dismissal and caution may be\ncharged in a subsequent formal written complaint, and evidence in support\nthereof may be presented at the hearing. (2)\n\nWhere the underlying conduct\ndescribed in the letter of dismissal and caution is charged in a subsequent\nformal written complaint, a judge may be questioned with respect to receipt of\nthe prior letter of dismissal and caution, and upon a finding by the commission\nof a judge's misconduct with respect to the facts underlying the letter of\ndismissal and caution, such letter of dismissal and caution may be considered\nby the commission in determining the sanction to be imposed. (b) As to any prior\nletter of dismissal and caution or letter of caution to the respondent judge\nthat is not already in the record of a proceeding commenced by the filing of a\nformal written complaint, the administrator and respondent may address such\nletter in their briefs to the commission and at oral argument before the\ncommission, for purposes of sanction only. Any prior letter used in such a\nmanner would become part of the record of the present proceeding. If the\nrespondent and the administrator do not address such letter in their briefs to\nthe commission or at oral argument, the commission may consider such letter\nonly with regard to sanction and only if the respondent and the administrator\nhad been given an opportunity to address it. Any prior letter used in such\nfashion would become part of the record of the present proceeding if the\ncommission relied on it in determining sanction. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
