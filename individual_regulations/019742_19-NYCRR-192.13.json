  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 192.13 - Forty-five day guarantee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nregistrant may make a guarantee which grants rights to the consumer in addition\nto those contained in General Business Law, section 798(12). (b) In a rental of a hearing aid or sale\nthereof under an installment contact or other non-sale transaction covered\nunder General Business Law, section 789(11), the cancellation fee shall be\nmeasured by the charge the registrant would make for a similar hearing aid and\naccessories sold outright to a customer. The cancellation fee shall be payable\nout of such sum the customer may have paid on account of the rental or purchase\nprice and any security the customer may have deposited with the registrant. If\nthe amount paid or deposited is insufficient to pay for the cancellation fee\nthe registrant may be entitled to, the customer shall be required to pay the\ndifference due in order to effect cancellation of the agreement. If such\npayments exceed the amount so due, the registrant shall return the difference\nto the customer forthwith. (c) A\ncontract of sale or rental may be utilized as the receipt and contain any\nguarantee. (d) The registrant shall\ndeliver to the purchaser a written statement setting forth the amount returned\nto the purchaser. (e) A registrant\nmay refuse to accept the return of a hearing aid within the 45-day guarantee\nperiod if the wear and tear on the hearing aid exceeds that which is\nreasonable. A registrant may not refuse to accept the return of a hearing aid\nfor such reason unless the registrant provides a written statement to the\ncustomer which shall specifically describe the condition of the hearing aid\nupon which the registrant bases such refusal. A copy of such statement shall be\nplaced in the customer's file. Within the 45-day guarantee period a registrant\nmay not demand or receive from a customer the payment of any special or\nadditional fee or charge for accepting the return of a hearing aid on the\nground that the registrant has the right to refuse to accept the return by\nreason of unreasonable wear and tear on the instrument.
