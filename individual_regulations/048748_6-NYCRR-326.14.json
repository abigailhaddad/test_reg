  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 326.14 - General requirements for pesticide product registration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every pesticide\nproduct which is used, distributed, sold, or offered for sale within this State\nor delivered for transportation or transported in intrastate commerce or\nbetween points within this State through any point outside this State shall\nfirst be registered with the commissioner, except a pesticide product in the\npossession of any carrier while lawfully engaged in transporting a pesticide\nwithin the State, if such carrier shall upon request by the department, permit\nthe commissioner or his/her designated agent to copy all records showing the\ntransactions in and movement of the pesticide product. (b) Prior to the use, distribution, sale, offer for sale within this State or delivery for transportation or\ntransportation in intrastate commerce or between points within this State\nthrough any point outside this State of any pesticide product whose use is\nauthorized by an experimental use permit (EUP) issued by the EPA or required to\nbe issued by EPA, such experimental pesticide product must be registered by the\ndepartment. Such registration is required whether the product is sold or given\nfree to cooperators. (c) Anyone may\nfile an application for registration with the department with the concurrence\nof the Federal registrant. (d) A\nnon-refundable application fee as provided in Environmental Conservation Law\n(ECL), section 33-0705 must accompany every pesticide product registration\napplication package. (e) Registrants or applicants for registration must notify the department of any\namended registration for pesticide products registered by the department or for\nwhich an application is pending with the department. Major changes in labeling\nrequire a new registration as further described in sections 326.15 and\n326.17\nof this Part. Minor\nregistration amendments must be filed with the department as further described\nin section\n326.18\nof this Part. Except as\ndescribed in section\n326.19\nof this Part, all amended\nlabeling must be accepted by the department as an amendment to the registration\nof the product before the pesticide product can be used, distributed, sold, offered for sale within this State, or delivered for transportation or\ntransported in intrastate commerce or between points within this State through\nany point outside this State. (f) Registrants of any pesticide product registered with the department, or\napplicants for pesticide product registration must file any factual information\nregarding unreasonable adverse effects of the pesticide product or any of its\ningredients with the department within 30 days after the registrant, or\napplicant, first possesses or knows of reportable information. This requirement\napplies to all information required to be filed with USEPA under 40 CFR part\n159\n(effective June 16, 1998) as incorporated by reference in Part 320 of this\n\nTitle. Information filed with USEPA prior to the effective date of this Part is\nnot routinely required to be submitted. However, the commissioner may request, on an individual basis, reports submitted to EPA prior to the effective date of\nthis Part. A summary of the information may be submitted in a form prescribed\nby the commissioner. The commissioner may request complete information, on an\nindividual basis, for any report. (g) Pesticide registration applicants or\nregistrants of pesticide products registered in New York State who hold Federal\nregistrations that are conditional may be required to submit to the department\nat the time of the submission to EPA, all information required by EPA as a\ncondition of that registration. (h) In addition to the information required to be submitted immediately to the\ndepartment under subdivision (g) of this section, the department may request at\nany time, information deemed necessary to support the continued registration of\nany pesticide product. Examples of such information include but are not limited\nto: product effectiveness data, indoor air residues, and surface\nresidues. (i) Product registrations\nare not transferable. If a product changes ownership, the new owner must file a\nnew registration application and new registration fees. Change in ownership is\nnot an amended registration. Change in company name, not involving a change of\nownership, does not require a new registration or fees, but will be treated as\nan amended registration. Changes in stock ownership of a corporation owning a\nproduct do not constitute a change in ownership of the product. (j) If a pesticide product is being phased\nout and a new pesticide product with the same brand name will be marketed\nsimultaneously, both pesticide products must be registered for as long as the\npesticide products remain in the channels of trade. This includes the\ncircumstance where two pesticide products have the same brand name with\ndifferent EA registration numbers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
