  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 58-2.17 - Laboratory tests to be performed prior to allogeneic or autogeneic transfusion\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tests shall be performed to determine the ABO and Rho (D) groups of each recipient in accordance with procedures approved by the department pursuant to this Subpart. ABO grouping tests shall include both forward and reverse grouping, except that reverse grouping is not required for infants under four months of age. Prior to transfusion, the ABO group of all units of whole blood and red blood cell components, as well as the Rh group of all such units labeled as Rh-negative, shall be confirmed using a sample obtained from an attached segment. Any discrepancies shall be reported in writing to the collecting facility and resolved prior to issuance of the blood for transfusion purposes. (b) Serum or plasma from each recipient or, in the case of an infant under four months of age, the infant's mother, shall be tested for unexpected alloantibodies using reagent red blood cells that meet F.D.A. standards, are intended for this purpose and are not pooled. Methods of testing for unexpected alloantibodies shall demonstrate sensitizing and hemolytic antibodies. (c) Except in cases necessitating emergency release of group-compatible blood, or in the case of transfusion of a volume of blood or blood components exceeding the recipient's expected normal blood volume in a 24-hour period, compatibility between recipient and donor blood shall be determined. If a clinically significant antibody has been detected, or if there is a history of presence of such an antibody, compatibility testing shall include an antiglobulin phase crossmatch. If no clinically significant antibody has been detected, and there is no known history of presence of such an antibody, the crossmatching procedure to be used may be determined by the director of transfusion services, but shall, at minimum, consist of an immediate spin test or use of a validated computer system, except that crossmatching is not required for infants under four months of age. (d) In the case of patients requiring repeated blood transfusions, or those pregnant or transfused with allogeneic red blood cell-containing components within the previous three months, fresh blood specimens shall be drawn for compatibility testing and antibody screening at intervals of not more than three days prior to the day of transfusion, except for neonates, to whom no time limits apply. (e) A pre-transfusion sample of recipient blood, including serum or plasma, shall be retained for seven days after each transfusion for further testing in the event of an adverse reaction.
