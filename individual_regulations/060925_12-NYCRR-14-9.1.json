  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.1 - Tube ends of fire-tube boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Figure 14-9.1 illustrates some of the\nacceptable types of tube attachments. Such connections shall be: (1)\nexpanded and beaded as in sketches (a), (b), and (d); (2)\nexpanded and\nbeaded and seal welded as in sketch (c); (3)\nexpanded and seal welded as in sketch\n(e); (4)\nwelded, as in sketches (f)\nand (g). Tube ends attached by expanding and welding are subject\nto the following provisions: Where no bevel or recess is employed, the tube shall\nextend beyond the tubesheet not less than a distance equal to the tube\nthickness or 1/8 inch, whichever is the greater, nor more than twice the tube\nthickness of 1/4 inch, whichever is the lesser (see sketch [e]). (b) The tubesheet hole\nmay be beveled or recessed, the depth of any bevel or recess shall not be less\nthan the tube thickness or 1/8 inch, whichever is greater, nor more than\none-third of the tubesheet thickness, except that when tube thicknesses are\nequal to or greater than 0.150 inch, the bevel or recess may exceed T/3. Where\nthe hole is beveled or recessed, the projection of the tube beyond the\ntubesheet shall not exceed a distance equal to the tube wall thickness, see\n\nFigure 14-9.1, sketches (f) and (g). (c) On types of welded attachment shown in\nsketches (c) and (e), the tubes shall be expanded before and after welding. On\ntypes shown in sketches (f) and (g), the tubes may be expanded. (d) Expanding of tubes by the Prosser method\nmay be employed in combination with any beaded or seal welded attachment method\n(see sketch [b]). (e) After seal\nwelding as shown by sketches (c) and (e), a single hydrostatic test of the\nboiler shall suffice. (f) The inner\nsurface of the tube hole in any form of attachment may be grooved or\nchamfered. (g) The sharp edges of\ntube holes shall be taken off on both sides of the plate with a file or other\ntool. Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
