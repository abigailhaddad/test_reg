No person shall be qualified to receive or hold\nan occupational license if he or she is not a bona fide participant in harness\nracing. A renewal license for owner, trainer, assistant\ntrainer, driver, racing official, mutuel employee, veterinarian, veterinary\ntechnician, farrier, track management or track security employee shall be for\nthree years unless an individual establishes good cause for a shorter term or\nthe commission, in the commission's discretion, determines a shorter\nterm. (e) An application for\nan occupational license shall be made upon a form supplied by the commission\nand shall be executed in the manner prescribed by the commission. The\ncommission may issue instructions as to the preparation and execution of\napplications for occupational licenses, which instructions may be a part of or\nseparate from the application form. Failure to comply with any such\ninstructions shall be grounds for denial, suspension or revocation of an\noccupational license. When so instructed by the commission, the applicant shall\nfile with the application fingerprints and photographs in requisite number. The\nfingerprints so obtained shall be transmitted by the commission to the New York\n\nState Identification and Intelligence System, the Federal Bureau of\n\nInvestigation Identification Division, and any other government agency of any\nstate or country selected by the commission, for the purpose of establishing\nidentity and previous criminal record, if any, of the applicant.

In addition to the statutory license\nfees for owners, trainers, assistant trainers, drivers, farriers and stable\nemployees set forth in Racing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law section\n309(1), license fees to be paid shall be as follows: (1)\nveterinarian, track\nmanagement-$20; (2)\ncleaning and\nfood service workers-$5; and\n(3)\nall\nothers-$10. Such fees shall be multiplied by two for two-year terms\nand by three for three-year terms.

In this regard the commission\nmay require a participant to produce any evidence and information it deems\nnecessary. (i) It shall be the\nresponsibility of the trainer to determine that every person employed by such\ntrainer at a licensed track and every assistant trainer, groom clerk, assistant\nor other person working regularly in such trainer's stable at a licensed track\nis licensed by the commission. It shall be the responsibility of the trainer to\nrefuse to represent any participant at a licensed track under circumstances in\nwhich the trainer, by the exercise of reasonable discretion, has reason to\nbelieve that said participant has not been licensed by the commission and to\nreport said circumstances to the track steward.

Failure to furnish such records and information if available, and if not\navailable to cooperate with and assist the commission in obtaining such records\nand information, shall be grounds for denial, suspension, or revocation or fine\nby the commission. (l) Before the\ncommission issues or reinstates an occupational license it may require as a\ncondition for issuing or reinstating such license that the person involved\nproduce proof: (1)\nthat if he or she is to be\nemployed, that his or her proposed employer intends to so employ him or her\nupon issuance or reinstatement of the license; or\n(2)\nthat if he or she is to otherwise engage\nin harness racing that he or she is able, financially or otherwise, to so\nparticipate upon licensing.
