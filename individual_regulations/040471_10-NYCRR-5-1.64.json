(b) If a system exceeds the operational evaluation level, it shall conduct an operational evaluation and submit a written report of the evaluation to the State no later than 90 days after being notified of the analytical result that caused the exceedance of the operational evaluation level. The written report shall be made available to the public upon request. (c) The operational evaluation shall include an examination of the operational practices for system treatment(s) and the distribution system, including storage tank operations, excess storage capacity, distribution system flushing, changes in sources or source water quality, and treatment changes or problems that may contribute to TTHM and HAA5 formation and what steps could be considered to minimize future exceedances.
