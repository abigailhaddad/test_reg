  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-5.1 - Statutory provision\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n96\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law states that no administrative expenses of an authority shall\nbe paid from any State loan or subsidy or from the rental income of any State\nproject. It follows that items of expenses of an authority deemed to be\nadministrative expenses are ineligible to be charged to development costs or\noperating expenses of a State-aided project. The division will determine which\nitems of expense constitute administrative expense of an authority. In such\ndetermination, a direct connection with the planning, construction, or\nmanagement of a State-aided project will be an important, but not conclusive\nfactor. In the absence of explicit rulings with respect to a given expense, an\nauthority should consult with the division and secure a ruling before incurring\nthat expense. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-5.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
