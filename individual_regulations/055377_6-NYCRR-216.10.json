Tit. 6 § 216.10 - Exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A source owner\nrequired to install the blast furnace emission reduction equipment specified in\nsection\n216.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart, may be exempted from such equipment requirements upon the acceptance by\nthe commissioner of an alternative emission reduction plan submitted by the\nsource owner. The plan shall become effective upon approval by the\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. For such a plan to be acceptable to the\ncommissioner, the following requirements must be met: (1)\na complete plant-wide particulate\nemission inventory for both traditional and nontraditional sources must be\nincluded in the alternative emission reduction plan; (2)\nthe alternative emissions reduction plan\nmust include air quality dispersion modeling results which show attainment of\nair quality standards off-plant property when the plant-wide emissions\ninventory required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision is modeled in place of\nthe plan's emission inventory in the State implementation plan; (3)\nthe emission reductions in the\nalternative emission reduction plan must be permanent; and\n(4)\nthe alternative emission reduction plan\nmust be included in a legally binding agreement which allows future State and\n\nFederal enforcement of the credited emission reductions. (b) Source owners subject to the opacity\nrequirements of section\n216.4\nof this Part may apply for\nand be granted an equivalent opacity which will replace the opacity listed in\n\nTable 2 of this Part for that source, if either of the following conditions are\nmet: (1)\nif the source owner can demonstrate\nthrough acceptable tests for any confined source that the source is in\ncompliance with all applicable emission requirements other than the opacity\nstandard and that the source and any associated emission controls are being\noperated and maintained in a manner acceptable to the commissioner; or\n(2)\nthe source owner has\nobtained approval of an alternative emission reduction plan under subdivision\n(a) of this section, which covers the source for which equivalent opacity is\ndesired. (c) For sources, other than blast furnaces equipped with emission shrouding and suppression\nsystems, that are not subject to the mass emission limits shown in Table 1 of\nthis Part, source owners may apply to the commissioner for an opacity standard\nfor that source. The assigned opacity standard shall be based on operation of\nthe source in a manner to minimize the generation of visible emissions\nconsistent with normal operating practices.
