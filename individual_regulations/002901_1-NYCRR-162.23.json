  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.23 - Parsnip standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality parsnips shall be washed parsnips of\nsimilar varietal characteristics which are well trimmed, fairly well formed, provided 50 percent of the lot is well formed, fairly smooth, clean, firm, free\nfrom woodiness, soft rot or wet breakdown, and from damage caused by\ndiscoloration, bruises, cuts, rodents, growth cracks, pithiness, disease, insects, mechanical or other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal characteristics means\nthat the parsnips in any lot are of the same general type. (2)\n\nWell trimmed means that the tops shall be\ncut back to within 3/4 inch from the crown of the parsnips; except that\noccasional uncut leaves or leaf stems or new top growth exceeding this length\nwhich does not materially damage the appearance of the lot shall be\npermitted. (3)\n\nWell formed means\nthat the individual parsnip is not forked, or misshapen to the extent that the\nappearance is more than slightly affected. (4)\n\nFairly well formed means that the parsnip\nis not turnip shaped or so forked or misshapen as to materially affect its\nappearance or cause a loss of more than five percent, by weight, in the\nordinary preparation for use. (5)\n\nClean means that individual parsnips are practically free from dirt, stain, or\nother foreign matter, and that the general appearance of the parsnips in the\nlot is not more than slightly affected by these causes. (6)\n\nFirm means that the parsnip is not soft, flabby, or shriveled. (7)\n\nDamage\nmeans any defect, or any combination of defects, which materially detracts from\nthe appearance, or the edible or marketing quality of the individual parsnip, or the parsnips in the lot; or which causes a loss of more than five percent, by weight, of the parsnip in the ordinary preparation for use. (8)\n\nBadly misshapen means that the parsnip is\nso badly crooked, twisted, forked, or otherwise so misshapen as to seriously\naffect its appearance or cause a loss of more than 10 percent, by weight, of\nthe parsnip in the ordinary preparation for use. (9)\n\nSerious damage means any defect, or any\ncombination of defects, which seriously detracts from the appearance, or the\nedible or marketing quality of the individual parsnip or the parsnips in the\nlot; or which causes a loss of more than 10 percent, by weight, of the parsnip\nin the ordinary preparation for use. (10)\n\nDiameter means the greatest dimension of\nthe parsnip measured at right angles to the longitudinal axis. (c) Size. Unless otherwise\nspecified, the diameter of each parsnip shall be not less than 7/8 inch. The\nmaximum diameter of the parsnips in any lot may be specified in terms of inches\nand quarter inches, in accordance with the facts. (d) Tolerances. In order to allow for\nvariations incident to proper grading and handling, the following tolerances by\ncount are provided as specified: (1)\n\nFor\ndefects. Ten percent for parsnips in any lot which fail to meet the\nrequirements, provided that not more than one-half of this amount, or five\npercent, shall be allowed for defects causing serious damage including therein\nnot more than one percent for parsnips affected by soft rot. (2)\n\nFor size. Three percent for parsnips in\nany lot which fail to meet the specified minimum diameter and 10 percent for\nparsnips which fail to meet any specified maximum diameter. (e) Application of tolerances. Individual samples shall not have more than double the tolerance specified, provided that not more that one parsnip which is frozen or affected by soft rot\nmay be permitted in any package weighing approximately three pounds or less; and provided further, that the averages of the entire lot are within the\ntolerances specified for the grade. Individual samples may not contain less\nthan 40 percent well formed. (f) Sample for grade determination. Each sample shall consist of 50 parsnips. When\nindividual packages contain at least 50 parsnips, the sample is drawn from one\npackage; when individual packages contain less than 50 parsnips, a sufficient\nnumber of adjoining packages are opened to form a 50 parsnip sample. (g) Packing. Parsnips must be packed in new\n1/4 or 1/2 bushel crates or cartons, one bushel or 1 1/9 bushel cartons, 25\npound sacks, master containers containing 12-one pound film bags or other new\nstandard containers subject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets. Container approval shall be based upon the ability of the container to\nmaintain the quality standards and integrity of the product. (h) Markings. Each package or display of\nparsnips shall be plainly labeled with the official Seal of Quality\ndesignation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
