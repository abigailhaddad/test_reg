  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.19 - Special provisions for cleanup\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability of corrective action\nmanagement unit (CAMU) regulations. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, CAMUs are subject to the requirements of subdivision (c) of\nthis section. (2)\nCAMUs that were\napproved before April 22, 2002, or for which substantially complete\napplications (or equivalents) were submitted to the department on or before\n\nNovember 20, 2000, are subject to the requirements in subdivision (b) of this\nsection for grandfathered CAMUs; CAMU waste, activities, and design will not be\nsubject to the standards in subdivision (c) of this section, so long as the\nwaste, activities, and design remain within the general scope of the CAMU as\napproved. (b) Grandfathered corrective action management units (CAMUs). (1)\n\nTo implement remedies under section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, ECL 71-2727(3), or RCRA section 3008(h), or to implement remedies at a\npermitted facility that is not subject to section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, the department may designate an area at the facility as a corrective\naction management unit, under the requirements of this subdivision. Corrective action management unit\nmeans an area within a\nfacility that is used only for managing remediation wastes for implementing\ncorrective action or cleanup at the facility. A CAMU must be located within the\ncontiguous property under the control of the owner or operator where the wastes\nto be managed in the CAMU originated. One or more CAMU's may be designated at a\nfacility. (i) Placement of remediation wastes\ninto or within a CAMU does not constitute land disposal of hazardous\nwastes. (ii)\n\nConsolidation or\nplacement of remediation wastes into or within a CAMU does not constitute\ncreation of a unit subject to minimum technology\nrequirements. (2)\n(i) The department may designate a regulated\nunit (as defined in section\n373-2.6\n[a][1][ii]\nof this Subpart) as a CAMU, or may incorporate a regulated unit into a CAMU, if: (a) the regulated unit is closed or\nclosing, meaning it has begun the closure process under section\n373-2.7\n(d) or\n373-3.7\n(d) of this\n\nPart; and\n(b) inclusion of the\nregulated unit will enhance implementation of effective, protective and\nreliable remedial actions for the facility. (ii)\n\nThe section\n373-2.6, 373-2.7, 373-2.8, 373-3.6, 373-3.7, and\n373-3.8\nrequirements and the\nunit-specific requirements of this Subpart or Subpart 373-3 of this Title that\napplied to that regulated unit will continue to apply to that portion of the\nCAMU after incorporation into the CAMU. (3)\n\nThe department shall designate a CAMU in\naccordance with the following: (i) the CAMU\nshall facilitate the implementation of reliable, effective, protective, and\ncost-effective remedies; (ii)\nwaste\nmanagement activities associated with the CAMU shall not create unacceptable\nrisks to humans or to the environment resulting from exposure to hazardous\nwastes or hazardous constituents; (iii)\nthe CAMU shall include uncontaminated\nareas of the facility, only if including such areas for the purpose of managing\nremediation waste is more protective than management of such wastes at\ncontaminated areas of the facility; (iv)\nareas within the CAMU, where wastes\nremain in place after closure of the CAMU, shall be managed and contained so as\nto minimize future releases, to the extent practicable; (v) the CAMU shall expedite the timing of\nremedial activity implementation, when appropriate and practicable; (vi)\nthe CAMU shall enable the use, when\nappropriate, of treatment technologies (including innovative technologies) to\nenhance the long-term effectiveness of remedial actions by reducing the\ntoxicity, mobility, or volume of wastes that will remain in place after closure\nof the CAMU; and\n(vii)\nthe CAMU\nshall, to the extent practicable, minimize the land area of the facility upon\nwhich wastes will remain in place after closure of the CAMU. (4)\n\nThe owner /operator shall\nprovide sufficient information to enable the department to designate a CAMU in\naccordance with the criteria in subdivision (a) of this section. (5)\n\nThe department shall specify, in the\npermit or order, requirements for CAMU's to include the following: (i) The areal configuration of the\nCAMU. (ii)\n\nRequirements for\nremediation waste management to include the specification of applicable design, operation and closure requirements. (iii)\n\nRequirements for ground water\nmonitoring that are sufficient to: (a) continue to detect and to characterize the nature, extent, concentration, direction, and movement of existing releases of hazardous constituents in\nground water from sources located within the CAMU; and\n(b) Detect and subsequently characterize\nreleases of hazardous constituents to ground water that may occur from areas of\nthe CAMU in which wastes will remain in place after closure of the\nCAMU. (iv)\n\nClosure and\npost-closure requirements. (a) Closure of\ncorrective action management units shall: (1)\nminimize the need for further maintenance; and\n(2)\ncontrol, minimize, or eliminate, to the\nextent necessary to protect human health and the environment, for areas where\nwastes remain in place, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, hazardous\nconstituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, of hazardous waste decomposition\nproducts to the ground, to surface waters, or to the atmosphere. (b) Requirements for closure of\nCAMUs shall include the following, as appropriate and as deemed necessary by\nthe department for a given CAMU: (1)\nrequirements for excavation, removal, treatment or containment of\nwastes; (2)\nfor areas in which\nwastes will remain after closure of the CAMU, requirements for capping of such\nareas; and\n(3)\nrequirements for\nremoval and decontamination of equipment, devices, and structures used in\nremediation waste management activities within the CAMU. (c) In establishing specific closure\nrequirements for CAMUs under paragraph (a)(5) of this section, the department\nshall consider the following factors: (1)\nCAMU characteristics; (2)\nvolume of\nwastes which remain in place after closure; (3)\npotential for releases from the\nCAMU; (4)\nphysical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the waste; (5)\nhydrological and other relevant environmental conditions at the facility which\nmay influence the migration of any potential or actual releases; and\n(6)\npotential for exposure of humans and\nenvironmental receptors if releases from the CAMU were to occur. (d) Post-closure requirements as\nnecessary to protect human health and the environment, to include, for areas\nwhere wastes will remain in place, monitoring and maintenance activities, and\nthe frequency with which such activities shall be performed to ensure the\nintegrity of any cap, final cover, or other containment system. (6)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall document the rationale for designating CAMUs and shall make\nsuch documentation available to the public. (7)\n\nIncorporation of a CAMU into an existing\npermit must be approved by the department according to the procedures for\ndepartment-initiated modifications under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart, or according to the permit modification procedures of section\n373-1.7\nof this Part. (8)\n\nThe designation of a CAMU does not change\nthe department's existing authority to address clean-up levels, media-specific\npoints of compliance to be applied to remediation at a facility, or other\nremedy selection decisions. (c) Corrective action management units\n(CAMU). (1)\n\nTo implement remedies under\nsection\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, ECL 71-2727(3), or RCRA section 3008(h), or to implement remedies at a\npermitted facility that is not subject to section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, the department may designate an area at the facility as a corrective\naction management unit under the requirements in this subdivision. Corrective action management unit\nmeans an area within a\nfacility that is used only for managing CAMU-eligible wastes for implementing\ncorrective action or cleanup at the facility. A CAMU must be located within the\ncontiguous property under the control of the owner or operator where the wastes\nto be managed in the CAMU originated. One or more CAMUs may be designated at a\nfacility. (i) CAMU-eligible\nwaste\nmeans: (a) all solid and\nhazardous wastes, and all media (including ground water, surface water, soils, and sediments) and debris, that are managed for implementing cleanup. As-generated wastes (either hazardous or non-hazardous) from ongoing industrial\noperations at a site are not CAMU-eligible wastes; (b) wastes that would otherwise meet the\ndescription in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph are not\n\"CAMU-eligible wastes\" where: (1)\nthe wastes\nare hazardous wastes found during cleanup in intact or substantially intact\ncontainers, tanks, or other non-land-based units found above ground, unless the\nwastes are first placed in the tanks, containers or non-land-based units as\npart of cleanup, or the containers or tanks are excavated during the course of\ncleanup; or\n(2)\nthe department\nexercises the discretion in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph to prohibit the\nwastes from management in a CAMU; (c) notwithstanding clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph, where appropriate, as-generated\nnon-hazardous waste maybe placed in a CAMU where such waste is being used to\nfacilitate treatment or the performance of the CAMU. (ii)\n\nThe department may prohibit, where\nappropriate, the placement of waste in a CAMU where the department has or\nreceives information that such wastes have not been managed in compliance with\napplicable land disposal treatment standards of Part 376 of this Title, or\napplicable unit design requirements of this Subpart, or applicable unit design\nrequirements of Subpart 373-3 of this Part, or that non-compliance with other\napplicable requirements of this Title likely contributed to the release of the\nwaste. (iii)\n\nProhibition against\nplacing liquids in CAMUs. (a) The placement of\nbulk or noncontainerized liquid hazardous waste or free liquids contained in\nhazardous waste (whether or not sorbents have been added) in any CAMU is\nprohibited except where placement of such wastes facilitates the remedy\nselected for the waste. (b) The\nrequirements in section\n373-2.14\n(j)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart for placement of containers holding free liquids in landfills\napply to placement in a CAMU except where placement facilitates the remedy\nselected for the waste. (c) The\nplacement of any liquid which is not a hazardous waste in a CAMU is prohibited\nunless such placement facilitates the remedy selected for the waste. (d) The absence or presence of free liquids\nin either a containerized or a bulk waste must be determined in accordance with\nsection\n373-2.14\n(j)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart. Sorbents used to treat free liquids in CAMUs must meet the\nrequirements of section\n373-2.14\n(j)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart. (iv)\n\nPlacement of CAMU-eligible wastes into or within, a CAMU does not constitute\nland disposal of hazardous wastes. (v) Consolidation or placement of\nCAMU-eligible wastes into or within a CAMU does not constitute creation of a\nunit subject to minimum technology requirements. (2)\n(i) The\ndepartment may designate a regulated unit (as defined in section\n373-2.6\n[a][1][ii]\nof this Subpart) as a CAMU, or may incorporate a regulated unit into a CAMU. if: (a) the regulated unit is closed or\nclosing, meaning it has begun the closure process under section\n373-2.7\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart or section\n373-3.7\n(d) of this\n\nPart; and\n(b) inclusion of the\nregulated unit will enhance implementation of effective, protective and\nreliable remedial actions for the facility. (ii)\n\nThe section\n373-2.6, 373-2.7, 373-2.8, 373-3.6, 373-3.7, and\n373-3.8\nrequirements and the\nunit-specific requirements of this Subpart or Subpart 373-3 of this Part that\napplied to the regulated unit will continue to apply to that portion of the\nCAMU after incorporation into the CAMU. (3)\n\nThe department shall designate a CAMU\nthat will be used for storage and/or treatment only in accordance with\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision. The department shall designate all other\nCAMUs in accordance with the following: (i) the CAMU shall facilitate the implementation of reliable, effective, protective, and cost-effective remedies; (ii)\nwaste management activities associated\nwith the CAMU shall not create unacceptable risks to humans or to the\nenvironment resulting from exposure to hazardous wastes or hazardous\nconstituents; (iii)\nthe CAMU shall\ninclude uncontaminated areas of the facility, only if including such areas for\nthe purpose of managing CAMU-eligible waste is more protective than management\nof such wastes at contaminated areas of the facility; (iv)\nareas within the CAMU, where wastes\nremain in place after closure of the CAMU. shall be managed and contained so as\nto minimize future releases, to the extent practicable; (v) the CAMU shall expedite the timing of\nremedial activity implementation, when appropriate and practicable; (vi)\nthe CAMU shall enable the use, when\nappropriate, of treatment technologies (including innovative technologies) to\nenhance the long-term effectiveness of remedial actions by reducing the\ntoxicity, mobility, or volume of wastes that will remain in place after closure\nof the CAMU; and\n(vii)\nthe CAMU\nshall, to the extent practicable, minimize the land area of the facility upon\nwhich wastes will remain in place after closure of the CAMU. (4)\n\nThe owner/operator shall\nprovide sufficient information to enable the department to designate a CAMU in\naccordance with the criteria in this subdivision. This must include, unless not\nreasonably available, information on: (i) the\norigin of the waste and how it was subsequently managed (including a\ndescription of the timing and circumstances surrounding the disposal and/or\nrelease); (ii)\nwhether the waste\nwas listed or identified as hazardous at the time of disposal and/or release; and\n(iii)\nwhether the disposal\nand/or release of the waste occurred before or after the land disposal\nrequirements of Part 376 of this Title were in effect for the waste listing or\ncharacteristic. (5)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall specify, in the permit or order, requirements for CAMUs to\ninclude the following: (i) the areal\nconfiguration of the CAMU; (ii)\nexcept as provided in paragraph (7) of this subdivision, requirements for\nCAMU-eligible waste management to include the specification of applicable\ndesign, operation, treatment and closure requirements; and\n(iii)\nminimum design requirements: CAMUs, except as provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, into which wastes are\nplaced must be designed in accordance with the following: (a) Unless the department approves alternate\nrequirements under clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, CAMUs that\nconsist of new, replacement, or laterally expanded units must include a\ncomposite liner and a leachate collection system that is designed and\nconstructed to maintain less than a 30-cm depth of leachate over the liner. For\npurposes of this section, composite liner\nmeans a system\nconsisting of two components; the upper component must consist of a minimum\n30-mil flexible membrane liner (FML), and the lower component must consist of\nat least a two-foot layer of compacted soil with a hydraulic conductivity of no\nmore than 1x10-7 cm/sec. FML components consisting of high density polyethylene\n(HDPE) must be at least 60 mil thick. The FML component must be installed in\ndirect and uniform contact with the compacted soil component. (b) Alternate requirements. The department\nmay approve alternate requirements if: (1)\nthe department finds that alternate design and operating practices, together\nwith location characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous\nconstituents into the ground water or surface water at least as effectively as\nthe liner and leachate collection systems in clause (\na\n) of\nthis subparagraph; or\n(2)\nthe CAMU\nis to be established in an area with existing significant levels of\ncontamination, and the department finds that an alternative design, including a\ndesign that does not include a liner, would prevent migration from the unit\nthat would exceed long-term remedial goals. (iv)\n\nMinimum treatment requirements. Unless\nthe wastes will be placed in a CAMU for storage and/or treatment only in\naccordance with paragraph (6) of this subdivision, CAMU-eligible wastes that, absent this section, would be subject to the treatment requirements of Part 376\nof this Title, and that the department determines contain principal hazardous\nconstituents must be treated to the standards specified in clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph. (a) Principal hazardous constituents are\nthose constituents that the department determines pose a risk to human health\nand the environment substantially higher than the cleanup levels or goals at\nthe site. (1)\n\nIn general, the department will\ndesignate as principal hazardous constituents: (i) carcinogens that pose a potential direct\nrisk from ingestion or inhalation at the site at or above\n10\n-3; and\n(ii)\nnon-carcinogens that pose a potential\ndirect risk from ingestion or inhalation at the site an order of magnitude or\ngreater over their reference dose. (2)\n\nThe department will also designate\nconstituents as principal hazardous constituents, where appropriate, when risks\nto human health and the environment posed by the potential migration of\nconstituents in wastes to ground water are substantially higher than cleanup\nlevels or goals at the site: when making such a designation, the department may\nconsider such factors as constituent concentrations, and fate and transport\ncharacteristics under site conditions. (3)\n\nThe department may also designate other\nconstituents as principal hazardous constituents that the department determines\npose a risk to human health and the environment substantially higher than the\ncleanup levels or goals at the site. (b) In determining which constituents are\n\"principal hazardous constituents,\" the department must consider all\nconstituents which, absent this section, would be subject to the treatment\nrequirements in Part 376 of this Title. (c) Waste that the department determines\ncontains principal hazardous constituents must meet treatment standards\ndetermined in accordance with clause (\nd\n) or\n(\ne\n) of this subparagraph. (d) Treatment standards for wastes placed in\nCAMUs. (1)\n\nFor non-metals, treatment must\nachieve 90 percent reduction in total principal hazardous constituent\nconcentrations, except as provided by subclause (\n3\n) of this\nclause. (2)\n\nFor metals, treatment\nmust achieve 90 percent reduction in principal hazardous constituent\nconcentrations as measured in leachate from the treated waste or media (tested\naccording to the TCLP) or 90 percent reduction in total constituent\nconcentrations (when a metal removal treatment technology is used), except as\nprovided by subclause (\n3\n) of this clause. (3)\n\nWhen treatment of any principal hazardous\nconstituent to a 90 percent reduction standard would result in a concentration\nless than 10 times the universal treatment standard for that constituent, treatment to achieve constituent concentrations less than 10 times the\nuniversal treatment standard is not required. Universal treatment standards are\nidentified in section\n376.4\n(j) Table UTS\nof this Title. (4)\n\nFor waste\nexhibiting the hazardous characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity or\nreactivity, the waste must also be treated to eliminate these\ncharacteristics. (5)\n\nFor debris, the debris must be treated in accordance with section\n376.4\n(g) of this\n\nTitle, or by methods or to levels established under subclauses\n(\n1\n) through (\n4\n) or clause\n(\ne\n) of this subparagraph, whichever the department determines\nis appropriate. (6)\n\nAlternatives to\nTCLP. For metal bearing wastes for which metals removal treatment is not used, the department may specify a leaching test other than the TCLP (SW-846 Method\n1311, as incorporated by reference in section 370.l[e] of this Title) to\nmeasure treatment effectiveness, provided the department determines that an\nalternative leach testing protocol is appropriate for use, and that the\nalternative more accurately reflects conditions at the site that affect\nleaching. (e) Adjusted\nstandards. The department may adjust the treatment level or method in clause\n(\nd\n) of this subparagraph to a higher or lower level, based on\none or more of the following factors, as appropriate. The adjusted level or\nmethod must be protective of human health and the environment: (1)\nthe technical impracticability of\ntreatment to the levels or by the methods in clause (\nd\n) of\nthis subparagraph; (2)\nthe levels\nor methods in clause (\nd\n) of this subparagraph would result in\nconcentrations of principal hazardous constituents (PHCs) that are\nsignificantly above or below cleanup standards applicable to the site\n(established either site-specifically, or promulgated under State or Federal\nlaw); (3)\nthe views of the affected\nlocal community on the treatment levels or methods in clause\n(\nd\n) of this subparagraph as applied at the site, and, for\ntreatment levels, the treatment methods necessary to achieve these\nlevels; (4)\nthe short-term risks\npresented by the on-site treatment method necessary to achieve the levels or\ntreatment methods in clause (\nd\n) of this\nsubparagraph; (5)\nthe long-term\nprotection offered by the engineering design of the CAMU and related\nengineering controls: (i) where the treatment\nstandards in clause (\nd\n) of this subparagraph are substantially\nmet and the principal hazardous constituents in the waste or residuals are of\nvery low mobility; (ii)\nwhere\ncost-effective treatment has been used and the CAMU meets the liner and\nleachate collection requirements for new land disposal units at section\n373-2.14\n(c)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Subpart; (iii)\nwhere, after review of appropriate\ntreatment technologies, the department determines that cost-effective treatment\nis not reasonably available, and the CAMU meets the liner and leachate\ncollection requirements for new land disposal units at section\n373-2.14\n(c)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Subpart; (iv)\nwhere cost-effective treatment has been\nused and the principal hazardous constituents in the treated wastes are of very\nlow mobility; or\n(v) where, after\nreview of appropriate treatment technologies, the department determines that\ncost-effective treatment is not reasonably available, the principal hazardous\nconstituents in the wastes are of very low mobility, and either the CAMU meets\nor exceeds the liner standards for new, replacement, or laterally expanded\nCAMUs in clause (iii)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this\nparagraph, or the CAMU provides substantially equivalent or greater\nprotection. (f) The treatment required by the treatment\nstandards must be completed prior to, or within a reasonable time after, placement in the CAMU. (g) For the\npurpose of determining whether wastes placed in CAMUs have met site-specific\ntreatment standards, the department may, as appropriate, specify a subset of\nthe principal hazardous constituents in the waste as analytical surrogates for\ndetermining whether treatment standards have been met for other principal\nhazardous constituents. This specification will be based on the degree of\ndifficulty of treatment and analysis of constituents with similar treatment\nproperties. (v) Except\nas provided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, requirements for ground water\nmonitoring and corrective action that are sufficient to: (a) continue to detect and to characterize\nthe nature, extent, concentration. direction, and movement of existing releases\nof hazardous constituents in ground water from sources located within the\nCAMU; (b) detect and subsequently\ncharacterize releases of hazardous constituents to ground water that may occur\nfrom areas of the CAMU in which wastes will remain in place after closure of\nthe CAMU; and\n(c) require\nnotification to the department and corrective action as necessary to protect\nhuman health and the environment for releases to ground water from the\nCAMU. (vi)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in paragraph (6) of this subdivision, closure and post-closure\nrequirements: (a) closure of corrective\naction management units shall: (1)\nminimize\nthe need for further maintenance; and\n(2)\ncontrol, minimize, or eliminate, to the\nextent necessary to protect human health and the environment, for areas where\nwastes remain in place, post-closure escape of hazardous wastes, hazardous\nconstituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, or hazardous waste decomposition\nproducts to the ground, to surface waters, or to the atmosphere; (b) requirements for closure of\nCAMUs shall include the following, as appropriate and as deemed necessary by\nthe department for a given CAMU: (1)\nrequirements for excavation, removal, treatment or containment of wastes; and\n(2)\nrequirements for removal\nand decontamination of equipment, devices, and structures used in CAMU-eligible\nwaste management activities within the CAMU; (c) in establishing specific closure\nrequirements for CAMUs under this paragraph, the department shall consider the\nfollowing factors: (1)\nCAMU\ncharacteristics; (2)\nvolume of\nwastes which remain in place after closure; (3)\npotential for releases from the\nCAMU; (4)\nphysical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the waste; (5)\nhydrogeological and other relevant environmental conditions at the facility\nwhich may influence the migration of any potential or actual releases; and\n(6)\npotential for exposure of\nhumans and environmental receptors if releases were to occur from the\nCAMU; (d) cap\nrequirements: (1)\nat final closure of the\nCAMU, for areas in which wastes will remain after closure of the CAMU, with\nconstituent concentrations at or above remedial levels or goals applicable to\nthe site, the owner or operator must cover the CAMU with a final cover designed\nand constructed to meet the following performance criteria, except as provided\nin subclause (\n2\n) of this clause: (i) provide long-term minimization of\nmigration of liquids through the closed unit; (ii)\nfunction with minimum\nmaintenance; (iii)\npromote drainage\nand minimize erosion or abrasion of the cover; (iv)\naccommodate settling and subsidence so\nthat the cover's integrity is maintained; and\n(v) have a permeability less than or equal to\nthe permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils\npresent. (2)\nthe\ndepartment may determine that modifications to subclause (\n1\n)\nof this clause are needed to facilitate treatment or the performance of the\nCAMU (\ne.g., to promote biodegradation); (e) post-closure requirements as necessary to\nprotect human health and the environment, to include, for areas where wastes\nwill remain in place, monitoring and maintenance activities, and the frequency\nwith which such activities shall be performed to ensure the integrity of any\ncap, final cover, or other containment system. (6)\nCAMUs used for storage and/or treatment\nonly are CAMUs in which wastes will not remain after closure. Such CAMUs must\nbe designated in accordance with all of the requirements of this section, except as follows: (i) CAMUs that are used\nfor storage and/or treatment only and that operate in accordance with the time\nlimits established in the staging pile regulations at clause\n(e)(4)(i)(\nc\n) of this section, and paragraphs (e)(8) and (9) of\nthis section are subject to the requirements for staging piles at clauses\n(e)(4)(i)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this section, subparagraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (e)(5) and (6) of this\nsection, and paragraphs (e)(10) and (11) of this section in lieu of the\nperformance standards and requirements for CAMUs in this subdivision at\nparagraph (3) and subparagraphs (5)(iii) through (vi) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\nCAMUs that are\nused for storage and/or treatment only and that do not operate in accordance\nwith the time limits established in the staging pile regulations at clause\n(e)(4)(i)(\nc\n) of this section, and paragraphs (e)(8) and (9) of\nthis section: (a) must operate in accordance\nwith a time limit, established by the Department, that is no longer than\nnecessary to achieve a timely remedy selected for the waste; and\n(b) are subject to the requirements for\nstaging piles at clauses (e)(4)(i)(\na\n) and (\nb\n)\nof this section, subparagraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section, paragraphs (e)(5) and\n(6) of this section, and paragraphs (e)(10) and (11) of this section in lieu of\nthe performance standards and requirements for CAMUs in this section at\nparagraph (3) and subparagraphs (5)(iv) and (vi) of this subdivision. (7)\nCAMUs into which\nwastes are placed where all wastes have constituent levels at or below remedial\nlevels or goals applicable to the site do not have to comply with the\nrequirements for liners at clause (5)(iii)(\na\n) of this\nsubdivision, caps at clause (5)(vi)(\nd\n) of this subdivision, ground water monitoring requirements at subparagraph (5)(v) of this subdivision\nor, for treatment and/or storage-only CAMUs, the design standards at paragraph\n(6) of this subdivision. (8)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall provide public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public\ncomment before designating a CAMU. Such notice shall include the rationale for\nany proposed adjustments under clause (5)(iv)(\ne\n) of this\nsubdivision to the treatment standards in subparagraph (5)(iv) of this\nsubdivision. (9)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany other provision of this section, the department may impose additional\nrequirements as necessary to protect human health and the\nenvironment. (10)\n\nIncorporation of\na CAMU into an existing permit must be approved by the department according to\nthe procedures for department-initiated permit modifications under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart and section\n621.14\nof this Title or according\nto the permit modification procedures of section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart and section\n621.13\nof this Title. (11)\n\nThe designation of a CAMU does not\nchange the department's existing authority to address clean-up levels, media-specific points of compliance to be applied to remediation at a facility, or other remedy selection decisions. (d) Temporary units (TU). (1)\n\nFor temporary tanks and container storage\nareas used to treat or store hazardous remediation wastes during remedial\nactivities required under section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, ECL 71-2727(3), or RCRA section 3008(h), or at a permitted facility\nthat is not subject to section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart, the department may designate a unit at the facility, as a temporary\nunit. A temporary unit must be located within the contiguous property under the\ncontrol of the owner/operator where the wastes to be managed in the temporary\nunit originated. For temporary units, the department may replace the design, operating, or closure standard applicable to these units under this Subpart or\n\nSubpart 373-3 of this Part, with alternative requirements which are protective\nof human health and the environment. (2)\n\nAny temporary unit to which alternative\nrequirements are applied in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nshall be: (i) located within the facility\nboundary; and\n(ii)\nused only for\ntreatment or storage of remediation wastes. (3)\n\nIn establishing standards to be applied\nto a temporary unit, the department shall consider the following factors: (i) length of time such unit will be in\noperation; (ii)\ntype of\nunit; (iii)\nvolumes of wastes to be\nmanaged; (iv)\nphysical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the wastes to be managed in the unit; (v) potential for releases from the\nunit; (vi)\nhydrogeological and\nother relevant environmental conditions at the facility which may influence the\nmigration of any potential releases; and\n(vii)\npotential for exposure of humans and\nenvironmental receptors if releases were to occur from the unit. (4)\n\nThe department shall specify\nin the permit or order the length of time a temporary unit will be allowed to\noperate, to be no longer than a period of one year. The department shall also\nspecify the design, operating, and closing requirements for the unit. (5)\n\nThe department may extend the operational\nperiod of a temporary unit once for no longer than a period of one year beyond\nthat originally specified in the permit or order, if the department determines\nthat: (i) continued operation of the unit\nwill not pose a threat to human health and the environment; and\n(ii)\ncontinued operation of the unit is\nnecessary to ensure timely and efficient implementation of remedial actions at\nthe facility. (6)\n\nIncorporation of a temporary unit or time extension for a temporary unit into\nan existing permit shall be: (i) approved in\naccordance with the procedures for department-initiated permit modifications\nunder section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart; or\n(ii)\nrequested by the\nowner/operator as a modification according to the procedures under section\n373-1.7\nof this\n\nPart. (7)\n\nThe department\nshall document the rationale for designating a temporary unit and for granting\ntime extensions for temporary units and shall make such documentation available\nto the public. (e) Staging piles. This subdivision is written in a special format to make\nit easier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other department\nregulations, this establishes enforceable legal requirements. \"I\" and \"you\"\nrefer to the owner/operator. (1)\n\nWhat\nis a staging pile? A\nstaging pile\nis an accumulation of solid, non-flowing remediation waste (as defined in section\n370.2\nof this Title) that is not a\ncontainment building and is used only during remedial operations for temporary\nstorage at a facility. A staging pile must be located within the contiguous\nproperty under the control of the owner/operator where the wastes to be managed\nin the staging pile originated. Staging piles must be designated by the\ndepartment according to the requirements in this subdivision. (i) For the purposes of this subdivision, storage\nincludes mixing, sizing, blending, or other similar\nphysical operations as long as they are intended to prepare the wastes for\nsubsequent management or treatment. (ii)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(2)\n\nWhen may I use a staging pile?\nYou may use a staging pile to store hazardous remediation waste (or remediation\nwaste otherwise subject to land disposal restrictions) only if you follow the\nstandards and design criteria the department has designated for that staging\npile. The department must designate the staging pile in a permit or, at an\ninterim status facility, in a closure plan or order (consistent with section\n373-1.3\n[g][1][v] and\n[2]\n[v] of this Part). The department must\nestablish conditions in the permit, closure plan, or order that comply with\nparagraphs (4) through (11) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nWhat information must I provide to get a\nstaging pile designated? When seeking a staging pile designation, you must\nprovide: (i) sufficient and accurate\ninformation to enable the department to impose standards and design criteria\nfor your staging pile according to paragraphs (4) through (11) of this\nsubdivision; (ii)\ncertification by\nan independent, qualified professional engineer licensed in New York State, for\ntechnical data, such as design drawings and specifications, and engineering\nstudies, unless the department determines, based on information that you\nprovide, that this certification is not necessary to ensure that a staging pile\nwill protect human health and the environment; and\n(iii)\nany additional information the\ndepartment determines is necessary to protect human health and the\nenvironment. (4)\n\nWhat\nperformance criteria must a staging pile satisfy? The department must establish\nthe standards and design criteria for the staging pile in the permit, closure\nplan, or order. (i) The standards and design\ncriteria must comply with the following: (a) the staging pile must facilitate a reliable, effective and protective\nremedy; (b) the staging pile must\nbe designed so as to prevent or minimize releases of hazardous wastes and\nhazardous constituents into the environment, and minimize or adequately control\ncross-media transfer, as necessary to protect human health and environment (for\nexample, through the use of liners, covers, run-off/run-on controls, as\nappropriate); and\n(c) the staging\npile must not operate for more than two years, except when the department\ngrants an operating term extension under paragraph (9) of this subdivision\n(entitled \"May I receive an operating extension for a staging pile?\"). You must\nmeasure the two-year limit, or other operating term specified by the department\nin the permit, closure plan, or order, from the first time you place\nremediation waste into a staging pile. You must maintain a record of the date\nwhen you first placed remediation waste into the staging pile for the life of\nthe permit, closure plan, or order, or for three years, whichever is\nlonger. (ii)\n\nEstablishing\nthe standards and design criteria, the department must consider the following\nfactors: (a) length of time the pile will be\nin operation; (b) volumes of wastes\nyou intend to store in the pile; (c) physical and chemical characteristics of\nthe wastes to be stored in the unit; (d) potential for releases from the\nunit; (e) hydrogeological and other\nrelevant environmental conditions at the facility that may influence the\nmigration of any potential releases; and\n(f) potential for human and environmental\nexposure to potential releases from the unit. (5)\n\nMay a staging pile receive ignitable or\nreactive remediation waste? You must not place ignitable or reactive\nremediation waste in a staging pile unless: (i) you have treated, rendered or mixed the\nremediation waste before you placed it in the staging pile so that: (a) the remediation waste no longer meets the\ndefinition of ignitable or reactive under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthe Title; and\n(b) you have\ncomplied with section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart; or\n(ii)\nyou\nmanage the remediation waste to protect it from exposure to any material or\ncondition that may cause it to ignite or react. (6)\n\nHow do I handle incompatible remediation\nwastes in a staging pile? The term incompatible waste is defined in section\n370.2\nof this Title. You must\ncomply with the following requirements for incompatible wastes in staging\npiles: (i) you must not place incompatible\nremediation wastes in the same staging pile unless you have complied with\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart; (ii)\nif remediation\nwaste in a staging pile is incompatible with any waste or material stored\nnearby in containers, other piles, open tanks or land disposal units (for\nexample, surface impoundments), you must separate the incompatible materials, or protect them from one another by using a dike, berm, wall or other device; and\n(iii)\nyou must not pile\nremediation waste on the same base where incompatible wastes or materials were\npreviously piled, unless the base has been decontaminated sufficiently to\ncomply with section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (7)\n\nAre\nstaging piles subject to land disposal restrictions (LDR) and minimum\ntechnological requirements (MTR)? No. Placing hazardous remediation wastes into\na staging pile does not constitute land disposal of hazardous wastes or create\na unit that is subject to the minimum technological requirements of RCRA\n3004(o). (8)\n\nHow long may I operate\na staging pile? The department may allow a staging pile to operate for up to\ntwo years after hazardous remediation waste is first placed into the pile. You\nmust use a staging pile no longer than the length of time designated by the\ndepartment in the permit, closure plan, or order (the operating term), except\nas provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (9)\n\nMay I receive an operating extension for\na staging pile?\n(i) The department may grant\none operating term extension of up to 180 days beyond the operating term limit\ncontained in the permit, closure plan, or order (see paragraph [12] of this\nsubdivision for modification procedures). To justify to the department the need\nfor an extension, you must provide sufficient and accurate information to\nenable the department to determine that continued operation of the staging\npile: (a) will not pose a threat to human\nhealth and the environment; and\n(b) is necessary to ensure timely and efficient implementation of remedial actions\nat the facility. (ii)\n\nThe\ndepartment may, as a condition of the extension, specify further standards and\ndesign criteria in the permit, closure plan, or order, as necessary, to ensure\nprotection of human health and the environment. (10)\n\nWhat is the closure requirement for a\nstaging pile located in a previously contaminated area?\n(i) Within 180 days after the operating term\nof the staging pile expires, you must close a staging pile located in a\npreviously contaminated area of the site by removing or decontaminating all: (a) remediation waste; (b) contaminated containment system\ncomponents; and\n(c) structures and\nequipment contaminated with waste and leachate. (ii)\n\nYou must also decontaminate contaminated\nsubsoils in a manner and according to a schedule that the department determines\nwill protect human health and the environment. (iii)\n\nThe department must include the above\nrequirements in the permit, closure plan, or order in which the staging pile is\ndesignated. (11)\n\nWhat is\nthe closure requirement for a staging pile located in an uncontaminated area?\n(i) Within 180 days after the operating term\nof the staging pile expires, you must close a staging pile located in an\nuncontaminated area of the site according to sections\n373-2.12\n(h)(1)\nand\n373-2.7\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart; or according to sections\n373-3.12\n(g)(1)\nand\n373-3.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (ii)\n\nThe department must\ninclude the above requirement in the permit, closure plan, or order in which\nthe staging pile is designated. (12)\n\nHow may my existing permit (for example, RAP), closure plan, or order be modified to allow me to use a staging pile?\n(i) To modify a permit, other than a RAP, to\nincorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension, either: (a) the department must approve the\nmodification under the procedures for department-initiated permit modifications\nin section\n373-1.7\nof this Part; or\n(b) you must request a major permit\nmodification under the section\n373-1.7\n(d) of this\n\nPart and Part 621 of this Title. (ii)\n\nTo modify a RAP to incorporate a staging\npile or staging pile operating term extension, you must comply with the RAP\nmodification requirements under section\n373-1.11\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nTo modify a\nclosure plan to incorporate a staging pile or staging pile operating term\nextension, you must follow the applicable requirements under section\n373-2.7\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart or 373-3.7(c)(3) of this Part. (iv)\n\nTo modify an order to incorporate a\nstaging pile or staging pile operating term extension, you must follow the\nterms of the order and the applicable provisions of section\n373-1.3\n(g)(1)(v) or\n(2)(v)\nof this Part. (13)\n\nIs information about the staging pile\navailable to the public? The department must document the rationale for\ndesignating a staging pile or staging pile operating term extension and make\nthis documentation available to the public. (f) Disposal of CAMU-eligible wastes in\npermitted hazardous waste landfills. (1)\n\nThe department with regulatory oversight\nat the location where the cleanup is taking place may approve placement of\nCAMU-eligible wastes in hazardous waste landfills not located at the site from\nwhich the waste originated, without the wastes meeting the requirements of Part\n376 of this Title, if the conditions in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this\nparagraph are met: (i) the waste meets the\ndefinition of CAMU-eligible waste in subparagraphs (c)(1)(i) and (ii) of this\nsection; (ii)\nthe department with\nregulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place\nidentifies principal hazardous constitutes in such waste, in accordance with\nclauses (c)(5)(iv)(\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this\nsection, and requires that such principal hazardous constituents are treated to\nany of the following standards specified for CAMU-eligible wastes: (a) the treatment standards under clause\n(c)(5)(iv)(\nd\n) of this section; or\n(b) treatment standards adjusted in\naccordance with subclause (c)(5)(iv)(\ne\n)(\n1\n), (\n3\n) or (\n4\n) or item\n(c)(5)(iv)(\ne\n)(\n5\n)(\ni\n) of this\nsection; or\n(c) treatment standards\nadjusted in accordance with item\n(c)(5)(iv)(\ne\n)(\n5\n)(\nii\n) of this\nsection, where treatment has been used and that treatment significantly reduces\nthe toxicity or mobility of the principal hazardous constituents in the waste, minimizing the short-term and long-term threat posed by the waste, including\nthe threat at the remediation site; (iii)\nthe landfill receiving the\nCAMU-eligible waste must have a RCRA hazardous waste permit, meet the\nrequirements for new landfills in section\n373-2.14\nof this Subpart, and be\nauthorized to accept CAMU-eligible wastes; for the purposes of this\nrequirement, \"permit\" does not include interim status. (2)\n\nThe person seeking approval shall provide\nsufficient information to enable the department with regulatory oversight at\nthe location where the cleanup is taking place to approve placement of\nCAMU-eligible waste in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Information required by subparagraphs (c)(4)(i) through (iii) of this section\nfor CAMU applications must be provided, unless not reasonably\navailable. (3)\n\nThe department with\nregulatory oversight at the location where the cleanup is taking place shall\nprovide public notice and a reasonable opportunity for public comment before\napproving CAMU eligible waste for placement in an off-site permitted hazardous\nwaste landfill, consistent with the requirements for CAMU approval at paragraph\n(c)(8) of this section. The approval must be specific to a single\nremediation. (4)\n\nApplicable\nhazardous waste management requirements for CAMU-eligible waste in this Part, including recordkeeping requirements to demonstrate compliance with treatment\nstandards approved under this section, must be incorporated into the receiving\nfacility permit through permit issuance or a permit modification, providing\nnotice and an opportunity for comment and a hearing. Notwithstanding section\n373-1.6\n(e) of this\n\nPart, a landfill may not receive hazardous CAMU-eligible waste under this\nsection unless its permit specifically authorizes receipt of such\nwaste. (5)\n\nFor each remediation, CAMU-eligible waste may not be placed in an off-site landfill authorized to\nreceive CAMU-eligible waste in accordance with paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision until the following additional conditions have been met: (i) The landfill owner/operator notifies the\ndepartment responsible for oversight of the landfill and persons on the\nfacility mailing list, maintained in accordance with section\n621.6\nof this Title, of his or her\nintent to receive CAMU-eligible waste in accordance with this subdivision; the\nnotice must identify the source of the remediation waste, the principal\nhazardous constituents in the waste, and treatment requirements. (ii)\n\nPersons on the facility mailing list may\nprovide comments, including objections to the receipt of the CAMU-eligible\nwaste, to the department within 15 days of notification. (iii)\n\nThe department may object to the\nplacement of the CAMU-eligible waste in the landfill within 30 days of\nnotification; the department may extend the review period an additional 30 days\nbecause of public concerns or insufficient information. (iv)\nCAMU-eligible wastes may not be placed\nin the landfill until the department has notified the facility owner/operator\nthat the department does not object to its placement. (v) If the department objects to the\nplacement or does not notify the facility owner/operator that the department\nhas chosen not to object, the facility may not receive the waste, notwithstanding section\n373-1.6\n(e) of this\n\nPart. until the objection has been resolved. or the owner/operator obtains a\npermit modification in accordance with the procedures of section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart and section\n621.13\nof this Title specifically\nauthorizing receipt of the waste. (vi)\n\nAs part of the permit issuance or permit\nmodification process of paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the department may\nmodify, reduce, or eliminate the notification requirements of this paragraph as\nthey apply to specific categories of CAMU-eligible waste, based on minimal\nrisk. (6)\n\nGenerators of\nCAMU-eligible wastes sent off-site to a hazardous waste landfill under this\nsubdivision must comply with the requirements of section\n376.1\n(g)(l)(iv)\nof\nthis Title; off-site facilities treating CAMU-eligible wastes to comply with\nthis section must comply with the requirements of section\n376.1\n(g)(2)(iv)\nof\nthis Title, except that the certification must be with respect to the treatment\nrequirements of subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision\nonly, the\ndesign of the CAMU\nin subclause\n(c)(5)(iv)(\ne\n)(\n5\n) of this section means design\nof the permitted Part 373 landfill. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
