  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-2.3 - Leak detection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General leak detection requirements. (1)\nA method, or combination of methods, of\nleak detection must be provided that: (i) can\ndetect a leak from any portion of the tank and the piping that is in contact\nwith the ground and routinely contains hazardous substance; (ii)\nis installed and calibrated in\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and\n(iii)\nmeets the requirements of subdivisions\n(c) and (d) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the methods listed\nunder paragraphs (c)(1), (d)(1), and (d)(2) of this section must be capable of\ndetecting the leak rate or quantity specified for that method with a\nprobability of detection of 95 percent and a probability of false alarm of 5\npercent. (2)\n\nIf a method\nof leak detection that complies with the requirements of this section cannot be\nimplemented, the UST system must be permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision 2.6(b) of this Subpart. (b) Specific leak detection requirements for\ntanks and piping. (1)\n\nTank leak detection. Every tank must be monitored for leaks at weekly intervals in accordance with\nparagraph (c)(2) of this section. Continuous electronic monitoring satisfies\nthe weekly monitoring requirement. (2)\n\nPiping leak detection. All piping in\ncontact with the ground must be monitored for leaks at weekly intervals in\naccordance with paragraph (c)(2) of this section. Additionally, all piping in\ncontact with the ground that conveys hazardous substance under pressure must be\nequipped with an automatic line leak detector that is operated in accordance\nwith paragraph (d)(1) of this section. (c) Tank leak detection methods. Tank leak\ndetection methods used to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this\nsection must be conducted in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nTank tightness testing. (i) A tightness test is a test acceptable to\nthe department which will determine if a tank and piping system is tight or not\ntight. This shall include a test capable of detecting a tank leak of one tenth\ngallons per hour (gph) with a probability of detection of 95 percent and\nprobability of false alarm of five percent or less with a maximum threshold for\ndeclaring a leak of five hundredths of a gallon in one hour accounting for\nvariables such as vapor pockets, thermal expansion and contraction of product, temperature stratification, groundwater level, evaporation, pressure and tank\ndeformation. (ii)\n\nIf it is\ntechnically impossible to perform a meaningful tightness test, then an\nalternative test or inspection which is acceptable to the department must be\nperformed. (iii)\n\nQualification of\ntechnicians. All tightness tests must be performed by a qualified technician\nwho has an understanding of the variables which affect the test and is trained\nby the manufacturer or their representative to perform the\ntest. (2)\n\nInterstitial\nmonitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the primary and secondary\ncontainment may be used if the monitoring equipment is designed, constructed\nand installed to detect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely\ncontains hazardous substance, and if the monitoring equipment meets the\nrequirements of either subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph: (i) For a double-walled tank or double-walled\npiping, the sampling or testing method: ('a')\ncan detect a leak through the inner wall in any portion of the tank and/or\npiping that routinely contains hazardous substance; and\n('b')\nis capable of detecting a breach in\nboth the inner and outer walls of the tank and/or piping if using continuous\nvacuum, pressure, or liquid-filled methods of interstitial\nmonitoring. (ii)\n\nFor a\nUST system with secondary containment within the excavation zone, the sampling\nor testing method can detect a leak between the primary and secondary\ncontainment, and the following conditions are met: ('a')\n\nThe secondary containment consists of\nartificially constructed material that is sufficiently thick and impermeable\n(i.e., with a permeability rate to water equal to or less than 1'10-6 cm/sec)\nto direct a leak to the monitoring point and permit its detection. ('b')\n\nThe secondary containment is compatible\nwith the hazardous substance stored so that a leak from the UST system will not\ncause a deterioration of the secondary containment, allowing a leak to pass\nthrough undetected. ('c')\n\nFor\ncathodically protected tank systems the secondary containment must be installed\nso that it does not interfere with the proper operation of the cathodic\nprotection system. ('d')\n\nThe\ngroundwater, soil moisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling\nmethod inoperative so that a leak could go undetected for more than seven\ndays. ('e')\n\nThe site is assessed to\nensure that the secondary containment is always above the groundwater and not\nin a 25-year flood plain, unless the secondary containment and monitoring\ndesigns are for use under such conditions. ('f')\n\nMonitoring wells are clearly marked in\naccordance with subparagraph 2.2(b)(1)(v) of this Subpart and secured to avoid\nunauthorized access and tampering. (d) Piping leak detection methods. Piping\nleak detection methods used to meet the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of\nthis section must be conducted in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nAutomatic line leak detectors. Methods\nwhich indicate the presence of a leak by restricting or shutting off the flow\nof hazardous substance through piping, or triggering an audible or visual\nalarm, may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons per hour at 10 pounds\nper square inch line pressure within one hour. (2)\n\nLine tightness testing. (i) A tightness test is a test acceptable to\nthe department which will determine if a tank and piping system is tight or not\ntight. This shall include a test capable of detecting a piping leak of one\ntenth gallons per hour (gph) with a probability of detection of 95 percent and\nprobability of false alarm of five percent or less with a maximum threshold for\ndeclaring a leak of five hundredths of a gallon in one hour accounting for\nvariables such as vapor pockets, thermal expansion and contraction of product, temperature stratification, groundwater level, evaporation, pressure and tank\ndeformation. (ii)\n\nIf it is\ntechnically impossible to perform a meaningful tightness test, then an\nalternative test or inspection which is acceptable to the department must be\nperformed. (iii)\n\nQualification of\ntechnicians. All tightness tests must be performed by a qualified technician\nwho has an understanding of the variables which affect the test and is trained\nby the manufacturer or their representative to perform the\ntest. (e) Recordkeeping. Records of the tests and inspections required by this section\nmust meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe\nresults or records of any sampling, testing, or monitoring must be retained for\nat least three years. (2)\n\nThe\nresults of tank and line tightness testing must be retained for three years or\nuntil the next test, whichever is later, and include the following information: (i) facility registration number; (ii)\ntank system identification number as\nshown on the registration certificate for the tank or piping tested; (iii)\ndate of test; (iv)\nresults of test; (v) test method; (vi)\ncertification by the technician that the\ntest complies with paragraph (c)(1) or paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection; (vii)\nstatement of\ntechnician's qualifications; (viii)\naddress of technician; and\n(ix)\nsignature of technician. (3)\n\nWritten performance claims pertaining to\nany leak detection system used, and the manner in which these claims have been\njustified or tested by the equipment manufacturer or installer, must be\nretained for five years after the date of equipment installation. (4)\n\nWritten documentation of all calibration, maintenance, and repairs of leak detection equipment installed on-site must be\nretained for at least three years after the servicing work is completed. Schedules of required calibration and maintenance provided by the leak\ndetection equipment manufacturer must be retained for five years after the date\nof equipment installation. (f) Uninspected tank systems. If any portion\nof a tank system is not tested or inspected as required by this section, the\nowner or operator must take the uninspected portion of the tank system\nout-of-service pursuant to the requirements of subdivision 2.6(a) of this\n\nSubpart.
