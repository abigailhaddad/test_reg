  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.14 - Legality of debentures of real estate investment trusts for investment by savings banks\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether debentures of a real estate\ninvestment trust formed under Massachusetts law could be considered \"corporate\ninterest-bearing securities\" eligible as savings banks investments under\nsection\n235\n(21)(a)(2)\nof the Banking Law. The department reiterated its long-standing view that such\ndebentures could not be considered \"corporate\" for purposes of the subdivision\nconcerned. First of all, both the Legislature and the Congress, particularly in\ntax legislation but including, at the State level, such other examples as\nsection 81 of the Insurance Law, have shown themselves quite cognizant of the\nexistence of business entities similar but not identical in form to true\ncorporations. Express references to business trusts in some instances, and\nallusions to \"associations\" as well as \"corporations\" in others, are entirely\nlacking in the pertinent Banking Law subdivision; this led the department to\nconclude that the Legislature intended \"corporate\" securities for these\npurposes to be precisely that. Legislative history, indicating the origins of\nthis subdivision as a narrow and careful exception to the strict rules\ntheretofore prevailing, supported this conclusion, as did the department's\nreview of an explanation by Massachusetts counsel of some significant respects, albeit usually more important to holders of equity than debt, in which\n\nMassachusetts trust differ in legal attributes and consequences from\ncorporations in that Commonwealth. In sum, the department felt it would need a clear legislative\nmandate before it could allow REIT debentures to be considered \"corporate\"\nunder the legal-investment statutes. DATED: February 27, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
