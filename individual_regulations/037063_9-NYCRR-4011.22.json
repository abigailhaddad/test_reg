  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.22 - Superfecta\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nobject of the superfecta is to select in order, the first-, second-, third- and\nfourth-place horses in a designated superfecta race. The superfecta pool shall\nbe held entirely separate from all other pools and has no relation to any other\npool. (b) Races in which\nsuperfecta betting shall be conducted shall be approved by the commission and\nbe clearly designated in the program. (c) If a horse is scratched or excused from\nracing or betting no further tickets shall be sold designating such horse and\nall tickets previously sold designating such horse shall be refunded and the\nmoney deducted from the pool. (d) (1)\n\nIf no ticket is sold designating, in\norder, the first four horses or only three horses finish, the net pool shall be\ndistributed equally among holders of tickets designating the first three horses\nin order. (2)\n\nIf no ticket is sold\ndesignating, in order, the first three horses or only two horses finish, the\nnet pool shall be distributed equally among holders of tickets designating the\nfirst two horses in order. (3)\n\nIf\nno ticket is sold designating, in order, the first two horses or only one horse\nfinishes, the net pool shall be distributed equally among holders of tickets\ndesignating the horse to win. (4)\n\nIf no ticket is sold designating the winner to win, the superfecta shall be\ndeclared off and the gross pool refunded. An announcement of such possibility\nshall be made as soon as the pool closes. (f) Dead heat. In the event of a dead heat, all tickets designating the correct order of finish, crediting each horse in a\ndead heat as finishing in any of the dead-heat positions, shall be winning\ntickets. Distribution shall be in accordance with established pari-mutuel\npractice relative to dead heats, i.e., separate price calculations for\ndifferent combinations. (g) Coupled\nentries and fields are permitted in superfecta races. In such races no wagers\nmay be accepted or issued (including \"wheel\" or \"box\" type bets) that couple\nthe same coupled entry or the same field in the same combination. (h) The numbers of the first four horses as\nmade official shall constitute the winning combination, except that where two\nor more such horses are part of the same coupled entry or field only the best\nfinishing position attained by such coupled entry or field horses shall be\nconsidered for pay- off purposes and the next best finishing horses not part of\nsuch coupled entry or field shall be selected to determine the winning\nsuperfecta combination. (i) No\nsuperfecta wagering shall be conducted on any race having fewer than five\nbetting entries. If fewer than five betting entries start, the superfecta shall\nbe declared off and the gross pool refunded. The commission's steward may, in\nthe exercise of discretion to protect the wagering public, require that there\nbe at least six betting entries for the conduct of superfecta\nwagering. Notes\nN.Y.
