  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.5 - Contracts with customers other than exempt organizations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1101(b)(4)(i), (9); 1105(c)(3), (5); 1115(a)(17)\n(a) The term\ncustomers\nin this classification includes, but is not limited\nto: (1)\nresidential customers; and\n(2)\nbusiness customers. (b) Capital improvements\ncontracts. (1)\n\nPurchases. All purchases\nof tangible personal property (excluding qualifying production machinery and\nequipment exempt under section\n1115[a][12] of the Tax\n\nLaw) which are incorporated into and become part of the realty or are used or\nconsumed in performing the contract are subject to tax at the time of purchase\nby the contractor or any other purchaser. A certificate of capital improvement\nmay not be validly given by any person or accepted by a supplier to exempt the\npurchase of these materials. (2)\n\nLabor and material charges. All charges by a contractor to the customer for\nadding to or improving real property by a capital improvement are not subject\nto tax provided the customer supplies the contractor with a properly completed\ncertificate of capital improvement. (3)\n\nDirect payment permit. A direct payment\npermit cannot be used as a device to defer payment of the sales tax on\npurchases which are taxable. A contractor who receives a direct payment permit\nfrom a customer cannot use such permit to defer his payment of tax on purchases\nused by him or incorporated into a capital improvement to real property. The\ncontractor's liability for the tax on his purchases are not relieved by his\ncustomer's direct payment permit. Cross-reference: For information on direct payment permits, see section\n532.5\nof\nthis Title. (4)\n\nDocuments; capital improvement contracts. (i) When a\nproperly completed certificate of capital improvement has been furnished to the\ncontractor, the burden of proving the job or transaction is not taxable and the\nliability for the tax rests solely upon the customer. (a) The prime contractor should obtain a\ncertificate of capital improvement from the customer and retain it as part of\nhis records. Copies of such certificate must be furnished to all subcontractors\non the job and retained as part of their records. (b) A certificate of capital improvement may\nnot be issued by a contractor, subcontractor or any other person to a supplier\non the purchase of tangible personal property. (ii)\n\nWhere a contractor does not receive a\ncapital improvement certificate from a customer, the contract or other records\nof the transaction will prevail. In such case: (a) where the contractor does not receive a\ncapital improvement certificate, collects tax on the full invoice price and the\njob is a capital improvement to real property, the contractor is liable for the\ntax on the cost of materials incorporated into the job, plus the tax collected\nfrom the customer. The customer is entitled to a refund of the tax paid to the\ncontractor; or\n(b) where the\ncontractor does not receive a capital improvement certificate, collects no tax\non the charges billed to the customer and the job is a capital improvement to\nreal property, the contractor is liable for the the tax on the cost of\nmaterials incorporated into the job performed. (iii)\n\nIf a contract includes the sale of\ntangible personal property which remains tangible personal property after\ninstallation, the contractor must collect the appropriate New York State and\nlocal taxes from the customer on the selling price, including any charge for\ninstallation, of the tangible personal property unless a properly completed\nexemption certificate is issued by the customer. The contractor may apply for a\ncredit or refund of taxes he has paid on purchases of the tangible personal\nproperty that remain tangible personal property after installation. Cross-reference: For refunds and credits, see Part 534 of this Title. For\nvendors' obligations to the Department of Taxation and Finance in relation to\nexemption certificates, see section\n532.4\nof this Title. Example 1: A contractor sells a building he has constructed and, as a\npart of the sale agreement, installs free standing water fountains which remain\ntangible personal property when installed. The contractor's billing to his\ncustomer must separately state all charges for tangible personal property\nincluded in the sales agreement. The New York State and applicable local tax\nrate must be collected on the total charges for the water fountains including\nany installation charges. In this instance, the contractor may purchase the\nwater fountains tax-free using a contractor exempt purchase certificate. If he\npays the tax to his supplier, he is entitled to a refund or credit of the tax\npaid on the purchase of the water fountains. Cross-references: For production machinery and equipment, see section\n541.6\nof this Part. For equipment, tools, and supplies, see sections\n541.9\nand\n541.10\nof this\n\nPart. For use tax liability, see Part 531 of this Title. For refunds and\ncredits, see Part 534 of this Title. (c) Agency contracts. (1)\n\nIf a customer enters into an agency\ncontract with a prime contractor and all subcontractors, all purchases of\nmaterials for such contract are taxable to the customer (other than qualifying\nproduction machinery and equipment exempt under section\n1115 (a)(12)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw). In order to create an agency relationship, all of the following\nconditions must be met: (i) purchases must be\nbilled or invoiced by the vendor to the customer or to the contractor\nspecifying that the contractor is acting as agent for the customer\n(\ne.g., X contractor, as agent for Y, name of corporation) and\nidentify the place of delivery; (ii)\npayment must be made by the customer or\nby the contractor, acting as agent, directly to the vendor from a special fund\ncreated by the customer for this specific purpose; and\n(iii)\ndeliveries must be made to the job\nsite; or under certain circumstances (such as where the materials require\nadditional fabrication before installation on the job site or for storage to\nprotect the materials from theft or vandalism prior to installation at the job\nsite) deliveries may be made to a site, other than the job site, providing the\nultimate delivery of the materials is made to the job site. Where delivery is\nmade to a site, other than the job site, the purchases must be billed or\ninvoiced by the vendor to the customer or to the contractor as agent, identify\nthe place of delivery, the customer's full name and address and the job site\nlocation where the materials will ultimately be delivered for\ninstallation. (2)\n\nUnder\nan agency relationship, the sale of tangible personal property is deemed to be\na retail sale to the customer (principal) and the customer is liable for the\ntax due on his purchases of such tangible personal property. (3)\nA contractor is liable for the tax due on\npurchases made under a purported agency contract if subsequently it is\ndetermined the contract does not qualify as an agency contract. Example 1: A contractor enters into a purported agency contract with a\ncustomer for the construction of a capital improvement to real property. The\ncustomer or contractor, acting as agent for the customer, makes taxable\npurchases of materials, and purchases and rental of tools and/or equipment and\nsupplies. Subsequently, it is determined the contract does not qualify as an\nagency contract. The contractor is liable for the tax due on the purchases or\nrentals of materials, tools and/or equipment and supplies. The contractor\nshould include the tax as part of his cost of materials and services billed to\nthe customer. The customer may submit a claim for refund or credit of the tax\npaid on purchases or rentals made before it was determined the contract did not\nqualify as an agency contract, providing the claim is submitted within three\nyears of the date the tax was payable to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. Example 2: Same as the example in subdivision (b) of this section\nexcept the customer is a holder of a direct payment permit. The customer either\nissues the direct payment permit to vendors and makes tax free purchases or\nissues the direct payment permit to the contractor, who acting as agent for the\ncustomer, uses the direct payment permit to make tax free purchases. Subsequently, it is determined the contract does not qualify as an agency\ncontract. The contractor is liable for the tax due on the purchases or rentals\nof materials, tools and/or equipment and supplies. The contractor should\ninclude the tax as part of his cost of materials and services billed to his\ncustomer. If a proposed agency contract differs from the conditions\nin this paragraph, copies of the proposed contract and procedures may be\nsubmitted for an opinion to the Instructions and Interpretations Unit, Sales\n\nTax Section, Technical Services Bureau, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY\n12227. (d) Maintaining, installing, repairing, and servicing tangible personal property\nand real property. (1)\n\nTangible\npersonal property. (i) Charges for repair, service, maintenance, and installation of tangible personal property which\nretains its identity as tangible personal property are taxable to the customer\nbased on the full invoice price. (ii)\n\nSome items of tangible personal property\nthat retain their identity as tangible personal property after installation\nare: (a) theater seats; (b) bowling lanes and related\nequipment; (c) free-standing\nshelves, counters, bars and appliances (refrigerators, stoves, window air\nconditioning units); and\n(d) above\nground swimming pools. Example 1: A customer contracts for the installation of a washer and\ndryer to be hooked up to existing wiring and plumbing in his home. The charge\nfor the installation is taxable. Example 2: A contractor sells and installs an above-ground swimming\npool. The pool consists of a vinyl liner supported by an aluminum and wood\nframe, which rests on the ground, and a wood and metal deck. The vinyl liner\nrests on a bed of sand to prevent damage. The deep end (hopper) of the pool is\nset approximately two feet in the ground. The pool may be dismantled and moved\nwithout substantially damaging the real property. The installation of this pool\nis not a capital improvement, as it may be dismantled and moved without\nsubstantial injury to the land, there is no intent that it become a permanent\ninstallation and it has not become affixed so that it has become part of the\nreal property. Therefore, the charges for the sale and installation of the pool\nare subject to the tax. (iii)\nA subcontractor must collect tax on all\nhis charges to a prime contractor for repair, service, maintenance, and\ninstallation of tangible personal property unless the prime contractor issues a\nproperly completed exemption certificate or a capital improvement certificate\nto the subcontractor. (iv)\n\nFor\ntreatment of repairs, service, maintenance, and installation charges for\nproduction machinery and equipment, see section\n541.6\nof this Part. (2)\n\nReal\nproperty. Charges for repair, service, and maintenance to real property, except\nfor interior cleaning and maintenance services of a janitorial nature performed\non a regular contractual basis for a term of not less than 30 days, are\ntaxable. However, charges for the services of window cleaning, rodent and pest\ncontrol, and trash removal from buildings are also subject to tax. Cross-reference: For debris removal, see section\n541.7\nof\nthis Part. For exclusion of interior cleaning and maintenance services, see\nsection\n527.7\n(c)(3)\nof this Title. For repairing, servicing, maintaining production machinery and\nequipment, see section\n541.6\nof this Part. (3)\n\nPurchases. Purchases of any tangible personal property (excluding qualifying production\nmachinery and equipment exempt under section\n1115[a] [12] of the Tax\n\nLaw) made by a contractor, subcontractor, or repairman for use or consumption\nin maintaining, servicing, or repairing real or personal property of others are\nsubject to tax. The contractor is entitled to a refund or credit of tax paid on\nsuch materials incorporated into real property where such property is later\ntransferred to the purchaser in conjunction with the performance of a service\nsubject to the tax. Example 3: The repainting of a building is not a capital improvement. The customer must pay tax on the total contract charge for this service. The\npainter is liable for the tax on the materials, tools and supplies he uses for\npainting (\ne.g., paint, spackling, brushes and drop cloths), subject to a right of refund or credit for the tax paid on the cost of the\nmaterials incorporated into the real property (\ne.g., paint, spackling).
