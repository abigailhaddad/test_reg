(2)\n\nPlayer may not be the bank at the start\nof the game. For the purposes of this subdivision, the start of the game shall\nmean the first round of play after the dealer is required to shuffle the\ncards. (3)\n\nAfter the first round of\nplay pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, each player at the table\nshall have the option to either be the bank or pass the bank to the next\nplayer. The dealer shall, starting with the player farthest to the right of the\ndealer, offer the bank to each player in a counter-clockwise rotation around\nthe table until a player accepts the bank. The dealer shall place a marker\ndesignating the bank in front of the player who accepts the bank. If the first\nplayer offered the bank accepts, the player seated to the right of that player\nshall first be offered the bank on the next round of play. The initial offer to\nbe the bank shall rotate counter-clockwise around the table until it returns to\nthe dealer. In no event may any player bank two consecutive rounds of play. If\nno player wishes to be the bank, the round of play shall proceed in accordance\nwith the rules of play provided in this section. (4)\n\nBefore a player may be permitted to bank\na round of play, the dealer shall determine that: (i) the player placed a wager against the\ndealer during the last round of play in which there was no player banking the\ngame; and\n(ii)\nthe player has\nsufficient chips on the table to cover all of the wagers placed by other\nplayers at the table for that round of play. (5)\nA gaming facility may offer the bank the\noption of having the gaming facility cover 50 percent of the wagers made during\na round of play. If the gaming facility offers this option, the gaming facility\nshall make such option available to all players at the table. If the bank\nwishes to use this option, the bank shall specifically request the dealer to\naccept responsibility for the payment of one-half of all winning wagers. When\nthe bank covers 50 percent and the gaming facility covers 50 percent of the\nwinning wagers, such arrangement shall be known as co-banking and the dealer\nshall place a marker designating the co-bank in front of that player. When the\ndealer is co-banking, the dealer shall be responsible for setting the hand of\nthe bank in the manner submitted to the commission for written approval. When\nco-banking is in effect, the dealer may not place a wager against the\nbank. (6)\n\nIf a player is the bank, the player may wager on one betting area only. (7)\n\nOnce the dealer has determined that a\nplayer may be the bank pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision and after\nthe cards have been shuffled, the dealer shall remove chips from the chip tray\nin an amount equal to the last wager made by that player against the dealer or\nin an amount, the calculation of which has been approved by the commission. This amount shall be the amount the dealer wagers against the bank. The bank\nmay direct that the sum wagered by the dealer be a lesser amount or that the\ndealer places no wager during that round of play. Any amount wagered by the\ndealer shall be placed in front of the chip tray. (8)\n\nIf the cards are to be dealt from a\nmanual dealing shoe, the procedures set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision\n(f) of this section shall apply, except as follows: (i) if a pai gow poker shaker and dice are\nused to determine the starting position for the dealing of the cards, the bank, instead of the dealer, shall shake the pai gow poker shaker three times.

This stack shall be\ndesignated as the first stack by the dealer, who shall move the stack toward\nthe players; (ii)\nif a pai gow\npoker shaker and dice are used to determine the starting position for the\ndelivery of the first stack, the bank, instead of the dealer, shall shake the\npai gow poker shaker three times pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (3)\nof subdivision (j) of this section. The dealer shall be responsible to ensure\nthat the bank shakes the pai gow poker shaker at least three times so as to\ncause a random mixture of the dice. Once the bank has completed shaking the pai\ngow poker shaker, the dealer shall remove the lid covering the pai gow poker\nshaker, total the dice and announce the total. The dealer shall always remove\nthe lid from the pai gow poker shaker and if the bank inadvertently removes the\nlid, the dealer shall require the pai gow poker shaker to be covered and\nre-shaken by the bank; (iii)\nif a\ncomputerized random number generator is used to determine the starting position\nfor the dealing of the cards, the bank shall use the procedures set forth in\nsubdivision (c) of section\n5324.2\nof this Part; and\n(iv)\nwhen counting the betting positions, including the dealer, to determine the starting position for delivering the\nseven stacks of cards, the position of the bank, instead of the dealer, shall\nbe considered number one; and\n(v) the dealer shall deliver the first stack as determined in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph to the starting position as determined in subparagraph (iii) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (j) of this section.

The dealer shall deliver each stack face\ndown to each position, including the dealer, regardless of whether there is a\nwager at the position.

(11)\n\nIf the cards dealt to the dealer have\nnot been previously collected, after each player has set such player's two\nhands and placed such hands on the appropriate area of the layout, the two\nhands of the dealer shall then be set. Once the dealer has formed a high and\nlow hand, the dealer shall expose the hands of the bank and determine if the\nhands of the dealer are higher in rank than the hands of the bank. If the\ndealer wins, the cards of the dealer shall be stacked face up to the right of\nthe chip tray with the amount wagered by the dealer against the bank placed on\ntop. If the dealer pushes, the dealer shall return the amount wagered by the\ndealer against the bank to the chip tray.
