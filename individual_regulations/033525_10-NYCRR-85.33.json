(1)\n\nNursing care to patients in New York State shall be provided by a person possessing a license and current registration from the New York State Education Department to practice as a registered professional nurse or licensed practical nurse. (2)\n\nOut-of-state nurses providing care to a New York State Medical Assistance patient who is temporarily located outside New York State, must be licensed and registered in the state in which they are practicing. (c) Private duty nursing care in the hospital. Private duty nursing care in the hospital shall be provided on the recommendation of the patient's attending physician when the patient is in need of individual and continuous care beyond that available by the staff of a hospital, including that which is available in a critical care area. (d) Nursing service in the home. (1)\n\nFor necessary nursing service to be provided in the person's home, full and primary use shall be made of the services of an approved home health agency, including a hospital-based home health agency. (2)\n\nSuch service shall be provided on a per visit basis and may include not only intermittent or part-time nursing service for the patient but also instructions to members of the patient's family in procedures necessary for the care of the patient. (3)\n\nService of a registered professional nurse or of a licensed practical nurse on a private practitioner basis may be provided to a patient in his or her own home only under the following circumstances: (i) when there is no approved home health agency available to provide the intermittent or part-time nursing services need by the patient; and\n(ii)\nwhen the patient is in need of individual and continuous nursing care beyond that available from an approved home health agency.
