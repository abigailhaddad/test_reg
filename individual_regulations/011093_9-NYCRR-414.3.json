Tit. 9 § 414.3 - General provisions applicable to residential and commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe provisions stated herein apply to eligible persons\noccupying property on or after July 1, 1971. Application for payment of moving\nexpenses shall be made by an eligible person in writing to the commission upon\nforms prescribed and shall be accompanied by such information, evidence and\nexecuted vouchers as may be required. Such application shall be submitted to\nthe commission and payment of such moving expenses will be made to eligible\npersons under the circumstances and to the extent set forth herein. (a) Any individual, family, business, or farm\noperator is eligible to receive payment for the reasonable expense of moving\nhis personal property subsequent to the earlier of the following two dates: (1)\nhe is in occupancy at the initiation of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property in whole or in part; or\n(2)\nhe is in occupancy at the\ntime he is given a written notice by the State that it is their intent to\nacquire the property by a given date or he is given notice to vacate the\nproperty by a specific date. (b) Where the acquisition of real property\nused for a business or farm operation which is eligible for a payment under\nsubdivision (a) of this section causes a person to vacate a dwelling from other\nreal property not acquired, the additional expenses of moving such personalty\nare eligible for the appropriate moving payments. (c) Moving expenses shall not exceed the cost\nof transportation beyond 50 miles, except in the case of a business or farm\nwhen the State determines that relocation cannot be accomplished within the\n50-mile area; such exceptions may only be allowed to the nearest adequate and\navailable site. (d) The cost of\ninsurance premiums covering loss and damage of personal property while in\nstorage or transit will be eligible for reimbursement. Moving expenses shall\nnot include any direct losses or losses due to negligence. (e) The type of interest acquired does not\naffect the eligibility of relocation costs for reimbursement provided the\ninterest acquired is sufficient to cause displacement. If, in the opinion of\nthe commission, the acquisition of a portion of an entire premises or of access\nthereto renders all or the remainder of such premises unsuitable for continued\nuse and occupation or renders it without suitable access the removal of\npersonal property from the entire property may be considered eligible for the\npayment of moving expenses. (f) Moving expenses shall not include the cost of moving any fixtures or equipment\nconsidered part of the realty from the acquired property nor will reimbursement\nbe made for any cost of construction or improvement to the new location or for\nany remodeling, redecorating or reinforcing of the new structure to accommodate\nthe eligible person or his personal property, unless required by law, or deemed\nto be in the public interest by the commission. (g) Reimbursement for electrical wiring and\nplumbing charges and communication systems work covers only that work which is\ndirectly related to the personal property being relocated. Reimbursement is to\nexclude any costs of bringing electrical or plumbing services to the new site\nbut may include costs of labor and materials of distributing these services to\nthe personal property relocated. Reimbursement under this category excludes\ncosts of installing basic electrical wiring or plumbing to a new structure or\nthat normally found and expected in an existing structure and is intended to\ncover only those costs necessary to provide sufficient and adequate but not\nsuper-adequate utilities to operate the displaced business. (h) No reimbursement for overtime payments\nwill be allowed unless prior approval is received in writing from the\ndepartment. (i) It is expected that\nin anticipation of moving, the business or farm will reduce their inventories\nof stock or merchandise as much as practicable in order to have the removal\naccomplished in the most businesslike and economical manner. (j) Application for payment of moving\nexpenses must be made within 12 months after vacating of acquired premises or\nsix months after final award determination in a case litigated in the courts of\nthe State, whichever is the later. Such limitation shall include any eligible\nstorage period. (k) In case a\nbuilding or structure acquired by the State is returned to the owners under an\nagreement, an eligible person will be entitled to the moving expenses for any\npersonal effects, furniture and household equipment remaining in the building\nor structure at the time of removal of such building or structure; however, the\ncost of moving the structure is not eligible for moving expenses. The eligible\nperson, at his option, may accept a room count allowance or receive\nreimbursement on the actual cost basis. (l) In the case where the acquisition of real\nproperty causes the displacement of an advertising sign and such sign\nconstitutes the only improvement to the property acquired or where the\nacquisition causes a person to remove his advertising sign from real property\nnot acquired, the owner of the advertising sign is eligible for appropriate\nmoving payments. However, where the advertising sign is owned by and located on\nthe business or farm displaced, there will be no separate moving or related\nexpenses considered. (m) Moving\njunkyards and automobile graveyards. The State will pay the cost to put the\njunk or automobile bodies in an acceptable condition for delivery to the\nnearest reasonable salvage collection point, together with the transportation\ncosts from the appropriated property to said salvage collection point. In the\ncase of moving the material from an appropriated junkyard to a substitute\nlocation, the State will pay the processing cost to prepare the junk for\nremoval by the most economical means. The State will not pay the cost of\ndisassembly for resale of parts. (n) An advertising sign, junkyard or\nautomobile graveyard that is otherwise eligible for moving payments will not be\neligible when it is moved to a site in violation of State, Federal or local\nregulations. (o) An otherwise\neligible owner of an advertising sign or a nonprofit business is not entitled\nto an \"in lieu of\" moving expense payment. (p) If the actual costs incurred by the\neligible person exceed the department's approved limit of moving expenses, the\neligible person may submit to the department a fully detailed explanation for\nthe excess costs. The department's approval limit may be adjusted\naccordingly. (q) The cost of\nnecessary storage for a period not to exceed six months may be considered as\npart of moving expenses and will be subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nMoving expenses may include the cost of\nmoving into dead storage at the prevailing rate in a commercial storage\nfacility or warehouse; no payment will be made for storage on premises owned or\noccupied by the eligible person, members of his immediate family, or his legal\nor financial representative. (2)\n\nIf\npersonal property is subsequently sold or delivered from storage to third\nparties, reimbursement for storage or moving out of storage will not be\nallowed. (r) The costs\nof storage or moving out of storage will not be considered in calculating a\nfigure for determining the extent of participation in any other benefits\ndefined herein. (s) The State will\nnot participate in more than one move of a displaced person unless in the\nopinion of the commission it is in the public interest to do so. (t) In the case of a hardship where advance\npayment of moving expenses is requested, the eligible person must submit in\nadvance a written application setting forth the full extent and circumstances\nof the hardship. A written determination will be made by the department. If the\ndepartment determines a hardship exists, an advanced payment of reasonable\nnecessary moving expenses may be made. (u) In unusual or hardship situations, when\ndetermined to be in the public interest, the commission may authorize a payment\neven though the strict requirements of eligibility specified herein are not\nmet.
