  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 156.4 - Performance evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employees with one year of service in grade as of March 31, 1985 shall be\nevaluated and eligible to receive a performance advance provided they are rated\nand receive a rating higher than unsatisfactory or an equivalent rating. Thereafter, employees with one year of service in grade who receive better than\nunsatisfactory or an equivalent rating shall be eligible to receive performance\nadvances. (b) Supervisors shall\nevaluate eligible employees against a written performance program comprised of\nobjectives, tasks and standards established by the supervisor upon review and\napproval of the reviewer. The approved performance program must be given and\nthoroughly explained to the employee at the onset of the evaluation period. The\nemployee may attach written comments concerning the program; however, such\ncomments shall serve as a formal expression of the employee's point of view and\nnot a change of the performance program. Upon completion of the annual\nevaluation period, the supervisor shall evaluate the employee's actual\nperformance against the standards in the evaluation program. The evaluation\nreport must be reviewed and approved by the reviewer before it is given to the\nemployee. Upon approval of the reviewer, the evaluation report is\nfinal. (c) Employees covered by the\nprovisions of this Part must be on the payroll at the time of rating. When an\nemployee is off the payroll or in less than regular full-time pay status for a\nfull payroll period or more, the employee's rating period is to be extended by\nthe same amount of time (in multiples of full payroll periods). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n156.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
