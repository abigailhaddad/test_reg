  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.7 - Refunds and credits attributable to bad debts\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1132(e), 1139(e)\n(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply for the purpose of\ndetermining entitlement and computation of the refunds and credits authorized\nin this section only. (1)\n\nThe term\nuncollectible\nmeans worthless, as used for federal income tax\npurposes. Legal action to enforce payment when it would probably not result in\nsatisfaction of a judgment upon a showing of the underlying facts is not a\nnecessary prerequisite in determining worthlessness. (2)\n\nThe term retail-vendor\nmeans a vendor of tangible personal property or services, payment for which is\nmade, in whole or in part, by the extension of credit to the purchaser by such\nvendor who is responsible for remitting applicable sales tax to the department\nand includes a lessor-vendor which meets the conditions of paragraph (b)(2) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nThe term\naccount-obligor\nmeans the purchaser of tangible personal\nproperty or services, the receipts of which are paid, in whole or in part, by\nthe extension of credit by the retail-vendor. (4)\n\nThe term\nreceivables of a\nretail-vendor\nmeans indebtedness to the retail-vendor incurred by an\naccount-obligor upon his purchases whether or not subject to the sales and use\ntaxes. (5)\n\nThe term\ncaptive\nfinance company\nmeans a company that meets all of the following\nconditions: (i) it is wholly owned by the\nretail-vendor or is wholly owned by a company which is related to such\nretail-vendor through an unbroken chain of wholly owned companies; (ii)\nit does not finance receivables of any\nvendor other than its retail-vendor or any company related to such\nretail-vendor by an unbroken chain of wholly owned related companies; (iii)\nit does not extend credit to anyone\nother than in the form of the purchase of receivables created as a result of\nextension of credit by the retail-vendor, except that the requirement of this\nsubparagraph shall not be violated by the investment of excess cash funds in\nthe shortor long-term financial markets or by advancing funds to its\nretail-vendor or a company which is related to such retail-vendor through an\nunbroken chain of wholly owned companies; (iv)\nit does not sell receivables to a third\nparty other than a transfer of a receivable to its retail-vendor; and\n(v) it does not receive payments on the\nreceivable directly from the account-obligors. Instead, the foregoing payments, including interest, on the receivable must be made by the account-obligors\ndirectly to the retail-vendor, and must be reported as income by the\nretail-vendor for income and franchise tax purposes. (6)\n\nThe term\nrecourse\nmeans\nthat all bad debts are transferred back to the retail-vendor or such bad debts\nare charged against the retail-vendor's reserve account established for that\npurpose. (b) Allowance of refund or credit. (1)\n\nWhere a receipt, amusement charge, or hotel rent has been ascertained to be\nuncollectible, either in whole or in part, the vendor of the tangible personal\nproperty or services, the recipient of the amusement charges, or the operator\nof the hotel (as such terms are defined in section\n1101\nof the Tax Law) may apply for a refund\nor credit of the tax paid on such receipt, amusement charge, or hotel rent\nwithin three years from the date the tax was payable by such person to the Tax\n\nDepartment. However, no refund or credit shall be allowed based upon the fact\nthat receipts are not actually paid on transactions described in section\n527.15\n(e) of this Title. (2)\nA vendor will be\nconsidered the vendor of the tangible personal property or services giving rise\nto the bad debt even though the property or services are sold by a leased\ndepartment or concession (as described in section\n526.10\n(f) of this Title), provided all the following conditions are met: (i) the leased department or concession\naccounts for and pays over all of its receipts to the lessor-vendor; (ii)\nthe lessor-vendor reports and remits to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance the tax on all of the leased department\nor concession's receipts; and\n(iii)\nthe transfer of all receivables from the leased department or concession to the\nlessor-vendor is made without any discount for any credit transactions which\ninvolve the lessor-vendor's receivables and without recourse to the leased\ndepartment or concession. (3)\nA refund or credit is not available for a\ntransaction which is financed by a third party or for a debt which has been\nassigned to a third party, whether or not such third party has recourse to the\nvendor on that debt. (4)\n\nReceivables transferred to a captive finance company by its retail-vendor (as\nsuch terms are defined in subdivision [a] of this section) will not be treated\nas debts assigned to a third party provided the following conditions are met: (i) such captive finance company has recourse\n(as defined in paragraph [a][6] of this section) on all bad debts to the\ntransferor retail-vendor; and\n(ii)\nannually (for a period determined from June 1st to May 31st of each year) not\nmore than 10 percent of the receivables of the retail-vendor are incurred by\naccount obligors upon purchases from any vendor other than the retail-vendor or\na leased department or concession of the retail-vendor which meets the\nconditions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision. Though a retail-vendor is not denied eligibility for the\nrefund or credit with respect to debts determined to be uncollectible with\nrespect to its receivables financed by a captive finance company if no more\nthan 10 percent of its receivables (whether or not financed by the captive\nfinance company) are derived from sales of any vendor other than the\nretail-vendor or a leased department or concession of such retail-vendor which\nmeets the conditions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, there is no refund\nor credit allowable to such retail-vendor with respect to any receivables\nderived from sales of such other vendors. (c) Computation of refund or\ncredit. (1)\n\nOnly the amount\nattributable to the sales tax imposed and remitted to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance by the vendor remaining unpaid by the customer to the\nvendor is allowable as a refund or credit in respect of a debt determined to be\nuncollectible. (2)\n\nWhere the debt\ndetermined to be uncollectible and charged off by a vendor is comprised in part\nof nontaxable charges (such as interest, service and finance charges, charges\nfor purchases delivered out-of-state by the vendor, or charges otherwise exempt\nor excluded from the State and local sales and use taxes) and in part of\ncharges subject to the New York sales and use taxes, a refund or credit may be\nclaimed only with respect to the proportionate amount of the New York sales and\nuse taxes attributable to the amount of the unpaid taxable charges remaining in\nsuch debt and only to the extent that the tax was remitted to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. Such proportionate amount may be computed by determining: (i) the tax imposed and remitted upon the\nunpaid amount of taxable charges in an account, or\n(ii)\nthe unpaid amount of New York sales tax\nin an account. (3)\n\nPayments upon an account shall be first applied to the oldest charges in the\naccount. These payments must be divided proportionately between the taxable and\nthe nontaxable components, if any, of such charges. (4)\n\nThough interest, service and finance\ncharges may be considered in the computation of the bad debt refund or credit, since payments are first applied to the oldest charges in an account, later\naccruing interest, service and finance charges upon inactive accounts generally\ndo not affect the amount of such refund or credit. Example 1: The following is an analysis of an account that was written\noff as a bad debt. Charges to account\n\nPayments made\n\nFeb. Sale price\n$250\n4 at $25 each (March - June)\n\nFeb. Sales tax\n20\n\nTotal $100\n\nJuly - Dec. service charge for late payment\n30\n\nTotal\n$300\n\nAs of the date the account was charged off on the vendor's\nbooks as uncollectible, the balance due was $200. This balance was determined\nby adding together the sale price, sales tax and service charge for a total of\n$300 and deducting payments of $100. Only that portion of the $200 bad debt\nthat represents amounts on which the vendor collected and remitted sales tax to\nthe department is included in the computation of the bad debt credit or refund. Therefore the composition of this $200 must be ascertained. However, since paragraph (3) of this subdivision requires\nthat payments received on account be applied first to the oldest charges in the\naccount, before the composition of the $200 bad debt can be determined, a\ncomputation must be made wherein the customer's payments are so applied. In\nthis example, in applying the payments to the oldest charges in the account, the entire $100 is absorbed by the first charge to the account\n(\ni.e., the February sale of $250 and the sales tax on that\namount of $20, or a total of $270). Subtracting the $100 in payments from the\n$270 in charges leaves a partial bad debt of $170. Since the $270 was composed\nof the sale price and the sales tax, the $170 partial bad debt consists of\nthese items as well, and in the same proportion. The composition of this $170\nmay be computed as follows: Sale price\n250\n× 170 = $157.41\n\nProportionate sale price\n\nTotal sales price and tax\n270\n\nSales tax\n20\n× 170 = $ 12.59\n\nProportionate sales tax\n\nTotal sales price and tax\n270\n\nOnce the payments on account have been applied to the\noldest charges in the account and any proportionate amount of bad debt subject\nto refund or credit has been ascertained, the balance of the outstanding\ncharges to the account are reviewed to determine their taxable or nontaxable\nstatus. In this example, only one charge to the account remains unaccounted for\n- the $30 service charge for December. Since sales tax is not imposed on this\ntype of charge (and should not have been collected), no refund or credit is\navailable with respect to it. Proportionate sale price\n$157.41\n\nProportionate sales tax\n12.59\n\nService charges\n30.00\n\nTotal\n$200.00\n\nThus, the bad debt refund or credit for sales tax is\n$12.59. Example 2: Assume the same facts as in Example 1, except that the bad\ndebt write-off occurred after $250 had been paid on account. The uncollected\nbalance of the account is $50 ($300 minus $250). As in Example 1, the $250 in\npayments is applied to the oldest charges in the account\n(\ni.e., $270) leaving a partial bad debt of $20. The\ncomposition of this $20 would be computed as follows: Sale price\n250\n× 20 = $18.52\n\nProportionate sale price\n\nTotal sale price and tax\n270\n\nSales tax\n20\n× 20 = $ 1.48\n\nProportionate sales tax\n\nTotal sale price and tax\n270\n\nThe account's remaining unpaid balance of $50 due is\ncomposed of: Proportionate sale price\n$18.52\n\nProportionate sales tax\n1.48\n\nService charges\n30.00\n\nTotal\n$50.00\n\nThus, the bad debt refund or credit for sales tax would be\n$1.48. Again, no refund or credit is available with respect to the $30 in\nservice charges, since late payment service charges are not subject to sales or\nuse tax. If the customer had paid at least $270, no bad debt refund or credit\nfor sales tax would be allowed the vendor. Example 3: The following is an analysis of an account that became a\nbad debt: Charges to account\n\nPayments made\n\nJan. Sale price (exempt)\n$200\n4 at $60 each\n\nJan.-June: Finance charges\n15\n\nTotal $240\n\nJuly: Sale price\n100\n\nSales tax at 8%\n8\n\nJuly-Sept.: Finance charges\n5\n\nTotal\n$328\n\nAs of the date the account was written off on the vendor's\nbooks as uncollectible, the balance due was $88 ($328 minus $240). The $240\npaid is applied first to the oldest charges in the account. This $240 is\nsufficient to cover the entire $200 exempt sale in January and the finance\ncharges of $15 for the period January through June. Since the total of these\ntwo amounts is $215, there remains $25 ($240 minus $215) to be applied to the\nnext oldest account charges, which is the July sales price of $100 and the\nrelated $8 in sales tax ($108). Subtracting the remaining $25 in payments from\nthe $108 leaves a partial bad debt for sales tax computation purposes of $83. Since the $108 was composed of the sale price of $100 and the sales tax of $8, the $83 partial bad debt consists of these items, in the same proportion. The\ncomposition of this $83 may be computed as follows: Sale price\n100\n× 83 = $76.85\n\nProportionate sales price\n\nTotal sale price and tax\n108\n\nSales tax\n8\n× 83 = $ 6.15\n\nProportionate sales tax\n\nTotal sale price and tax\n108\n\nThe composition of the unpaid balance due is: Proportionate sale price\n$76.85\n\nProportionate sales tax\n6.15\n\nFinance charges (July-Sept.)\n5.00\n\nTotal\n$88.00\n\nThus, the bad debt refund or credit for sales tax would be\n$6.15. Example 4: Between January and October a building supply company\ndelivered materials to a contractor at several construction sites in different\nlocalities and billed the contractor's account. The contractor's account with\nthe vendor is later determined to be uncollectible and charged off on the\nvendor's books. Month\n\nAmount of sale\n\nDelivery charges\n\nTax amount\n\nJuris\n\nTax rate\n(Payments)\n\nBalance\n\nJan. $10,000\n$ 250\n$ 615\n\nCity X\n6%\n$\n$10,865\n\nFeb. 5,000\n5,865\n\nMarch\n15,000\n300\n612\n\nCounty A\n4%\n2,500\n19,277\n\nApril\n7,000\n12,277\n\nMay\n25,000\n100\n\nCounty B\nExempt\n5,000\n32,377\n\nJune\n25,000\n7,377\n\nJuly\n10,000\n200\n714\n\nCounty B\n7%\n5,000\n13,291\n\nAug. 10,000\n300\n618\n\nCity X\n6%\n5,000\n19,209\n\nSept. 5,000\n200\n\nCounty C\n4%\n10,000\n14,409\n\nOct. 10,000\n\nCounty A\nExempt\n5,000\n19,409\n$85,000\n$1,150\n$2,759\n$69,500\n\nSummary of Charges\n\nMonth\n\nTotal charges\n\nCumulative charges\n\nJan. $10,865\n$10,865\n\nMarch\n15,912\n26,777\n\nMay\n25,100\n51,877\n\nJuly\n10,914\n62,791\n\nAug. 10,918\n73,709\n\nSept. 5,200\n78,909\n\nOct. 10,000\n88,909\n\nThe $69,500 paid is applied first to the oldest charges in\nthe account. This $69,500 is sufficient to cover the charges to the account\nthrough July, of $62,791. Consequently, there are $6,709 in payments to be\napplied to the charges to the account for August of $10,918 ($10,000 + $300 +\n$618). Subtracting the $6,709 from the $10,918 leaves a partial\nbad debt of $4,209 for the August charges. Since the August charges of $10,918\nwere composed of the sale price ($10,000), the delivery charges ($300) and\nsales tax ($618), the partial bad debt of $4,209 for august is composed of\nthese items, in the same proportion. The composition of this $4,209 may be\ncomputed as follows: Sale price and delivery\n10,300\n× 4,209 = $3,970.75\n\nTotal sale price, delivery and tax\n10,918\n\nSales tax\n618\n× 4,209 = 238.25\n\nTotal sale price, delivery and tax\n10,918\n\nThe account's total unpaid balance due of $19,409 is\ncomposed of: Proportionate amount of sale (including delivery) for\n\nAugust\n$3,970.75\n\nProportionate amount of sales tax on sale for\n\nAugust\n238.25\n\nAmount of sale for September\n5,000.00\n\nSales tax on September sale\n200.00\n\nAmount of exempt sale for October\n10,000.00\n\nTotal\n$19,409.00\n\nThus, the bad debt refund or credit is the total of the\nuncollected portion of the tax on the August sale of $238.25 and the\nuncollected tax on the September sale of $200.00, or $438.25. Example 5: Assume the same facts as in Example 4, except that instead\nof the August sale of $10,000 to City X at the six percent tax rate, the\nsupplier delivered materials to four jobs sites in August, as follows: State and Local\n\nTax\n\nDelivery\n\nJurisdiction\n\nRate\n\nMaterials\n\nCharges\n\nTax\n\nTotal\n\nCounty A\n5%\n$ 832\n$ 40\n$ 43.60\n$ 915.60\n\nCounty B\n7%\n5,000\n120\n358.40\n5,478.40\n\nCity X\n6%\n3,500\n100\n216.00\n3,816.00\n\nCounty B\n7%\n668\n40\n\nExempt\n708.00\n\nTotal\n$10,000\n$300\n$618.00\n$10,918.00\n\nIn Example 4 it was determined that there was a partial bad\ndebt for August of $4,209. The portion of this bad debt attributable to\nuncollected sales tax in August for each of the jurisdictions for which tax was\nremitted to the department may be determined as follows: Partial Bad Debt\n\nUncollected Sales\n\nTax\n\nCounty A tax\n43.60\n× 4,209 =\n$ 16.81\n\nTotal sale price, delivery and tax\n10,918\n\nCounty B tax\n358.40\n× 4,209 =\n138.17\n\nTotal sale price, delivery and tax\n10,918\n\nCity X tax\n216\n× 4,209 =\n83.27\n\nTotal sale price, delivery and tax\n10,918\n238.25\n(5)\n\nOther methods of calculation of the refund or credit, not inconsistent with the\nprinciples herein expressed, fairly and equitably apportioning taxable and\nnontaxable elements of a bad debt and computing the amount of sales tax imposed\nand remitted in respect of such taxable charges remaining unpaid on such debt, may, subject to the approval of the Department of Taxation and Finance, be used\nto compute such refund or credit where the volume and character of the\nuncollectible accounts is of such a magnitude as to warrant use of alternative\ncomputations. (d) Procedures. (1)\n\nNo credit or refund may\nbe sought until an account has been found to be uncollectible and has been\nactually charged off for federal income tax purposes. (2)\n\nAn application for refund or credit, in\nrespect of the sales taxes collected and remitted upon a debt which has been\nfound to be uncollectible and charged off, shall be filed with the Department\nof Taxation and Finance within three years from the date the tax was payable by\nthe applicant to the Department of Taxation and Finance. The applicant may, as\npart of the application for credit, take such credit on the return which is due\ncoincident with or immediately subsequent to the time such debt is charged off\nand the application filed. (3)\n\nThe\napplication for refund or credit shall be subject to the provisions of\nsubdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of section\n1139\nof the\n\nTax Law and section\n534.2\nof this Part. (4)\nA schedule of the\ncomputation of the State and local taxes for which refund or credit is sought\nmust be attached to the return upon which such credit is taken, or the\napplication for refund. (e) Subsequent collection. (1)\n\nIf a vendor later collects, in whole or\nin part, any amounts attributable to a debt determined to be uncollectible\nwhich was charged off and in respect of which a refund was granted or a credit\ntaken, the tax on the amount so collected must be reported to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance on, and remitted with, the next return due after such\ncollection. (2)\n\nIn determining the\namount of subsequent collections upon a debt determined to be uncollectible, for which refund or credit of sales tax was previously allowed attributable to\ntax, such collection should be allocated to taxable charges, nontaxable charges\nand taxes in the same manner as regular payments to such account. (f) Interest. Credits or refunds of tax attributable to bad debts will be\nmade without interest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
