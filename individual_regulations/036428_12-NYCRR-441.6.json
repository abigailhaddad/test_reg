  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 441.6 - Review by the Board of a Prior Authorization Denial\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If\nthe Carrier's Physician issues a denial or a partial approval, the medical\nprovider may seek review by the Board's Medical Director's Office. The medical\nprovider may not seek review by the Board's Medical Director's Office unless\nthe medical provider has received a denial or partial approval by the Carriers'\nPhysician. (b) All requests for\nreview of denials or partial approvals of a Prior Authorization request shall\nbe submitted to the Medical Director's Office in the format prescribed by the\n\nChair. The Chair or Medical Director may designate private entities to evaluate\nsuch requests for review of denials by a Carrier's Physician provided that the\nentity has: 1. the appropriate URAC\naccreditation or such accreditation/certification as designated by the\n\nChair, 2. other demonstrated\nexpertise and criteria established by the Board; and\n3. no conflict of interest exists in\nresolving the subject dispute. (c) When a prescribing medical provider\nwishes to request review of a denial or partial approval of a Prior\n\nAuthorization request, the medical provider shall submit the request to the\n\nMedical Director's Office in the format prescribed by the Chair within 10\ncalendar days of the denial date together with all documentation submitted in\nsupport of its First and Second level carrier review, and the denial or partial\napproval issued following such First and Second level reviews. (d) A decision by the Medical Director's\n\nOffice (or designated accredited entity) is final and binding on the medical\nprovider, the carrier, self-insured employer or pharmacy network. Such decision\nshall be binding and not appealable under Workers' Compensation Law section\n23. (e) Notwithstanding paragraph\n(d) herein, a claimant may request review of a Medical Director's Office\ndecision, by filing a Request for Further Action, that demonstrates that such\ndrug is medical necessary and denial or Prior Authorization adversely impacts\nthe claimant's interests. The Board may respond to such requests for review by\nletter or by referral to adjudication, as appropriate in the discretion of the\n\nChair or his or her designee. Such decisions shall be binding and not\nappealable under Workers' Compensation Law section 23. (f) In the event that a Prior Authorization\nrequest is denied on the merits, the medical provider may not submit a request\nfor Prior Authorization for the same prescription unless he or she submits\nevidence that there has been a change in the claimant's medical condition that\nrenders the denial of the request for Prior Authorization no longer applicable\nto the claimant's current medical condition.
