Tit. 1 § 159.18 - Aids to Enforcement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nCommissioner shall have full access to all premises, buildings, factories, farms, where activities regulated by Article 29 of the Agriculture and Markets\n(\"Article 29\") law are licensed or occur, including vehicles, cars, boats, airplanes, vessels, containers, packages, barrels, boxes, tubs and/or cans for\nthe purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article. The Commissioner may, at such locations, examine hemp and hemp products and may open any package\nand/or container reasonably believed to contain hemp or hemp products, to\ndetermine whether it is in violation of Article 29 or any rule or regulation of\nthis Part. (b) The Commissioner may\nseek an inspection warrant when he or she reasonably believes a violation of\n\nArticle 29 or any rule or regulation of this Part has occurred or is occurring\nand that a licensee or an individual or entity authorized to conduct research\npursuant to Article 29 has: refused to permit any hemp to be inspected or\nsamples taken therefrom; refused to permit access to any premises or place\nwhere licensed activities are conducted; and/or refused to permit access\nthereto by any inspector of the Department and that such inspector has\nreasonable grounds to believe that such person has any hemp in his or her\npossession or under his or her control and/or is in violation of Article 29 or\nany rule or regulation of this Part. In such a case, a warrant may be issued in\nthe name of the people, directed to the Commissioner, his or her employees, and/or police officers, commanding him, her or them to: (1)\nsearch any place of business, factory, building, premises, farm where licensed activities have occurred and any\nvehicle, car, boat, airplane, vessel, container, package, barrel, box, tub\nand/or can, containing, or believed to contain, hemp in the possession or under\nthe control of any person who shall refuse to allow access to such hemp for\ninspection or sampling; (2)\npermit\nthe inspection and sampling of any hemp found in the execution of the warrant, as the officer applying for the inspection warrant shall designate when the\nsame is found, by an inspector or a Department official authorized by the\n\nCommissioner or by the agriculture and markets law; and/or\n(3)\npermit access to any place where access\nis refused or prevented, and to allow and enable a Department inspector or\nother Department official or police officer to conduct an inspection of the\nplace. The officer to whom the warrant is delivered shall make a return in\nwriting of his proceedings thereunto to the court which issued the\nsame. (c) The\n\nCommissioner or his/her designee may quarantine hemp when he or she has reason\nto believe that the hemp does not meet the definition of hemp or if hemp or\nhemp products is/are maintained, processed, or marketed in violation of or\ndoes/do not meet a standard set forth in Article 29 or this Part. The\nquarantine may be put into effect by the issuance of an order directing the\nowner or custodian of hemp and/or hemp products not to distribute, dispose of, or move that commodity without the written permission of the Commissioner. The\n\nCommissioner may also quarantine hemp or hemp products by placing a tag or\nother appropriate marking on the hemp or hemp product or adjacent thereto that\nprovides and requires that such product must not be distributed, disposed of, or moved without his or her written permission, or may quarantine a product or\neffect a stop sale direction by otherwise informing the owner or custodian\nthereof that such condition must be complied with. (d) Whenever the Commissioner has reason to\nbelieve that any hemp is being maintained or distributed in violation of any\nprovision, rule or regulation of Article 29 or this Part, the Commissioner may\nissue a stop sale order to the owner or custodian of such suspect lot and\nenforce the same against such person. Any such order may direct that the hemp\nor hemp products be removed from distribution and retained at the establishment\nwhere the hemp or hemp products is/are located. It shall be a violation of this\nsection for the owner or custodian of any hemp served with or otherwise aware\nof, and affected by, a stop sale order, to sell barter, give away, use, or\notherwise remove such hemp from the place of retention without prior written\napproval of the Commissioner. (e) The Commissioner may seize hemp by taking physical possession of hemp when the\n\nCommissioner has substantial evidence to believe that the commodity does not\nmeet the definition of hemp or is otherwise in violation of or does not meet a\nstandard set forth in Article 29 or this Part. (f) Subsequent to quarantining, issuing a\nstop sale order, or seizing hemp or hemp product, as authorized in subdivisions\n(c), (d) and (e) of this section, the Commissioner shall promptly give the\nowner or custodian thereof notice and an opportunity to be heard to show cause\nwhy such hemp or hemp products should not be ordered destroyed. The\n\nCommissioner shall, thereafter, consider all the relevant evidence and\ninformation presented and shall determine whether such hemp should be ordered\nto be destroyed. The Commissioner shall notify the owner and custodian in\nwriting of the specific reason or reasons for the determination. Such\ndetermination may be reviewed as provided in article seventy-eight of the civil\npractice law and rules. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
