  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 216.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The definitions\nin this section are specific to this Part. Additional definitions applying to\nthis Part and other Parts in this Chapter are found in section\n200.1. (b) Basic oxygen furnace tapping. The process\nwhereby molten steel is poured from a basic oxygen furnace vessel into a\nteeming ladle. (c) Blast furnace\ntapping. The process whereby molten iron and slag drain from a blast furnace\ntap hole. (d) Fluxing. The process\nwhereby flux materials are added to a basic oxygen furnace vessel during\nlancing. (e) Iron and/or steel\nprocesses. Processes commonly associated with or necessary to production of\niron and steel, excluding ferro alloys, including, but not limited to the\nfollowing: (1)\nmaterials handling systems, including, but not limited to systems for handling iron ore, ore pellets, coal, limestone, fluxes, scrap steel sinter, coke, steel alloying ingredients, slag\nand dust; (2)\nblast furnaces for\nmaking iron; (3)\nsintering\nprocesses such as agglomeration including sintering and handling of\nagglomerated materials, but excluding iron-ore beneficiating processes and\nprocesses occurring prior to iron-ore agglomeration such as washing, screening, crushing, blending and materials handling; (4)\nbasic oxygen furnaces open hearths and\nelectric furnaces; (5)\niron and/or\nsteel furnaces, except furnaces in jobbing foundries; (6)\nmolten material transfer and processing\noperations, including but not limited to teeming, tapping, reladling and\ncasting; (7)\ncontinuous casting\noperations; (8)\nscarfing and other\nsurface defect removal operations, except those in jobbing foundries; (9)\nscrap preparation, including scrap\nmelting and burning operations; (10)\nmolten metal desulfurization\noperations; (11)\nraw material\ndrying systems; and\n(12)\nprocess\nfurnaces, including soaking pits, annealing furnaces, reheating furnaces and\nother process furnaces using direct heat transfer. (f) Lancing. The process whereby oxygen is\nblown into a charged basic oxygen furnace vessel. (g) Lower Orange County metropolitan area. The area including the towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury. (h) New York City metropolitan area. All of the city of New York, and Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester and Rockland Counties. (i) Potential to emit. The maximum capacity\nof an air contamination source to emit any air contaminant under its physical\nand operational design. Any physical or operational limitation on the capacity\nof the facility or air contamination source to emit any air contaminant, including air pollution control equipment and/or restriction on the hours of\noperation, or on the type or amount of material combusted, stored, or\nprocessed, shall be treated as part of the design only if the limitation is\ncontained in enforceable permit conditions. Fugitive emissions, to the extent\nthat they are quantifiable, are included in determining the potential to\nemit. (j) Reasonably available\ncontrol technology (RACT). Lowest emission limit that a particular source is\ncapable of meeting by application of control technology that is reasonably\navailable, considering technological and economic\nfeasibility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n216.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
