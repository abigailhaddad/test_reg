Subpart 373-3)\nRECORDKEEPING INSTRUCTIONS\nThe recordkeeping provisions of section\n373-2.5\n(c) and\n373-3.5\n(c) specify\nthat an owner or operator must keep a written operating record at the facility. This Appendix provides additional instructions for keeping portions of the\noperating record. The following information must be recorded, as it becomes\navailable, and maintained in the operating record until closure of the facility\nin the following manner: Records of each hazardous waste received, treated, stored or\ndisposed of at the facility, which include the following: (i) A description by its common name and the EPA Hazardous\n\nWaste Number(s) from 6 NYCRR Part\n371\nwhich apply to the waste. The waste\ndescription also must include the waste's physical form, i.e., liquid, sludge, solid or contained gas. If the waste is not listed in section\n371.4, the description also must\ninclude the process that produced it (for example, solid filter cake from\nproduction of _______, EPA Hazardous Waste Number W051). Each hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4, and each hazardous waste\ncharacteristic defined in section\n371.3, has a four-digit EPA\nHazardous Waste Number assigned to it. This number must be used for\nrecordkeeping and reporting purposes. Where a hazardous waste contains more\nthan one listed hazardous waste, or where more than one hazardous waste\ncharacteristic applies to the waste, the waste description must include all\napplicable EPA Hazardous Waste Numbers. (ii) The estimated or manifest-reported weight, or volume and\ndensity, where applicable, in one of the units of measure specified in Table\n1. (iii) The method(s) (by handling code[s] as specified in\n\nTable 2) and date(s) of treatment, storage or disposal.
