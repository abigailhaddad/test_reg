  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4249.4 - Eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Eligible\napplicants shall include, but not be limited to, business improvement\ndistricts, local development corporations, economic development organizations, for profit businesses, not-for-profit corporations, public benefit\ncorporations, municipalities, counties, research and academic institutions, incubators, technology parks, private firms, regional planning councils, tourist attractions and community facilities. (b) The corporation shall be eligible for\nassistance in the form of loans, grants, or monies contributing to projects for\nwhich the corporation or a subsidiary act as developer. (1)\n\nThe corporation may act as developer in\nthe acquisition, renovation, construction, leasing or sale of development\nprojects authorized pursuant to this program in order to stimulate private\nsector investment within the affected community. (2)\n\nIn acting as a developer, the corporation\nmay borrow for purposes of this subdivision for approved projects in which the\nlender's recourse is solely to the assets of the project, and may make such\narrangements and agreements with community-based organizations and local\ndevelopment corporations as may be required to carry out the purposes of this\nsection. (3)\n\nPrior to developing\nany such project, the corporation shall secure a firm commitment from entities, independent of the corporation, for the purchase or lease of such project. Such\nfirm commitment shall be evidenced by a memorandum of understanding or other\ndocument describing the intent of the parties. (4)\n\nProjects authorized under this\nsubdivision whether developed by the corporation or a private developer, must\nbe located in distressed communities, for which there is demonstrated demand\nwithin the particular community. (c) Program assistance is available for the\nfollowing funding tracks: (1)\n\nBusiness\ninvestment. Business investments are capital expenditures that facilitate an\nemployer's ability to create new jobs in New York State or retain jobs that are\notherwise in jeopardy. Such jobs otherwise in jeopardy include, but are not\nlimited to, jobs in danger of being eliminated, having hours and/or wages\nreduced or relocated outside of New York State. Within the business investment\ntrack, five-year job commitments will be required of all beneficiaries; it is\nby underwriting these job commitments that ESDC is best able to forecast the\neconomic benefits of providing assistance to any particular project. Applicants\nwill therefore be required to commit to the number of jobs at risk that will be\nretained by the proposed project, the number of new jobs that will be created\nby the project, and the average salaries of each. Failure to achieve or\nmaintain these employment commitments will subject a beneficiary to potential\nrecapture of assistance. (2)\n\nInfrastructure investment. The funds will finance infrastructure investments in\norder to attract new businesses and expand existing businesses, thereby\nfostering further investment. Infrastructure investments are capital\nexpenditures for infrastructure including transportation, water and sewer, communication, and energy generation and distribution. Infrastructure also\nincludes the construction of parking garages. Unlike the other two tracks, infrastructure investment may be used to finance planning or feasibility\nstudies relating to capital expenditures. The infrastructure investment track\nis appropriate only for infrastructure activity for unidentified end-users or\nfor multiple users; infrastructure projects that will serve a single identified\nentity must apply for assistance under the business investment track, which may\nbe used to fund infrastructure expenses. Although projects without identified\nusers may be funded under the infrastructure investment track, preference under\nthis track will be given to projects with identified tenants. (i) Job commitments: infrastructure\ninvestment projects that are able to provide job commitments will be viewed\nfavorably. However, it is important to note that: (a) few infrastructure investment projects\nare anticipated to be able to provide job commitments; and\n(b) if the employer will be an entity other\nthan the applicant, a third party guarantee of the applicant's job commitment\nmust be provided by the prospective employer and that prospective employer must\nbe found by ESDC to be creditworthy. (3)\n\nDowntown redevelopment. Downtown\nneighborhoods - whether major commercial areas of big cities or one block\nstretches of village main streets - are important generators of economic\nactivity in New York State. In an effort to strengthen these cores of commerce, the downtown redevelopment track will finance rehabilitation and new\nconstruction in downtown areas statewide. Funding will be available for a range\nof commercial uses, including retail, office and commercial. Funding will also\nbe available for projects that are likely to increase tourism, including\nhotels, cultural institutions and entertainment facilities, and streetscape\nimprovements. This track will not be used to finance speculative development, and therefore only projects in which 60 percent of the square footage has been\npre-leased generally will be considered. (i) Job commitments: downtown redevelopment projects that are able to provide job\ncommitments will be viewed favorably. However, it is important to note that: (a) few downtown redevelopment projects are\nanticipated to be able to provide job commitments; and\n(b) if the employer will be an entity other\nthan the applicant, a third party guarantee of the applicant's job commitment\nmust be provided by the prospective employer and that prospective employer must\nbe found by ESDC to be creditworthy. (d) No full-time employee of the State or\nfull-time employee of any agency, department, authority or public benefit\ncorporation (or any subsidiary of a public benefit corporation) of the State\nshall be eligible to receive assistance under this initiative, nor shall any\nbusiness, the majority ownership interest of which is beneficially controlled\nby any such employee, be eligible for assistance under this\ninitiative.
