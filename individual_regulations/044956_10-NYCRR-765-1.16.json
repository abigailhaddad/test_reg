  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 765-1.16 - Determinations of public need\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nprocess of determining need in this section will be used in the evaluation of\ncertificate of need applications requiring a review of the public need by the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council. (b) Planning areas. The commissioner shall\ndesignate each county as a separate planning area. (c) Determination of need. (1)\n\nThere shall be a rebuttable presumption\nof no need for additional licensed home care service agencies in a planning\narea if there are 5 or more Licensed Home Care Service Agencies (LHCSA)\nactively serving patients within the planning area as of April 1, 2020. Beginning in 2021, the commissioner shall have the authority to adjust the\ntarget date for determining need for additional LHCSAs in a planning area, in\nsubsequent years. (2)\n\nApplications\nfor licensure based on change of ownership for Licensed Home Care Service\n\nAgencies actively serving at least 25 patients will not be subject to public\nneed review and shall be evaluated only on financial feasibility and the\ncharacter and competence of the proposed operator unless the proposed operator\nseeks to serve patients outside of the approved planning area. (3)\n\nThe determination of need for licensed\nhome care service agencies in accordance with this subdivision does not include\nlicensed home care services agencies affiliated with an Assisted Living Program\n(ALP), Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly (PACE), Nurse Family\n\nPartnership (NFP), or Continuing Care Retirement Community (CCRC). ALP, PACE, NFP, or CCRC-affiliated agencies are not subject to the public need review\nunless the agency seeks to serve patients outside the ALP, NFP, or CCRC\nprograms or who are not PACE members. For the purpose of this paragraph, affiliated shall mean common ownership. Any limitation on the population an\nagency is allowed to serve resulting from an exemption made under this\nparagraph shall be noted on the LHCSA's license. (4)\n\nThe department shall review the adequacy\nof the need methodology set forth under paragraph (1) of this subdivision and\nissue a report to the commissioner, the Public Health and Planning Council, and\nother interested parties at the discretion of the Department of Health no later\nthan three years from adoption. (d) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis section, factors to be considered when determining need for licensed home\ncare service agencies shall include, but are not limited to: (1)\nthe demographics and/or health status of\nthe residents in the planning area or the state, as applicable; (2)\ndocumented evidence of the unduplicated\nnumber of patients on waiting lists who are appropriate for and desire\nadmission to a licensed home care service agency but who experience a long\nwaiting time for placement; (3)\nthe\nnumber and capacity of currently operating licensed home care services\nagencies; (4)\nthe quality of\nservices provided by existing agencies; (5)\nthe availability and accessibility of the\nworkforce; (6)\npersonnel and\nresources dedicated to adding and training additional members of the workforce\nincluding committed resources in an organized training program; (7)\ncultural competency of existing agencies; and\n(8)\nsubpopulations requiring\nspecialty services. When making recommendations to the Public Health and\n\nHealth Planning Council concerning the impact of the factors set forth above, the department shall, to the extent practicable, indicate the relative priority\nof such factors. (e) In addition to meeting the other\napplicable provisions of this section, an applicant for initial certification\nshall be approved as meeting public need only if the applicant agrees to serve\npopulation groups in the planning area that have difficulty gaining access to\nappropriate licensed home care service agency care due to minority status, age, medical history, case complexity, payment source, or geographic\nlocation. (f) Any application\nwherein a determination of public need is made pursuant to this section shall\nbe subject to the following: (1)\n\nThe Public\n\nHealth and Health Planning Council and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, may, during the processing of an application, propose to disapprove the\napplication solely on the basis of a determination of public need in advance of\nthe consideration of the other review criteria required by article 36 of the\n\nPublic Health Law without, however, waiving the right to consider such other\ncriteria at a later date. (2)\n\nIn\nthe event the Public Health and Health Planning Council and/or the commissioner\nproposes to disapprove an application on the basis of a lack of public need and\nthe applicant requests a hearing according to the provisions provided in\n\nSection\n765-1.9\nof this Title, the Public\n\nHealth and Health Planning Council and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, may\ndirect the completion of the other reviews required by Article 36 of the Public\n\nHealth Law. The application shall then be returned to the Public Health and\n\nHealth Planning Council and/or the commissioner as appropriate, to consider\nsuch reviews, the results of which may then be included as grounds for the\nproposed disapproval to be considered at the hearing. If the Public Health and\n\nHealth Planning Council and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, directs the\ncompletion of such reviews, a copy of the report containing the results of the\nreviews shall be mailed to the applicant at least 60 days prior to the date set\nfor hearing. (3)\n\nIn the processing\nof an establishment application, the commissioner may recommend disapproval\nbased on a review limited to a determination of public need. In the event the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council does not concur with the\ncommissioner's recommendation of disapproval, it shall return the application\nto the department at which time all other required reviews shall be completed. When all other reviews are completed, the application shall be returned to the\n\nPublic Health and Health Planning Council for action. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
