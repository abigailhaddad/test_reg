  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.6 - Investment by a mutual savings institution in a mutual fund listed on a national securities exchange\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether a mutual fund which is\nlisted on a national securities exchange is an eligible investment for a mutual\nsavings institution. The department answered the question in the negative for\nthe following reason. There is a specific Banking Law provision dealing with\ninvestments in mutual funds, section 235(26)(e). Under it savings banks are\nauthorized to invest in mutual funds only if such mutual funds are owned by\nsavings banks or savings and loan associations and invest only in investments\nwhich are eligible for savings banks. This limitation was imposed because\nsavings banks may only invest in certain types of common stock which meet\ncertain quality standards, while mutual funds are not subject to such\nrestrictions. To read section 235(26)(e) as anything other than exclusive would\nrender that provision meaningless and authorize savings banks to do indirectly\nthat which they can not do directly. DATED: January 2, 1970\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
