  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.5 - Manifest system, recordkeeping and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of both onsite and offsite facilities, except that subdivisions (b)\nand (f) do not apply to owners and operators of onsite facilities that do not\nreceive any hazardous waste from offsite sources. (b) Manifest requirements. A treatment, storage or disposal facility shipping\nhazardous wastes off-site or offering hazardous wastes for shipment off-site\nmust comply with all generator standards as specified in section\n372.2\nof this Title. If a facility\nreceives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner or operator, or\nhis or her agent, must comply with the requirements of this subdivision. (1)\n\nUse of manifest system. (i) (a) If\na facility receives hazardous waste accompanied by a manifest, the owner, operator or his/her agent must: (1)\ncomplete\nline 19 of the manifest, hazardous waste report management method codes, for\neach waste received and accepted, using the codes established in the annual\nreport instructions and forms referenced in subdivision (e) of this section; and\n(2)\nsign and date the manifest\nas indicated in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph to certify\nthat the hazardous waste covered by the manifest was received, that the\nhazardous waste was received except as noted in the discrepancy space of the\nmanifest, or that the hazardous waste was rejected as noted in the manifest\ndiscrepancy space. (b) If a facility receives a hazardous waste shipment accompanied by a manifest, the owner, operator or his/her agent must: (1)\ndetermine that all portions of the\nmanifest, except that portion filled out by the owner or operator of the\nfacility, have been completed. For example, if the facility is not providing a\nhazardous waste management code in item 19 that reflects the ultimate disposal\nmethod for the waste, the State code in box 13 designating the ultimate\ndisposal method for the hazardous waste is completed. A completed form includes\nsignatures and all certifications required from the generator and the initial\nand delivering transporters. In those cases where the owner or operator\ncompletes any of the generator's portions of the manifest (items 1-14), the\nowner or operator assumes joint responsibility with the generator for the\naccuracy and completeness of those portions he or she completed; (2)\nsign and date, by hand, each copy of the\nmanifest; (3)\nnote any\ndiscrepancies (as defined in clause [d] of this subparagraph) on each copy of\nthe manifest; (4)\nimmediately give\nthe transporter at least one copy of the manifest; (5)\nwithin 10 calendar days of delivery, mail\na copy of the manifest to the generator, the generator state and the\ndestination state (if different from the generator state), making legible\nphotocopies as necessary. Mail the department copy to New York State Department\nof Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-7252. Facilities\ndo not need to distribute manifest copies to states other than New York, if\nthose states do not require such a copy be submitted to them; and\n(6)\nretain at the facility a copy of each\nmanifest for a least three years from the date of delivery. (c) If a facility receives\nhazardous waste imported from a foreign source, the receiving facility must\nalso mail a copy of the manifest and documentation confirming EPA's consent to\nthe import of hazardous waste to the following address within 30 days of\ndelivery: Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, Office of\n\nFederal Activities, International Compliance Assurance Division (2254A), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC\n20460\n\nNote: For purposes of reference only: The owner or operator of\na recovery facility that has arranged to receive hazardous waste from an OECD\nMember country, as defined in section\n372.5\n(h)(1)\nof\nthis Title, must also meet the requirement of\n40 CFR\n265.71(d)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title). (d) Manifest discrepancies are: (1)\nsignificant\ndifferences between the quantity (as defined by clause [e] of this\nsubparagraph) or type (as defined by clause [f] of this subparagraph) of\nhazardous waste designated on the manifest or shipping paper, and the quantity\nor type of hazardous waste a facility actually receives; (2)\nrejected wastes, which may be a full or\npartial shipment of hazardous waste that the facility cannot accept; or\n(3)\ncontainer residues, which\nare residues that exceed the quantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth\nin section\n371.1\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (e) Significant differences in quantity are: (1)\nfor bulk waste, variations greater than 10 percent in weight; and\n(2)\nfor batch waste, any variation in piece\ncount, such as a discrepancy of one drum in a truckload. (f) Significant differences in type are\nobvious differences which can be discovered by inspections or waste analysis, such as waste solvent substituted for waste acid, or toxic constituents not\nreported on the manifest or shipping paper. (ii)\n\nThe facility owner or operator must\nperform or obtain an analysis of a representative sample of each hazardous\nwaste shipment as specified in the waste analysis plan required by section\n373-2.2\n(e)(2)\nof\nthis Part. The purpose of this analysis is to identify discrepancies between\nthe actual composition of the waste and its description on the\nmanifest. (iii)\n\nUpon discovering a\nsignificant difference in quantity or type, the owner or operator of the\nfacility must attempt to reconcile the discrepancy with the waste generator or\ntransporter (\ne.g., with telephone conversations). If the\ndiscrepancy is not resolved within 15 days after receiving the waste, the owner\nor operators must immediately submit a letter to the generator state and the\ndisposer state describing the discrepancy and attempts to reconcile it, and a\ncopy of the manifest or shipper paper at issue. (iv)\n(a) Upon rejecting waste or identifying a container residue that exceeds the\nquantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth in section\n371.1\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Title, the facility must consult with the generator prior to forwarding\nthe waste to another facility that can manage the waste. If it is impossible to\nlocate an alternative facility that can receive the waste, the facility may\nreturn the rejected waste or residue to the generator. The facility must send\nthe waste to the alternative facility or to the generator within 60 days of the\nrejection or the container residue identification. (b) While the facility is making arrangements\nforwarding rejected wastes or residues to another facility under this\nsubparagraph, it must ensure that either the delivering transporter retains\ncustody of the waste, or the facility must provide for secure, temporary\ncustody of the waste, pending delivery of the waste to the first transporter\ndesignated on the manifest prepared under subparagraph (v) or (vi) of this\nparagraph. (v) Except as\nprovided in clause (\ng\n) of this subparagraph, for full or\npartial load rejections and residues that are to be sent off-site to an\nalternate facility, the facility is required to prepare a new manifest for each\nmanifest with a full or partial load rejection in accordance with section\n372.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle and the following instructions: (a) Write the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in item 1 of the new manifest. Write\nthe generator's name and mailing address in item 5 of the new manifest. If the\nmailing address is different from the generator's site address, then write the\ngenerator's site address in the designated space for item 5. (b) Write the name of the alternate\ndesignated facility and the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated\nfacility block (item 8) of the new manifest. (c) Copy the manifest tracking number found\nin item 4 of the old manifest to the special handling and additional\ninformation block of the new manifest (item 14), and indicate that the shipment\nis a residue or reject waste from the previous shipment. (d) Copy the manifest tracking number found\nin item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference number line in the\ndiscrepancy block of the old manifest (item 18a). (e) Write the DOT description for the\nrejected load or the residue in item 9 (U.S. DOT description) of the new\nmanifest and write the container types, quantity and volume(s) of\nwaste. (f) Sign the\ngenerator's/offeror's certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been property packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper\ncondition for transportation, and mail a signed copy of the manifest to the\ngenerator identified in item 5 of the new manifest. (g) For full load rejections that are made\nwhile the transporter remains present at the facility, the facility may forward\nthe rejected shipment to the alternate facility by completing item 18b of the\noriginal manifest and supplying the information on the next destination\nfacility in the alternate facility space. The facility must retain a copy of\nthis manifest for its records, and then give the remaining copies of the\nmanifest to the transporter to accompany this shipment. If the original\nmanifest is not used, then the facility must use a new manifest and comply with\nclauses (\na\n), (\nb\n), (\nc\n), (\nd\n), (\ne\n) and (\nf\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (vi)\n\nExcept as provided in clause (\ng\n) of this subparagraph, for\nrejected wastes and residues that must be sent back to the generator, the\nfacility is required to prepare a new manifest for each manifest with a full or\npartial load rejection in accordance with section\n372.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle and the following instructions: (a) Write the facility's U.S. EPA ID number in item 1 of the new manifest. Write\nthe facility's name and mailing address in item 5 of the new manifest. If the\nmailing address is different from the facility's site address, then write the\nfacility's site address in the designated space for item 5. (b) Write the name of the initial generator\nand the generator's U.S. EPA ID number in the designated facility block (item\n8) of the new manifest. (c) Copy\nthe manifest tracking number found in item 4 of the old manifest to the item 14\nspecial handling and additional information block of the new manifest, and\nindicate that the shipment is a residue or rejected waste from the previous\nshipment. (d) Copy the manifest\ntracking number found in item 4 of the new manifest to the manifest reference\nnumber line in the discrepancy block of the old manifest (item 18a). (e) Write the DOT description for the\nrejected load or the reside in item 9 (U.S. DOT description) of the new\nmanifest and write the container types, quantity and volume(s) of\nwaste. (f) Sign the\ngenerator's/offeror's certification to certify, as the offeror of the shipment, that the waste has been properly packaged, marked and labeled and is in proper\ncondition for transportation, and transmit a signed copy of the manifest to the\ngenerator identified in item 5 of the new manifest. (g) For full load rejections that are made\nwhile the transporter remains at the facility, the facility may return the\nshipment to the generator with the original manifest by completing item 18b of\nthe manifest and supplying the generator's information in the alternate\nfacility space. The facility must retain a copy for its records, and then give\nthe remaining copies of the manifest to the transporter to accompany this\nshipment. If the original manifest is not used, then the facility must use a\nnew manifest and comply with clauses (\na\n), (\nb\n), (\nc\n), (\nd\n), (\ne\n), (\nf\n), and (\nh\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (h) For full or\npartial load rejections and container residues contained in non-empty\ncontainers that are returned to the generator, the facility must also comply\nwith the exception reporting requirements in section\n372.2\n(c)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Title. (vii)\n\nIf a\nfacility rejects a waste or identifies a container residue that exceeds the\nquantity limits for \"empty\" containers set forth in section\n371.1\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Title after it has signed, dated, and returned a copy of the manifest to\nthe delivering transporter, the generator, the generator state, or the\ndestination state, the facility must amend its copy of the manifest to indicate\nthe rejected wastes or residues in the discrepancy space of the amended\nmanifest. The facility must also copy the manifest tracking number from item 4\nof the new manifest to the discrepancy space (item 18a) of the amended\nmanifest, and must re-sign and date the manifest to certify to the information\nas amended. The facility must retain the amended manifest for at least three\nyears from the date of amendment, and must within 10 calendar days of the\namendment, send a copy of the amended manifest to the transporter, generator, generator state and destination state that received copies prior to their being\namended. The facility must retain a copy of the new manifest for at least three\nyears from the date of shipment, and must within 10 calendar days, send a copy\nof the new manifest to their state, the generator, generator state and\ndestination state. (viii)\n\nThe\nrequirements of this subdivision do not apply to hazardous waste produced by\ngenerators of greater than 100 kilograms but less than 1,000 kilograms in a\ncalendar month where: (a) the waste is being\ntransported pursuant to a reclamation agreement as provided in section\n373.2(b)(7) of this Title, provided that: (1)\nthe owner or operator records the following information for each shipment: (i) the name, address and U.S. E.P.A. identification number of the generator of the waste; (ii)\nthe hazardous waste number and quantity\nof waste accepted; and\n(iii)\nthe\ndate the waste is accepted; (2)\nthe owner or operator retains these\nrecords for a period of at least three years after termination or expiration of\nthe agreement; and\n(3)\nquarterly\nsummaries (unless otherwise specified by the department) of these records must\nbe submitted to the department. These summaries must include the waste types\nand quantities received from each generator. (ix)\nA facility must determine whether the\nconsignment state for a shipment regulates any additional wastes (beyond those\nregulated federally) as hazardous wastes under its state hazardous waste\nprogram.
