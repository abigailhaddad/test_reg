  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.11 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of these examples, it can be assumed that\nthe corporation has met all the requirements of due diligence, unless otherwise\nprovided, and that the business address presumption does not apply. Example 1: Software Corp sells tax preparation software\nto individuals through its website. When individual customers purchase the\nsoftware, Software Corp provides the software on a disk shipped to the\ncustomer's address. Customer A purchases the software and has it shipped to her\nbilling address in New York State. Software Corp ships a box to Customer A that\ncontains the software on a disk and a user manual explaining how the software\nworks and troubleshooting tips. Computer software by whatever means delivered\nis considered to be a digital product and therefore receipts from the software\nare sourced under the rules in this Subpart. Because the product is purchased\nonline, it does not qualify for the special rule for computer software sold at\na retail location. Although the sale of the software to Customer A includes the\nuser manual, which is tangible personal property, the user manual is incidental\nto the actual sale of the software and, therefore, the entire receipt is\nsourced as a digital product. It is presumed that Customer A primarily uses the\nsoftware at the billing address, which is located within New York State. Software Corp includes the receipt in New York receipts and everywhere\nreceipts. Example 2: Develop Corp, a software development\ncorporation located in State A, enters into a contract with a business\ncustomer, Purchaser Corp, which is physically located in both New York and\n\nState A, to develop custom software to be licensed to Purchaser Corp's\nbusiness. Develop Corp delivers the software electronically from its office in\n\nState A to Purchaser Corp. Purchaser Corp will primarily use the software at\nthe location where its employees utilize the software. As no special rules\napply to this receipt, Develop Corp must use its books and records to determine\nwhere the software will be primarily used. Based on Develop Corp's records, it\nis providing Purchaser Corp 100 licenses to use the software at Purchaser\n\nCorp's New York State location and 300 licenses to use the software at\n\nPurchaser Corp's State A location. As a result, 25% of the receipt (100/400) is\nincluded in New York receipts. 100% of such receipt is included in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 3: Movie Corp sells movies for personal use to\nindividual customers that either may be downloaded from the internet or\nreceived via DVD, a physical medium. Customer A purchases a digital download\nfor a movie (a digital product) and pays with a credit card that has a billing\naddress in State A. As no special rules apply, Movie Corp must use its books\nand records to determine where the movie will be primarily used. The general\nrule presumes that the digital product is primarily used at Customer A's\nbilling address in State A. Therefore, the receipt from this sale is not\nincluded in New York receipts. The receipt from this sale is included in\neverywhere receipts. Customer B purchases a DVD and requests it be shipped to\nan address in New York State. A DVD is not one of the methods of delivery\nspecifically provided for in section 210-A(4), so the movie on a DVD is not\nconsidered a digital product. Therefore, Video Corp's receipt from Customer B\nis a receipt from the sale of tangible personal property and, as such, should\nbe sourced pursuant to the rules for receipts from the sale of tangible\npersonal property. Example 4: Cable TV Corp, a corporation that is located\noutside of New York State, sells monthly subscriptions for cable television to\nindividual customers in New York State and other states. Cable TV Corp provides\ncable television through cables that are installed at the location of each\ncustomer's television that will be receiving content. Cable TV Corp also has a\nbilling address on file for each of its customers. While most of Cable TV\nCorp's customers have cable installed at their billing address, a number of\n\nCable TV Corp's customers have cable installed at an address other than their\nbilling address. The cable television subscription sold by Cable TV Corp is a\ndigital product. As no special rules apply, the general rule presumes that the\ndigital product is primarily used at an individual customer's billing address. However, either Cable TV Corp or the commissioner can overcome this presumption\nthrough clear and convincing evidence as to where the cable is installed, which\nbetter reflects where the digital product is primarily used. Example 5: Security Corp sells cyber security software to\n200 business customers, including a Federal agency XYZ. XYZ has its\nheadquarters located in Washington D.C., and 12 regional offices relatively\nsimilar in size located in 12 different states, one of which is New York State. Security Corp generally conducts business with a person at XYZ's headquarters, but Security Corp provides cyber security software to XYZ's entire network, which is utilized by XYZ employees at all of the 13 locations. As no special\nrules apply, Security Corp must use its books and records to determine the\nprimary use location of the software. After making reasonable inquiries to\n\nFederal agency XYZ, it does not have more detailed information, such as the\nnumber of computers or the distribution of licenses among the locations. Security Corp uses reasonable approximation based on customer information to\ninclude 1/13 of the receipts from its cyber security software in New York\nreceipts. Security Corp incudes 100% of such receipts in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 6: Office Corp, an office supply retailer, has\nphysical stores located in New York and other states. Office Corp sells a\nvariety of office supplies, including a multitude of prewritten computer\nsoftware programs. When customers purchase items from Office Corp, they take\npossession of the purchased items immediately at the retail location. In the\ncase of software purchases, customers can either purchase the software on a\ndisk or can purchase a code to download the computer software at a later time. Office Corp's sale of prewritten software qualifies for the special rule for\nsales of computer software at retail locations. Therefore, Office Corp includes\nthe receipts from the sale of the software in New York receipts to the extent\nthe sales are made at the retail stores located in New York State. Office Corp\nincludes 100% of such receipts in everywhere receipts. Example 7: Music Corp provides music streaming services\nto individual customers for a monthly subscription fee. Customers can access\n\nMusic Corp's service through an application on their mobile devices or by\nvisiting Music Corp's website. Once in their account, individuals can listen to\nmusic on a variety of channels and indicate whether they like certain songs. Music Corp uses an algorithm to recommend songs to customers based on songs\nthey have previously indicated that they like. As this service is entirely\nautomated, it meets the definition of a digital service and therefore is\nsourced under the rules in this Subpart. As no special rules apply, Music Corp\nmust use the general rule to determine the primary use location of its\nstreaming services. Therefore, the primary use location is presumed to be at\nthe billing addresses of its customers. To the extent that customers have\nbilling addresses located in New York State, receipts from such customers are\nincluded in New York receipts. Music Corp must include 100% of its receipts\nfrom customers in everywhere receipts. Example 8: Webapp located in State A sells subscription\nplans to its web-based video/voice conferencing service. This service allows\nits customers to hold meetings remotely using video and voice transmitted\nthrough a web browser. Meetings can be joined by attendees in multiple\nlocations. When a customer purchases a subscription to Webapp's service, the\ncustomer may log into its online account to use the service at any location\nwhere it can access a web browser. Customers also can use this service to\nconduct meetings with parties who are not subscribers simply by sending the\nattendee an invitation to the meeting; this can be done from any location as no\nspecialized software is required. Webapp's service is provided entirely online, without any human intervention by Webapp. Therefore, it is considered a digital\nservice. Development Studio subscribes to Webapp's digital service and uses\n\nWebapp's service to hold numerous meetings with its customers and employees\nthat access the service throughout the country. As no special rules apply, Webapp must use its books and records to determine the primary use location of\nits digital service. It determines that Development Studio's subscription for\n\nWebapp's digital service is used by employees of Development Studio's New York\n\nState office. Webapp includes 100% of this receipt in New York receipts and in\neverywhere receipts. Example 9: Website Corp designs custom software and Web\napplications for use by various businesses. Travel Corp, located in State A, operates hotels in New York and other states and rents rooms to its customers. Travel Corp wants to make the ability to book a room accessible to its\ncustomers via the internet, so Travel Corp contracts with Website Corp to\ndesign a custom website using Travel Corp's name and methodology, which will\nallow Travel Corp's customers to book hotel rooms online for a fee. Under the\ncontract, Travel Corp will pay Website Corp a flat annual fee to maintain and\nhost the website. Website Corp is providing a digital service related to the\nfacilitation of a room rental, which is a digital service related to real\nproperty. As Website Corp receives a flat annual fee, it must use reasonable\napproximation based on customer information to apportion the receipt under the\nspecial rule for digital services related to real property to the various real\nproperty locations. Therefore, Website Corp multiplies the receipt it receives\nfrom Travel Corp by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of rooms\nrented in New York State via the website and the denominator of which is the\nnumber of rooms rented everywhere via the website. Website Corp includes 100%\nof such receipt in everywhere receipts. Example 10: Room Corp operates a website that acts as a\ndigital marketplace to facilitate the short-term rental of apartments and\nhouses between individual homeowners and individuals looking for short-term\nrentals. Individual homeowners are able to list their homes on Room Corp's\nwebsite and will pay Room Corp a small commission if someone books their\nproperty via Room Corp's website. In return Room Corp provides a variety of\nservices to the homeowners automatically via their website, such as payment\nprocessing, liability insurance, and ID verification of renters. The digital\nservice Room Corp is providing is related to the facilitation of a real\nproperty rental that is a digital service related to real property. Therefore, Room Corp must include the receipts from facilitating real property rentals in\n\nNew York receipts to the extent the real property is located in New York State. Room Corp must include 100% of the receipts in everywhere receipts. Example 11: Ticket Corp operates a website that allows\nindividuals to purchase tickets to various live events. Sports Corp enters into\na contract with Ticket Corp to list tickets for its sporting events on Ticket\n\nCorp's website and Ticket Corp retains a small commission for every ticket that\nis purchased through its website under this contract. Ticket Corp's fully\nautomated website is providing the digital service of facilitating the purchase\nof an in-person service because the ticket sales are for a live sporting event\nand a live sporting event meets the definition of in-person service. Therefore, Ticket Corp should source its receipts from the commissions it receives for\nfacilitating in-person services to the location of the venue hosting the\nevent. Example 12: Game Co, an online gaming company based in\n\nNew York State, sells monthly subscriptions to individual customers. The\nmajority of Game Co's customers do not pay with a credit card. They instead use\nan online payment transfer service to pay their monthly subscription fee and, therefore, do not provide Game Co with a billing address. To subscribe, individuals need to provide only a first name, screen name, password, and\nonline payment information. As such, Game Co does not have enough information\nto determine the primary use location and, because Game Co's customers are\nindividuals, Game Co does not need to make reasonable inquiries as to\nindividuals' billing addresses. Although Game Co does not have address\ninformation for most of its subscribers, it can use IP address information to\ndetermine where the individual customers log into the website. Therefore, Game\n\nCo can use this information to reasonably approximate based on customer\ninformation the primary use location of its game and must include receipts from\nsubscribers logging into its game from IP addresses located within New York\n\nState in New York receipts. Game Co includes 100% of such receipts in\neverywhere receipts. Example 13: Marketplace Corp hosts a website that\nfacilitates the sale of tangible personal property by unrelated individuals. Marketplace Corp does not take title to any of the tangible property posted on\nits website. Item sellers can create accounts on Marketplace Corp's website and\nlist property for sale. Individual buyers can visit Marketplace Corp's website\nto view pages containing tangible property that item sellers are offering for\nsale. Marketplace Corp makes these pages readily available for consumer access\nat the request of the item sellers. Marketplace Corp receives two primary\nrevenue streams from the item sellers: (1)\na small fee for listing tangible property\non Marketplace Corp's website, regardless of whether it sells; and\n(2)\na small commission for every sale of\ntangible property made via Marketplace Corp's website. Both revenue streams are\nservices related to tangible personal property and, therefore, the special rule\napplies. Marketplace Corp receives the first revenue stream\ndirectly from the item seller when the item seller lists the tangible property\non Marketplace Corp's website. In fact, Marketplace Corp receives this receipt\nregardless of whether the property is sold or the seller removes it from the\nwebsite without a sale. Therefore, although it is a service related to tangible\npersonal property, Marketplace Corp does not have information on where the\ntangible personal property is received by a buyer because, at the time the fee\nis received by Marketplace Corp, the property has not yet been and, in fact, may never be, sold. Furthermore, the service Marketplace Corp provided to\ngenerate this receipt is complete at the time the tangible property is listed\nand there is not yet a consumer in the transaction, so this receipt is not\ngenerated in an intermediary transaction. Receipts from listing fees are\nincluded in New York receipts using the general rule based on the primary use\nlocation of the item seller. Marketplace Corp includes all receipts from\nlisting fees generated via its website in everywhere receipts. In contrast, Marketplace Corp is receiving the second\nrevenue stream from item sellers at the time the tangible personal property is\nsold and, as such, Marketplace Corp has information on where the tangible\npersonal property will be delivered to the consumer. Marketplace Corp includes receipts from its second\nrevenue stream for commissions in New York receipts to the extent the\ncommission was received for facilitating the sale of tangible personal property\ndelivered into New York State. Marketplace Corp includes all receipts from\ncommissions received via its website in everywhere receipts. Example 14: Software Corp sells case management software\nto 200 large corporations. Business Corp purchases software from Software Corp\nto be installed on laptops used by Business Corp's employees. The contract\nbetween Business Corp and Software Corp is managed at Business Corp's office in\n\nState A, but Business Corp's employees spend the majority of their time working\nthroughout the country, including in New York. As no special rules apply, Software Corp must use its books and records to determine where the software\nwill be primarily used. Software Corp's books and records do not provide any\ninformation on the amount of time that Business Corp's employees spend working\nin other states to determine where the software is primarily used. Because\n\nSoftware Corp only has 200 customers, it must ask Business Corp where its\nemployees utilize the software. Business Corp is not able to provide such\ninformation, nor would population information be relevant to software used by\n\nBusiness Corp's employees in internal operations. Therefore, Software Corp does\nnot have adequate information to determine the primary use locations or\nreasonably approximate such locations. It must source the receipt to where the\ndigital product is received, which is presumed to be at the location where the\ncontract is managed. Business Corp manages the contract with Software Corp at\nits office in State A; therefore, the receipt is not included in New York\nreceipts. Software Corp must include 100% of the receipt in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 15: Sales Corp provides only one type of digital\nproduct to approximately 200 business customers. In tax year 2021, all of its\nreceipts were sourced under this Subpart and, as a result, 45% of Sales Corp's\nreceipts were included in New York receipts. In tax year 2022, Sales Corp\ncontinues to provide only one type of digital product to its customers. At the\nend of tax year 2022, Sales Corp's computer system crashes and it is unable to\nrecover information it had obtained on where the digital product was primarily\nused. Upon reasonable inquiries to its known customers, Sales Corp still cannot\nobtain information on where the digital products were primarily used or\ndetermine where they were received. Therefore, under the preceding taxable year\nmethod, Sales Corp includes 45% of its 2022 receipts in New York receipts. Sales Corp includes 100% of receipts from this type of digital product in\neverywhere receipts. Example 16: Taxpayer A has $10,000 in receipts from a new\ntype of digital product. After exercising due diligence, Taxpayer A cannot\ndetermine where the digital product is primarily used or where it was received. Further, because this is a new type of digital product, it cannot use the\npreceding taxable year method. Therefore, under the current taxable year\nmethod, Taxpayer A must determine the portion of the $10,000 to include in New\n\nYork receipts based on the apportionment of the receipts for all its other\ndigital products and digital services using the primary use location method and\nthe apportionment of the receipts for all its other digital products and\ndigital services using the where received method. In the current taxable year, Taxpayer A has $65,000 in digital products receipts and $85,000 in digital\nservices receipts sourced using the primary use location method and the where\nreceived method, of which $75,000 (or 50 percent) are New York receipts. Therefore, Taxpayer A includes 50% of the $10,000, or $5,000, of receipts from\nthe new type of digital product in New York receipts. Taxpayer A includes 100%\nof receipts from the new type of digital product in everywhere receipts. Taxpayer B also has $10,000 in receipts from a new type\nof digital product that, after exercising due diligence, it cannot source using\neither the primary use method or the where received method. However, unlike\n\nTaxpayer A, Taxpayer B has been able to source all its other receipts from\ndigital products and digital services using the primary use location method and\nhas determined that 40 percent of all those other receipts are New York\nreceipts. Therefore, under the current taxable year method, $4000, or 40%, of\nthe receipts from this new digital product are included in Taxpayer B's New\n\nYork receipts. Taxpayer B includes 100% of the receipts from the new type of\ndigital product in everywhere receipts. Example 17: App Design Corp (the taxpayer), a corporation\nlocated in State B, provides mobile phone application (\"app\") design services\nto its customer, Bank Corp (the business customer), which has branches located\nin New York and other states. Bank Corp contracts with App Design Corp to have\n\nApp Design Corp design an app that will be readily available for free download\nby any of Bank Corp's account holders (the consumers) via a digital\nmarketplace. App Design Corp also will provide periodic updates to ensure the\napp runs smoothly and the information transmitted through the app is secure. App Design Corp is receiving receipts from Bank Corp in an intermediary\ntransaction because App Design Corp is making its digital product readily\navailable to consumers at the request of Bank Corp, and App Design Corp\nmaintains involvement with the app after consumers download it. As no special\nrule for determining primary use location applies, App Corp must determine\nwhere Bank Corp primarily uses the digital service, which is at the location\nwhere the consumers download and use the app. App Design Corp cannot determine information on New York\naccount holders who download the app based on its own books and records because\nit does not have information on either the primary use location or where the\napp is received by the consumers and, therefore, App Design Corp must make\nreasonable inquiries to Bank Corp for location statistics on account holders\nwho download the app. Bank Corp cannot provide App Design Corp with any\ninformation after reasonable inquiries, so App Design Corp should look to\npublicly available information, such as the number of Bank Corp's bank branches\nlocated within and without New York State, and use the percentage of branches\nin New York to reasonably approximate based on customer information the primary\nuse location of the app. Example 18: Website Design Corp (the taxpayer) designs\nand maintains websites for unrelated parties. Database Corp (the business\ncustomer) develops an internet-based information database and enters into a\ncontract with Website Design Corp to create a website and sell access to the\ndatabase to individual customers (the consumers) for a small monthly fee. The\ncontract specifies that Website Design Corp will retain a commission each month\nfrom every consumer that pays for access to the database and remit the\nremainder to Database Corp. Website Design Corp actively maintains and updates\nthe website where it makes the database readily available on the internet for\naccess by consumers at the request of Database Corp. Therefore, Website Design Corp must apportion its\nreceipts from commissions based on the location of the consumers rather than\nthe location of Database Corp. As no special rule for determining primary use\nlocation applies, Website Design Corp must use the general rule to determine\nthe primary use location of its digital service. As the consumers are\nindividuals, Website Design Corp presumes the digital product will be primarily\nused at the billing addresses of the consumers. To the extent that consumers\nhave billing addresses located in New York State, receipts from such customers\nare included in New York receipts. Website Design Corp must include 100% of its\nreceipts in everywhere receipts. Example 19: Research Corp, a corporation located in State\nD, compiles a digital collection of treatises on a variety of subjects and\nsells a copy of its collection to University A, located in New York. However, Research Corp does not provide continuing support after the sale and, if\n\nResearch Corp were to update any information, it would sell this as a separate\nproduct. Therefore, after Research Corp delivers the copy of the digital\ncollection to University A, it maintains no interaction with the product and\nprovides no further services in connection with the receipt. For this reason, this is not considered an intermediary transaction. As no special rules apply, Research Corp must use its books and records to determine if it can ascertain\nthe primary use location of the digital collection. Research Corp's books and\nrecords indicate that University A will use the digital collection at its\nlocation in New York State; therefore, the entire receipt is included in both\n\nNew York receipts and everywhere receipts. Example 20: Images Corp, a corporation located in State\nE, maintains an online database of digital images that it licenses to customers\nto use in a variety of publications. Receipts from the license to use the\ndigital database are apportioned under these rules. Newspaper Corp, located in\n\nNew York State, enters into a contract with Images Corp whereby, in exchange\nfor a monthly flat fee, Newspaper Corp receives a license to use an unlimited\nnumber of images from Image Corp's online database in Newspaper Corp's print\nand digital publications that will be viewed by Newspaper Corp's subscribers\nworldwide. Images Corp's database is only accessible by Newspaper Corp directly\nand not by its subscribers; therefore, this is not an intermediary transaction. Images Corp must apportion the receipt it receives from Newspaper Corp under\nthe general rule to the primary use location of Newspaper Corp. Newspaper Corp\nuses the images it selects from the online database when composing articles; therefore, Newspaper Corp's primary use location is where this editorial\ncontrol is exercised. Because Newspaper Corp makes editorial decisions at its\noffice located in New York State, the entire receipt is included in both New\n\nYork receipts and everywhere receipts. Example 21: Exchange Corp, a security exchange located\nin New York, has contracts with 300 brokerage firms that grant digital access\nto its exchange. Under the terms of the contract, employees of the firms are\nable to digitally access the exchange for purposes of purchasing or selling\nshares of stock on the exchange for a fee. Exchange Corp's contract with Trader\n\nCorp, one such brokerage firm, allows Trader Corp's 120 traders based in New\n\nYork and 80 traders based in State A to buy and sell shares of stock on the\nexchange on behalf of clients. As Exchange Corp is not a registered securities\nbroker or dealer, the fees it earns from allowing customers to trade on the\nexchange cannot be apportioned under the rules in section 210-A(5)(b). Furthermore, because the fee is for granting digital access to the exchange, the receipt is apportioned under the rules in this Subpart. This is not an\nintermediary transaction because Exchange Corp is not providing access to the\nexchange directly to consumers at Trader Corp's direction. Only Trader Corp's\nown employees have digital access to the exchange. For this reason, the receipt\nmust be apportioned to the location where Trader Corp's traders primarily\nutilize the digital product. Exchange Corp does not have adequate information to\ndetermine the exact location where the traders primarily use this digital\nproduct and, since Exchange Corp has more than 250 business customers that pay\nfees for substantially similar digital products, and no more than 5% of its\nreceipts are from Trader Corp, Exchange Corp is not required to make reasonable\ninquiries to Trader Corp. Therefore, Exchange Corp must use its books and\nrecords to reasonably approximate where Trader Corp's traders primarily use the\nexchange. Since 60% of Trader Corp's traders are based in New York State, 60%\nof the receipts Exchange Corp receives from Trader Corp are included in New\n\nYork receipts. Exchange Corp includes 100% of the receipts in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 22: Channel Corp operates a digital platform, available through Channel Corp's website or as a downloadable application, for\nindividual subscribers to access Channel Corp's content for a monthly fee. Subscribers can subscribe either directly with Channel Corp. or through another\nentity. For revenue earned directly by Channel Corp from its\nsubscribers, it is presumed that an individual subscriber primarily accesses\n\nChannel Corp's digital content at its billing address. Therefore, receipts\nearned by subscribers with billing addresses in New York State are included in\n\nNew York receipts. Channel Corp includes 100% of the receipts it earned from\nthese subscribers in everywhere receipts. Platform Corp (the business customer) operates a digital\napplication store where individuals can download and purchase a subscription to\nvarious digital applications. Under the agreement between Channel Corp and\n\nPlatform Corp, Platform Corp can sell subscriptions to Channel Corp's service\nin its marketplace for a fee set by Channel Corp in exchange for a commission. In addition, the agreement requires that Platform Corp receive all payments\nfrom individual subscribers for access to Channel Corp's service and must remit\nthe fees, after retaining its commission, to Channel Corp. While subscribers download Channel Corp's digital\napplication from Platform Corp's platform, the subscribers access Channel\n\nCorp's service directly through its digital application to view content. Channel Corp actively maintains and updates the digital application, which is\nreadily available for access by subscribers who pay for the service through\n\nPlatform Corp. Platform Corp forwards these receipts, minus its commission, to\n\nChannel Corp. Therefore, these are receipts from an intermediary transaction\nand Channel Corp must apportion them based on the location of the subscribers\n(the consumers) rather than the location of Platform Corp. Channel Corp's books\nand records do not have information on the consumer's billing address. Therefore, Channel Corp must make reasonable inquiries to Platform Corp to\ndetermine where the subscribers access Channel Corp's digital application. After making such inquiries, Channel Corp still does not know the subscriber\nlocation so it reasonably approximates that location using third-party\ndata. Example 23: Channel Corp operates a digital platform, available through Channel Corp's website or as a downloadable application of\ndigital content that can be accessed by users. Phone Corp sells phone\nsubscription plans, some of which bundle access to various digital platforms of\nmovies and TV shows operated by different providers as part of the package. Channel Corp enters into an agreement with Phone Corp (the business customer)\nthat allows Phone Corp to bundle access to Channel Corp's digital platform in\nexchange for a fee set by Channel Corp. Under the agreement, Phone Corp may\ndecide what fee to charge (or even not charge) its customers for the bundled\nservice. After individual consumers purchase a phone plan that provides access\nto Channel Corp's digital content, the consumers access Channel Corp's digital\nplatform through its website or by downloading Channel Corp's\napplication. Channel Corp actively maintains and updates the\napplication, which is readily available for access by subscribers who pay for\nservice through Phone Corp. Therefore, these are receipts from intermediary\ntransactions and Channel Corp must apportion based on the location of the Phone\n\nCorp's users rather than the location of Phone Corp. It is presumed that the\nusers primarily access the digital content at their billing address. Channel\n\nCorp's books and records do not contain the billing address of Phone Corp's\nusers and, upon inquiries, Phone Corp did not provide this information. However, if Channel Corp collects location information when subscribers create\nan account to access Channel Corp's service, then Channel Corp may use such\ninformation to reasonably approximate use. To the extent the location is in New\n\nYork State, the receipts are included in New York receipts. All receipts that\n\nChannel Corp receives from Phone Corp are included in everywhere\nreceipts.
