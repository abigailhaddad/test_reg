  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 131.20 - Utility facilities on structures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Utility facilities may be placed\non bridges upon written approval of the department. The following provisions\nare applicable to new or replacement installations of usual size, pressure and\nvoltage. The department will establish requirements for situations beyond the\nnorm and for those not specifically covered by this subdivision. (b) All utility facilities to be installed by\n\nState-let contract or owner-let contract, shall be fully detailed and shown in\nplan, section and elevation when required. Utilities shall not be placed on an\nexisting structure if their weight would reduce the allowable vehicle loading\nbelow the legal limit except in certain instances when approved by the\ndepartment. (c) Location of utility\nfacilities on bridges. (1)\n\nUtility facilities\nshall not be placed at nor extend below the bottom of the\nsuperstructure. (2)\n\nUtility\nfacilities shall not be located where they may be subject to vehicular impacts\nnor shall they be attached to railing systems which may be subject to vehicular\nimpacts. (3)\n\nUtility facilities\nshall not be located where they will impair or interfere with roadway\ndrainage. (4)\n\nUtility facilities\nshall not be supported from the bottom of the concrete structural\nslab. (5)\n\nUtility facilities should\nbe located so they do not interfere with maintenance and inspection of the\nstructure. Aesthetics is also a consideration. Preferred locations, in\ndecreasing desirability, are: (i) In bays\nbetween main longitudinal bridge members. (ii)\n\nIn concrete sidewalks - small diameter\ninstallations only. (iii)\n\nIn the\nvoided section of closed box bridge members. (iv)\n\nOn a utility ledge on the\nfascia. (v) Attached to the fascia, preferably on downstream side. (d) Expansion devices. All utility\ninstallations shall either: (1)\nhave expansion\ncapability located adjacent to the bridge expansion bearings so as to conform\nto the bridge movements. Additional expansion devices may be required at other\nlocations if the operating temperature range of the utility or the coefficient\nof thermal expansion of the utility installation differs from the\ncharacteristics of the bridge; or\n(2)\nbe supported on a system of rollers that\nallow it to expand and contract independently of the bridge. (e) Shut-off device. All utility\nfacilities carrying fluid or gaseous materials shall have a shut-off device at\nthe supply side of the structure. If reverse flows are possible, a shut-off\ndevice is required on each end. Shut-off devices should be located as close to\nthe structure as feasible, not over 1,000 feet from the end. Exceptions may be\ngranted for low-pressure lines upon a showing that such exception does not\ncompromise public safety. (f) Marking. Each utility carrier or casing shall be clearly and appropriately\nmarked with the carrier contents. The marking may be painted on or a printed\nself-adhering tape may be used. (g) Protective structures. Fencing or other protective structures may be\nmandated. (h) Water lines. Water\nlines shall have welded or restrained joints or shall be cased for the length\nnecessary to prevent water from falling on an underlying highway, railway, or\nother areas determined by the department. (i) Sewer lines. Sewer lines shall have\nwelded or restrained joints or shall be cased for the length necessary to\nprevent sewage from dropping on an underlying highway, railway, or other areas\ndetermined by the department. (j) Natural gas lines. All plans involving natural gas lines must contain a\ncertification by a licensed professional engineer that the work conforms to all\napplicable provisions of the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act ( 49 U.S.C. 1672\net seq.) and the regulations in 49 CFR part\n192, and Public Service Commission\nrequirements in 16 NYCRR Part\n255. Where not superseded by the above Federal\nand State provisions; (1)\n\nAll installations\non structures shall be designed as if subject to the most populous \"class\nlocation\" requirements in 16 NYCRR Part\n255. (2)\n\nUnless otherwise approved, all welds on\ncarrier lines shall be nondestructively tested. (3)\n\nAll lines on structures shall be\nelectrically insulated from the structure or shall be electrically isolated\nfrom the buried portion of the line. (4)\n\nUnless otherwise approved, lines\ninstalled in an enclosed portion of a structure, or encased in concrete, shall\nbe sleeved in a continuous manner, with adequate venting. This provision does\nnot apply to sections of lines where they pass through abutments or retaining\nwalls. (k) Communication\nlines. Communication lines shall be placed in ducts having sufficient bending\nstrength to span between points of support. (l) The department, by issuance of a permit\nunder this Part, does not thereby warrant or represent to the permittee that\nthe structure is capable of sustaining or continuing to sustain the utility\nfacilities installed or attached thereto. If for any reason the structure is\ndamaged, the department shall not be liable to the utility for any resulting\nlosses or damages, nor shall the department be obligated to the utility to make\nrepairs or restore the structure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n131.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
