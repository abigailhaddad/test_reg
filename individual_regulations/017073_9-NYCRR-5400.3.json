(2)\n\nFor purposes of this section, critical\ninfrastructure means systems, assets, places or things, whether physical or\nvirtual, so vital to the State that the disruption, incapacitation or\ndestruction of such systems, assets, places or things could jeopardize the\nhealth, safety, welfare or security of the State, its residents or its\neconomy. (b) A person\nmay, at the time of submission of a record to the commission, request that the\ncommission designate all or a portion of such record as a trade secret and that\nthe commission except such record from disclosure pursuant to Public Officers\n\nLaw sections 87(2)(d) and 89(5)(a)(1). A person may, at any time, request that\nthe commission designate all or a portion of such record as critical\ninfrastructure information and that the commission except such record from\ndisclosure pursuant to Public Officers Law section 87(2) and 89(5)(a)(1-a). The\nrecord for which a trade secret designation is sought shall be labeled using\nsuch words as ''trade secret,'' ''confidential,'' ''proprietary information''or\nwords of similar import. Such request shall be in writing, identify the record\nfor which a designation and exception from disclosure is being requested, and\nstate the reasons why the information should be excepted from disclosure. Requests for designation and exception from disclosure of trade secrets shall\nindicate, if appropriate: (1)\nthe specific\nrecord requested to be considered a trade secret, including, where applicable, the page, form, line, chart or table designation; (2)\nthe confidential nature of the record, including a description of the nature and extent of the injury to the\ncommercial enterprise's competitive position, such as unfair economic or\ncompetitive damage, that would be caused if the record is disclosed; (3)\nwhether the record is treated as\nconfidential by the commercial enterprise, including whether the record has\nbeen made available; (4)\nwhether\nany patent, copyright or similar legal protection exists for the\nrecord; (5)\nwhether the public\ndisclosure of such record is otherwise restricted by law, and the specific\nsource and contents of such restrictions; (6)\nthe date upon which such record will no\nlonger need to be kept confidential, if applicable; (7)\nwhether the request itself constitutes a\nrecord that, if disclosed, would defeat the purpose for which trade secret\nstatus is sought; (8)\nwhether the\nrecord is known outside of the business of the submitting commercial enterprise\nand the extent to which the record is known by its employees and others\ninvolved in the business of the commercial enterprise; (9)\nthe value of the record to the commercial\nenterprise and to its competitors; (10)\nthe amount of effort or money expended\nby the commercial enterprise in developing the records; (11)\nthe ease or difficulty with which the\nrecord could be properly acquired or duplicated by others; and\n(12)\nany other factors considered\nrelevant.

Each of the directors of the divisions of\nthe commission, or their designees, shall be responsible for the custody of\nsuch records. Each commission employee who has custody of records containing\ndesignated trade secrets or critical infrastructure information shall take\nappropriate measures to safeguard such records and to protect against\nunauthorized disclosure.
