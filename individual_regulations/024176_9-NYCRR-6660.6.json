(c) The agency in which a\nlocal ombudsman entity is organizationally located shall not have personnel\npolicies or practices which prohibit the representatives of the ombudsman\nprogram from performing their duties, or from adhering to the access, confidentiality and disclosure requirements of the program. Policies, procedures and practices, including personnel management practices of the host\nagency, which the state ombudsman determines conflict with the laws, regulations, policies or policies governing the ombudsman program shall be\nsufficient grounds for the refusal, suspension, or removal of the designation\nof local ombudsman entity by the state ombudsman. (d) The state long-term care ombudsman, in\ncoordination with the state office for the aging, and in accordance with\napplicable state contracting procedures, may designate an entity to operate a\nlocal long-term care ombudsman program for one or more counties, and shall\nmonitor the performance of such entity. If the state office for the aging is\naware or becomes aware of any compelling reason why the state ombudsman should\nnot designate an entity to operate a long-term care ombudsman program, the\nstate ombudsman will comply with the state office for the aging's\ndetermination. (e) When the state\nombudsman determines that a local long-term care ombudsman program does not\nmeet the standards set forth in this part and any related regulations or if the\nlocal ombudsman entity is subject to a conflict of interest that cannot be\nremedied, the state ombudsman in coordination with the state office for the\naging, may refuse, suspend, or withdraw the designation of the local program. Prior to taking such action, the state ombudsman shall send to the affected\nlocal program a notice of the state ombudsman's intentions to withdraw the\ndesignation. If the state office for the aging is aware or becomes aware of any\ncompelling reason why the state ombudsman should not designate an entity to\noperate a long-term care ombudsman program or why the state ombudsman should\nrefuse, suspend or remove designation of a local ombudsman entity, the state\nombudsman will comply with the state office for the aging's\ndetermination. (f) The state\nombudsman shall develop a grievance process to offer an opportunity for\nreconsideration of any decision to refuse, suspend, or remove designation of a\nlocal ombudsman entity. Notwithstanding the grievance process, the state\nombudsman in coordination with the state office for the aging shall make the\nfinal determination to designate or to refuse, suspend, or remove designation\nof a local ombudsman entity. If the state office for the aging is aware or\nbecomes aware of any compelling reason why the state ombudsman should not\ndesignate an entity to operate a long-term care program or why the state\nombudsman should refuse, suspend or remove designation of a local ombudsman\nentity, the state ombudsman will comply with the state office for the aging's\ndetermination.
