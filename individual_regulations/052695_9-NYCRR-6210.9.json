  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.9 - Vote tabulation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Preparation of ballots for\ntabulation by central count paper-based systems. (1)\n\nBallots shall be reviewed pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n6210.13\nof this Part, to determine\nif the ballot is machine-readable or if the ballot requires that it be manually\ncounted, then recorded in the official canvass of the votes for the\nelection. (2)\n\nBallots shall be\nassembled in separate batches by election district unless otherwise directed by\nthe county board to preserve the secrecy of the ballot. (i) Each batch shall be identified by a\nheader card and at the end of all batches there shall be an end- or trailer-\ncard, if required by the software. Header and trailer cards shall be visually\ndistinct from ballots. Such distinction may be made, for example, by using a\ndifferent color card stock, or different edge marking, or by other appropriate\nmeans. (ii)\n\nThe bi-partisan team of\ncounty board personnel shall place header cards, in order that the votes\nrecorded on each ballot shall be attributed to the correct election district. When placing header cards, as each is placed by one person, the other person\nshall verify that the header card is the correct one for the batch of ballots\nwhich follows it and that it is correctly oriented in the batch. (3)\n\nBallots shall then be fed into\nthe central count paper-based voting system. Following the counting of all\nballots, a tabulation report shall be printed. Two back-up copies of the\ntabulation report shall be locked in secure storage. (4)\n\nWhere the number of ballots to be\ncanvassed is small, the county board may provide for canvassing of the ballots\nby larger units of representation. (b) Testing during ballot tabulation by\ncentral count paper-based systems. The system shall be so designed and constructed that, at the\ndiscretion of the county board, it shall be possible to halt the ballot\ntabulation at a point when a portion of the election districts have been\ncounted, and run the test deck to demonstrate, as in the tests listed in\nsection\n6210.2\nof this Part, the accuracy\nand dependability of the count without interrupting or affecting any official\ntabulation of results that may be on the equipment at that\ntime.

Tit. 9\n§\n6210.9\n\nAmended, New\n\nYork State Register May 21, 2014/Volume XXXVI, Issue 20, eff. 5/21/2014\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
