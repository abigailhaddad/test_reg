(1)\n\nClearcutting means any cutting of trees\nover six inches in diameter at breast height over any 10-year cutting cycle\nwhere the average residual basal area of such trees after such cutting is less\nthan 30 square feet per acre, measured within the area harvested. Provided, however, that where regeneration is assured by stand conditions such that after\nsuch cutting the average residual basal area of trees at least one inch in\ndiameter at breast height is at least 30 square feet per acre, measured within\nthe area harvested, a clearcut will not be deemed to have taken place unless\nthe average residual basal area of trees over six inches in diameter at breast\nheight is less than 10 square feet per acre, similarly measured. (2)\n\nRiver area means the wild, scenic, and\nrecreational rivers and the private lands in their immediate environs as set\nforth in Appendix Q-6 of these regulations. (3)\n\nWood road means any dirt or other\nunimproved road designed and used solely for forest management purposes or\nrelated fish and game activities, not intended for use by the general public, and simply constructed by grading, filling and/or corduroying, without\nextensive finish or maintenance work.

Individual clearcut areas of eight acres or more will be\naggregated in computing the 25-acre jurisdictional threshold prescribed in this\nsubdivision if they are not separated from each other by an intervening uncut\narea at least 300 feet wide at all points. (2)\n\nClearcutting is not allowed in river\nareas except in accordance with sections\n577.6\n(c) and\n577.8\nof this Title. (c) Application requirements.

The\nagency will supply such a map on request. (ii)\nexisting, and approximate location of\nproposed, wood roads, stream crossings and culverts; (iii)\nbuffers proposed; (iv)\nsignificant areas of timber infestation\nor disease on the area to be clearcut, including beech bark disease, scleroderris canker, spruce budworm, and pine blister rust; (v) any areas where the general public is\nallowed access or use pursuant to a formal contract or conveyance to the State\nor a local government, such as public hiking or snowmobile trails, public\nfishing access, and the like. (2)\n\nThe name and address of the individual\nwho prepared the draft plan, and his forestry qualifications.
