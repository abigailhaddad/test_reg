  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 1205.5 - Routine Cases and Alternative Compliance Cases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Routine cases. A routine case is one\ndetermined by the department to involve either: a de minimis variance or\nmodification of the Uniform Code that does not substantially affect the code's\nprovisions for health, safety, and security; or a request for a variance from a\nconstruction-permitting agency, as defined in section\n1204.3\n(e) of Part\n1204 of this Title, that is based on a substantially similar petition\npreviously granted by the department or the board of review. In determining\nwhether a petition is substantially similar, the department may consider any\nrelevant factors including but not limited to the applicable code provisions, design criteria, and geographic location. At the department's discretion, in\nmaking this determination the department may coordinate with the petitioner, the authority having jurisdiction, and any known interested parties. (1)\n\nAny person aggrieved may petition the\ndepartment for relief under this subdivision. The petition shall be submitted\nto the department on a form prescribed by the department and shall include, at\na minimum, all of the following: (i) the\nfee(s) specified in or determined in accordance with section\n1205.6\nof this Part; (ii)\na statement of the nature of the\ngrievance and the relief sought in sufficient detail as would permit the\ndepartment to make a determination on the basis of the information contained\nwithin the petition; (iii)\nwhere\nnecessary, construction documents (drawings and/or specifications), site plans, and descriptions of buildings and their histories; (iv)\nan explanation of the facts supporting\nthe criteria upon which the petitioner relies as a basis for relief; and\n(v) if applicable, a copy of the\nsubstantially similar variance decisions previously granted by the department\nor the board of review and an explanation of how the proposed variance is\ncomparable, including but not limited to the petitioner arranging for the\nreview of the request by experts and consultants with qualifications comparable\nto independent design professionals, at the department's\ndiscretion. (2)\n\nUpon\nreceipt of a petition for a routine case, the department shall review the\npetition for completeness to determine whether it has sufficient detail to\npermit the department to make a determination on the basis of the information\ncontained within the petition. (i) If the\ndepartment deems the petition complete, the department shall consider the\nevidence offered, make findings of fact and conclusions of law, and render its\ndecision in writing. (ii)\n\nIf the\ndepartment deems the petition incomplete, the department shall notify the\npetitioner of the information required for completeness. If, after notice that\nthe petition is incomplete, no additional information is forthcoming and the\nfile has remained inactive for a period exceeding 90 days, the department may\ndismiss the matter for neglect to proceed, but without prejudice to any\nsubsequent petition. (3)\n\nThe department shall serve a copy of the decision on the petitioner, the\nadministrative official authorized to enforce the Uniform Code, and any other\ninterested parties by either first-class mail or electronic mail. Unless the\ndepartment receives a written objection from the petitioner or any aggrieved\nperson within 15 days of receipt of the department's decision, the decision\nshall become final. A decision shall be filed, indexed, and distributed in the\nsame manner as a decision of the boards of review. The department's timely\nreceipt of a written objection shall cause the decision to be without force and\neffect, and the matter to which it pertains shall be transmitted to a board of\nreview for proceedings de novo in accordance with section\n1205.4\nof this Part. (b) Alternative compliance cases. An alternative compliance case is one in which the petitioner proposes, as an\nalternative to strict compliance with the design, construction, and maintenance\nprovisions or requirements of the Uniform Code, the use of the design, construction, and maintenance provisions or requirements of a nationally\nrecognized standard or code that is not expressly allowed by the version of the\n\nUniform Code in effect at the time of petition. Such alternative shall show to\nthe satisfaction of the department that: strict compliance with specific\nprovisions or requirements of the Uniform Code would be unnecessary in light of\nthe alternative; such alternative ensures the achievement of the Uniform Code's\nintended objective; and such alternative does not substantially adversely\naffect provisions for health, safety, and security in comparison to that\nprovided by strict adherence to the Uniform Code. (1)\n\nAny person aggrieved may petition the\ndepartment for relief of any provision or requirement of the Uniform Code under\nthis subdivision for an alternative compliance case. The petition shall be\nsubmitted to the department on a form prescribed by the department and shall\ninclude the following: (i) the fee(s)\nspecified in or determined in accordance with section\n1205.6\nof this Part; (ii)\nthe specific provisions and requirements\nof the Uniform Code to which a variance or modification is sought; (iii)\nthe specific alternative compliance\nmeasures proposed, including the edition of the proposed alternative code or\nstandard to be used, a detailed description and analysis of how the alternative\ncompliance measures meet the requirements of the proposed alternative code or\nstandard, and evidence substantiating that the modifications or alternative\ndesign do not substantially adversely affect provisions for health, safety, and\nsecurity in comparison to that provided by strict adherence to the Uniform\n\nCode; (iv)\nthe name and\nqualifications of the design professional, licensed and registered to practice\nin the State of New York, who designed the alternative compliance measures to\nmeet the requirements of the proposed alternative code or standard; (v) the name and qualifications of an\nindependent design professional, licensed and registered to practice in the\n\nState of New York, who performed a peer review of the alternative compliance\nmeasures to ensure compliance with the requirements of the proposed alternative\ncode or standard; (vi)\nthe names\nand contact information of any authorities having jurisdiction and any other\nparties identified by the petitioner or the department as interested\nparties. (vii)\nthe results of the\npeer review including a statement, affirming that the design professional is an\nindependent design professional within the meaning of this Part, as to whether\nthe modifications or alternative design substantially adversely affect\nprovisions for health, safety, and security in comparison to that provided by\nstrict adherence to the Uniform Code; (viii)\nwhere necessary, construction\ndocuments (drawings and/or specifications), construction document evidence, site plans, and descriptions of buildings and their histories; and\n(ix)\na succinct list of all alternative\ncompliance measures and identification of specific locations in the plans where\ninformation on these measures is located. (2)\nA petitioner may choose to submit an\nalternative compliance case as a complete petition under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, or in two stages, including a conceptual submission and a final\nsubmission, under this paragraph.

The issuance of a\npreliminary approval by the department shall not guarantee a final approval of\nthe petition. (iii)\n\nFollowing\nconceptual submission, a final submission shall be submitted to the department\non a form prescribed by the department and shall include the following: (a) the fee(s) specified in or determined in\naccordance with section\n1205.6\nof this Part; (b) any updated information to the conceptual\nsubmission; (c) the specific\nalternative compliance measures proposed, including the edition of the proposed\nalternative code or standard to be used, a detailed description and analysis of\nhow the alternative compliance measures meet the requirements of the proposed\nalternative code or standard, and evidence substantiating that the\nmodifications or alternative design do not substantially adversely affect\nprovisions for health, safety, and security in comparison to that provided by\nstrict adherence to the Uniform Code; (d) results of the peer review including a\nstatement, affirming that the design professional is an independent design\nprofessional within the meaning of this Part, as to whether the modifications\nor alternative design substantially adversely affect provisions for health, safety, and security in comparison to that provided by strict adherence to the\n\nUniform Code; (e) where necessary, construction documents (drawings and/or specifications), construction document\nevidence, site plans, and descriptions of buildings and their histories; and\n(f) a succinct list of all\ncompliance measures and identification of specific locations in the plans where\ninformation on these measures is located.

These conferences may be requested by the petitioner or the\ndepartment at any time prior to the final determination. In collaboration with\nthe petitioner, design professional of record, the independent design\nprofessional, and the authority having jurisdiction, the department shall have\nthe authority to fashion suitable additional mitigating requirements deemed\nnecessary by the department in order to render a decision or determine that the\nproposed alternative does not substantially adversely affect provisions for\nhealth, safety, and security in comparison to that provided by strict adherence\nto the Uniform Code. (4)\n\nUpon\nreceipt of a petition for an alternative compliance case, the department shall\nreview the petition for completeness to determine whether it has sufficient\ndetail to permit the department to make a determination on the basis of the\ninformation contained within the petition.
