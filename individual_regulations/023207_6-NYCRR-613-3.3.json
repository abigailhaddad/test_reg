  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-3.3 - Leak detection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General leak detection\nrequirements. (1)\nA method, or\ncombination of methods, of leak detection must be provided, that: (i) can detect a leak from any portion of the\ntank and the piping that are in contact with the ground or are in inaccessible\nareas, and routinely contain petroleum; (ii)\nis installed and calibrated in\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions; and\n(iii)\nmeets the requirements of subdivisions\n(c) and (d) of this section, as applicable. In addition, the methods listed\nunder paragraphs (c)(1), (2), (7), and (d)(1) through (3) of this section must\nbe capable of detecting the leak rate or quantity specified for that method\nwith a probability of detection of 95 percent and a probability of false alarm\nof 5 percent. (2)\n\nIf a\nmethod of leak detection that complies with the requirements of this section\ncannot be implemented, the UST system must be permanently closed in accordance\nwith subdivision\n3.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nIf the petroleum\nstored will change such that the UST system would then be subject to new\ninspections and tests required under this section, these inspections and tests\nmust be performed before the change occurs. (b) Specific leak detection\nrequirements for tanks and piping. (1)\n\nTank leak detection. Tanks must be monitored for leaks as follows: (i) Category 1 tanks. Category 1 tanks must have an annual tank tightness test performed in\naccordance with paragraph (c)(1) of this section, with the exception of tanks\nthat are: (a) part of UST systems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel oil; (b) monitored\nfor leaks at weekly intervals using one of the methods listed under paragraphs\n(c)(2), (3), (4), (5), and (7) of this section; or\n(c) encased in concrete and monitored for\nleaks at weekly intervals in accordance with paragraph (c)(6) of this section. Continuous electronic monitoring satisfies the weekly monitoring\nrequirement. (ii)\n\nCategory 2 tanks. Category 2 tanks must be monitored for leaks\nat weekly intervals using one of the methods listed under paragraphs (c)(2), (3), (4), and (5) of this section. Continuous electronic monitoring satisfies\nthe weekly monitoring requirement. (iii)\n\nCategory 3 tanks. Category 3 tanks must be monitored for leaks at weekly intervals in accordance\nwith paragraph (c)(5) of this section. Continuous electronic monitoring\nsatisfies the weekly monitoring requirement. (2)\n\nPiping leak detection. Piping that is in contact with the ground and routinely contains petroleum must\nbe monitored for leaks as follows: (i) Pressurized piping. (a) Category 1 piping. Except for piping that is part of UST\nsystems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel oil, Category 1 piping that conveys\npetroleum under pressure must: (1)\nbe\nequipped with an automatic line leak detector that is operated in accordance\nwith paragraph (d)(1) of this section; (2)\nhave an annual line tightness test\nperformed in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section; or\n(3)\nbe monitored for leaks at weekly\nintervals in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of this section. Continuous\nelectronic monitoring satisfies the weekly monitoring\nrequirement. (b) Category 2 piping. Category 2 piping that conveys petroleum\nunder pressure and is part of UST systems storing motor fuel, must be equipped\nwith an automatic line leak detector that is operated in accordance with\nparagraph (d)(1) of this section. (c) Category 3 piping. Category 3 piping that conveys petroleum under pressure and is part of UST\nsystems storing motor fuel, must be equipped with an automatic line leak\ndetector that is operated in accordance with paragraph (d)(1) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nSuction and gravity-fed piping. (a) Category 1 piping. Except for piping that is part of UST systems storing No. 5 or No. 6 fuel oil, Category 1 piping that conveys petroleum under suction must have an annual line\ntightness test in accordance with paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (b) Category 2 piping. Reserved. (c) Category 3\npiping. Reserved. (d) No\nleak detection is required for suction piping that is demonstrated to be\ndesigned and constructed to meet the following standards: (1)\n\nThe piping operates at less than\natmospheric pressure. (2)\n\nThe\npiping is sloped so that the contents of the pipe will drain back into the tank\nif the suction is released. (3)\n\nOnly one check valve is included in each suction line. (4)\n\nThe check valve is located directly below\nand as close as practicable to the suction pump. (c) Tank leak\ndetection methods. Tank leak detection methods used to meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section must be conducted in\naccordance with the following: (1)\n\nTank tightness testing. (i) Tank tightness testing (or another test of equivalent performance) must be\ncapable of detecting a leak at the rate of 0.1 gallon per hour from any portion\nof the tank that routinely contains petroleum while accounting for the effects\nof thermal expansion or contraction of the petroleum, vapor pockets, tank\ndeformation, evaporation or condensation, and the location of the water\ntable. (ii)\n\nQualifications\nof test technicians. Tightness tests must be performed by a technician\nwho has an understanding of variables which affect the test and is trained in\nthe performance of the test. (2)\n\nAutomatic tank gauging. Automatic tank gauging equipment which tests for the loss of petroleum must\nmeet the following requirements: (i) The\nautomatic petroleum level monitor test can detect a leak at the rate of 0.2\ngallon per hour from any portion of the tank that routinely contains\npetroleum. (ii)\n\nThe test must be\nperformed with the equipment operating in one of the following modes: (a) in-tank static testing performed on a\nweekly basis; or\n(b) continuous\nin-tank leak detection operating on an uninterrupted basis or operating within\na process that allows the equipment to gather incremental measurements to\ndetermine the leak status of the tank at weekly\nintervals. (3)\n\nVapor monitoring. Testing or monitoring for vapors within the\nsoil gas of the excavation zone must meet the following requirements: (i) The materials used as backfill are\nsufficiently porous (\ne.g., gravel, sand, crushed rock) to\nreadily allow diffusion of vapors from leaks into the excavation\narea. (ii)\n\nThe stored petroleum, or\na tracer compound placed in the UST system, is sufficiently volatile\n(\ne.g., gasoline) to result in a vapor level that is detectable\nby the monitoring devices located in the excavation zone in the event of a leak\nfrom the tank. (iii)\n\nThe\nmeasurement of vapors by the monitoring device is not rendered inoperative by\ngroundwater, rainfall, soil moisture, or other known interferences so that a\nleak could go undetected for more than seven days. (iv)\n\nThe level of background contamination in\nthe excavation zone will not interfere with the method used to detect leaks\nfrom the tank. (v) Vapor monitors\nare designed and operated to detect any significant increase in concentration\nabove background levels of the petroleum stored in the UST system, a component\nor components of that substance, or a tracer compound placed in the UST\nsystem. (vi)\n\nIn the tank excavation\nzone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance with the requirements of\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph and to establish the number\nand positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will detect leaks within\nthe excavation zone from any portion of the tank that routinely contains\npetroleum. (vii)\n\nMonitoring wells\nare clearly marked in accordance with paragraph 3.2(d)(3) of this Subpart and\nsecured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering. (4)\n\nGroundwater monitoring. Testing or monitoring for liquids on the groundwater must meet the following\nrequirements: (i) The petroleum stored is\nimmiscible in water and has a specific gravity of less than one. (ii)\n\nGroundwater is never more than 20 feet\nfrom the ground surface, and the hydraulic conductivity of the soil(s) between\nthe UST system and the monitoring wells or devices is not less than 0.01 cm/s\n(\ne.g., the soil should consist of gravels, coarse to medium\nsands, coarse silts, or other permeable materials). (iii)\n\nThe slotted portion of the monitoring\nwell casing is designed to prevent migration of natural soils or filter pack\ninto the well and to allow entry of petroleum on the water table into the well\nunder both high and low groundwater conditions. (iv)\n\nMonitoring wells are sealed from the\nground surface to the top of the filter pack. (v) Monitoring wells or devices intercept the\nexcavation zone or are as close to it as is technically feasible. (vi)\n\nThe continuous electronic monitoring\ndevices or manual methods used can detect the presence of at least one-eighth\nof an inch of free product on top of the groundwater in the monitoring\nwells. (vii)\n\nWithin and immediately\nbelow the UST system excavation zone, the site is assessed to ensure compliance\nwith the requirements of subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph and to\nestablish the number and positioning of monitoring wells or devices that will\ndetect leaks from any portion of the tank that routinely contains\npetroleum. (viii)\n\nMonitoring wells\nare clearly marked in accordance with paragraph 3.2(d)(3) of this Subpart and\nsecured to avoid unauthorized access and tampering. (5)\n\nInterstitial monitoring. Interstitial monitoring between the primary and secondary containment may be\nused if the monitoring equipment is designed, constructed, and installed to\ndetect a leak from any portion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum, and if the monitoring equipment meets the requirements of subparagraph (i), (ii), or (iii) of this paragraph: (i) For a\ndouble-walled tank, the sampling or testing method: (a) can detect a leak through the inner wall\nin any portion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum; and\n(b) is capable of detecting a breach in both\nthe inner and outer walls of the tank if using continuous vacuum, pressure, or\nliquid-filled methods of interstitial monitoring. (ii)\n\nFor a UST system with secondary\ncontainment within the excavation zone, the sampling or testing method can\ndetect a leak between the primary and secondary containment, and the following\nconditions are met: (a) The secondary\ncontainment consists of artificially constructed material that is sufficiently\nthick and impermeable (\ni.e., with a permeability rate to water\nequal to or less than 1x10\n-6\ncm/s) to direct a leak\nto the monitoring point and permit its detection. (b) The secondary containment is compatible\nwith the petroleum stored so that a leak from the UST system will not cause a\ndeterioration of the secondary containment, allowing a leak to pass through\nundetected. (c) For cathodically\nprotected tanks, the secondary containment is installed so that it does not\ninterfere with the proper operation of the cathodic protection\nsystem. (d) The groundwater, soil\nmoisture, or rainfall will not render the testing or sampling method\ninoperative so that a leak could go undetected for more than seven\ndays. (e) The site is assessed to\nensure that the secondary containment is always above the groundwater and not\nin a 25-year flood plain, unless the secondary containment and monitoring\ndesigns are for use under such conditions. (f) Monitoring wells are clearly marked in\naccordance with paragraph 3.2(d)(3) of this Subpart and secured to avoid\nunauthorized access and tampering. (iii)\nUST systems installed in a vault that\nallows for monitoring of the vault space, must meet the requirements of clauses\n(ii)(a) through (c) of this paragraph. (6)\n\nWeep holes. Holes in the\nbase of a concrete form encasing a tank that are used to detect leaks from any\nportion of the tank that routinely contains petroleum, must be directly visible\nto an observer and be inspected for obstructions during leak\nmonitoring. (7)\n\nOther\nmethods. Another leak detection method, or combination of methods, can\nbe used if: (i) it can detect a leak at the\nrate of 0.2 gallons per hour with a probability of detection of 95 percent and\na probability of false alarm of 5 percent, and the method is demonstrated to\ndetect a leak as effectively as any of the methods allowed under paragraphs (2)\nthrough (5) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nthe Department approves the method. If\nthe Department approves the method, all conditions imposed by the Department\nmust be met. (d) Piping leak detection\nmethods. Piping leak detection methods used to meet the requirements\nof paragraph (b)(2) of this section must be conducted in accordance with the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nAutomatic line leak\ndetectors. Methods which indicate the presence of a leak by\nrestricting or shutting off the flow of petroleum through piping, or triggering\nan audible or visual alarm, may be used only if they detect leaks of 3 gallons\nper hour at 10 pounds per square inch line pressure within one hour. (2)\n\nLine tightness testing. (i) Line tightness testing must be capable of\ndetecting a leak at the rate of 0.1 gallon per hour at one and one-half times\nthe operating pressure. (ii)\n\nQualifications of test technicians. Tightness tests must be\nperformed by a technician who has an understanding of variables which affect\nthe test and is trained in the performance of the test. (3)\n\nOther methods. The\nmethods listed under paragraphs (c)(3), (4), (5), and (7) of this section may\nbe used if they are designed to detect a leak from any portion of the piping\nthat routinely contains petroleum. (e) Recordkeeping. Records\nrequired by this section must meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe results or records of any sampling, testing, or monitoring must be retained for at least three years. (2)\n\nThe results of tightness testing must be\nretained for three years or until the next test, whichever is later, and\ninclude the following information: (i) facility registration number; (ii)\ntank identification number used on the application form required under section\n1.9 of this Part for the tank or piping tested; (iii)\ndate of test; (iv)\nresults of test; (v) test method; (vi)\ncertification by the technician that the\ntest complies with subparagraph (c)(1)(i) or (d)(2)(i) of this\nsection; (vii)\nstatement of\ntechnician's qualifications; (viii)\naddress of technician; and\n(ix)\nsignature of technician. (3)\nA copy of the results of tightness\ntesting must be submitted to the Department within 30 days after performance of\nthe test(s).
