Tit. 9 § 5.142 - Executive Order No. 142: Directing State Agencies and Authorities to Diversify Transportation Fuel and Hearing Oil Supplies Through the Use of Bio-Fuels in State Vehicles and Buildings. [*]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, New York State agencies and authorities annually\nconsume over 48 million gallons of diesel fuel and 55 million gallons of\nheating oil; WHEREAS, less than 1% of the nation's proven oil reserves\nand less than 0.03% of the world's proven oil reserves are located in New\n\nYork; WHEREAS, New York imports the vast majority of its\ntransportation and heating fuels via extended supply chains that have proven\ncapable of interruption; WHEREAS, the price of crude oil on worldwide markets has\nexperienced dramatic price fluctuations in recent months; WHEREAS, New York's security and economy are threatened by\nan over-reliance upon imported transportation and heating fuels; WHEREAS, over 5% - or 400 million gallons - of New York's\ngasoline requirements are already met through the use of ethanol; WHEREAS, approximately 150 million gallons of annual\nethanol production capacity are currently planned or under construction in New\n\nYork State; WHEREAS, the diesel fuel supply in New York remains\nexclusively dependent upon imported petroleum products; WHEREAS, methyl ester, commonly referred to as bio-diesel, can be produced from New York State agricultural products, such as soybeans and\nother crops, and can be utilized in standard diesel engines without\nmodification; and\nWHEREAS, use of renewable fuels in New York would increase\ndemand for agricultural products grown in the State, improve revenue for the\n\nState's farmers, provide investment and employment opportunities from the\nproduction and distribution of bio-fuels, reduce emissions from diesel engines, increase diversity of fuel supplies, and decrease reliance on foreign sources\nof energy. NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York do hereby order as follows: I. Definitions\nA. \"State Agency\" shall mean any agency or\ndepartment over which the Governor has Executive authority. B. \"Public authority\" shall mean any public\nauthority, the head of which is appointed by the Governor, or the majority of\nthe board members are appointed by the Governor. C. \"B100\" shall mean bio-diesel in its pure\nform. D. \"B20\" shall mean a mixture\nof 20% bio-diesel and 80% petroleum fuel. E. \"B5\" shall mean a mixture of 5% bio-diesel\nand 95% petroleum fuel. F. \"E100\"\nshall mean ethanol in its pure form. G. \"E10\" shall mean a mixture of 10% ethanol\nand 90% petroleum fuel. H. \"E85\"\nshall mean a mixture of 85% ethanol and 15% petroleum fuel. II. Diversification of State\n\nAgency and Public Authority Transportation Fuels\nA. Ethanol\n\nNew York State currently has four E85 Ethanol fueling\nstations and additional E85 fueling stations are planned for future\ninstallation. Currently, the vast majority of the gasoline powered vehicles in\nthe New York State fleet do not utilize central fueling stations, but instead\nrely upon private sector gasoline stations. However, all of the gasoline sold\nin the New York City metropolitan non-attainment area is already 10% ethanol, a\nsignificant component of the State's light-duty fleet is already using blended\nethanol as fuel. Therefore, to the extent that gasoline powered State agency\nvehicles do utilize central fueling stations, all agencies and authorities\nshall ensure that vehicles capable of operating on E85 ethanol fuel shall do so\nwhenever it is feasible to do so. The Governor's Clean Vehicle Council, chaired\nby the Commissioner of the Office of General Services and comprised of the\nfleet managers of State agencies and public authorities, shall prepare a plan\noutlining steps that can be taken to ensure that, to the greatest extent\npossible, all flexible-fueled vehicles in the State fleet than can utilize\nethanol fuels will do so, and identify and implement measures to provide for\nsuch refueling. B. Bio-diesel\n\nThe Governor's Clean Vehicle Council shall prepare a report\ndetailing how such agencies and authorities shall purchase, allocate, distribute and utilize bio-diesel in State agency and public authority fleets. State agencies and public authorities shall purchase, allocate, distribute and\nutilize bio-diesel in accordance with the aforementioned report, and as\nspecified in the table below. The percentage of diesel shall be a blended\nequivalent which results in an overall consumption of B100 as set forth\nbelow. Calendar Year\nB100 Percentage\n2007\n2.0%\n2008\n5.0%\n2009\n6.0%\n2010\n7.0%\n2011\n8.0%\n2012\n10.0%\nIII. Substitution of Biodiesel Usage for\n\nAlternative Fueled Vehicle Requirements of Executive Order No. 111\n\nParagraph V of Executive Order No. 111, issued on June 10, 2001, requires that: \"State Agencies and other affected entities shall procure\nincreasing percentages of alternative-fueled vehicles, including\nhybrid-electric vehicles, as part of their annual vehicle acquisition plans. By\n2005, at least 50% of new light duty vehicles acquired by each agency and each\naffected entity shall be alternative-fueled vehicles, and by 2010, 100 percent\nof all new light-duty vehicles shall be alternatively-fueled vehicles, with the\nexception of specialty, police or emergency vehicles as designated by DOB. State agencies and other affected entities that operate medium- and heavy-duty\nvehicles shall implement strategies to reduce petroleum consumption and\nemissions by using alternative fuels and improving vehicle fleet fuel\nefficiency.\"\nIn complying with the requirements of Paragraph V of\n\nExecutive Order No. 111, State agencies and other affected entities may\nsubstitute the use of 450 gallons of B100 for the acquisition of one\nalternative-fueled vehicle. Use of 2,250 gallons of B20 or use of 9,000 gallons\nof B5 may also be substituted for one alternative fueled vehicle. No more than\n50% of a given State agency fleet's alternative-fueled vehicle purchase\nrequirement may be met by substituting B100, B20 or B5 in accordance with this\n\nOrder. IV. Use of Bio-based\n\nHeating Fuels in State Buildings\n\nThe New York State Energy and Research Development\n\nAuthority (NYSERDA) and the New York City Housing Authority are currently\nconducting a \"Bio-Based Heating Oil Project.\" Although many transportation\napplications can use bio-diesel at concentrations of up to B20, the fuel is\ngenerally used at B5 concentrations for heating and burner applications. Preliminary findings from the study have shown that B5 can be used in process\nand space heating equipment and has resulted in more efficient furnace\noperations and reduced emissions. NYSERDA shall therefore develop a plan pursuant to which\nstate agencies and public authorities shall purchase, allocate, distribute and\nutilize bio-diesel heating oil for use in state agency and public authority\nbuildings that currently utilize oil, as specified in the table below. The\npercentage of diesel shall be a blended equivalent which results in an overall\nconsumption of B100 as set forth below. Calendar Year\nB100 Percentage\n2007\n0.5%\n2008\n1.0%\n2009\n2.0%\n2010\n3.0%\n2011\n4.0%\n2012\n5.0%\nIV. Waiver Provisions\n\nAlthough there is a recognized national specification for\nbio-diesel, and most engines and burners can utilize bio-diesel at\nconcentrations of up to B20 without harm or need for modification, there has\nbeen limited on-road testing of bio-diesel in the State's diesel vehicle fleet. In addition, certain engine manufacturers have taken the position that use of\nbio-diesel fuels above certain concentrations will void existing engine\nwarranties. Many, if not all, of those State vehicles are engaged in\nmission-critical operations that are essential to public safety, convenience\nand welfare. As a result of the limited on-road testing to date, it is possible\nthat the use of bio-diesel in certain vehicles in the State's diesel fleet may\nhave unacceptable impacts upon the reliable and safe operation of such vehicles\nor upon the life cycle or warranted performance of certain critical components\nof such vehicles and therefore may not be prudent. Therefore, the requirements of Paragraphs II, III and IV of\nthis Order may be waived, either in whole or in part, by any State agency or\npublic authority subject to this Order upon a finding from a commissioner of\nthe State agency or the chief executive officer of the public authority that\nadherence to such requirement would have unacceptable impacts upon the reliable\nand safe operation of such vehicles, or upon the life cycle or warranted\nperformance of certain critical components of such vehicles. Such waivers shall\nbe in effect no longer than necessary to address the condition, or for a\nmaximum of 60 days from the issuance of the finding, whichever one is less; however, in the event that the condition that gives rise to the waiver is not\ncapable of being resolved within a 60-day period, such waivers may be extended\nfor an additional period by the State agency or public authority with the\nconcurrence of the President of NYSERDA, after consultation with the\n\nCommissioner of the Department of Environmental Conservation.
