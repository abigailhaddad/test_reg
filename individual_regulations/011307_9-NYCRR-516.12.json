(1)\n\nCases required\nto be referred to a Board of Military Review. The State judge advocate must\nrefer to the Board of Military Review the record in each trial by court-martial\nwhich: (i) the sentence, as approved, extends\nto dismissal of an officer or cadet, dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or\nconfinement; and\n(ii)\nthe accused\nhas not waived or withdrawn appellate review. (2)\n\nCases reviewed by the State judge\nadvocate. (i) Mandatory examination of\ncertain general courts-martial. Except when the accused has waived the right to\nappellate review or withdrawn such review, the record of trial by a general\ncourt-martial in which there has been a finding of guilty, the appellate review\nof which is not provided for in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, must be\nexamined in the office of the staff judge advocate. If any part of the findings\nor sentence is found unsupported in law, or, if reassessment of the sentence is\nappropriate, the State judge advocate may modify or set aside the findings or\nsentence or both. If the State judge advocate so directs, the records must be\nreviewed by the Board of Military Review in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 1203. If\nthe case is forwarded to the Military Review, the accused must be informed and\nhas the rights under N.Y.R.C.M. 1202(b)(2). (ii)\n\nMandatory review of cases forwarded\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 1112(g)(1). The State judge advocate must review each case\nforwarded under N.Y.R.C.M. 1112(g)(1). On such review, the State judge advocate\nmay vacate or modify, in whole or in part, the findings or sentence, or both, of a court-martial on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the\ncourt-martial, lack of jurisdiction over the accused or the offense, error\nprejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused, or the appropriateness of\nthe sentence. (iii)\n\nReview by the\n\nState judge advocate after final review. (a) In general. Notwithstanding N.Y.R.C.M. 1209, the State judge advocate may, sua\nsponte or upon application of the accused or a person with authority to act for\nthe accused, vacate or modify, in whole or in part, the findings, sentence, or\nboth of a court-martial which has been finally reviewed, but has not been\nreviewed by the Board of Military Review or by the State judge advocate under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, on the ground of newly discovered evidence, fraud on the court-martial, lack of jurisdiction over the accused, or the\noffense, error prejudicial to the substantial rights of the accused, or\nappropriateness of the sentence (ML, 130.68[b]). (b) Procedure. The State judge advocate must\nprovide procedure for considering all cases properly submitted under\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph and may prescribe the manner by which an\napplication for relief under subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph may be made\nand, if submitted by a person other than the accused, may require that the\napplicant show authority to act on behalf of the accused. (c) Time limits on applications. Any\napplication for review by the State judge advocate under ML, 130.68 must be\nmade on or before the last day of the two-year period beginning on the date the\nsentence is approved by the convening authority, unless the accused establishes\ngood cause for failure to file within that time. (iv)\n\nRehearing. If the State judge advocate\nsets aside the findings or sentence, the State judge advocate may, except when\nthe setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the record to\nsupport the findings, order a rehearing. If the State judge advocate sets aside\nthe findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, the State judge\nadvocate shall order that the charges be dismissed. If the State judge advocate\norders a rehearing but the convening authority finds a rehearing impractical, the convening authority must dismiss the charges. (3)\n\nRemission and suspension. The State judge\nadvocate may, when so authorized by the Chief of Staff to the Governor under\nML, 130.72 at any time remit or suspend the unexpected part of any sentence, other than a sentence approved by the Governor. (b) Appellate counsel. (1)\n\nIn general. The State judge advocate may\ndetail one or more officers as appellate counsel and must detail one or more\nofficers as appellate defense counsel. (2)\n\nDuties. (i) Appellate State counsel. Appellate State\ncounsel represent the State before the reviewing authority when directed to do\nso by the State judge advocate. (ii)\n\nAppellate defense counsel. Appellate\ndefense counsel represent the accused before the reviewing authority, the staff\njudge advocate and the State judge advocate, when the accused is a party in the\ncase before such and requests to be represented by appellate defense counsel. Appellate defense counsel is authorized to communicate\ndirectly with the accused. The accused is a party in the case when named as a\nparty in pleadings before the reviewing authority or staff judge advocate or\nbefore the State judge advocate or, even if not so named, when the military\njudge is named as respondent in a petition by the government for extraordinary\nrelief from a ruling in favor of the accused at trial. (c) Review by the Board\nof Military Review. (1)\n\nIn general. The State\njudge advocate must establish a Board of Military Review composed of not less\nthan three officers of the organized militia or on the State reserve list or\n\nState retired list, each of whom must be a member of the board of the State\n(see ML, 130.65[a]). No member of the Board of Military Review can review the\nrecord of any trial member of the court-martial before which such trial was\nconducted, or served as military judge, trial or defense counsel, or reviewing\nofficer (see ML, 130.65[g]). (2)\n\nCases reviewed by a Board of Military Review. A Board of Military Review must\nreview cases referred to it by the State judge advocate under N.Y.R.C.M. 1201(a) or (b)(1). (3)\n\nAction on\ncases considered by the Board of Military Review. (i) In general. In a case referred to it, the\n\nBoard of Military Review may act only with respect to the findings and sentence\nas approved by the convening authority. It may affirm only such findings of\nguilty and the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as it finds\ncorrect in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record, it may weight the evidence, judge the credibility of witnesses and determine controverted questions of\nfact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses (ML, 130.65[c]). (ii)\n\nAction when\nsentence is set aside. If the Board of Military Review sets aside the findings\nand sentence, it may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of\nsufficient evidence in the record to support the findings, order a rehearing. If it sets aside the findings and sentence and does not order a rehearing, it\nmust order that the charges be dismissed (ML, 130.65[d]). (iii)\n\nAction subject to approval by Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor. The action taken by the Board of Military Review is\nsubject to the approval of the Chief of Staff to the Governor. If the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor disapproves the action taken by the Board of Military\n\nReview, he may take any action on the sentence or findings that could be taken\nby the convening authority under ML, 130.60 (ML, 130.65[e]). (iv)\n\nAction by the State judge advocate. The\n\nState judge advocate shall, unless there is to be further action by the\n\nGovernor, instruct the convening authority to take action in accordance with\nthe decision of the Board of Military Review as approved by the Chief of Staff\nto the Governor. If the Board of Military Review has ordered a rehearing but\nthe convening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, the convening\nauthority may dismiss the charges (ML, 130.65[f]). (v) Action when accused lacks mental\ncapacity. An appellate authority may not affirm the proceedings while the\naccused lacks mental capacity to understand and to conduct or cooperate\nintelligently in the appellate hearings. In the absence of substantial evidence\nto the contrary, the accused is presumed to have the capacity to understand and\nto conduct or cooperate intelligently in the appellate proceedings. If a\nsubstantial question is raised as to the requisite mental capacity of the\naccused, the appellate authority may direct that the record be forwarded to an\nappropriate authority for an examination of the accused in accordance with\nN.Y.R.C.M. 706, that the examination may be limited to determining the\naccused's present capacity to understand and cooperate in the appellate\nproceedings. The order of the appellate authority will instruct the appropriate\nauthority as to permissible actions that may be taken to dispose of the matter. If the record is thereafter returned to the appellate authority, the appellate\nauthority may affirm part or all of the findings or sentence unless it is\nestablished, by a preponderance of the evidence--including matters outside the\nrecord of trial--that the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity. If the accused does not have the requisite mental capacity, the appellate\nauthority shall stay the proceedings until the accused regains appropriate\ncapacity, or take other appropriate action. Nothing in this paragraph shall\nprohibit the appellate authority from making a determination in favor of the\naccused which will result in the setting aside of a conviction. (4)\n\nNotification to accused. (i) Notification of decision. The accused\nmust be notified of the decision of the Board of Military Review. (ii)\n\nNotification of right to petition the\n\nGovernor for review.

The endorsement must inform the\naccused that such a petition: (a) may be filed\nonly within 60 days form the earlier of: (1)\nthe date on which the accused was notified of the decision of the Board of\n\nMilitary Review and the approval of the Chief of Staff to the Governor; or\n(2)\nthe date on which a copy of\nthe decision of the Board of Military Review and the approval of the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor, after being served on counsel of record for the accused\n(if any), is deposited in the United States mail for delivery by first class, certified mail to the accused, at an address provided by the accused or, if no\nsuch address has been provided by the accused, at the latest address noted for\nthe accused in his official service record (ML, 130.66[b]); and\n(b) may be forwarded through the\nofficer immediately exercising general court- martial jurisdiction over the\naccused and through the Chief of Staff to the Governor or filed directly with\nthe Governor. (iii)\n\nReceipt by the accused; disposition. The receipt by the accused of a copy of\nthe decision of the Board of Military Review, a certificate of service on the\naccused, or the postal receipt for delivery of certified mail must be\ntransmitted in duplicate by expeditious means to the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor. If the accused is personally served, the receipt or certificate of\nservice must show the date of service. The Chief of Staff to the Governor must\nforward one copy of the receipt, certificate, or postal receipt to the Governor\nwhen required by him. (5)\n\nCases not reviewed by the Governor. If\nthe accused has not timely petitioned the Governor to review the decision of\nthe Board of Military Review and approval by the Chief of Staff to the Governor\nor, if the Governor has denied a petition for review, the State judge advocate\nmust: (i) if the sentence affirmed by the\n\nBoard of Military Review includes a dismissal and is approved by the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor, transmit the record, the decision of the Board of\n\nMilitary Review and approval of the Chief of Staff to the Governor for action\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 1205; or\n(ii)\nif\nthe sentence affirmed by the Board of Military Review does not include a\ndismissal, notify the convening authority, the officer exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over the accused, or the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor, as appropriate, who, subject to N.Y.R.C.M. 1113(c)(1), may order into\nexecution any unexecuted sentence affirmed by the Board of Military Review or\ntake other action, as authorized. (d) Review by the Governor. (1)\n\nCases reviewed by the Governor. The\n\nGovernor shall review the record in all cases reviewed by a Board of Military\n\nReview and approved by the Chief of Staff to the Governor in which, upon\npetition by the accused and on good cause shown, the Governor grants such\nreview. (2)\n\nCounsel to assist the\naccused in connection with review by the Governor. When the accused is notified\nof the right to forward a petition for review by the Governor, if requested by\nthe accused, associate counsel qualified under N.Y.R.C.M. 502(d)(1) must be\ndetailed to advise and assist the accused in connection with preparing a\npetition for further appellate review.

He may affirm only such findings of\nguilty in the sentence or such part or amount of the sentence, as he finds\ncorrect in law and fact and determines, on the basis of the entire record, should be approved. In considering the record, he may weigh the evidence, judge\nthe credibility of witnesses and determine controverted questions of fact, recognizing that the trial court saw and heard the witnesses (ML, 130.66). (ii)\n\nAction when sentence\nis set aside. If the Governor set aside the findings and sentence, he may, except where the setting aside is based on lack of sufficient evidence in the\nrecord to support the findings, order a rehearing. If he sets aside the\nfindings and sentence, and does not order a rehearing, he must order that the\ncharges be dismissed. If the Governor has ordered a rehearing, but the\nconvening authority finds a rehearing impracticable, he may dismiss the\ncharges. (e) Powers and Responsibilities of the Chief of Staff to the Governor. (1)\n\nSentences requiring approval by the Chief\nof Staff to the Governor. No part of a sentence extending to dismissal of an\nofficer may be executed until approved by the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor. (2)\n\nRemission and\nsuspension. (i) In general.

The reappointment of such a\nformer officer must be consistent with Federal regulations (ML, 130.73[c]). (g) Finality of courts-martial. (1)\n\nWhen a conviction is final. A\ncourt-martial conviction is final when: (i) Review is completed by a Board of Military Review and approved by the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor; and\n(a) the accused\ndoes not file a timely petition for review by the Governor; (b) a petition for review is denied or\notherwise rejected by the Governor. (ii)\n\nIn cases not reviewed by a Board of\n\nMilitary Review: (a) the findings and sentence\nhave been found legally sufficient by a judge advocate and, when action by such\nofficer is required, have been approved by the officer exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction over the accused at the time the court-martial was\nconvened (or that officer's successor); or\n(b) the findings and sentence have been\naffirmed by the State judge advocate when review by the State judge advocate is\nrequired under N.Y.R.C.M. 1112(g)(1) or 1201(b)(1). (2)\n\nEffect of finality. The\nappellate review of records of trial provided by the code, the proceedings, findings and sentences of courts-martial as approved, reviewed or affirmed as\nrequired by the code, and all dismissals and discharges carried into execution\nunder sentences by courts-martial following approval, review, or affirmation is\nrequired by the code, are final and conclusive. Orders publishing the\nproceedings of courts-martial and all action taken pursuant to those\nproceedings are binding upon all departments, courts, agencies, and officers of\nthe State, subject only to action upon a petition for a new trial under ML, 130.71 or action by the Chief of Staff to the Governor as provided in ML, 130.72 and the authority of the Governor (ML, 130.74). (h) New trial. (1)\n\nIn general. At any time within two years\nafter approval by the convening authority of a court-martial sentence, the\naccused may petition the State judge advocate for a new trial on the ground of\nnewly discovered evidence or fraud on the court-martial. A petition may not be\nsubmitted after the death of the accused. (2)\n\nWho may petition. A petition for a new\ntrial may be submitted by the accused personally, or by the accused's counsel, regardless of whether the accused has been separated from the\nservice. (3)\n\nForm of petition. A\npetition for a new trial in triplicate, is to be written and signed under oath\nor affirmation by the accused, by a person possessing the power of attorney of\nthe accused for that purpose, or by a person with the authorization of an\nappropriate court to sign the petition as the representative of the accused. The petition must contain the following information, or an explanation why such\nmatters are not included: (i) the name, service number and current address of the accused; (ii)\nthe date and location of the\ntrial; (iii)\nthe type of\ncourt-martial and the title or position of the convening authority; (iv)\nthe sentence or a description thereof as\napproved or affirmed, with any later reduction thereof by clemency or\notherwise; (v) the request for the\nnew trial; (vi)\na brief description\nof any findings or sentence believed to be unjust; (vii)\na full statement of the newly\ndiscovered evidence or fraud on the court-martial which is relief upon for the\nremedy sought; (viii)\naffidavits\npertinent to the matters in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph; and\n(ix)\nthe affidavit of each person whom the\naccused expects to present as a witness in the event of a new trial. Each such\naffidavit should set forth briefly facts within the personal knowledge of the\nwitness. (4)\n\nEffect of\npetition. The submission of a petition for a new trial does not stay the\nexecution of a sentence. (5)\n\nWho\nmay act on petition. If the accused's case is pending before a Board of\n\nMilitary Review or the Governor, the State judge advocate must refer the\npetition to that board or to the Governor, as appropriate, for action. Otherwise, the State judge advocate must act on the petition (ML, 130.71). (6)\n\nGrounds for new trial. (i) In general. A new trial may be granted\nonly on grounds of newly discovered evidence of fraud on the\ncourt-martial. (ii)\n\nNewly\ndiscovered evidence. A new trial cannot be granted on the grounds of newly\ndiscovered evidence unless the petition shows that: (a) the evidence was discovered after the\ntrial; (b) the evidence is not such\nthat it would have been discovered by the petitioner at the time of trial in\nthe exercise of due diligence; and\n(c) the newly discovered evidence, if\nconsidered by a court-martial in the light of all other pertinent evidence, would probably produce a substantially more favorable result for the\naccused. (iii)\n\nFraud on\ncourt-martial. No fraud on the court-martial warrants a new trial unless it had\na substantial contributing effect on a finding of guilty or the sentence\nadjudged. (7)\n\nAction on\nthe petition. The authority considering the petition may cause such additional\ninvestigation to be made and such additional information to be secured as that\nauthority believes appropriate. Upon written request, and in its discretion, the authority considering the petition may permit oral argument on the matter. If the State judge advocate or a Board of Military Review believes meritorious\ngrounds for relief under ML, 130.72 have been established but that a new trial\nis not appropriate, he or she may act under ML, 130.72 if authorized to do so, or transmit the petition and related papers to the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor with a recommendation. The State judge advocate may also, in cases\nwhich have been finally reviewed but have not been reviewed by a Board of\n\nMilitary Review, act under ML, 130.68. (8)\n\nAction when new trial is granted. (i) Forwarding to convening authority. When a\npetition for a new trial is granted, the State judge advocate must select and\nforward the case to a convening authority for disposition. (ii)\n\nCharges at new trial. At a new trial, the accused may not be tried for any offense of which the accused was found not\nguilty or upon which the accused was not tried at the earlier\ncourt-martial. (iii)\n\nAction by\nconvening authority. The convening authority's action on the record of a new\ntrial is the same as in other court-martial. (iv)\n\nDisposition of record. The disposition\nof the record of a new trial is the same as for other courts-martial. (v) Court-martial orders.

(vi)\n\nAction by persons charged with execution\nof the sentence. Persons charged with the administrative duty of executing a\nsentence adjudged upon a new trial after it has been ordered and executed must\ncredit the accused with any executed portion or amount of the original sentence\nincluded in the new sentence in computing the term of the amount of punishment\nactually to be executed pursuant to the sentence.
