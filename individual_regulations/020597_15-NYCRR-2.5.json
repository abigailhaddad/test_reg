  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 2.5 - Effect of student certificate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A student presenting a student\ncertificate to the department within two years after issuance shall not be\nrequired to pass the written test and traffic sign and symbol tests in applying\nfor a license. However, the passing of the road test and vision test shall\nremain a requirement. (b) To be\nexempt from the written and traffic sign and symbol tests, the student\ncertificate (form MV-285) must be presented at time of tests. (1)\n\nAny student between the ages of 16 and 17\nmay file an application for a class DJ license provided a parent or guardian\nsigns the statement of consent on the application. For exemption from the\nwritten and traffic sign tests, form MV-285 must be shown as stated in the\npreceding paragraph. (2)\n\nAny\nstudent who has reached his 17th birthday, but has not attained the age of 18, may obtain a class D license. If the student already holds a class DJ license, he must surrender the Class DJ license and the student certificate (form\nMV-285) to the Department of Motor Vehicles. After filing proper forms, a class\nD driver's license will be issued upon payment of the proper fee. The fact that\na student possesses form MV-285 and a class DJ license, although 17 years of\nage, will not exempt the student from the provisions of the class DJ\nrestrictions. Any student not holding a class DJ license at the age of 17 may\nfile an application for a class D license, surrender form MV-285, pay proper\nfee and must successfully pass the vision test and driving test. The holder of\na class D license at the age of 17 may legally operate a motor vehicle any\nplace in the State of New York and such operation is legal at any hour, day or\nnight, without the holder of the license being accompanied by a licensed driver\n18 years of age or over, or a parent, guardian or one in loco parentis to the\nlicensee. (3)\n\nAny student 18 years\nof age or over desiring a license, by filing proper application, may obtain a\nclass D license after passing the road test and vision test. (c) The procedural provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section relating to the change from a class DJ to a\nclass D driver's license would also apply to the change from a class MJ to a\nclass M driver's license if applicable.
