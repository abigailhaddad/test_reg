  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.9 - Minimum treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nAll wastes shall be treated to\nremove practically all suspended solids and shall receive such additional\ntreatment as determined by the commission upon consideration of the waste\nassimilative capacity of the receiving stream and as required to meet the\nlimitations of Part 860 of this Title. (2)\n\nWastes containing biodegradable matter\nshall receive a minimum of secondary treatment as defined in the\nstandards. (3)\n\nBiodegradable and\nother waste matter to be treated or reduced shall not include that incorporated\nin influent waters, unless special circumstances as determined by the\ncommission require such inclusion. (b) BOD reduction. (1)\n\nThe 85 percent minimum BOD reduction for\nsecondary treatment will be determined by an average of samples taken over each\nperiod of 30 consecutive days of the year. (2)\n\nIt is recognized that optimum efficiency\nmay not be achieved with certain secondary treatment facilities during the\ncolder months. A slight deviation may be permitted by the commission when it\nresults from reduced plant efficiency caused by temperatures below 59° F (15°\nC). (3)\n\nFor dilute industrial\nprocess wastewater, the percent BOD reduction may be modified, upon\napplication, provided it has been demonstrated that the best management\npractices and the highest degree of waste treatment determined to be\npracticable will be applied. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n861.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
