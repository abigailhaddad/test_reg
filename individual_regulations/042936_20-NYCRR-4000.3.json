  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 4000.3 - Request for conciliation conference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Filing of request. (1)\n\nAny person who has received a statutory\nnotice may request a conciliation conference using the form prescribed by the\ndepartment or by filing a written request with the Bureau of Conciliation and\n\nMediation Services, either in person at the offices in Albany or by mail\naddressed to: Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance\n\nBuilding 9\nW. A. Harriman Campus\n\nAlbany, NY 12227\n(2)\nA request for a conciliation conference\nregarding the denial of an application for a license, permit or registration, or the cancellation, suspension or revocation of a license, permit or\nregistration, shall be addressed to the director of the Bureau of Conciliation\nand Mediation Services. (3)\n\nRequests should be typewritten, if possible, and should include the information\nset forth in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. Because the conciliation\nconference provides an informal and inexpensive way to resolve controversies\nwithout the need for a hearing, it is strongly recommended that a request for a\nconciliation conference be filed prior to the filing of a petition with the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals. (4)\n\nIn\naddition to the methods prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, a\nperson who has received a statutory notice may request a conciliation\nconference with the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services in any other\nmanner as prescribed by the department. (b) Form of request. (1)\n\nThe request should contain: (i) the name and address of the\nrequester; (ii)\nthe name and\naddress of the requester's representative, if any; (iii)\nif applicable, the taxable years or\nperiods involved and the amount of tax in controversy; (iv)\nthe action or actions of the operating\ndivision or bureau which are being protested; (v) the facts and law which the requester\nasserts are relevant to the controversy; (vi)\nthe signature of the requester or the\nrequester's representative beneath a statement that the request is made with\nknowledge that a willfully false representation is a misdemeanor punishable\nunder section\n210.45\nof the Penal Law; (vii)\na legible copy of the statutory notice\nbeing protested; and\n(viii)\nthe\noriginal or a legible copy of the power of attorney. (2)\n\nThe bureau may at any time during the\nconciliation conference proceeding ask the requester to supply additional\ninformation in order to properly process the request for conference and resolve\nthe issues raised in such request. (c) Time limitations. The request must be\nfiled within the time limitations prescribed by the applicable statutory\nsections for filing a petition for hearing in the Division of Tax Appeals, and\nthere can be no extension of those time limitations. Where the Division of Tax\n\nAppeals has referred a matter to the Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation\n\nServices pursuant to section\n3000.3\n(e) of this Title, the taxpayer will be deemed to have requested a conciliation\nconference as of the date of filing the petition. A timely request for a\nconciliation conference suspends the running of the period of limitations for\nthe filing of a petition for hearing (see sections\n4000.5\n[c][4]\nand\n4000.6\nof this Part). However, it does not suspend the accrual of any amount that may\nbe due for addition to tax, interest or penalty on any amount of tax finally\ndetermined to be due. (d) Notification to Division of Tax Appeals and other bureaus. The Bureau of\n\nConciliation and Mediation Services shall notify the Division of Tax Appeals\nand other appropriate divisions or bureaus of the department when any person\nrequests a conciliation conference.
