(d) In making a\ndetermination whether to grant the request for a waiver, the members of the\n\nInter-Office Coordinating Council shall consider the following: (1)\n\nWhether the director will have adequate\ntime to competently perform all the functions, duties and responsibilities as\nthe director of community services.

In order to determine\nthis, factors which may be considered include, but are not limited to, the\nfollowing: (i) Inconsistencies in the\nfunctions of the two positions, whereby the position holder could not fully and\nimpartially discharge the duties of both positions without conflict. (ii)\n\nThe right of the holder of one position\nto interfere with the other, such as where one position is subordinate to or\nsubject to audit and review by the other. (3)\n\nWhether the code of ethics adopted by the\nlocality, pursuant to General Municipal Law, article 18, would permit the\nholding of both positions by one individual.
