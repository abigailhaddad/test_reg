This section, if applicable, must be on a separate page following the\ntable of contents. All features of a plan which involve significant risk or are reasonably likely to affect disproportionately or unusually the\ncommon charges or obligations of unit owners in future years of condominium operation must be conspicuously disclosed and highlighted. A brief\ndescription of the nature of the risk should be given in this section and a more thorough description should be given in a referenced later section. Uncertainties as to whether a risk should be described in this section should be resolved in favor of inclusion. (1)\n\nDisclose whether sponsor is reserving the right to rent rather than sell units after the plan has been\nconsummated and whether sponsor is limiting its right to rent rather than sell after the plan has been consummated based on objective articulable\ncriteria, such as a significant decline in market prices of a specific percentage and the conditions upon which the sponsor would resume sales. If\nsponsor has obtained construction financing, disclose the terms of the construction loan as they apply to the sponsor's obligation to market the\nunits for sale, including any minimum number or percentage of units which must be under contract before the plan can be declared effective, the\nexistence of either a minimum release price set by the lender or a required minimum payment per sale which must be made to the lender in order for\nthe lender to release its lien from the unit being sold, and limits or requirements imposed by the lender for sponsor to rent rather than sell under\nspecified market conditions. If sponsor is reserving an unconditional right to rent rather than sell, the cover of the plan must state in bold print: BECAUSE SPONSOR IS RETAINING THE UNCONDITIONAL RIGHT TO RENT RATHER\nTHAN SELL UNITS AFTER THE PLAN HAS BEEN CONSUMMATED, THIS PLAN MAY NOT RESULT IN THE CREATION OF A CONDOMINIUM IN WHICH A MAJORITY OF THE UNITS ARE\nOWNED BY OWNER-OCCUPANTS OR INVESTORS UNRELATED TO THE SPONSOR. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION OF THE PLAN.)\n\nFurther disclose, in the Special Risks section, that because sponsor is\nnot limiting the conditions under which it will rent rather than sell units after the plan has been consummated, there is no commitment to sell more\nunits than the 15 percent necessary to declare the plan effective and owner-occupants may never gain effective control and management of the\ncondominium. (2)\n\nIf the bylaws of the condominium do not include a provision that, after an\ninitial sponsor voting control period a majority of the board of managers must be owner-occupants or members of an owner-occupant's household who are\nunrelated to the sponsor and its principals, this fact must be disclosed as a special risk and if either of these special risks exist, the cover of\nthe plan must state in bold print. PURCHASERS FOR THEIR OWN OCCUPANCY MAY NEVER GAIN CONTROL OF THE\nBOARD OF MANAGERS UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS PLAN. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION OF THE PLAN.)\n\nDisclose further that owner-occupants and non-resident owners, including\nsponsor, may have inherent conflicts on how the condominium shall be managed because of their different reasons for purchasing, i.e., purchase as a home as opposed to as an investment. (d) Introduction. The introduction must: (1)\n\nExplain that the purpose of the offering plan is to set forth all the material terms of the offer. Explain that the plan may be amended from time to\ntime when an amendment is filed with the New York State Department of Law. State that amendments will be served on all offerees as defined in section\n20.1\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nState that the condominium is subject to and complies with the New York Condominium Act or the\nlaw regulating condominiums in the State where the property is located. (3)\n\nIdentify the sponsor, and\nstate when the sponsor acquired the property or sponsor's interest as a contract vendee. (4)\n\nDisclose\nsponsor's intent with regard to the sale of units offered for sale in the plan. Disclose whether sponsor represents that it will endeavor in good\nfaith to sell units rather than rent after the plan has been consummated. If sponsor makes a bulk sale of all or some of its unsold units, the\ntransferee successor sponsor is bound by sponsor's representations regarding its commitment to sell units. If sponsor has obtained construction\nfinancing, disclose the terms of the construction loan as they apply to the sponsor's obligation to market the units for sale, including any minimum\nnumber or percentage of units which must be under contract before the plan can be declared effective, the existence of either a minimum release price\nset by the lender or a required minimum payment per sale which must be made to the lender in order for the lender to release its lien from the unit\nbeing sold, and limits or requirements imposed by the lender for sponsor to rent rather than sell under specified market conditions. If sponsor has\nnot obtained construction financing or if the construction loan agreement does not include provisions on the terms set forth in the previous\nsentence, disclose any conditions under which sponsor reserves the right to rent than sell after the plan has been consummated based on objective\narticulable criteria, such as a significant decline in market prices of a specific percentage and the conditions under which sponsor would resume\nsales. If sponsor retains unconditional discretion to rent rather than sell units after the plan has been consummated, include on the cover of the\nplan the warning set forth in paragraph (c)(1) of this section and discuss as a special risk. (5)\n\nSummarize the number and the type of units being offered in this offering plan, whether the units are residential or otherwise, any parking or\nrecreational facilities and refer to schedule A for prices. Identify any units or property interests that are not being offered such as commercial\nspace, the superintendent's apartment, and common areas.

(7)\n\nOutline the basic aspects of condominium ownership, including the following: (i) that each purchaser owns his or her unit outright and is entitled to exclusive possession of that unit together\nwith an interest in and right to use the common elements, and exclusive right to use limited common elements, if applicable; (ii)\na description of the differences between space owned exclusively by a unit owner and common elements and\nlimited common elements, where applicable; (iii)\nthat each unit owner must pay common charges in\naccordance with the New York Condominium Act, Real Property Law section\n339 (i)\nand (m), or applicable State and local law; (iv)\nthat each unit owner is obligated to comply with the\ndeclaration, the bylaws, rules and regulations and any other requirements of the board of managers; (v) any restrictions on use, resale, leasing or mortgaging; the Department of Law may, in its discretion, require an opinion from counsel for sponsor or\nindependent counsel as to the legality and enforceability of these restrictions; (vi)\nthe authority of\nthe board of managers to manage the condominium, and the unit owner's right to vote for members of the board of managers; (vii)\nthat each unit will be separately taxed and may be separately mortgaged; and\n(viii)\na unit owner's responsibility for maintenance and repairs and for casualty and liability insurance, as\ndistinguished from the obligations of the board of managers; (ix)\nif applicable, that the condominium\nboard does not have the right to approve or disapprove purchasers, that there is no limit on the number of owners who may purchase for investment\nrather than for personal occupancy and that there may always be a substantial percentage of owners who are non-residents. (8)\n\nDisclose and specify if any equipment or fixtures described in the plan are not included in the offering price, or if the offering price is conditioned on the equipment and fixtures selected. (9)\n\nState that the prices\nare not subject to approval by the Department of Law or any other government agency. (10)\n\nState that the\nplan delivered to prospective purchasers contains all of the material terms of the transaction. State that copies of the plan, all documents referred\nto in the plan and all exhibits submitted to the Department of Law in connection with the filing of the plan will be available for inspection without\ncharge and for copying at a reasonable charge to prospective purchasers and their attorneys at the site whenever the on site sales office is open and\nat the office of the selling agent or sponsor. (11)\n\nState any lawful limitations on who may purchase\nunits. (12)\n\nInclude the following paragraph printed in bold-face roman type at least as large as\neight-point modern type and at least two points leaded: THE PURCHASE OF A CONDOMINIUM UNIT HAS MANY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL AND FINANCIAL\nCONSEQUENCES.

(3)\n\nState whether the property will\nbe improved and the units constructed in accordance with all applicable zoning and building laws, requirements and specify the laws and regulations\nthat apply. (4)\n\nIf applicable, state the approximate construction timetable for completion of the first\nunit, the remaining units, related sections of the condominium, recreational facilities and amenities. (5)\n\nState whether any roads to be constructed by sponsor will be dedicated to the local government. Describe access\nfrom the condominium to public roads. (f) Location and area information.

Describe the police, fire, water, sanitation, snow removal and road\nmaintenance services. If any such services are not provided by the local taxing authorities, the cost of such services must be included in Schedule\nB. (2)\n\nDescribe the zoning of the site and what uses are permitted as of right, including landmark\ndesignation and any approvals required. If any adjoining areas are undeveloped, disclose the permitted uses of the adjoining areas. (3)\n\nIf sponsor or any principals of sponsor own, in whole or part, or have an option or right to acquire, in whole\nor part, any adjacent areas which are not fully developed, disclose such facts and the present intention of sponsor and principals with respect to\nthe development of such areas.

Indicate that all projected charges are for a stated 12-month period, e.g., January 1, 20_ to December 31, 20_. Totals must be given for subparagraphs (iii), (iv), (v), (viii), (ix) and (x) of this\nparagraph. (i) Unit identification. (ii)\n\nNumber of bedrooms and\nbathrooms (if applicable). (iii)\n\nApproximate total area of each unit. (iv)\n\nOffering price. (vi)\n\nMaximum mortgage on each unit (if financing\nis offered). (v) Percentage of common interest.

(This is a total of subpargraphs [vii], [viii] and [ix] of this paragraph.)\n(2)\n\nDetailed\nfootnotes must support and explain the information in schedule A. These footnotes must include but are not limited to the following: (i) For the number of rooms, state the method of calculating the number of rooms or approximate total area in each\nunit. If rooms are calculated in accordance with an industry standard, refer to the industry standard employed. Indicate which units, if any, have\nthe use of a limited common element. State that floor plans are included in the plan in Part II. (ii)\n\nFor\nthe offering price, refer to the portion of the plan that explains price changes. If applicable, explain that prices and other terms are\nnegotiable. (iii)\n\nFor the offering price, refer to the portion of the plan that explains any closing\ncosts that a purchaser may have to pay. (iv)\n\nFor the percentage of common interest, disclose the basis\nfor calculating the percentage of common interest including a reference to the method selected pursuant to section 339(i) of the Real Property Law, or applicable state law. (v) For the projected monthly carrying charges, disclose that if sponsor is not\noffering or procuring mortgage financing and if the purchaser obtains financing, the purchaser's debt service will be an additional expense. Disclose\nthat projected carrying charges do not include certain costs for which the unit owner is responsible such as (where applicable) repairs to the\ninterior of the unit, separately metered gas, electricity, hot water, heat, air conditioning and cable television service. If unit owners\nindividually pay for heat and hot water costs, or for costs usually included in the common charges, refer to schedule B-1 for individual carrying\ncharges; see paragraph (h)(5) of this section. (vi)\n\nFor the projected real estate taxes, state that after\nthe condominium is divided into individual tax lots, each unit will be taxed as a separate tax lot for real estate tax purposes and the unit owner\nwill not be responsible for the payment of, nor will the unit be subject to, any lien arising from the non-payment of taxes on other units. Discuss\nthe deductibility of real estate taxes for income tax purposes. State the projected assessed valuation, after completion of construction or\nrehabilitation, the approximate date of completion and reassessment, and the tax rate used to calculate the projected real estate taxes. If any\nclosings are projected to occur before the post-completion assessment is given to the building, sponsor may also disclose the pre-completion\nassessment. When tax exemption or tax abatement benefits are projected but not yet obtained, the real estate tax reflected in Schedule A may be the\nlower tax only if the preliminary certificate of eligibility for Real Property Law section 421-a benefits has been obtained or if the certificate of\nreasonable cost has been obtained for benefits under section 11-243 (J-51) of the New York City Administrative Code. If such certificates have not\nbeen obtained prior to acceptance for filing, schedule A must contain two tax columns, one reflecting real estate taxes with benefits and one without\nbenefits, whether or not the sponsor agrees to pay the taxes for the first year of condominium operation. The possibility of not obtaining real\nestate tax benefits should be included in the special risk section of the plan and purchasers should be clearly advised that they are purchasing with\nno guarantee of obtaining tax benefits. If the condominium is an existing building being sold without rehabilitation or is undergoing minimum\nrehabilitation, state the present assessed valuation. Refer to the section of the plan which discusses real estate taxes; see subdivision (x) of this\nsection. (vii)\n\nFor the projected income tax deduction, explain that the projected tax deduction (where\napplicable) may vary in future years due to changes in the interest rate on the unit owner's mortgage (if any) or from changes in the allocation of\nconstant debt service payments to interest and principal, or due to changes in real property taxes resulting from the expiration of real estate tax\nbenefits, or from changes in the assessed value, the tax rate or the method of assessing real property. (viii)\n\nFor maximum mortgage, disclose the maximum mortgage financing available pursuant to financing commitments\noffered or procured by sponsor, if any. If sponsor is not offering and has not procured mortgage financing on specified terms including a specific\ninitial interest rate, schedule A should not include columns describing potential mortgage financing or the debt service thereon and the column\ndescribing the amount of monthly carrying charges deductible for income tax purposes should not include interest on mortgage financing. (ix)\n\nFor maximum mortgage, disclose any limitations on the availability of financing if sponsor is offering or\nprocuring mortgage financing but is not making financing available to all purchasers. The limitation must be indicated together with a reference to\nthe section of the plan that fully explains the method of allocation and credit standards and other criteria for eligibility. (h) Budget for first year of condominium operation (schedule B). The plan must describe all projected income and expenses for the first\nyear of condominium operation in schedule B. (1)\n\nThe budget shall be based upon a specified 12-month period\nto commence on the date when it can reasonably be projected that condominium operations will begin and no sooner than six months after the submission\nof the offering plan for filing. When calculating the projection, include sufficient time to arrange for the closings. If the actual or anticipated\ndate of commencement of condominium operation is to be delayed more than six months from the budget year projected in the offering plan, the plan\nmust be amended to include a revised budget disclosing current projections. If such amended projections exceed the original projections by 25 percent\nor more, the sponsor must offer all purchasers the right to rescind and a reasonable period of time that is not less than 15 days after the date of\npresentation to exercise the right, whether or not sponsor offers to guarantee the previous budget projection. Sponsor must return any deposit or\ndownpayment to purchasers who rescind within a reasonable period of time. Sponsor may not declare a plan effective where there are any material\nchanges to the budget if these changes have not been disclosed by a duly filed amendment to the offering plan. (2)\n\nIf the sponsor is reserving developmental rights and intends to add additional units which will be part of the\ncondominium, the budget must reflect expenses associated with the operation of the space to be newly constructed, including footnotes and supporting\ndocumentation required by this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe budget for the condominium must be in the following\nformat. Headings marked with an asterisk may be omitted if not applicable to the offering. Additional income, expenses or cost items unique to a\nbuilding or unit should be added whenever appropriate to reflect additional sources of income, expenses, costs or unique circumstances.

The footnotes must set forth the basis or assumptions for each projection. (i) Commercial income. Briefly describe any contracts or leases that will provide income to the condominium. State\nwhether the condominium is required to provide heat, water, electricity, gas or insurance and describe any other specific additional costs under the\ncontract or lease. State the name and business address of each contractor or lessee, the annual income, and the expiration date of the contract or\nlease. If applicable, state whether the sponsor may rent vacant non-residential space. State whether the rent to be collected could be less than the\nrent set forth in schedule B for the space. Sponsor must amend the plan if any new lease or extension of any existing lease is for a term in excess\nof two years. (ii)\n\nLabor costs. State the number of full and part time staff projected for the\ncondominium in schedule B and whether the staff will be union members. State whether such level of staffing complies with all applicable housing and\nlabor laws. The labor budget must include benefits required by local, state or Federal law or required by contract such as worker's compensation, disability insurance, welfare and pension contributions by employers, unemployment insurance and payroll taxes. Specify the wages and the cost of\neach applicable benefit. The budget must reflect current wage rates and payroll tax rates applicable for the budgeted year, and reasonably\nanticipated increases or increases now mandated by contract. If applicable, state the expiration dates of all union contracts. If there is non-union\nlabor in the building, discuss whether their wages meet state minimum wage laws. In the case of an occupied non-residential building, if the budget\nreflects a reduction in the existing staff, disclose what effect this will have on the existing level of services and whether such reduction is\nlawful. (iii)\n\nHeating, cooling and hot water costs. State the type and quantity of energy projected to be\nused during the year and the projected cost per gallon or other pricing unit inclusive of sales tax for all energy costs for providing heat, air\nconditioning and hot water for the building. State the basis for projecting the quantity of energy to be used. In the case of an occupied\nnon-residential building, unless it would be misleading for a particular building, base the projected quantity of energy on the average quantity of\nenergy purchased for the prior three years. State the quantity of energy purchased in each of the three prior years, the average cost per gallon or\nother pricing unit and the total cost per year. The Department of Law may, from time to time, issue pricing guidelines to reflect minimum fuel\ncosts. (iv)\n\nUtilities (electricity and gas). State the basis for the projected consumption and projected\nunit cost for utilities. Unit cost should be based on the current tariff plus a reasonably anticipated increase which should be set forth, e.g., estimate based on current tariffs plus 10 percent increase. State which services will be provided by or through the board of\nmanagers and which must be obtained directly by unit owners. In the case of an occupied non-residential building, unless it would be misleading for a\nparticular building, base the projected quantity of the utilities on the average quantity of the utilities purchased for the prior three\nyears. (v) Water charges and sewer rents. State the basis for the projection. If water and/or sewer\ncharges will be separately billed by local authorities or utility companies to individual unit owners, the estimated individual annual charges should\nbe stated in a separate column in schedule A or (if appropriate) in schedule B-1. In the case of an occupied non-residential building, if the water\ncharges or sewer rents are metered charges, state the consumption for the prior three years.

The name, address and telephone number of the escrow agent and of each attorney who is a signatory must be stated in\nthe plan. (iv)\n\nThe account(s).

(xi)\n\nReview and audit. The Department of Law may perform\nrandom reviews and audits of any records involving escrow accounts to determine compliance with statute and regulation. (xii)\n\nWaiver void.

The provisions of this section of the\nregulations shall prevail over any conflicting or inconsistent provision in the plan or in the escrow or purchase agreement. (xiii)\n\nTrust obligation of sponsor. Nothing contained herein shall diminish or impair the sponsor's statutory\nobligation to each purchaser pursuant to GBL section 352-h to hold in trust all deposits, advances or payments made in connection with the offer\nuntil consummation of the transaction with such purchaser. Consummation of the plan does not relieve sponsor of its obligations pursuant to GBL\nsection 352-h.

Such funds shall not be a part of the estate of the sponsor or the escrow agent upon any bankruptcy, incapacity or death. (xiv)\n\nTransition.

(5)\n\nDiscuss the condominium's available means and options to finance needed capital expenditures such as renewal or replacement of building components or\nsystems or to remedy major building defects.
