(a) Personal service. The wages of professional and staff personnel assigned to, authorized by, and paid by council. The services of personnel assigned from another county or municipal agency to undertake work for the council may be reimbursable if approved in advance by the commissioner. Such approval may be given for services actually performed for the council regardless of the percentage of time such personnel spend in work for such council or of the intermittent nature of such assignment.
