  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 50.1 - Marine Gastropods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n'Carnivorous marine\ngastropods' means marine snails; including channeled whelk (Busycotypus\ncanaliculatus), knobbed whelk (Busycon carica), and moon snails (Naticidae\nfamily), that prey on other animals. (2)\n'Whelk' means channeled whelk and knobbed\nwhelk. (3)\n'Bait saving device'\nmeans a container (such as bait bag or bait envelope) that is designed for the\npurposes of containing horseshoe crabs or horseshoe crab parts within a whelk\npot or trap, which extends the effective fishing time of the horseshoe crab\nbait in the whelk pot or trap. (4)\n'Designated navigation channel' means the Long Island Intracoastal Waterway and\nnatural or dredged paths through otherwise shoal waters that are used for\nentering or leaving ports and harbors, the boundaries of which are marked by\nmaintained aids to navigation. Designated navigation channel does not include\nthe main west/east shipping fairway through the center of Long Island\n\nSound. (5)\n'Land or landed' means\nthe bringing of whelk to shore or the transfer of the catch of whelk taken from\na vessel to any other vessel or inwater storage facility or to the land or to\nany pier, wharf, dock or other similar structure. When a vessel bearing whelk\nhas been tied, moored, or made fast to land, to another vessel, to an in-water\nstorage facility or to any pier, wharf, dock or similar structure, such whelk\nshall be deemed as landed. (6)\n'Long Island Sound Management Region': The 'Long Island Sound Management Region' includes all\nmarine and coastal district waters lying east of the Throgs Neck Bridge and\nwest of a line that runs from Orient Point, NY to Watch Hill, RI. (7)\n'Shell length' means\nthe longest measurement of a whelk shell from the spire apex to the edge of the\nsiphonal canal. (8)\n'Shell height'\nmeans the distance along a straight perpendicular line from a point on the\nopercular side of the shell to the farthest point of the top of the shell. This\ndistance is measured with the whelk retracted, and the shell placed with the\noperculum stably positioned against a flat surface. (9)\n'Whelk pot or trap' means any box-like\ndevice, made of any material, with an opening on its top side that is capable\nof catching whelk. (b) When the commissioner, or the commissioner's designee authorized to designate\nshellfish lands as uncertified, determines that carnivorous marine gastropods\nmay be hazardous for use as food for human consumption, due to the presence of\nmarine biotoxins, he shall take such action as he deems necessary to protect\nthe public health and welfare. The commissioner, or the commissioner's designee\nauthorized to designate shellfish lands as uncertified, may prohibit activities\nsuch as, but not limited to, the taking, possessing, processing, packing, transporting, offering or exposing for sale carnivorous gastropods from areas\nthat are designated as uncertified for the harvest of shellfish pursuant to\nsection\n47.4\nof this Title due to the\npresence of marine biotoxins in shellfish. The commissioner may advise the\ngeneral public, the industry and public health officials that carnivorous\ngastropods may be hazardous for use as food. (c) Gear requirements and restrictions. (1)\n\nWhelk pots or traps shall not exceed a\nvolume larger than 22,950 cubic inches. (2)\n\nWhelk shall not be taken by whelk pot, trap or similar device from one hour after sunset to one hour before\nsunrise. (3)\n\nGear used in taking\nwhelks must be identified as follows: (i) Whelk pots or traps which are marked on the surface of the water, must have\nattached to them a floating buoy or identification marker that is clearly\nvisible on the surface of the water. The floating buoy or identification marker\nmust not be made from containers, bottles, or jugs originally designed to\ncontain liquids. Buoy lines must be constructed so that the buoy line does not\nfloat at the surface, such as a sinking line or weighted line. (ii)\n\nEach buoy or marker attached to a whelk\npot or trap must be of a distinctive color visible in daylight from a minimum\ndistance of 100 feet. Each buoy or marker must be painted or otherwise affixed\nwith the assigned whelk permit holder's number, including any letter. The\npermit holder's number must be clearly visible and in a contrasting color or\nbranded in clearly visible characters. The same color or combination of colors\nmust be used on all buoys or markers bearing the same permit number. (iii)\n\nAll whelk pot or trap buoys must be\nmarked with fluorescent or reflective paint, tape, or reflectors, or other\nreflective material. (iv)\n\nAll whelk\npots or traps must be marked or branded, in clearly visible and legible\ncharacters not less than three-fourths inch in height, with the assigned whelk\npermit holder's number, including any letters. If the construction of a pot or\ntrap does not allow it to be marked by branding, that pot or trap must be\nmarked by a tag or other device bearing, in clearly visible and legible\ncharacters, the assigned whelk permit holder's number, including any letters, for the current year. The tag or other device must be of a material that is not\ndeteriorated by sea water and remain firmly attached to the pot or trap it\nidentifies. (4)\n\nExcept\nas provided for in subparagraphs 50.1(c)(4)(i) and 50.1(c)(4)(ii) of this\nparagraph, whelk pots or traps shall not be placed within 25 feet of designated\nnavigation channels, and all floating buoys or identification markers and lines\nattached to such pots shall remain outside designated navigation channels at\nall times, except that: (i) Whelk pots or\ntraps which are directly attached to the shoreline or a bulkhead may be placed\nwithin 25 feet of a designated navigation channel provided that neither the pot\nnor any attached lines or markers are within such channel; and\n(ii)\n\nWhelk pots or traps that are affixed to\na vessel with at least one person aboard may be placed within 25 feet of a\ndesignated navigation channel. (d) Whelk pots or traps using horseshoe crabs\nas bait must contain a bait saving device. All horseshoe crabs or horseshoe\ncrab parts used in whelk pots or traps must be wholly contained within the bait\nsaving device. (e) Size limits. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, no person shall take, possess, or land whelk less than 5 1/2\ninches in length or 2 1/4 inches in height. (2)\n\nLong Island Sound Management Region. If the State of Connecticut adopts a minimum size limit for\nwhelk, the following size limits shall apply for the Long Island Sound\n\nManagement Region: (i) Effective\n\nAugust 1, 2022, no person shall take, possess, or land whelk less than 4\n3\n/4 inches in length or 1 15/16 inches in\nheight. (ii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2024, no person shall take, possess, or land whelk less than 5 inches in length\nor 2 inches in height. (iii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2026, no person shall take, possess, or land whelk less\nthan 5 1/4 inches in length or 2 1/8 inches in height. (iv)\n\nEffective January 1, 2028, no person\nshall take, possess, or land whelk less than 5 1/2 inches in length or 2 1/4\ninches in height. If the State of Connecticut does not adopt a minimum size\nlimit for whelk, then effective August 1, 2022, no person shall take, possess, or land whelk less than 5 1/2 inches in length or 2 1/4 inches in\nheight. Pursuant to 50.2(a)(1), whelk permit holders must include\nthe area fished on their fishing vessel trip report. Pursuant to 50.2(b)(1), food fish and crustacea dealers and shippers license holders must include a\nfishing vessel trip ID number on their Purchases from Fishing Vessels Report or\n\nFishermen Report. The department will include information on its website\nindicating whether the State of Connecticut has adopted a minimum size limit\nfor whelk by August 1, 2022. (3)\n\nUndersized allowance. Notwithstanding the size limits set forth in this\nsubdivision, whelk measuring less than the minimum shell length or minimum\nshell height may comprise by number up to, and shall not exceed, three percent\nof any bushel, package, or any other container of whelk. (4)\n\nHeight gauge. When using a gauge to measure shell height, the whelk shall\nbe in a retracted position and the shell shall be placed with the operculum\nstably positioned against one (1) of the parallel surfaces. The whelk is\nlegalsized if it does not fit between the opposing parallel\nsurfaces. (f) All\nwhelks must be landed whole in the shell. (g) Violations of any provision of this Part\nshall subject the violator to the penalties fixed by the Environmental\n\nConservation Law and may result in the suspension or revocation of any whelk\npermit.
