  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 5004.4 - Repayment of loans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Loans may\nbe repaid by one of two methods. (1)\n\nDirect\ncoupon repayment--the member sends payment directly to the system. This method\nshall be used in the case of members who are not in service or are on an unpaid\nleave of absence or for whom the employer is unable to deduct the full amount\nof the loan payment from the member's compensation. (2)\n\nPayroll deduction repayment--the member's\nfull loan payment is automatically deducted from the member's compensation by\nthe employer. This method shall be used in the case of members who are in\nservice unless the employer is unable to deduct the full amount of the loan\npayment from the member's compensation. (b) The amount borrowed, together with\ninterest and insurance premiums on any unpaid balance thereof, shall be repaid\nin equal payments. (c) Payment shall\nbe made monthly on a 10-month basis, September to June of each regular school\nyear. Payments under the direct coupon repayment method shall be due on the\n15th day of each month. (d) Payments\nmay be in such amount as the member elects; however, payments shall be at an\nannual rate of at least two percent of the member's contract salary and\nsufficient to repay the amount borrowed, together with interest and insurance\npremiums on unpaid balances thereof, within a period not in excess of five\nyears. (e) Notwithstanding\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the loan repayment period for Tier I/II\nmembers may exceed five years if the member makes a written request for a\nlonger repayment period. Tier I/II members must also make payments in an amount\nsufficient to repay the amount borrowed, together with interest and insurance\npremiums on the unpaid balance thereof, within a period not in excess of 30\nyears. (f) In the event a member is\non leave of absence without pay or not in service and wishes to secure a loan, the last working year's contract salary shall be used to determine the amount\nof repayment. In the event the member was employed on other than a per annum\nbasis, the member's annualized contract salary as defined in section\n5001.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle shall be deemed to be the member's contract salary. (g) The system, at any time, may in its\ndiscretion accept additional payments on a loan from a member who is otherwise\ncurrent. Such payments will be considered pre-payments on the principal of the\nloan unless the member provides express instructions that the additional\npayments are to be applied to succeeding installments of the loan as they\nbecome due. (h) If the last payment\non a loan is $10 or more in excess of that required to fully repay the loan, the amount in excess shall be refunded to the member. (i) In the event that the member has failed\nto pay a loan payment in full when due, any payment thereafter received from\nthe member shall be applied first to the loan payment which has not been paid\nin full before being applies to any subsequent loan payments. If a payment is\ninsufficient to pay an outstanding installment in full, the payment shall be\napplied in the following order: first to the interest portion, then the\ninsurance portion, and finally the principal portion of the outstanding\ninstallment. In the event that more than one loan payment has not been paid in\nfull, any payment thereafter received from the member shall first be applied to\nthe earliest outstanding installment until it is paid in\nfull.
