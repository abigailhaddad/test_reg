  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2523.6 - Notices of appearance by attorney or other authorized representative\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever an\nattorney or other authorized representative appears for a party who is involved\nin a proceeding before the DHCR, such person must file a notice of appearance\nwhich shall be on a form prescribed by the DHCR, unless the application which\ninstituted the proceeding before the DHCR stated the representation of such\nperson and his or her mailing address in the space allotted for the mailing\naddress of the represented party. An attorney who appears for such party may\ninstead use the letterhead stationery of his or her office as a notice of\nappearance if the information contained therein substantially conforms to the\ninformation required by the form. All subsequent written communications or\nnotices to such party (other than subpoenas) shall be sent to such attorney or\nother authorized representative at the address designated in such notice of\nappearance. The service of written communications and notices upon such\nattorney or other authorized representative shall be deemed full and proper\nservice upon the party or parties so represented. If an authorized\nrepresentative appears, such notice of appearance must be accompanied by a\nwritten authorization, duly verified or affirmed, by the party\nrepresented. (b) Whenever an\nattorney or other authorized representative shall represent the same party or\nparties in more than one proceeding before the DHCR, separate notices of\nappearance and authorizations shall be filed in each proceeding. (c) Any submission signed by an attorney or\nother authorized representative must state that such person has personal\nknowledge of the facts contained in such submission, or if he or she does not\nhave such personal knowledge, the basis for such person's\ninformation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2523.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
