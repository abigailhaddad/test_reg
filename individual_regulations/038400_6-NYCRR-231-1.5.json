  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-1.5 - Emission offsets\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An applicant\nfor a permit to construct for an air contamination source project subject to\nthis Subpart must provide emission offsets as part of the application. Emission\noffsets are required for any air contaminant for which the area is designated\nas a nonattainment area if the net increase in annual actual emissions of that\ncontaminant exceeds the de minimis emission limits shown in section\n231-1.9\nof this Subpart. (b) Emission offsets must be of the same\ncontaminant. That is, only particulates can be used as offsets for new\nparticulate emissions, only sulfur dioxide can be used as offsets for new\nsulfur dioxide emissions, and so on. (c) Emission offsets must exceed the net\nincrease in annual actual emissions from the air contamination source\nproject. (d) Only emission\nreductions which occurred within five years prior to the date of submittal of a\ncomplete application may be used as emission offsets. (e) Emission offsets must be sufficient to\nprovide a net air quality benefit when offsets of particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide and/or nitrogen oxides are required. A net air quality benefit\nis achieved when the air quality impact of the applicable air contamination\nsource project does not exceed the significant impacts shown in section\n231-1.10\nof this Subpart. (f) Emission offsets must be real, permanent, and enforceable to the satisfaction of the commissioner. (g) If the applicable air contamination\nsource project is proposed in a nonattainment area for ozone, emission offsets\nof volatile organic compounds are required. These may be from any location\nwithin the same or a contiguous ozone nonattainment area in New York\n\nState. (h) Only reductions which\nlower actual emissions from an air contamination source beyond levels\nprescribed by applicable emission standards may be used as emission\noffsets. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
