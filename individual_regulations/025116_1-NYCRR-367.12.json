  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 367.12 - Rules of evidence\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnless otherwise provided by any statute the rules of\nevidence observed by courts need not be observed, but the rules of privilege\nrecognized by law shall be given effect. Objections to evidentiary offers may\nbe made and shall be noted in the record. Irrelevant or unduly repetitious\nevidence or cross-examination may be excluded. Subject to these requirements, for the purpose of expediting hearings and when the interests of parties will\nnot be substantially prejudiced thereby, the submission of all or part of the\nevidence in written form may be permitted, provided that nothing herein shall\nbe construed as requiring that such a submission be\npermitted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n367.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
