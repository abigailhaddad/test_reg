  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 419.1 - Determination of tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 288, 289-d\n(a) Except as otherwise provided for in this\nsection, if a distributor of motor fuel or any other person liable for tax, penalty and interest imposed by article 12-A of the Tax Law, files a return but\nsuch return is incorrect or insufficient, the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance may determine the amount of tax, penalty and interest due the State at\nany time within three years from the date such return was filed, whether or not\nthe return was filed on or after the due date. (b) A notice of determination is given by\nmailing it to the person for whom it is intended in a postpaid envelope\naddressed to such person at the address given in the application for\nregistration as a distributor of motor fuel or at the address reflected in the\nlast return filed by such person or in the event no application or return has\nbeen filed then at any address of such person as may be obtainable. The mailing\nof the notice is presumptive evidence of its receipt by the person to whom it\nis addressed. Any period of time which is measured from the giving of notice by\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance begins to run from the date of mailing\nof such notice. (c) A determination\nof the amount of tax, penalty and interest due the State may be made by the\ndepartment at any time if a distributor or any other person liable therefor: (1)\nhas not registered as a distributor of\nmotor fuel as required by article 12-A of the Tax Law; (2)\nfails to file a return; (3)\nfiles a willfully false or fraudulent\nreturn with an intent to evade the tax; or\n(4)\nfails to comply with section\n411.1\n(e) of this Title with respect to immediately informing the department, in writing, of any changes in its address, officers, directors or partners or their\nresident addresses as shown in its application for registration. (d) If a distributor has, in\naccordance with section\n411.1\n(e) of this Title, informed the department, in writing, of any changes in its\naddress, officers, directors or partners or their resident addresses as shown\nin the distributor's application for registration as a distributor of motor\nfuel, a determination of any tax, penalty and interest may be made by the\ndepartment at any time within three years after such information is received. The provisions of this subdivision are not intended to renew the authority to\ndetermine taxes in respect of any return beyond three years from the date such\nreturn was filed if such changes occurred subsequent to the expiration of such\nthree-year period nor to limit or restrict any period of time otherwise\nprescribed by this section. (e) If\nbefore the expiration of time for a determination of tax, penalty and interest\nprescribed in this section, the distributor or any other person liable therefor\nconsents in writing to a determination after such time, the tax, penalty and\ninterest may be determined at any time prior to the expiration of the period\nagreed upon. The period agreed to may be further extended by subsequent written\nagreement if made before the expiration of the period previously agreed\nupon. (f) Any determination made\npursuant to this section shall finally and irrevocably fix the tax, penalty and\ninterest due the State, unless the distributor, or other person against whom\nsuch amounts are assessed, within 90 days after the date of giving of the\nnotice of determination, petitions the Division of Tax Appeals for a hearing or\nunless the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance redetermines the same. (For\nhearing procedures, see Part 3000 of this Title.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n419.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
