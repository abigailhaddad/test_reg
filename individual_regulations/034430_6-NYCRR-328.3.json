(2)\n\nThe\npermit-issuing official shall not make recommendations on the method, use, general handling, efficiency of the chemicals and treatment operation or other\naspects involving responsibilities of the applicant, except as may be related\nto the public health and conservation programs and to avoid adverse effects on\nwater uses. (3)\n\nRegardless of\nconformity with other limitations, no permit shall be issued for chemical\ntreatment of water supply waters, or waters closely contiguous to and tributary\nto such waters, without the approval of the water supply agency.
