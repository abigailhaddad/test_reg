Tit. 2§ 5.2 - Purchase of railroad materials in the open market\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe procedure to be followed by the railroad companies in\npurchasing materials in the open market for use on State sponsored projects\ninvolving changes to railroad facilities is as follows: (a) (1)\n\nUpon\nthe acceptance of a project estimate by the State, the railroad shall determine\nthe extent of required material available in its stores. A stores charge of 15\nper cent may be added to the cost of this material after its incorporation in\nthe work. (2)\n\nSubstantial\nquantities of materials ordered under an annual contract for a specific project\nwill be paid for at the cost provided for in such contract, plus necessary\ncosts of transportation and inspection. This material shall be shipped direct\nto project and the 15 per cent overhead will not be allowed. (3)\n\nAll other materials required shall be\ngrouped in a manner which would permit the solicitation of bids for each class\nof materials. Open market orders will be required for each group of materials\nhaving an estimated cost of $2,000 or more. (4)\n\nOpen market orders shall be numbered\nconsecutively by projects. Each tabulation shall be tied in with the\nappropriate estimate item. (5)\n\nAll\ntabulations should show the following certification of the railroad company's\npurchasing agent or other responsible official: I hereby certify that the foregoing is a correct tabulation\nof all bids received on the material listed above. The quotations are based on\ndelivery of the material ____________. Recommend placing order with\n(Low bidder)\n\nValue $________\nTerms ________\nPurchasing Agent\n\nDated ________\n(b) (1)\n\nInvitations to submit bids must be issued to at least five manufacturers or\ndistributors of products or materials meeting the railroad company's general\nspecification. If less than five invitations are issued, the reason for the\nlimited canvass should be shown on the proposal form. In recognition of the\nfact that the railroad companies have adopted the products of certain\nmanufacturers as an inflexible standard for signal and related facilities, the\n\nState will in these instances, waive the requirement for competition, providing\nthat the proposed purchase is a reproduction of a product of the same producer, and accept a copy of railroad company's purchase order for such products. If\nthe proposal of other than the low bidder is recommended for acceptance, a\ndetailed explanation of the preference must be submitted by the Superintendent\nof Public Works. All tabulations must be accompanied by a copy of the proposal\nform, invitation and photostatic copy of each bid and/or declination. (2)\n\nPrices must be based on delivery at the\nnearest point of the railroad on which the project is located and tabulation\nshould show the estimated cost of transportation (for each bidder) at the rate\nof not to exceed 10 miles per ton mile from such point to the site of project, or the published tariff rate for that commodity. Specifically, the total for\neach bid should be adjusted to show total net cost of materials F.O.B. job. (3)\n\nDelivery dates should be\nso arranged that materials will not pass through railroad stores, as the 15 per\ncent overhead will not be allowed on direct purchases. (4)\n\nMaterials purchased for specific State\nprojects shall be consigned to the State of New York, Department of Public\n\nWorks--in care of the railroad for the reason that the State will not accept\nbilling for transportation taxes on such purchases. In issuing invitations to\nbid on these materials the railroad companies should not be influenced by the\nfact that a manufacturer is located on their own or affiliated lines. Invitations must be issued to any reputable producer or distributor of products\nmeeting the railroad company's general specifications. (c) In order to secure prompt consideration\nof the open market orders, the following procedure should be carefully\nfollowed: (1)\n\nThe railroad company shall\nsubmit to the State seven photostatic copies of each bid or declination, proposal form, invitation and certified tabulation. (2)\n\nDistribution should be as follows: Two copies to Deputy Chief Engineer, State Department of\n\nPublic Works, Albany, N. Y. One copy to Public Service Commission, Albany, N. Y. (if\nproject is under jurisdiction of that commission). Remaining copies to Department of Audit and Control, Albany, N. Y. (d) The\n\nDepartment of Public Works and/or the Public Service Commission shall review\nthe material so transmitted and forward same to the Department of Audit and\n\nControl with appropriate recommendations or comments. (e) Upon approval of the Department of Audit\nand Control, the copies shall be distributed as follows: One copy to each railroad company. One copy to Deputy Chief Engineer, Department of Public\n\nWorks, Albany, N. Y. One copy to Public Service Commission, Albany, N. Y. (if\nP.S.C. project). One copy to Director, Bureau of Contracts, Department of\n\nPublic Works, Albany, N. Y. One copy retained for files of the Department of Audit and\n\nControl. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
