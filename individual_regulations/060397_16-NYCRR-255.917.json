  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.917 - Identification of potential threats to pipeline\n\nState Regulations\n\nIntegrity and use of the threat identification in an\nintegrity program. (a) Threat\nidentification. An operator must identify and evaluate all potential threats to\neach covered pipeline segment. Potential threats that an operator must consider\ninclude, but are not limited to, the threats listed in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 2\nwhich are grouped under the following four categories: (1)\ntime dependent threats such as internal\ncorrosion, external corrosion, and stress corrosion cracking; (2)\nstatic or resident threats, such as\nfabrication or construction defects; (3)\ntime independent threats such as third\nparty damage and outside force damage; and\n(4)\nhuman error. (b) Data gathering and integration. To\nidentify and evaluate the potential threats to a covered pipeline segment, an\noperator must gather and integrate existing data and information on the entire\npipeline that could be relevant to the covered segment. In performing this data\ngathering and integration, an operator must follow the requirements in\nASME/ANSI B31.8S, section 4. At a minimum, an operator must gather and evaluate\nthe set of data specified in Appendix A to ASME/ANSI B31.8S, and consider both\non the covered segment and similar non-covered segments, past incident history, corrosion control records, continuing surveillance records, patrolling records, maintenance history, internal inspection records and all other conditions\nspecific to each pipeline. (c) Risk\nassessment. An operator must conduct a risk assessment that follows ASME/ANSI\nB31.8S, section 5, and considers the identified threats for each covered\nsegment. An operator must use the risk assessment to prioritize the covered\nsegments for the baseline and continual reassessments (sections\n255.919, 255.921, 255.937\nof this Part), and to\ndetermine what additional preventive and mitigative measures are needed\n(section\n255.935\nof this Part) for the\ncovered segment. (d) Plastic\ntransmission pipeline. An operator of a plastic transmission pipeline must\nassess the threats to each covered segment using the information in sections 4\nand 5 of ASME B31.8S, and consider any threats unique to the integrity of\nplastic pipe. (e) Actions to\naddress particular threats. If an operator identifies any of the following\nthreats, the operator must take the following actions to address the threat. (1)\n\nThird party damage. An operator must\nutilize the data integration required in subdivision (b) of this section and\nASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A7 to determine the susceptibility of each covered\nsegment to the threat of third party damage. If an operator identifies the\nthreat of third party damage, the operator must implement comprehensive\nadditional preventive measures in accordance with section\n255.935\nof this Part and monitor\nthe effectiveness of the preventive measures. If, in conducting a baseline\nassessment under section\n255.921\nof this Part, or a\nreassessment under section\n255.937\nof this Part, an operator\nuses an internal inspection tool or external corrosion direct assessment, the\noperator must integrate data from these assessments with data related to any\nencroachment or foreign line crossing on the covered segment, to define where\npotential indications of third party damage may exist in the covered segment. An operator must also have procedures in its integrity management program\naddressing actions it will take to respond to findings from this data\nintegration. (2)\n\nCyclic fatigue. An\noperator must evaluate whether cyclic fatigue or other loading condition\n(including ground movement, suspension bridge condition) could lead to a\nfailure of a deformation, including a dent or gouge, or other defect in the\ncovered segment. An evaluation must assume the presence of threats in the\ncovered segment that could be exacerbated by cyclic fatigue. An operator must\nuse the results from the evaluation together with the criteria used to evaluate\nthe significance of this threat to the covered segment to prioritize the\nintegrity baseline assessment or reassessment. (3)\n\nManufacturing and construction defects. If an operator identifies the threat of manufacturing and construction defects\n(including seam defects) in the covered segment, an operator must analyze the\ncovered segment to determine the risk of failure from these defects. The\nanalysis must consider the results of prior assessments on the covered segment. An operator may consider manufacturing and construction related defects to be\nstable defects if the operating pressure on the covered segment has not\nincreased over the maximum operating pressure experienced during the five years\npreceding identification of the high consequence area. If any of the following\nchanges occur in the covered segment, an operator must prioritize the covered\nsegment as a high risk segment for the baseline assessment or a subsequent\nreassessment. (i) operating pressure\nincreases above the maximum operating pressure experienced during the preceding\nfive years; (ii)\nMAOP increases; or\n(iii)\nthe stresses leading to\ncyclic fatigue increase. (4)\nERW pipe. If a covered pipeline segment\ncontains low frequency electric resistance welded pipe (ERW), lap welded pipe\nor other pipe that satisfies the conditions specified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, appendices A4.3 and A4.4, and any covered or noncovered segment in the pipeline\nsystem with such pipe has experienced seam failure, or operating pressure on\nthe covered segment has increased over the maximum operating pressure\nexperienced during the preceding five years, an operator must select an\nassessment technology or technologies with a proven application capable of\nassessing seam integrity and seam corrosion anomalies. The operator must\nprioritize the covered segment as a high risk segment for the baseline\nassessment or a subsequent reassessment. (5)\n\nCorrosion. If an operator identifies\ncorrosion on a covered pipeline segment that could adversely affect the\nintegrity of the line (conditions specified in section\n255.931\nof this Part), the\noperator must evaluate and remediate, as necessary, all pipeline segments (both\ncovered and non-covered) with similar material coating and environmental\ncharacteristics. An operator must establish a schedule for evaluating and\nremediating, as necessary, the similar segments that is consistent with the\noperator's operating and maintenance procedures established under 49 CFR part\n192\nfor testing and repair.
