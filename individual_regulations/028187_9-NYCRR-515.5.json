  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.5 - The commander's legal options\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Introduction. Regardless of how a commander learns of an alleged offense, the\nmatter must be promptly and adequately investigated. See chapter 2, FM 27- 1, Legal Guide for Commanders. However, during the course of the investigation, insure that a suspect's rights are not violated (see section\n515.6\nof this Part). (b) Once a commander\nhas determined that an offense has been committed, he must take one of the\nfollowing courses of action: (1)\n\nIf the\noffense is minor, he may impose non-judicial punishment. (See Part 519 of this\n\nTitle). (2)\n\nIf the offense is more\nserious, the commander may refer same to a commander empowered to convene a\nsummary court-martial (see section\n515.2\n(f)(1)\nof this Part). The commander empowered to convene a summary court-martial may\nappoint a summary court-martial officer. A request should first be made to a\ncommand with judge advocate personnel to have such command either detail on\norders a judge advocate officer to act as a summary court-martial, or, to\nsimply give approval to the subordinate command to detail a particular judge\nadvocate as SCM. Using the latter procedure, the approval of the higher command\nwould be noted in the instruction portion of Part V of the Charge Sheet. By so\ndoing, a separate order detailing the SCM would not be necessary. If a judge\nadvocate is not reasonably available for such detail, the command from which\nthe judge advocate is requested shall immediately so notify the subordinate\ncommand and instead detail a disinterested field grade officer to serve as a\nsummary court-martial. (3)\n\nIn any\nevent, the commander shall prepare or cause to be prepared the Charge Sheet\nDMNA form 1050 (see Appendix L-2 [A1] and chapter 4, FM 27-1, Legal Guide for\n\nCommanders). (4)\n\nIf the charges are\nmore serious, the command may refer such charges to a special court-martial\nconvening authority. However, due to the nature of the offenses contained in\nthe State Code of Military Justice (Part 518 of this Title) convening a special\nor general court-martial will rarely be appropriate. (5)\n\nIf the offense is a violation of State\n\nPenal Law, local police should be sought to enforce the violation of State\n\nPenal Law. (6)\nNOTE: The commander\nmay also utilize a board of officers for the administrative elimination of\ntroublesome personnel. (Army National Guard see AR 135-178 and Air National\n\nGuard see ANGR 39-10.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
