  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-4.1 - Computation of the receipts factor\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe percentage of a surcharge taxpayer's receipts within\nthe MCTD is determined pursuant to the apportionment rules described in section\n210-A and this Subchapter, with the following exceptions: (a) The numerator of the apportionment\nfraction under section 210-A is the denominator for purposes of the MCTD\nreceipts factor. (b) The numerator\nof the MCTD receipts factor is determined by applying the rules of section\n210-A as if those rules made reference to the MCTD rather than to New York\n\nState. (c) In the case of a\ncombined report, the combined group's receipts factor of the MCTD apportionment\npercentage will be determined after the elimination of intercorporate and\ninter-entity receipts. (d) Adjustment must be made for qualified financial instruments (QFIs), as defined\nin section 210-A and this Subchapter, and other statutorily imposed\napportionment percentages for purposes of the MCTD receipts factor, as follows: (1)\n\nIf a surcharge taxpayer elects to use the\nfixed percentage method to apportion receipts from QFIs to the State pursuant\nto section 210-A(5)(a)(1) and section\n4-2.4\n(c) or\nsection\n9-4.3\nof this Subchapter, the\nfixed percentage method applies in computing the receipts factor under this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nIf 8% of the receipts\nspecified in a provision of section 210-A(5) are required by such provision and\nthis Subchapter to be included in the numerator of the apportionment fraction\nunder section 210-A(5), then 90% of the 8% will be considered to be within the\nMCTD, and 100% of the 8% will be considered to be within New York State. This\nrule also is applicable in determining the amount of any other receipts\nreceived by a credit card processor that are deemed to have been generated\nwithin the MCTD. (e) If\nthe receipts specified in a provision of section 210-A are not includable in\nthe numerator of the apportionment fraction, then such receipts will not be\nincluded in determining the MCTD apportionment percentage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8-4.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
