  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 111.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Designated\nstands or trees means stands or trees which have been inspected and approved\nfor the collection of seed or vegetative propagation material in accordance\nwith the standards and procedures outlined in the \"standards\". (b) Field shall be interpreted to include\n\"stand\", \"orchard\" and \"trees\" from which tree seed may be collected. Note: All forest tree improvement terms are defined in\naccordance with \"Glossary for Forest Tree Improvement Workers\" E.B. Snyder, Editor, published 1959 by Southern Forest Experiment Station. U.S.F.S. (c) Clone. A group of plants\nderived from a single individual (ortet) by a sexual reproduction. All members\n(ramets) of a clone have the same genotype and consequently tend to be\nuniform. (d) Elite tree. The\nquality of the tree so designated has been verified by appropriate testing, as\nsuperior or desirable under a specified propagation system. The superiority of\ncrossbred parents is evaluated by means of the progeny test. That of inbreds is\nevaluated by observing the inbred lines; that of clones by clonal\ntests. (e) Genotype. (1)\n\nAn individual's hereditary constitution, expressed or hidden, underlying one or more characters; the gene classification\nof this constitution expressed in a formula. The genotype is determined chiefly\nfrom breeding behavior and ancestry. It reacts with the environment to produce\nthe phenotype. (2)\n\nIndividual(s)\ncharacterized by a certain genic constitution. (f) Ortet. The one plant from which members\nof a clone were originally derived. (g) Phenotype. The demonstrable\ncharacteristic(s) of an organism; the product of the interaction of the genes\nof an organism with the environment. (h) Progeny test. Evaluation of individuals\nby the performance of their offspring. (i) Propagule. A plant part such as a bud, tuber, root, or shoot, used to reproduce an individual asexually. (j) Seed orchard. A plantation consisting of\nclones or seedlings from selected trees, isolated to prevent pollination from\noutside sources, and cultured for early and abundant production of seed for\nreforestation. Forest seed orchards are often established while genetic\nevaluation of the material is under way. When results of these tests are known, the undesirable individuals are rogued. (k) Vegetative propagation. Propagation of a\nplant by asexual parts, as in budding, dividing, grafting, rooting, and air\nlayering. Hereditary factors or genes of the resulting clone (ramets) are\nidentical with those of the original plant (ortet). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n111.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
