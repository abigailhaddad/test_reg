For\npurposes of water management pursuant to section\n3.3\nand article 10 of the compact, the determination of drought warning and drought conditions shall be based upon\nthe combined storage in the Cannonsville, Pepacton and Neversink Reservoirs, in\naccordance with Figure 1, entitled \"Operation Curves for Cannonsville, Pepacton\nand Neversink Reservoirs\". The division of the drought-warming zone into upper\nand lower halves shall be defined as a physically equal division, or 20\nbillions of gallons in each zone. (b) Drought emergency declaration.
