Tit. 9 § 3.11 - Executive order no. 11: directing the creation of the public health education unit\n\nState Regulations\n\nPreventive medicine is the key to the future success of our\nhealth care delivery system. By taking steps to reduce the incidence of illness\nand disease, we are also reducing the need for hospitalization or prolonged\nmedical treatment. This can only be accomplished through a coordinated program\nof public health information and education directed at both medical\nprofessionals and the general public. Today, therefore, I am directing the Commissioner of Health\nto establish a new unit within his department, the function of this new unit to\nbe the broadening of public understanding of health problems, the expansion of\npublic knowledge of solutions to those problems and the widening of public\nparticipation in and support of public health programs and services. In order to facilitate and improve access to health\nresources, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of New York, by virtue of\nthe authority vested in me by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of New\n\nYork, do hereby direct the Commissioner of Health to establish a new unit\nwithin the Department of Health, to be the Public Health Education Unit. I. Public Health Education Unit. It shall be the function of the Public Health Education\n\nUnit to: examine the role of State, local and voluntary agencies in\nhealth education; widely disseminate information on health problems, issues\nand solutions; identify and advocate consumer health concerns for the\n\nDepartment; and encourage the development of education services in medical care\nsettings, industrial settings and all settings in which the greatest number of\npersons can be reached. In particular, the Department of Health, through this new\nunit, shall direct educational efforts to reaching the economically\ndisadvantaged who most often are outside the mainstream of education and\ncommunication routinely provided by local health departments. II. The Interagency Council on Critical\n\nHealth Problems. The Interagency Council on Critical Health Problems is\nhereby transferred from the Department of Education to the Department of\n\nHealth, in order to coordinate its activities with the Public Health Education\n\nUnit established by this Order. With respect to any right, obligation or remedy\nheretofore existing as to the Interagency on Critical Health Problems, the\n\nInteragency Council on Critical Health Problems in the Health Department shall\nbe deemed and held to constitute the continuation of the Interagency Council on\n\nCritical Health Problems in the Department of Education. All appropriations or reappropriations together with any\n\nFederal funds advanced to the Department of Education for the Interagency\n\nCouncil on Critical Health Problems, to the extent of remaining unexpended or\nunencumbered balances thereof, whether allocated or unallocated and whether\nobligated or unobligated, shall be transferred to and made available for use by\nthe Department of Health for the same purposes for which originally\nappropriated or advanced.
