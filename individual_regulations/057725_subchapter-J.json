These\n\nParts were previously Parts 300, 301 and 310. The rule making which renumbered\nthese Parts did not make substantive changes and did not seek to incorporate\nintervening changes in the law. The regulations should be read in conjunction\nwith current law. State Tax Commission Ruling\n\nMachines and equipment for use in the conduct of pari-mutuel\nbetting. (a) Sections 6 and 42 of the Pari-Mutuel Revenue Law (L. 1940, ch. 254, as amd.) requires that all machines and equipment for use in the\nconduct of pari-mutuel betting at race tracks in the State of New York be\napproved by the State Tax Commission, and by the State Racing Commission or the\n\nState Harness Racing Commission as the case may be, before they may be\nused. (b) Such approval will be given by the State Tax Commission\nonly upon the application of a corporation or association duly authorized to\nconduct pari-mutuel betting. (c) However, a manufacturer of machines or equipment, including electronic systems, designed for use in pari-mutuel betting, upon\napplication to the State Tax Commission, may arrange for a demonstration\nthereof subject to such tests and inspections as the commission may require. The cost of any such demonstration, testing and inspection must be borne by the\nmanufacturer. If the equipment operates in a satisfactory manner, complies with\nthe requirements of the statute, and is judged adequate to protect State\nrevenues from the conduct of pari-mutuel betting, the commission will so advise\nthe manufacturer.
