This showing may be made by submission\nof the following by the applicant: (1)\nan SPCC\nplan; or\n(2)\na Coast Guard plan; or\n(3)\nsuch other information\nsufficient to show that the applicant has implemented or is in the process of\nimplementing a plan which will effectively provide for the control, containment\nand removal of petroleum discharges. (b) Where an applicant for the renewal of a\nlicense has not demonstrated full implementation of the SPCC plan or Coast\n\nGuard plan, or the plan described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, such applicant must show that substantial progress toward full\nimplementation has been made since the license was issued or last renewed, whichever shall have occurred later. (c) The applicant must demonstrate to the\ndepartment that it can provide the necessary equipment to prevent, contain and\nremove discharges of petroleum. This requirement can be satisfied by showing\nany of the following: (1)\na fully implemented\nSPCC plan; or\n(2)\na fully\nimplemented Coast Guard plan; or\n(3)\na fully implemented plan as is described\nin paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this section; or\n(4)\ninformation sufficient for the department\nto determine that such equipment as is necessary for the prevention of oil\nspills is in use by applicant and that such equipment as is necessary for the\ncontainment and removal of oil spills is available to the applicant on short\nnotice. (d) No license\nshall be issued or renewed by the department for an onshore major facility\nunless the applicant furnishes to the department a certification by the\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation that the applicant meets the standards\ncontained in subdivisions 3 and 8 of section\n174\nof the\n\nNavigation Law. Such certification need not be submitted with the application\nfor a license, but is a precondition to the issuance or renewal of a\nlicense. (e) The department may\nissue guidelines for its review of State and Federal plans for the control of\npetroleum discharges and the containment and removal thereof when a discharge\noccurs. Where article 12 of the Navigation Law imposes additional or other\nmandates beyond those required for compliance with 33 Code of Federal\n\nRegulations Part 154.300 or 40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 112 (i.e., groundwater protection), such guidelines may set additional plan requirements\nin these regards. When such guidelines are issued, each applicant for issuance\nor renewal of a license must show that its Coast Guard plan or SPCC plan, or\nplan as is described in paragraph (3) of subdivision (a) of this section, as\nthe case may be, complies with such guidelines or that the applicant is in the\nprocess of amending such plan so as to bring it into compliance.
