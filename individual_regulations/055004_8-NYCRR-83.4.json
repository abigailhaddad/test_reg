Upon receipt of a request for a\nhearing, a hearing officer shall be appointed by the commissioner to hear and\nrecommend, and a hearing scheduled. In the order designating a hearing officer, the commissioner shall also designate the place where said hearing will be\nheld.

Except as otherwise provided in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, in the case of a certified individual, proof\nof conviction for any of the following acts constituting a crime in New York\n\nState and committed subsequent to certification shall create a rebuttable\npresumption that the individual so convicted lacks good moral character: (1)\nthe criminal sale, possession or use of\nmarijuana, a controlled substance, a precursor of a controlled substance or\ndrug paraphernalia as defined in article 220 or 221 of the Penal Law; or\n(2)\nany crime involving physical\nor sexual abuse of a minor or student; or\n(3)\nany crime committed either on school\nproperty or while in the performance of teaching duties. (4)\nany crime committed involving the\nsubmission of false information, or the commission of fraud, related to a\ncriminal history record check.
