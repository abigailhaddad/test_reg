Tit. 20 §§ 3-7.6 - Rules for combined reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\ncomputing the New York net capital loss of corporations included in a combined\nreport pursuant to section 210-C, the New York net capital loss of the combined\ngroup is computed in accordance with this Subpart, substituting \"combined\ngroup\" for \"corporation\". (b) A\nmember leaving a combined group must compute its own share of New York net\nbusiness capital loss carryover and New York net investment capital loss\ncarryover. New York net capital loss carryover is net capital loss that may be\ncarried back or forward as the case may be. (1)\n\nTo compute the leaving member's share of\nthe New York net business capital loss carryover, multiply the combined group's\n\nNew York net business capital loss carryover for the taxable year by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the total New York business capital losses\nfor that taxable year of the leaving member and the denominator of which is the\ntotal New York business capital losses for that taxable year of all members of\nthe combined group having such New York business capital losses to the extent\nsuch capital losses are included in the capital loss carryover amount of the\ncombined group in accordance with this section. (2)\n\nTo compute the leaving member's share of\n\nNew York net investment capital loss carryover, multiply the combined group's\n\nNew York net investment capital loss carryover for the taxable year by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the total New York investment capital\nlosses for that taxable year of the leaving member and the denominator of which\nis the total New York investment capital losses for that taxable year of all\nmembers of the combined group having such New York investment capital losses to\nthe extent such capital losses are included in the capital loss carryover\namount of the combined group in accordance with this section. (c) If a corporation is a member\nof a combined group for any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, and leaves that group in a later taxable year, the leaving member takes its\nshare of the combined group's New York net business capital loss carryover and\n\nNew York net investment capital loss carryover. The remaining combined group\nmust reduce its New York net business capital loss carryover and New York net\ninvestment loss carryover by the leaving member's share of such loss\ncarryovers. If the leaving corporation joins another combined group, its New\n\nYork net business capital loss carryover is added to, or becomes, the new\ncombined group's New York net business capital loss carryover and its New York\nnet investment capital loss carryover is added to, or becomes, the new combined\ngroup's New York net investment capital loss carryover, subject to the rules in\nthis Subpart. If the leaving corporation files a separate New York return, it\nis allowed to use its New York net business capital loss carryover or New York\nnet investment capital loss carryover on a separate basis, subject to the rules\nin this Subpart. (d) If a\ncorporation that was subject to tax under article 9-A and was not a member of a\ncombined group in any taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 2015, subsequently joins a combined group, that incoming member's New York net\nbusiness capital loss carryover is added to, or becomes, the combined group's\n\nNew York net business capital loss carryover and its New York net investment\ncapital loss carryover is added to, or becomes, the combined group's New York\nnet investment capital loss carryover, subject to the rules in this\n\nSubpart.
