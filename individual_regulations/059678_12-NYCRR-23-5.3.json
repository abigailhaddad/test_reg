This section\napplies to all scaffolds constructed of metal except mobile types. (b) Special approval required. Any metal\nscaffold erected after June 1, 1972 to a height exceeding 125 feet above the\nground, grade or equivalent surface shall not be placed in service until such\nscaffold has been granted a special approval. The plans and specifications for\nany such scaffold shall be submitted to the board for such approval. (c) Strength and factor of safety. The total\nof live and dead loads imposed on any scaffold assembly shall not exceed\none-quarter of the ultimate strength of the members as determined by actual\ntest. (d) Minimum uniform live\nloads. (1)\n\nMetal scaffolds shall be designed\nand constructed to support safely all loads intended to be imposed thereon, but\nin no case shall such scaffolds be designed or constructed to support uniform\nlive loads of less than the following: (i) Light duty scaffolds--25 pounds per square foot. (ii)\n\nMedium duty scaffolds--50 pounds per\nsquare foot. (iii)\n\nHeavy duty\nscaffolds--75 pounds per square foot. (2)\n\nMetal scaffolds designed and constructed\nfor particular types of work shall support uniformly distributed live loads in\naccordance with the following: (i) Stone\nmasons--75 pounds per square foot. (ii)\n\nStone setters (no stone on scaffold)--25\npounds per square foot. (iii)\n\nBricklayers--50 pounds per square foot. (iv)\n\nStucco applicators--50 pounds per square\nfoot. (v) Lathers and\nplasterers--50 pounds per square foot. (vi)\n\nCarpenters--25 pounds per square\nfoot. (vii)\n\nMiscellaneous (no\nmaterial on scaffold)--25 pounds per square foot. (3)\n\nIn addition to such live loads, metal\nscaffolds shall be designed and constructed to support the dead loads, such as\nplatforms, frames, safety railings and other members. (e) Safety railings. Safety railings\nconstructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule) shall be provided\nfor every metal scaffold. (f) Access. Ladders, stairs or ramps shall be provided for access to and egress\nfrom the platform levels of metal scaffolds which are located more than two\nfeet above or below the ground, grade, floor or other equivalent\nlevel. (g) Footings. (1)\n\nFootings for metal scaffolds shall be\nsound, rigid and capable of supporting the maximum design loads of such\nscaffolds without settlement or deformation. Such footings shall be secure\nagainst movement in any direction and shall have sufficient area to properly\ntransfer the vertical post or end frame loads of the scaffolds to the ground, grade or equivalent surface without causing any unsafe condition. (2)\n\nMetal base plates of not less than 16\nsquare inches in area by one-eighth inch in thickness shall be provided for the\ntubular ends of posts and for the legs of end frames which are in bearing\ncontact with the footings or other supporting surfaces. (3)\n\nWhere the ground, grade or other\nsupporting surface of a metal scaffold is not level, screw jacks or adjustment\njacks shall be used to support the tubular posts or end frames of the scaffold\nso that the scaffold platform bearers are level. Such adjustment jacks shall be\nso positioned that the threaded sections do not extend beyond the frames or\nparts more than 12 inches. (h) Tie-ins. (1)\n\nEvery metal scaffold shall be securely\ntied into the building or other structure at intervals not to exceed 30 feet\nhorizontally and 26 feet vertically. (2)\n\nTies to any window cleaners' anchors are\nprohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
