  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 890.70 - Subscribers' complaints; procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A subscriber complaint will be processed\nby the commission after the subscriber has first attempted to resolve the\nparticular matter with the cable television company. The procedure with respect\nto such complaints shall be as follows: (1)\nA\ncopy of the complaint together with a written notice requesting a statement\nconcerning the matter described therein shall be served on the cable television\ncompany. Within 10 days, or such other period as may be specified in the\nnotice, the cable television company shall submit a written response to the\ncommission and shall serve a copy of said response on the complainant. The\nresponse must contain a statement of the action that has been taken to resolve\nthe complaint and/or to preclude any recurrence of the matter complained of. If\nthe subject of the complaint is the failure of the company to provide cable\ntelevision service to a potential subscriber who has requested service, the\ncommission may require the cable television company to provide, in addition to\nthe information required by this paragraph, a map of the franchised area\nindicating information requested by the commission. (2)\n\nComplaints received by the commission by\ntelephone shall be recorded and kept on file. Where the nature of a telephone\ncomplaint warrants, the commission may request written information from the\ncomplainant. In such cases, the commission shall follow the procedure specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nWhere numerous complaints are made, concerning a particular cable television company or where it appears that\ncomplaints have not been satisfactorily resolved by a particular company, the\ncommission may make further inquiry of said company, which may be formal or\ninformal, and which may include a hearing or oral argument, or both. (b) Every cable television company\nshall adopt and file with the commission, in writing, its procedures for\nreporting and the resolution of subscriber complaints which procedures may be\nin such form and contain such provisions as the company deems necessary, provided they are not in conflict with any procedures, rules or regulations of\nthe commission. Every cable television company shall provide notice to\nsubscribers of such procedures in accordance with section\n890.80\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (c) (1)\n\nThe commission may delegate by written\nnotice to any of its officers or employees authority pursuant to this section\nto investigate, hear and resolve subscriber complaints concerning disputed\nbills, charges, deposits, service problems and other subscriber-related\nproblems. Such authority shall include the authority to conduct informal\nhearings. Except in the instance of an appeal by any party, disposition of\nunresolved complaints will be determined by such officers or employees of the\ncommission as the commission designates to act in its place. In exercising this\nfunction, the designated officers or employees may obtain the information\nrequired to make a determination by conversation with the complainant or his or\nher representative, by telephone or in person, supplemented where appropriate\nby written materials from the complainant, reports or documents from the cable\ntelevision company (including such data as may be required by the staff at the\nrequest of the complainant or on its own initiative); through written\ncomplaints similarly supplemented; or through a conference conducted by the\ndesignated officer or employee at which the complainant, accompanied and\nassisted by such friend, advisor or attorney as he or she desires, and company\nrepresentatives are present. Officers or employees designated to consider\ncomplaints will afford both the complainant and the cable television company a\nfair and reasonable opportunity to present evidence pertinent to the complaint\nand to challenge evidence submitted by the other party to the dispute. The\ncomplainant or cable television company complained of may obtain a\ndetermination, including a statement of the reason for the conclusion. The\nparty adversely affected by the determination of the officer or employee\ndesignated to consider the complaint may appeal to the commission. Any such\nappeal shall be in writing filed with the commission within 20 days of\nreceiving notice of the determination and shall set forth the specific basis\nfor claiming error. (2)\n\nAfter\nreceipt of the response to a complaint, and where the procedures described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision are not applicable or cannot reasonably\nresolve the issues raised by a complaint, the commission, on its own\ninitiative, the recommendation of staff or the request of the complainant or\ncable television company, may hold a hearing upon reasonable advance notice to\nall interested parties. (3)\n\nPending\nresolution of a complaint, the commission may require appropriate interim\nrelief to either party. In the case of complaints regarding bills or deposits, the commission, without hearing or formal order, may, and in the absence of\nunusual circumstances shall, preclude discontinuance of service or the issuance\nof any notice of discontinuance during the commission's investigation of such\ncomplaint, upon such terms and conditions as it deems appropriate.
