  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.7 - Leases and subleases\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1401(d), (e), (f)\n(a) Creation of a taxable lease or sublease\nnot coupled with an option to purchase. The creation of a lease or sublease is\na conveyance subject to tax only where: (1)\nthe sum of the term of the lease or sublease and any options for renewal\nexceeds 49 years; and\n(2)\nsubstantial capital improvements are or may be made by or for the benefit of\nthe lessee or sublessee; and\n(3)\nthe lease or sublease is for substantially all of the premises constituting the\nreal property. Substantially all\nmeans ninety percent or more\nof the total rentable space of the premises, exclusive of common areas. For the\npurpose of determining whether a lease or sublease is for substantially all of\nthe premises constituting the real property, premises shall include, but not be\nlimited to the following: (i) an individual\nbuilding, except for space which constitutes an individual condominium or\ncooperative unit; (ii)\nan\nindividual condominium or cooperative unit; or\n(iii)\nwhere a lease or sublease is of vacant\nland only, any portion of such vacant land. (b) Consideration in the case of the\ncreation of a taxable lease or sublease. (1)\n\nIn the case of the creation of a lease\nwhich constitutes a conveyance subject to tax, the consideration used to\ncompute the tax is the present value of the right to receive rental payments or\nother payments attributable to the use and occupancy of the real property. Such\nconsideration also includes the present value of rental or other payments\nattributable to any renewal term. In the case of the creation of a taxable\nsublease, the consideration is computed in the same manner as in the creation\nof a taxable lease except that the value of the remaining prime lease rental\npayments must be subtracted. (2)\nA\ndiscount rate equal to 110 percent of the federal long-term rate compounded\nsemiannually, which is determined pursuant to section 1274(d) of the United\n\nStates Internal Revenue Code, is required to be used in determining the present\nvalue of such payments which constitute consideration in the case of the\ncreation of a taxable lease or sublease. Such federal long-term rate in effect\n30 days prior to the date of transfer shall be used when computing such\ndiscount rate. If the taxpayer establishes: (i) that a discount rate which is greater\nthan 110 percent of the federal long-term rate is appropriate in his or her\nparticular circumstances; and\n(ii)\nthat using a discount rate equal to 110 percent of the federal long-term rate\nresults in the computation of consideration which exceeds the fair market value\nof the real property subject to the lease or sublease, the department will\nallow the use of a discount rate that results in a computation of consideration\nthat is equal to the fair market value of such real property. The discount rate\nis applied to net rents. Net rents\nmeans the amount by which\ngross rents exceed the lessor's or sublessor's operating costs. Such operating\ncosts include amounts paid for heat and gas, electricity, furnishings, insurance, maintenance, management and real estate taxes. (3)\n\nWhen net rents are tied to unknown\nfactors, a reasonable estimate thereof must be made by the taxpayer. Such\nestimate shall reflect the probability that an amount of income will be\nreceived or expense incurred, as well as the factors affecting the range on\ncontingent amounts. (4)\n\nOperating\nexpenses paid directly to third parties by the lessee or sublessee, for\nexample, under a net lease, are not included in gross rents, nor are they\ndeductible as operating costs. (5)\n\nIf the lease specifies that the lessor will pay a fixed amount of operating\nexpenses, the lessor may deduct such amount from gross rents in computing net\nrents. If there is no itemization of the operating costs paid by the lessor\nand, according to the terms of the lease, the lessor must pay such costs, the\nlessor may make a reasonable estimate of such costs in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) (3) of this section. If the lessor pays one or more of the\nfollowing operating costs and (i) there is no itemization in the lease for such\ncosts and (ii) no reasonable estimate is made, then the following percentages\nof gross rentals will be presumed attributable to the following costs: Heat and gas\n15 percent\n\nElectricity\n5 percent\n\nFurnishings\n5 percent\n\nAll of the above\n25 percent\n\nExample 1: A, as lessor, creates a lease with B as lessee. The lease\nis for a term of 60 years and covers an entire office building owned by A. The\nterms of the lease allow B to make substantial capital improvements to the\nbuilding. The gross rents to be received by A over the term of the lease total\n$5 million. Operating costs are estimated to be $2 million. Net rents total $3\nmillion (gross rents of $5 million less operating costs of $2 million paid by\nA). The present value of net rents is $550,000. Since all three conditions set forth in subdivision (a) of\nthis section are met, the creation of the lease constitutes a conveyance\nsubject to tax. The taxable consideration is $550,000, the present value of net\nrents. The total tax due, at the rate of $2 for each $500 of consideration, is\n$2,200. Example 2: Same facts as in example 1, except that this lease is for a\nterm of 30 years with no option to renew included. Since the lease is for a\nterm of less than 49 years, the creation of the lease is not a conveyance\nsubject to the transfer tax. Example 3: Same facts as in example 1, except that the lease created\nbetween A and B has a fixed term of 30 years and B is granted an option to\nrenew the lease at the end of the fixed term for another 30 years. This would\nbe treated as the creation of a 60 year lease and, therefore, would be a\ntaxable conveyance. The consideration used to compute the tax includes the\npresent value of the net rental payments to be received during the fixed term\nand the renewal term. Example 4: Corporation Z owns a ten story building. Corporation Z\ncreates a 60 year lease with corporation Y as tenant, such lease covering five\nfloors of the building (50 percent of the premises). Since the lease covers\nless than 90 percent of the rentable space of the premises, the creation of the\nlease is not a conveyance subject to the transfer tax. (c) Creation of a lease\nfor less than 49 years coupled with the granting of an option to\npurchase. (1)\n\nAn option to purchase\nreal property is an interest in real property. Where an option to purchase real\nproperty is coupled with the granting of the right to use and occupancy of the\nreal property, a conveyance subject to the transfer tax has occurred. Therefore, the creation of a lease coupled with the granting of an option to\npurchase the real property, regardless of the term of the lease, is a\nconveyance subject to the transfer tax. (2)\n\nIn the case of the creation of a lease\nfor less than 49 years, coupled with the granting of an option to purchase, the\nconsideration is the present value of the net rental payments under the lease\nplus the consideration paid for the granting of the option to purchase. Rental\npayments for periods that occur after the last date that the property may be\npurchased, if the option is exercised, are not included in the calculation of\nthe present value of the rental payments. Example: A, as lessor, creates a lease of a building with B as\nlessee. The term of the lease is 20 years. The lease contains an option to\npurchase the building which is exercisable through the tenth year of the lease. If the option is exercised, the lease provides that the property will be\ntransferred to B not later than 6 months after the option is exercised. B paid\n$10,000 specifically for the granting of the option. Since this is the granting\nof an option with use and occupancy, the transaction is subject to the transfer\ntax. The consideration used to compute the tax would be the present value of\nthe net rental payments to be received from the effective date of the lease\nthrough the expiration of the first ten years and six months of the lease, which is the period during which the property may be purchased pursuant to the\noption to purchase, plus the $10,000 paid for the granting of the\noption. (d) Assignments and surrenders of leases, options and contracts. (1)\n\nAn interest in real property includes a\nleasehold interest and an option or contract to purchase real property. Therefore, the transfer of a leasehold interest, regardless of the term, or the\ntransfer of an option or contract to purchase real property, by assignment or\nsurrender, is a conveyance subject to tax. (2)\n\nThe consideration in the case of an\nassignment of a leasehold interest or an option or contract to purchase real\nproperty is the amount paid for the assignment by the assignee to the assignor, i.e., the lessee under the lease or the person who is\nassigning his rights to purchase the property under the option or contract. The\nconsideration in the case of a surrender of a leasehold interest or option or\ncontract to purchase real property is the amount paid for the surrender by the\nlessor to the lessee or by the owner of the real property to the person who is\nsurrendering his rights to purchase the property under the option or contract. However, no tax will be imposed in the case of an assignment of a leasehold\ninterest or an option or contract to purchase real property if the assignor\npays consideration to the assignee to accept the assignment. Further, no tax\nwill be imposed in the case of a surrender of a leasehold interest or an option\nor contract to purchase real property if the lessee or the person who is\nsurrendering his rights to purchase the property under the option or contract\npays consideration to the lessor or owner of the real property to accept the\nsurrender. Example 1: A, a lessee under a 30 year lease, enters into an agreement\nto assign the leasehold interest to B, who will replace A as tenant under the\nlease. B agrees to pay A $500,000 for the leasehold interest. The assignment of\nA's leasehold interest to B is subject to tax at the rate of $2 for each $500\nof consideration resulting in a tax due of $2,000. Example 2: X is the owner of a building which is leased to Z under a\n20 year lease which has 10 years remaining under the terms of the lease. X\nwishes to cancel the lease before it expires and, therefore, enters into an\nagreement with Z whereby X will pay Z $400,000 to surrender the lease. The\nsurrender of the leasehold interest by Z is subject to tax at the rate of $2\nfor each $500 of consideration, resulting in a tax due of $1,600. Example 3: Same facts as in example 2 except that Z is the party\nmotivating the cancellation of the lease and, therefore, Z agrees to pay X to\naccept the surrender of the lease. No tax would be due since Z, the grantor, is\nnot receiving consideration for the conveyance. Example 4: A is the purchaser/contract vendee under a contract to\npurchase real property. A agrees to assign all rights under the contract, including the right to use and occupancy of the property, to B for $100,000. The assignment of the contract is subject to tax at the rate of $2 for each\n$500 of consideration, resulting in a tax due of $400. Example 5: Same facts as in example 4 except that the real property\nunder contract is a single family residence which A used solely as a personal\nresidence under a lease. The assignment of the contract would be exempt from\ntax. (See section\n575.9\n[c][10]\nof this Part.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
