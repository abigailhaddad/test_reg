Carey, by virtue of the authority vested in me\nby the Constitution and the Laws of the State of New York, and as Governor of\nthe State of New York, by Executive Order do hereby establish in the Executive\n\nDepartment the Council on International Business. The Council shall assist the\n\nGovernor and other State officials in their efforts to increase the level and\nscope of international business activities conducted in New York. Membership\n\nThe Council on International Business shall consist of such\nmembers as may be appointed by the Governor. Such membership shall be selected\nfrom among the private business, labor and academic communities and shall\ninclude the Commissioner of Commerce. The Governor shall designate one member\nas Chairman of the Council, and the Commissioner of Commerce shall serve as\n\nVice-Chairman.

The members of the Council shall not receive any salary or\nother compensation, but shall be reimbursed for expenses incurred in the\nperformance of their duties within amounts made available therefor by\nappropriation. General Powers and Responsibilities\n\nNew York State has historically served as the leading state\nin international activities, and to this day New York City is the nation's\nbusiest port and the world's financial center. As a result, any enhancement of\n\nNew York's participation in foreign commerce has a direct effect on the State's\neconomy; and increases in the exports of New York State firms and in the\nattraction of foreign investments contribute directly to the benefit of our\neconomy, providing additional jobs and income for our citizens. Essential to any effort to increase trade and commerce with\nnations around the world is the vital and energetic participation of members of\nthe State's private sector, especially those in the business, labor and\nacademic communities. To strengthen and build upon existing private and public\nsector cooperation in this effort, therefore, the Council on International\n\nBusiness shall: (1)\nadvise the Governor\nand other State officials on programs and projects designed to increase\ninternational business activities conducted by New York State firms; (2)\nserve as a catalyst for creating an\ninternational business consciousness among private sector firms; (3)\nassist in coordinating the involvement of\nthe Governor and other State officials in foreign trade activities in\ncooperation with members of the private sector, including participation in\noverseas trade missions; (4)\nassist\nin monitoring and coordinating current programs designed to promote\ninternational trade activities; and\n(5)\nreview the competitiveness of New York\n\nState as compared with other states in areas directly related to the attraction\nof foreign investment, including tax incentives, financing assistance, labor\nclimate and other factors as may be deemed appropriate. In conducting its affairs, the Council on International\n\nBusiness and its staff shall work in close cooperation with the Commissioner of\n\nCommerce in his capacity as Vice-Chairman of the Council and shall develop a\ncoordinated work program with the Division of International Commerce of the\n\nDepartment of Commerce. It shall also establish such committees or other\nsub-groups as may be needed. Internal Management\n\nThe Council may employ such staff and may retain the\nservices of such assistants as may be deemed necessary, at compensation to be\nfixed by the Chairman. It may also make such other expenditures as may be\ndeemed necessary within the amounts available therefor and subject to the\napproval of the Director of the Budget. In carrying out its functions, powers\nand duties, and in addition to coordinating its activities with the Department\nof Commerce, the Council shall, wherever possible, make use of the resources of\nexisting State departments and agencies, which are hereby directed to render\nfull cooperation and assistance to the Council.
