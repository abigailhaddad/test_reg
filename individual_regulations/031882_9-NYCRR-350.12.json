  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 350.12 - Guidelines for schedule of payments\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere a county or the City of New York has adopted a local\nlaw authorizing its probation department to receive an investigation fee for\nconducting an investigation pursuant to Family Court Act, section 653, the\nschedule of payment(s) of any such fee should be imposed by the court at the\ntime the investigation is ordered. Pursuant to Family Court Act, section 252-a, all fees shall be paid directly to the local probation department. To\nfacilitate the effective administration of fee collection, it is recommended\nthat the court require completion of the schedule of payment(s) on or before\nthe next court date. In the event payment is not completed by such time, it is\nrecommended that the balance be paid before completion of the hearing or\nsubmission of the final order and that any schedule of remaining payment(s)\nprovide for a designated amount to be paid at specified\nintervals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n350.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
