Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.19 - Elevator scaffold jacks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When elevator scaffold jacks are used for the installation of elevator hoistway\ndoors, such scaffold jacks shall be constructed and installed in compliance\nwith this Part (rule). (b) The\nplatforms of such scaffolds shall consist of planks at least equal in strength\nto No. 1 grade fir. Such planks shall be at least two inches thick full size. Such planks shall be supported by scaffold brackets or jacks constructed of\nspruce or plywood at least three-quarters inch by five inches in size or of\nmetal of equivalent strength. (c) Such jacks shall be constructed and installed in any hoistway by being tightly\nwedged between the guide rails and the elevator door sill. There shall be a\nnotch at least one and one-half inches by one and one-half inches in the lower\nhorizontal member of each jack at which point such jack shall rest on the door\nsill. A plank, at least two inches thick full size, shall be placed on the\nlower members of the jack and notched to fit tightly against the front vertical\nmembers to prevent any inward movement of the jacks. Such planks shall be\nbolted to the jacks by means of angles three inches by three inches by\none-quarter inch in size. The first plank of the main scaffold platform shall\nbe bolted similarly to the jacks. At the points where the jacks rest against\nthe guide rails, \"C\" clamps shall be used to prevent dislodgment. \"C\" clamps\nshall also be used to fasten two-inch by four-inch guard rails to the guide\nrails. Where it becomes necessary to prevent horizontal movement, cleats shall\nbe nailed to the platform planks to block such planks against the guide rails\nand/or hoistway walls. (d) Every\nperson working from, installing or dismantling such scaffolds shall be provided\nwith and shall use an approved safety belt or harness properly secured in\ncompliance with this Part (rule).
