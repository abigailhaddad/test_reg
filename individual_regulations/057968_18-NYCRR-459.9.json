Tit. 18 § 459.9 - Specific validation procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every participant coming into the senior\ncenter on the specified date will sign the daily log. A visitor who is not a\nbona fide member shall sign a guest log and not be included in the\nsample. (b) Their names will then\nbe checked against the participant record files, which will provide the basis\nfor verifying that they are at least 60 years of age, or the spouse of a person\nat least 60 years of age. (c) After\na brief explanation of why the requested information is being obtained, including the statement that the provision of this information is optional on\nthe part of the participant, the individual will be asked to show any\ndocumentation which would identify him as being categorically related, such as\na Medicaid card, P.A. ID card, SSI award letter. This information is to be\nrecorded on the validation form for categorically related individuals, and such\nidentification will terminate the validation process for those individuals of\nthe sample group. (d) Those\nparticipants who do not have any of the above documentation or indicate that\nthey are not categorically related would be asked to voluntarily sign a group\ndeclaration form that states that their \"monthly gross income is less than 90\npercent of the then in effect State median income, adjusted for family size,\"\nor if they prefer, an individual declaration form that certifies the same\nfacts. (The actual figures of the State median income adjusted for family size\nwill be published in the current Comprehensive Annual Social Services Program\n\nPlan for New York State.) All those participants who signed either the\nindividual or group declaration are then finished with the validation\nprocess. (e) The number in the\nsample who are categorically related (see subdivision [c] of this section) will\nbe added to the number who sign the group or individual forms (see subdivision\n[d] of this section) certifying that their income is below the required\nlevel. (f) Every person not\nvalidated by the previous steps must be listed on another form \"Individuals Not\n\nValidated.\" This includes anyone who refuses or otherwise fails to participate\nin the validation process after signing the log, as well as anyone who declare\nincome above the cutoff level. The residue of the sample who fail to show\ndocumentation or sign the group or individual declarations as to their level of\nincome, will be run against existing M.A. or P.A. files when determined\nappropriate to comply with Federal requirements. (g) The total number of persons recorded on\nthe categorical, group and individual declaration and not validated forms must\nequal the number in the sample, as listed on the daily log. This reconciliation\nis to be recorded on the return transmittal form prescribed by the\ndepartment. (h) The completed forms\nfrom each center in the sample, including the daily log, are to be packed with\nthe return transmittal form and returned to the main office of the local social\nservices district conducting the validation.
