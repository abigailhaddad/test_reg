(b) The State Archives, with the consent of the agency records management officer, may revise a records disposition proposal prior to taking final action to\nauthorize disposition. (c) At least\n40 days prior to authorizing an agency records disposition proposal, the State\n\nArchives shall forward a copy to the offices of the Attorney General and State\n\nComptroller for their review.
