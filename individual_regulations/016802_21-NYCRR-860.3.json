  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 860.3 - Stream quality objectives\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Antigradation of waters. (1)\n\nInterstate waters. It is the policy of the commission to maintain the quality\nof interstate waters, where existing quality is better than the established\nstream quality objectives, unless it can be affirmatively demonstrated to the\ncommission that such change is justifiable as a result of necessary economic or\nsocial development or to improve significantly another body of water. In\nimplementing this policy, the commission will require the highest degree of\nwaste treatment determined to be practicable. No change will be considered\nwhich would be injurious to any designated present or future use. (2)\n\nSpecial protection waters. It is the\npolicy of the commission that there be no measurable change in existing water\nquality except towards natural conditions in waters considered by the\ncommission to have exceptionally high scenic, recreational, ecological, and/or\nwater supply values. Waters with exceptional values may be classified by the\ncommission as either outstanding basin waters or significant resource waters. In determining waters suitable for classification as special protection waters, the commission will consider nomination petitions from local, State and Federal\nagencies and governing bodies, and the public for waters potentially meeting\nthe definition of outstanding basin waters and significant resource waters as\ndescribed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. The following policies shall\napply to waters classified by the commission as outstanding basin waters or\nsignificant resource waters and their drainage areas: (i) Definitions. (a) Outstanding basin waters\nare interstate and contiguous intrastate waters that are contained within the\nestablished boundaries of national parks; national wild, scenic and\nrecreational rivers systems; and/or national wildlife refuges that are\nclassified by the commission under clause (vii)(\na\n) of this\nparagraph hereof as having exceptionally high scenic, recreational, and\necological values that require special protection. (b) Significant resource\nwaters\nare interstate waters classified by the commission under clause\n(vii)(\nb\n) of this paragraph hereof as having exceptionally high\nscenic, recreational, ecological, and/or water supply uses that require special\nprotection. (c) Existing\nwater quality\nfor purposes of the Special Protection Waters Program is\ndefined for a limited set of parameters, consisting of those listed in tables 1\nand 2. Existing water quality is defined in table 1 for stream reaches between\n\nHancock, New York and the Delaware Water Gap and in table 2 for stream reaches\nbetween the Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, New Jersey. Where existing water\nquality is not defined in tables 1 and 2, existing water quality may be defined\nby extrapolation from the nearest upstream or downstream interstate control\npoint, from data obtained from sites within the same ecoregion, or on the basis\nof best scientific judgement. (d) Measurable change to existing water quality\nis defined as an\nactual or estimated change in a seasonal or non-seasonal mean (for SPW waters\nupstream of and including river mile 209.5*) or median (for SPW waters\ndownstream of river mile 209.5) in-stream pollutant concentration that is\noutside the range of the two-tailed upper and lower 95 percent confidence\nintervals that define existing water\nquality. *\n(e) Public interest\nis a\ndetermination of all the positive and negative social, economic and water\nresource impacts associated with a project affecting a significant resource\nwater. A project that is in the public interest is one that, at a minimum, provides housing, employment, and/or public facilities needed to accommodate\nthe adopted future population, land use, and other goals of a community and\nregion without causing deleterious impacts on the local and regional\nenvironment and economy. In general, such a project would be one that conforms\nto a locally adopted growth management plan which is undergoing active\nimplementation by local officials, is supported by the larger community as a\nwhole, and is compatible with national, State and regional objectives as well. For a project not fully meeting the above criteria, the commission will weigh\nthe positive and negative impacts to determine public interest. (f) Regional resources management\nplan\nis a management plan developed and adopted by the government\nagency that is assigned primary responsibilities for the overall management of\na national park, scenic and recreational river and/or wildlife refuge which\ncontains waters that have been classified by the commission as outstanding\nbasin waters. A regional resources management plan is one that addresses, among\nother subjects, the location and general size of allowable wastewater treatment\nfacilities. A regional resources management plan, or applicable portions\nthereof, may be incorporated into the commission's comprehensive\nplan. (g) Natural\ncondition\nis the ecological state of a water body that represents\nconditions without human influence. (h) Nondischarging/load reduction\noptions\nare options whereby the amount of wastewater discharged to a\nsurface stream is reduced by (\n1\n) instituting load reduction\nmeasures involving reductions in pollutants at the source possibly accompanied\nby water conservation practices to reduce the amount of flow received at a\nwastewater treatment plant; and/or (\n2\n) using land-based\nwastewater disposal whereby treated wastewater effluent is further treated by\npercolation and other soil-based processes instead of instream\nprocesses. (i) Natural\nwastewater treatment systems\nare soil-based, vegetative and/or aquatic\nwastewater treatment systems characterized by the use of low energy treatment\nprocesses that use and simulate \"natural\" environmental processes such as\nprimary and secondary productivity, crop production, wetlands, ponds and\nothers. (j) Nonpoint\nsources\nare sources of pollutants carried by surface and subsurface\nrunoff that are derived from human activities and land use. (k) Cumulative impact\nis the\nnet sum of all individual impacts including all point and nonpoint source\nimpacts. (l) Boundary\ncontrol points\nare locations where monitoring and other activities\noccur to determine existing water quality, no measurable change, and related\npollution control requirements as applicable. Boundary control points for\noutstanding basin waters will generally correspond to federally established\nboundaries for national parks, etc. while those for significant resource waters\nwill generally correspond to the confluence of an intrastate tributary with the\nclassified interstate water. The locations of boundary and interstate control\npoints are described in part C of table 1 for the reach between Hancock, NY and\nthe Delaware Water Gap and in tables 2A and 2B for the reach between the\n\nDelaware Water Gap and Trenton, NJ. (m) Interstate control\npoints\nare general locations used to assess water quality for purposes\nof defining and protecting existing water quality. The locations of boundary\nand interstate control points are described in part C of table 1 for the reach\nbetween Hancock, NY and the Delaware Water Gap and in tables 2A and 2B for the\nreach between the Delaware Water Gap and Trenton, NJ. (n) Growth management plans\nare locally developed and adopted plans expressing the social, economic, and\nenvironmental goals and objectives of the local community. A growth management\nplan in this context can be one plan, a series of plans, local ordinances, and\nother official documents of a municipality. Growth management plans outline the\ncommunity's desired growth patterns and related infrastructure. To be\nconsidered in the commission's determination of public interest, growth\nmanagement plans must be undergoing active implementation and forming the basis\nfor local governmental decisions. (o) An\nexpanding wastewater treatment\nproject\nis a project involving either (1) alterations or additions to\nan existing wastewater treatment facility that result in a reviewable project\nin accordance with the commission's\n\nRules of Practice and\n\nProcedure; or (2) a new load or increased flow or loading from an\nexisting facility that was not included in a NPDES permit or docket effective\non the date of SPW designation. (p) Substantial alterations or additions\nare those additions and\nalterations resulting in: (1)\na complete\nupgrade or modernization of an existing wastewater treatment plant, including\nsubstantial replacement or rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment\nplant, including substantial replacement or rehabilitation of the existing\nwastewater treatment process or major physical structures such as headworks, settling tanks, and biological/chemical treatment and filtration tanks, whether\nconducted as a single phase or a multi-phased project or related projects; or\n(2)\na new load or increased flow\nor loading from an existing facility that was not included in a NPDES permit or\ndocket effective on the date of SPW designation. Among other projects, modifications made solely to address wet weather flows; and alterations that\nare limited to changes in the method of disinfection and/or the addition of\ntreatment works for nutrient removal are not deemed to be \"Substantial\n\nAlterations or Additions.\"\n(q) Load\nand\n\nLoading\nare used interchangeably in these regulations and\nrefer to the amount of a substance or material, expressed as a weight per unit\ntime (pounds per day, for example), that is discharged from a\nfacility. (r) Incremental\nload\nand\nincremental loading\nare used interchangeably\nin these regulations and refer to the load that is greater than the actual load\ndischarged by a facility at the time of SPW designation. (s) Best management\npractices\nare any structural or nonstructural measure designed to\nreduce stormwater runoff and resulting nonpoint source loads. (t) Watershed nonpoint source\nmanagement plan\nis a plan prepared for a watershed that describes the\nbasis for, and overall control strategy of, a plan for controlling, limiting, and abating all relevant nonpoint source loadings within the watershed. The\nplan will identify and assess important natural and anthropogenic features and\ninfluences on water quality; existing local, state and other nonpoint source\ncontrol programs; potential nonpoint source loads on special protection waters; watershed-specific protection requirements; and the institutional needs and\narrangements required to implement the plan. (u) Nonpoint source pollution control\nplan\nis a plan describing the best management practices to be used at\nthe project site and in the project service area to control increases in\nnonpoint source pollutant loadings resulting from the project. (v) Priority watershed\nis a\nwatershed that has been evaluated in conjunction with other watersheds draining\nto special protection waters and designated by the commission as having a\nsubstantial potential pollution impact on the water quality of special\nprotection waters in comparison with other watersheds. (ii)\n\nNo measurable change to existing water\nquality. (a) Outstanding basin waters shall be\nmaintained at their existing water quality. Point and nonpoint sources of\npollutants originating from outside the boundaries of stream reaches classified\nas outstanding basin waters shall be treated as required and then dispersed in\nthe receiving water so that no measurable change occurs at boundary and\ninterstate control points. Point sources of pollutants discharged to\noutstanding basin waters shall be treated as required and then dispersed in\nsuch a manner that complete mixing of effluent with the receiving stream is, for all practical intents and purposes, instantaneous. (b) Significant resource waters shall not be\ndegraded below existing water quality as defined in these regulations, although\nlocalized degradation of water quality may be allowed for initial dilution if\nthe commission, after consultation with the State NPDES permitting agency, finds that the public interest warrants these changes. Point and nonpoint\nsources of pollutants originating from outside the boundaries of stream reaches\nclassified as significant resource waters shall be treated as required and then\ndispersed in the receiving water so that no measurable change occurs at\nboundary and interstate control points, unless a mixing zone is allowed in\nsignificant resource waters, and then to the extent of the mixing zone\ndesignated as set forth in this section. If degradation of water quality is\nallowed for initial dilution purposes, the commission, after consultation with\nthe State NPDES permitting agency, will designate mixing zones for each point\nsource and require the highest possible point source treatment levels necessary\nto limit the size and extent of the mixing zones. The dimensions of the mixing\nzone will be determined by the commission after consultation with the State\nNPDES permitting agency based upon an evaluation of (1) site-specific\nconditions, including channel characteristics; (2) the cost and feasibility of\ntreatment technologies; and (3) the design of the discharge structure. Mixing\nzones will be developed using the wastewater treatment facility design\nconditions and low ambient flow conditions unless site-specific characteristics\nindicate otherwise. Nonpoint sources shall be subject to the requirements of\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph for the implementation of nonpoint source\ncontrol plans. (iii)\n\nAllowable discharges. (a) Direct discharges of\nwastewater to special protection waters are discouraged. The following\ncategories of projects discharging directly to special protection waters may be\napproved only after the applicant demonstrates that it has fully evaluated all\nnon-discharge/load reduction alternatives and is unable to implement these\nalternatives because of technical and/or financial infeasibility: new\nwastewater treatment facilities and substantial alterations or additions to\nexisting wastewater treatment facilities. When evaluating non-discharge/load\nreduction alternatives, the applicant shall consider alternatives to any and\nall loadings-both existing and proposed-in excess of actual loadings at the\ntime of SPW designation. (b) The\nfollowing categories of projects within the drainage area of special protection\nwaters may be approved only after the applicant demonstrates that it has fully\nevaluated all natural wastewater treatment system alternatives and is unable to\nimplement these alternatives because of technical and/or financial\ninfeasibility: new wastewater treatment facilities and substantial alterations\nor additions to existing wastewater treatment facilities. When evaluating\nnatural treatment alternatives, the applicant shall consider alternatives to\nany and all loadings-both existing and proposed-in excess of actual loadings at\nthe time of SPW designation. (c) The following categories of projects discharging directly to significant\nresource waters may be approved only following a determination that the project\nis in the public interest as that term is defined in subparagraph (a)(2)(i)(e)\nof this paragraph: new wastewater treatment facilities and substantial\nalterations or additions to existing wastewater treatment facilities. (d) The general number, location and size of\nfuture wastewater treatment facilities discharging to outstanding basin waters\n(if any) shall be developed taking into consideration any adopted regional\nresource management plan as defined in clause (i)\n(f) of this\nparagraph and, on an individual project basis, considering the feasibility of\nnon-discharge/load reduction alternatives. (iv)\n\nWastewater treatment facilities. (a) All wastewater treatment facilities\ndischarging to waters classified as special protection waters shall have\navailable standby power facilities unless it can be shown that a proposed\ndischarge can be interrupted for an extended period with no threat to the water\nquality of special protection waters. Existing facilities must comply with this\nrequirement upon their next permit renewal under the delegated national\npolluant discharge elimination system (NPDES) permit program. (b) All wastewater treatment facilities\ndischarging to special protection waters that are not staffed 24 hours every\nday shall have a remote alarm that will continuously monitor plant operations\nwhenever the plant is not staffed. The alarm system will be designed to alert\nsomeone available with authority and knowledge to take appropriate action. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon their next permit\nrenewal under the delegated NPDES program. (c) All new wastewater treatment facilities\ndischarging to outstanding basin waters shall not have visual discharge plumes. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon their next permit\nrenewal under the delegated NPDES program. (d) All new wastewater treatment facilities\ndischarging to special protection waters shall prepare and implement an\nemergency management plan following the guidance provided in the Water\n\nPollution Control Federation's\n\nManual of Practice SM-8, Emergency\n\nPlanning for Municipal Wastewater Facilities, the U.S. EPA's\n\nDesign Criteria for Mechanical, Electric and Fluid System and Component\n\nReliability\nor other suitable manuals. Emergency management plans\nshall include an emergency notification procedure covering all affected\ndownstream users. Existing facilities must comply with this requirement upon\ntheir next permit renewal under the delegated NPDES program. (e) The minimum level of wastewater treatment\nfor the following categories of projects will be \"Best Demonstrable Technology\"\nas defined below: all new wastewater treatment facilities and all projects\ninvolving substantial alterations or additions to existing wastewater treatment\nfacilities when the new or expanding facility discharges directly to\noutstanding basin waters or significant resource waters. Equivalent effluent\ncriteria for industrial facilities and seasonal limits, if any, will be\ndeveloped on a case-by-case basis. The following 30-day average effluent\ncriteria define best demonstrable technology: *\n5-day CBOD: 10 mg/l or less\n\nDissolved oxygen: 6.0 mg/l or greater\n\nTotal suspended solids: 10 mg/l or less\n\nAmmonia-nitrogen: 1.5 mg/l or less\n\nTotal nitrogen: 10.0 mg/l or less\n\nTotal phosphorus: 2.0 mg/l or less\n\nFecal coliform: 50/100 ml or less\n(f) Best demonstrable technology for\ndisinfection shall be ultraviolet light disinfection or an equivalent\ndisinfection process that results in no harm to aquatic life, does not produce\ntoxic chemical residuals, and results in effective bacterial and viral\ndestruction. (g) For\nwastewater treatment facility\ndischarge projects that satisfy\napplicable requirements of subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of this paragraph, the commission may approve effluent trading on a voluntary basis between point\nsources within the same watershed or between the same interstate or boundary\ncontrol points to achieve no measurable change to existing water quality. Applicants seeking the commission's approval for a trade must demonstrate\nequivalent load and pollutant reductions and the ability (through contracts, docket conditions, NPDES effluent limits or other legal instruments) to ensure\ncontinuous achievement of the required reductions for a term of not less than\nfive years or the time required for the point source(s) to install the\ntreatment needed to demonstrate no measurable change to existing water quality, whichever term is longer. States will be encouraged to incorporate appropriate\nconditions in the next NPDES permits issued to the trading\ndischargers. (h) For wastewater\ntreatment facilities within the drainage area to special protection waters, the\nactual loads and design flows included in a NPDES permit or docket effective at\nthe time of special protection waters designation (\"SPW designation\") may\ncontinue without triggering the additional treatment requirements and\nalternatives analyses required by these regulations. However, when substantial\nalterations or additions as defined herein are proposed, although the actual\ndischarge at the time of SPW designation remains exempt from additional\nrequirements, the proposed expansion cannot be approved until (1) the applicant\ndemonstrates that it has evaluated all non-discharge load reduction\nalternatives for all or a portion of the incremental load and is unable to\nimplement these alternatives because of technical or financial infeasibility\n(for discharges directly to outstanding basin waters [OBW] and significant\nresource waters [SRW]); (2) the applicant demonstrates that it has evaluated\nall natural wastewater treatment system alternatives for all or a portion of\nthe incremental load and is unable to implement these alternatives because of\ntechnical or financial infeasibility (for discharges directly to OBW and SRW\nand for tributary discharges); (3) the commission has determined that the\nproject is demonstrably in the public interest as defined herein (for\ndischarges directly to SRW); (4) the minimum level of treatment to be provided\nfor the incremental discharge is best demonstrable technology as defined herein\n(for discharges directly to OBW and SRW); and (5) the applicant demonstrates\nthat the project will cause no measurable change to existing water quality as\ndefined herein (for discharges directly to OBW and SRW and for tributary\ndischarges). (i) For wastewater\ntreatment facility projects subject to the no measurable change requirement, the demonstration of no measurable change to existing water quality shall be\nsatisfied if the applicant demonstrates that the new or incremental increase in\nthe facility's flow or load will cause no measurable change at the relevant\nwater quality control point for the parameters denoted by asterisks in tables 1\nand 2 of this section: ammonia (NH\n3\nN); dissolved oxygen\n(DO); fecal coliform (FC); nitrate (NO\n3\nN) or nitrite +\nnitrate (NO\n2\nN + NO\n3\nN); total\nnitrogen (TN) or total kjeldahl nitrogen (TKN); total phosphorus (TP); total\nsuspended solids (TSS); and biological oxygen demand (BOD) (table 1 only). In\nmaking the demonstration required in the preceding sentence the applicant shall\nuse a DRBC-approved model of the tributary or main stem watershed if available. Where a DRBC-approved model is not available, the applicant shall use other\nmethodologies submitted to and approved in advance by the commission to\nestimate cumulative effect at the applicable control point. (v) Control of nonpoint sources. (a) Projects subject to review under section\n3.8\nof the Compact that are\nlocated in the drainage area of special protection waters must submit for\napproval a nonpoint source pollution control plan that controls the new or\nincreased nonpoint source loads generated within the portion of the project's\nservice area which is also located within the drainage area of special\nprotection waters. The plan will document which best management practices\ndescribed in handbooks, manuals and other documents prepared by the applicable\nstate environmental agency that the project sponsor will use to control, to the\nextend possible, the nonpoint source loads from the project. In approving the\nplan, the commission may consider, but not require, tradeoffs, that the project\nsponsor might propose, between the reduction of potential new nonpoint source\nloads and: (1)\nequivalent reductions in\nexisting nonpoint source loads; (2)\nequivalent point source loads; and\n(3)\nequivalent nonpoint source loads from\noutside the affected service area. Applicants desiring commission approval of tradeoff\nstrategies must provide information concerning the amount of nonpoint source\nloads to be reduced through an equivalent tradeoff process and, where\nnecessary, the enforceable mechanisms and/or agreements required to implement\nthe tradeoffs. Where tradeoffs have been approved, control measures for\nexisting nonpoint sources must be substantially in-place prior to project\noperation. The executive director may, upon agreement with the State, delegate\nreview and approval responsibilities under this section to the appropriate\n\nState environmental agency. Exceptions to this policy are: (i) Public authorities, other special purpose\ndistricts, and private corporations that do not have the legal authority to\nimplement nonpoint source controls in their new or expanded service areas. Such\nentities are subject, however, to the requirement set forth in clause\n(b) of this subparagraph, that no new connection may be\napproved unless the area(s) served is (are) regulated by a nonpoint source\npollution control plan approved by the commission. (ii)\n\nThe requirement for service area\nnonpoint source control plans is automatically satisfied if the project service\narea is part of a watershed nonpoint source management plan that has been\nadopted into the commission's comprehensive plan and is being\nimplemented. (iii)\n\nProjects located\nabove major surface water impoundments listed in subdivision (a)(2)(vii)(e) of\nthis section where time of travel and relevant hydraulic and limnological\nfactors preclude a direct impact on special protection waters. (iv)\n\nProjects located in municipalities that\nhave adopted and are actively implementing nonpoint source/stormwater control\nordinances that have been reviewed and approved by the commission. (v) Projects located in watersheds where the\napplicable State environmental agency, county government, and local\nmunicipalities are participating in the development of a watershed plan being\nprepared under the auspices of these regulations, the Federal Clean Water Act, or State initiatives. (b) Approval of a new or expanded water\nwithdrawal and/or wastewater discharge project will be subject to the condition\nthat any new connection to the project system only serve an area(s) regulated\nby a nonpoint source pollution control plan which has been approved by the\ncommission. (c) Within two years\nafter the adoption of special protection waters nonpoint source control\nregulations, the commission shall, after substantial consultation with local, county, State and Federal agencies and the general public, publish a report\npresenting its methodology for prioritizing watersheds in the special\nprotection waters drainage area including alternatives, if any; a preliminary\nlisting of priority watersheds in the drainage area; and a recommended plan of\nstudy for the development of watershed-specific management plans. For waters\nclassified as special protection waters after December 1992, the watershed\nprioritization process will be completed within two years after the special\nprotection waters are classified. Watershed priorities will be determined from\na comparative analysis of each watershed's location and potential, future\nimpact on existing water quality at designated boundary and interstate control\npoints. In determining priorities, the commission will consider: (1)\nthe physical characteristics of the\nwatershed including slopes, soils, existing land use and land cover, drainage\ncharacteristics, and others; (2)\nthe status of existing water quality and trends, if any, of the watershed as\nmeasured as its boundary control point; (3)\nthe anticipated mass loadings of new\nnonpoint sources; (4)\nthe watershed\nmanagement and planning priorities of applicable local, State and Federal\nagencies; (5)\nthe current status of\nlocal land use/nonpoint source controls in the watershed; and, (6)\nthe stormwater permitting activity in the\nNPDES permitting program; and\n(7)\nother natural and anthropogenic factors. (d) Once the public has been given an\nopportunity to comment, the commission will adopt a list of priority\nwatersheds. This listing will be reviewed and modified as necessary on a two\nyear basis after adoption. (e) Within five years after adopting a list of priority watersheds draining to\nspecial protection waters, the commission shall develop, or encourage the\ndevelopment of, watershed nonpoint source management plans for each priority\nwatershed unless new circumstances result in deferring plan completion. Watershed nonpoint source management plans will focus on nonpoint source\nloadings, but will consider total loads including both point and nonpoint\nsources and their interrelationship where necessary. During plan development, the commission will seek technical assistance from the applicable State\nenvironmental agency and all other applicable Federal, State, county, and local\ngovernment units; and will consider direct delegation of plan development (with\nconcurrence of the State environmental agency) to any county or other\napplicable governmental entity desiring to perform the watershed planning\nactivities on behalf of, or instead of, the commission. Where more than one\npolitical unit shares a watershed, joint plan development arrangements between\nthe commission and delegated agencies will be developed. (f) Watershed management plans developed by\nthe commission, or approved by the commission will be incorporated into the\ncommission's comprehensive plan in accordance with the\n\nRules of\n\nPractice and Procedure. (g) The commission shall encourage the\nvoluntary development of watershed management plans for tributary watersheds\nentering special protection waters and local nonpoint source regulatory\nprograms that conform to the goals and objectives of the special protection\nwaters regulations as promulgated in subdivision (a)(2) of this section. Within\nthe limits of its resources, the commission will provide technical assistance, a clearinghouse for nonpoint sources information, regulatory authority, inter-agency coordination, and other services to local and other governmental\nunits desiring to develop and implement stormwater and nonpoint source\nwatershed plans and local regulatory programs. (h) The commission shall encourage the\nsubmission of watershed management plans prepared voluntarily and independently\nfrom these regulations for consideration of inclusion into the commission's\ncomprehensive plan. (vi)\n\nPolicies regarding intergovernment responsibilities. (a) Inter-relationship of State and\ncommission responsibilities. The applicable State environmental agency shall\nassure to the extent possible that existing water quality in special protection\nwaters is not measurably changed by pollution discharged into the intrastate\ntributary watersheds within its jurisdiction. For water quality management\npurposes, the State environmental agency and the commission will jointly\nestablish boundary control points as described in subparagraph\n(i) (l) and (vii)\n(d) of this paragraph. In\nperforming this responsibility, the State environmental agency shall require\nthat all new or expanding wastewater treatment facilities and existing\nwastewater treatment plants applying for a discharge permit or permit renewal\nunder the delegated NPDES program to comply with the policies as prescribed in\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph unless it can be demonstrated, after\nconsultation with the commission, that these requirements are not necessary for\nthe protection of existing water quality in the special protection waters due\nto distance from special protection waters, time of travel, the existence of\nwater storage impoundments, the waste assimilation characteristics of the\nreceiving stream, and other relevant hydrological and limnological factors. The\ncommission shall, to the extent practicable and necessary, coordinate and\noversee all special protection waters activities and assist the efforts of each\n\nState environmental agency to control pollutants originating from intrastate\ntributary watersheds. The commission shall determine pollution control\nrequirements for discharges to special protection waters; for nonpoint sources\ndraining directly into special protection waters; and total nonpoint source\nloads emanating from intrastate tributary watersheds as measured at boundary\ncontrol points. (vii)\n\nClassified special protection waters. (a) The\nfollowing stream reaches are classified as outstanding basin waters: (1)\nthe Upper Delaware Scenic and\n\nRecreational River (Delaware River between River Mile 330.7 and\n258.4); (2)\nthose portions of\nintrastate tributaries located within the established boundary of the Upper\n\nDelaware Scenic and Recreational River Corridor; (3)\nthe Middle Delaware Scenic and\n\nRecreational River (Delaware River between River Miles 250.1 and\n209.5); (4)\nthose portions of\ntributaries located within the established boundary of the Delaware Water Gap\n\nNational Recreation Area. (b) The following stream reaches are\nclassified as significant resource waters: (1)\n\nThe Delaware River between River Miles\n258.4 (the downstream boundary of the Upper Delaware Scenic and Recreational\n\nRiver) and 250.1 (the upstream boundary of the Delaware Water Gap National\n\nRecreation Area). (2)\n\nThe Lower\n\nDelaware River between River Miles 209.5 (the downstream boundary of the\n\nDelaware Water Gap National Recreation Area) and 134.34 (the Calhoun Street\n\nBridge near the Head of Tide at Trenton, NJ). (c) Definitions of existing water quality for\nwaters classified in subclauses\n(1)\nand\n(2)\nof this clause above are presented in part A of table 1 for the Upper Delaware\n\nScenic & Recreational River and part B of table 1 for the reach from\n\nMillrift, PA. to the Delaware Water Gap, including the Middle Delaware Scenic\nand Recreational River; and in table 2 for the reach between the Delaware Water\n\nGap and Trenton, NJ.

Existing water quality is defined in terms of (a) an annual or seasonal mean of\nthe available water quality data, (b) two-tailed upper and lower 95 percent\nconfidence limits around the mean, and (c) the 10th and 90th percentiles of the\ndata set from which the mean was calculated.

Implementation guidance should be consulted. 2\n\nThe definitions of Existing\n\nWater Quality presented in Parts A and B of this table were developed by\nperforming parametric statistical analyses using logarithmic transformation of\navailable water quality data to derive normality. The numbers represent the\nanti-log of the statistical results and, thus, will differ from numbers\ngenerated by using non-transformed data. Means derived from log\ntransformations, for example, will be lower than means derived from\nnon-transformed data. The three indices used to develop the biocriteria were\nderived from specialized transformations of the original data, resulting in\nvalues that are normally distributed.

(1)\n\nThe waters of the\nbasin shall not contain substances attributable to municipal, industrial, or\nother discharges in concentrations or amounts sufficient to preclude the\nspecified water uses to be protected. Within this requirement: (i) the waters shall be substantially free\nfrom unsightly or malodorous nuisances due to floating solids, sludge deposits, debris, oil, scum, substances in concentrations or combinations which are toxic\nor harmful to human, animal, plant, or aquatic life, or that produce color, taste, odor of the water, or taint fish or shellfish flesh; and\n(ii)\nthe concentration of total dissolved\nsolids, except intermittent streams, shall not exceed 133 percent of\nbackground. (2)\n\nIn no\ncase shall concentrations of substances exceed those values given for rejection\nof water supplies in the\n\nUnited States Public Health Service Drinking\n\nWater Standards. (c) Aquatic life objectives for toxic\npollutants. It is the policy of the commission to designate numerical\nstream quality objectives for the protection of aquatic life for the Delaware\n\nRiver estuary and Bay (zones 2 through 6) which correspond to the designated\nuses of each zone. Aquatic life objectives for the protection from both acute\nand chronic effects are herein established on a pollutant-specific basis for: pollutants listed as toxic under section 307(a)(1) of the Clean Water Act for\nwhich the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has published final\ncriteria; other chemicals for which EPA has published final criteria under\nsection 304(a) of the Act; and pollutants and other chemicals in combinations. Other toxic substances for which any of the three estuary states have adopted\ncriteria or standards may also be considered for the development of stream\nquality objectives. (1)\n\nFor the\npurpose of determining compliance with stream quality objectives for the\nprotection of aquatic life, the duration of exposure of aquatic organisms shall\nbe one hour for acute objectives and four days for chronic\nobjectives. (2)\n\nStream quality\nobjectives for cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, silver and zinc shall\nbe expressed as the dissolved form of the metal. Adjustment factors established\nby the commission based upon the best available scientific information shall be\nused to convert total recoverable criteria published by the U.S. Environmental\n\nProtection Agency to dissolved stream quality objectives. In the absence of\ndata to develop a factor for any of the metals, an adjustment factor of 1.0\nshall be utilized. Stream quality objectives for other metals shall be\nexpressed as the concentration of the total recoverable form of the\nmetal. (d) Human\nhealth objectives for toxic pollutants. It is the policy of the commission to designate numerical\nstream quality objectives for the protection of human health for the Delaware\n\nRiver estuary and Bay (zones 2 through 6) which correspond to the designated\nuses of each zone. Stream quality objectives for protection from both\ncarcinogenic and systemic effects are herein established on a\npollutant-specific basis for: pollutants listed as toxic under section\n307(a)(1) and other toxic pollutants; and other chemicals for which EPA has\npublished final criteria under section 304(a) of the Act. Other toxic\nsubstances for which any of the three estuary states have adopted criteria or\nstandards may also be considered for the development of stream quality\nobjectives. (1)\n\nAn objective to\nprotect against carcinogenic effects shall only be established if the pollutant\nis classified A, B or C under the U.S. EPA classification system for\ncarcinogens, and if a cancer potency factor (CPF) exists in IRIS. (2)\n\nAn objective to protect against systemic\neffects shall only be established for a pollutant if a reference dose (RfD)\nexists in IRIS. An additional safety factor of 10 shall be utilized in\nestablishing the stream quality objectives to protect against systemic effects\nfor pollutants classified as carcinogens if a CPF is not available in\nIRIS. (3)\n\nIn the absence of\ntoxicological data for an RfD or CPF in IRIS, data published in the 1980 U.S. EPA water quality criteria documents will be considered. (4)\n\nIn establishing stream quality objectives\nfor carcinogens, the level of risk is established at\n10\n-6\nor one additional cancer in every 1,000,000\nhumans exposed for a lifetime (70 years). (5)\n\nFor the purpose of determining compliance\nwith human health stream quality objectives, the duration of exposure shall be\n70 years for carcinogens and 30 days for systemic toxicants. (6)\nA rate of ingestion of water of 2.0\nliters per day is assumed in calculating objectives for river zones where the\ndesignated uses include public water supplies after reasonable treatment. A\nrate of ingestion of fish of 17.5 grams per day (equivalent to consuming a 1/2\npound portion every 13 days) is assumed in calculating freshwater and marine\nstream quality objectives for the protection of human health. (7)\n\nMaximum contaminant levels (MCLs) shall\nbe applied as stream quality objectives in zones 2 and 3 which are designated\nfor use as public water supplies for those toxic pollutants where the MCL value\nis more stringent than the calculated human health objectives for carcinogens\nor systemic toxicants. (8)\n\nNumerical criteria for toxic pollutants to protect the taste and odor of\ningested water and fish shall be applied as stream quality objectives in the\nzones 2-6 if these criteria are more stringent than the calculated human health\nobjectives for carcinogens or systemic toxicants. Footnotes\n* River mile 209.5 is the downstream boundary of the\n\nDelaware Water Gap National Recreation Area. SPW waters upstream of and\nincluding this point received SPW designation in 1992 and SPW waters below this\npoint received SPW designation in 2005. The water quality strategy used to\nsupport this later designation differed from that employed a decade\nearlier. * The effluent criteria that define best demonstrable\ntechnology (BDT) were established by these regulations in 1992 when DRBC\noriginally promulgated the special protection waters regulations for point\nsource discharges. Although treatment technologies have advanced since that\nyear, these \"BDT\" criteria have been retained for the limited purposes of the\nSPW program. BDT as defined herein may be superseded, however, by applicable\n\nFederal, State or DRBC criteria that are more stringent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
