  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.3 - Refunds and credits based on certain uses\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1119(a)\n(a) Authorization. Where a sales or compensating use tax has been correctly, legally, and constitutionally imposed and paid on the purchase of tangible\npersonal property, a refund or credit of State and local taxes paid pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of section\n1105\nor section\n1110\nof the Tax Law on the sale or use will\nbe allowed to the purchaser or user when, to the satisfaction of the Department\nof Taxation and Finance, the purchaser shows that such tangible personal\nproperty was used in one of the following manners: (1)\nthe tangible personal property was used\nin the performance of a contract, and pursuant to such contract, was\nincorporated into real property, as described in section\n527.7\nof this Title, located outside of New York State (see subdivision [b] of this\nsection); (2)\nthe tangible personal\nproperty was purchased in bulk, or any portion thereof, stored in New York\n\nState and not otherwise used in New York State by the purchaser or user, but\nwas reshipped to a point outside New York by such purchaser or user for use\noutside of New York State (see subdivision [c] of this section); (3)\nthe tangible personal property was sold\nto or used by a contractor or subcontractor solely in the performance of a\npre-existing lump sum or unit price construction contract (see subdivision [d]\nof this section); (4)\nthe tangible\npersonal property was not purchased for resale, but its use in this State was\nrestricted to fabricating (including incorporating it into or assembling it\nwith other tangible personal property), processing, printing, or imprinting\nsuch property, and such property was shipped outside of this State for use\noutside of this State (see subdivision [e] of this section); (5)\ndrugs or medicine sold to or used by a\nveterinarian if such drugs or medicine were: (i) used by the veterinarian in rendering\nservices, exempt pursuant to section\n1115 (f)\nof the Tax Law, to\nlivestock or poultry used in the production of tangible personal property by\nfarming; or\n(ii)\nsold to a person\nentitled to claim the farmer's exemption under section\n1115 (a)(6)\nof the Tax Law\nfor use by such person on production livestock or poultry. (For farming\nexemption, see section\n528.7\nof this Title); (6)\nfor\npurposes of paragraphs (1), (2), and (4) of this subdivision, movement of the\nproperty from one taxing locality in New York to another may also give rise to\na refund or credit of the local sales or use tax paid on the original\ntransaction. However, such movement may be subject to a use tax, depending upon\nthe nature of the subsequent use in the second locality. (b) Property incorporated into realty\noutside of New York State. (1)\nA\npurchaser or user who has paid the tax on tangible personal property may claim\na refund or credit for such tax provided: (i) he incorporates the property into real property located outside of this State; and\n(ii)\nsuch incorporation is\npursuant to a contract. Example: A contractor purchases a quantity of lumber in New York\n\nState to use for a construction contract in Vermont. At the time the contractor\npurchases the lumber and accepts delivery in New York State he is liable for\nsales tax. To the extent the lumber is incorporated into real property in\n\nVermont, a refund or credit of the sales tax paid by the contractor on such\nlumber is allowable. (iii)\n\nIf the tangible personal property is moved from New York County A to County B, and it meets the conditions outlined in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph, any County A local tax paid on the tangible personal property may be\nclaimed by the contractor as a refund or credit. However, any local\ncompensating use tax imposed by County B is due on the material. (c) Property\npurchased in bulk and reshipped. (1)\nA\nrefund or credit is allowable for tangible personal property, or any portion\nthereof: (i) which is purchased in\nbulk; (ii)\nwhich is stored and not\nused by the purchaser or a user in New York State; (iii)\nwhich is later reshipped by such\npurchaser or user outside of New York State for use outside New York State; and\n(iv)\nprovided the property is\nreshipped as required within three years after the date the tax was payable to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance and that application is made within\nthree years from the date the tax was payable to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (2)\n(i) For the purpose of this subdivision only, the phrase\npurchased in bulk\nmeans a single purchase from a\nsingle vendor of items of the same kind of tangible personal property, of such\nquantity that it would require storage of some part for future use. (ii)\n\nFor the purpose of this subdivision, the\nphrase\nstored and not used\nmeans the placement of property in\nstorage for later withdrawal for shipment outside of the State or use outside\nof the State. (3)\n\nThe\npurchaser of tangible personal property who has paid sales or use tax thereon, and who placed such property in storage to await reshipment outside of the\n\nState for use outside of the State, is allowed a refund or credit of the tax\npaid on the portion of the property so reshipped and used. If the tangible\npersonal property is stored in a locality that imposes a local sales tax and it\nis later shipped to another point in New York State for use, the purchaser is\nentitled to a refund or credit of the local tax, in the same manner as outlined\nin this subdivision for the statewide sales tax. However, if the tangible\npersonal property is used by the purchaser or used in a New York State locality\nimposing sales tax on the receipts from the sale of tangible personal property, a tax for that locality is due. Cross-reference: Compensating Use Tax, see Part 531 of this\n\nSubchapter. Example 1: A multi-location firm purchases a truckload of office forms\nand stationery and stores it in a New York State warehouse. Applicable State\nand local sales tax is paid by the purchaser. A portion of the forms and\nstationery is later shipped to several of the firm's locations outside of New\n\nYork State. A credit or refund is allowable for the tax paid on that portion of\nthe forms and stationery shipped outside of New York State for use outside of\n\nNew York State. Example 2: A corporation purchases 150 desks from vendor A, and 60\ntypewriters from vendor B, and accepts delivery of all of these items in New\n\nYork State. Applicable sales tax is paid by the purchaser. It stores the items\nin its warehouse, then ships 100 desks and 50 typewriters to a new office\nlocated out-of-state for use there. The balance of the desks and typewriters\nare used in New York locations. The corporation is entitled to a refund or\ncredit of tax paid on 100 desks and 50 typewriters after shipment outside the\n\nState. (d) Property used in pre-existing lump sum or unit price construction\ncontracts. (1)\n\nThe phrase\npre-existing lump sum or unit price construction contract\nas\nused in this subdivision means a contract for the construction of improvements\nto real property under which the amount payable to the contractor or\nsubcontractor is fixed without regard to costs incurred by him in the\nperformance thereof, and which: (i) was\nirrevocably entered into prior to the date of the enactment of article 28 of\nthe Tax Law or the enactment of a law increasing the rate of tax imposed under\narticle 28 of the Tax Law or the imposition of a tax or an increased rate\nauthorized by article 29 of the Tax Law; or\n(ii)\nresulted from the acceptance by a\ngovernmental agency of a bid accompanied by a bond or other performance\nguaranty which was irrevocably submitted prior to the date of enactment of a\nlaw imposing a tax or increasing the rate of tax imposed under article 28 or\nauthorized by article 29 of the Tax Law. (2)\n(i) A\ncontractor or subcontractor who has paid sales tax on the purchase of tangible\npersonal property used solely in the performance of a pre-existing lump sum or\nunit price construction contract may claim a refund or credit which will be\nallowable within the following limitations: (a) the refund or credit is limited to any\ntax paid by the contractor or subcontractor which exceeds the tax which would\nhave been due at the time the contract was entered into or the bid submitted\nhad not article 28 been enacted or a tax authorized by article 29 been\nimposed; (b) where a tax rate, State or local, is increased by the enactment of a law, local law, ordinance or\nresolution the refund or credit is limited to any tax paid by the contractor or\nsubcontractor resulting from the increase in the tax rate, provided the statute\nincreasing the tax rate was enacted after the contract was entered into or the\nbid submitted; or\n(c) to qualify\nfor a credit or refund, the tangible personal property must be used in a\ncontract as described above within three years after the date the tax was\npayable to the Department of Taxation and Finance, and application for the\ncredit or refund must be filed within three years after the date the tax was\npayable to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (ii)\n\nTangible personal property eligible for\na credit or refund because it was used solely in the performance of a\npre-existing lump sum or unit price contract is not limited to materials\nincorporated into the project, supplies consumed in construction and equipment\nrentals are also included as long as their sole use involved the eligible\ncontract. Taxes on telephone, electric, and other services are not\neligible for a credit or refund under this subdivision, therefore, the rate in\neffect at the time of purchase is due without a right to a refund or credit of\ntax paid. Example: On March 1, 1972 a contractor irrevocably enters into a\nlump sum contract. On July 1, 1972 the locality in which the construction site\nis located enacts a tax effective September 1, 1972. After September 1, 1972\nthe contractor pays the increased rate of tax on his purchases of materials, rentals of equipment, storage of material, and electricity. The contractor is\neligible for a refund of the increase in tax on the purchase of materials and\nthe rental of equipment; but not the increased tax on the storage charge or the\nelectric service. (e) Property, the use of which is\nrestricted to fabricating, processing, printing, or imprinting. (1)\nA purchaser who has paid the tax on the\ntangible personal property may claim a refund or credit for such tax provided: (i) the use of the tangible personal property\nin New York is restricted to fabricating such property (including the\nincorporation of it into or assembling it with other tangible personal\nproperty), processing, printing, or imprinting such property; (ii)\nsuch property is then shipped to a point\noutside New York State for use outside the State; and\n(iii)\nsuch property is so used within three\nyears from the date the tax was payable to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, and application for the credit or refund is filed within three years\nafter the date the tax was payable to the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (2)\n\nThe\nfabricator, assembler, processor, printer, or imprinter may be either the\npurchaser or a user distinct from the purchaser. Example 1: An Ohio corporation purchases a special paper and ink for\nits corporate checks from a New York State vendor. The New York State vendor\ndelivers the paper and ink to a New York State printer who will print the\nchecks. When the paper and ink is delivered to the New York State printer the\n\nOhio corporation is deemed to have taken delivery of the property in New York\n\nState and is liable for the sales tax on the paper and ink. When the checks are\nshipped by the printer to Ohio, a refund or credit for the tax paid on the\npaper and ink will be allowable. Example 2: A multi-location firm purchases equipment and has it\ndelivered to its New York State location. In New York State the firm's\nemployees assemble the equipment and ship the finished product to New Jersey\nfor installation. As delivery of the equipment occurs in New York State, the\nfirm is liable for New York State sales tax. When the finished product is\nshipped to New Jersey, a refund or credit for the tax paid will be allowable\neven though the purchaser of the tangible personal property in this instance is\nboth the assembler and ultimate user. Example 3: A company purchases 20,000 advertising circulars which are\ndelivered by the printer to a firm in New York State that will address and mail\nthem. The printer charges and collects the New York State sales tax. A refund\nor credit will be allowed on that portion of the circulars which are mailed to\naddresses outside of New York State. Cross-reference: Also see Administrative Provisions, section\n534.2\nof this Part for the method of applying for a refund or\ncredit. (f) Drugs or medicine used by veterinarians in rendering certain services to\nlivestock and poultry used in production, or sold to farmers for such\nuse. A veterinarian may apply for a credit or refund of sales\ntax paid on his purchase of drugs and medicines: (1)\nused in the practice of veterinary\nmedicine on livestock or poultry, exempt pursuant to section\n1115 (f)\nof the Tax Law, used in the production of tangible personal property for sale, by\nfarming; (2)\nsold to a person\nentitled to the farming exemption provided by section\n1115 (a)(6)\nof the Tax Law\nfor his use on livestock or poultry used in the production of tangible personal\nproperty for sale, by farming; or\n(3)\nprovided the drugs and medicine are used\nby the veterinarian as described above within three years after the date such\ntax was payable to the Department of Taxation and Finance and that an\napplication for a credit or refund is filed within three years after the date\nsuch tax was payable to the Department of Taxation and Finance. Cross-reference: Veterinarian and practice of veterinary medicine, see\nsection\n528.24\nof this Title. Farming, see section\n528.7\nof this Title. Example 1: A veterinarian treats several cows in a dairy herd for\nmastitis. The veterinarian may apply for a credit or refund of the sales tax\npaid at the time of purchase on the drugs and medicine he uses to treat the\naffected cows. Additionally, he may claim a credit or refund of sales tax paid\non drugs or medicine he sells the farmer to treat the herd. Example 2: A veterinarian treats an injured racehorse and sells the\ntrainer drugs and medicine to continue treatment. Since the racehorse is not\nused in the production of tangible personal property for sale, by farming, the\nveterinarian may not file a claim for credit or refund of the tax paid on such\ndrugs and medicine since a refund or credit is not allowable. Example 3: A veterinarian renders veterinary services to puppies\nraised for resale by a kennel. The puppies, although held for resale, are not\nlivestock or poultry and, therefore, the veterinarian may not file a claim for\na credit or refund of tax paid on such drugs and medicine used in conjunction\nwith the services since a refund or credit is not allowable. Example 4: An operator of a fur farm purchases drugs and medicine from\na veterinarian to treat animals he is raising for fur. Although the operator is\nengaged in farming, fur bearing animals are not livestock or poultry. Therefore, the veterinarian may not file a claim for a credit or refund of tax\npaid on his purchase of the drugs and medicine since a refund or credit is not\nallowable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
