A nonresident student is one who has resided in the State\nfor a period of at least one year but has resided outside of the sponsorship\narea during a portion or all of the six months preceding the date of the\napplication for a certificate of residence. Nonresident students may\nalso be referred to as \"out-of-county students\" or \"out-of-sponsorship area\nstudents.\"\nFor tuition purposes, out-of-state students shall be\ntreated in a manner consistent with these regulations and approved by the State\n\nUniversity Board of Trustees. (b) All instructional programs, including off\nsite campus locations (high schools, malls, etc.) supported by State aid shall\nbe entitled to chargeback payment by the county of residence of nonresident\nstudents. (c) Within 30 days after\nthe commencement of each college term, each nonresident student shall submit to\nthe college a valid certificate of residence, unless a valid certificate is\nalready on file. Such certificate must have been issued no earlier than two\nmonths prior to the student's registration; is valid for one year from the date\nof issuance; and is applicable for all terms or programs commenced within that\n12-month period. (d) Within 45 days\nafter the commencement of each college term or program, the president of the\ncollege or designee shall submit to the chief fiscal officer of each county a\nlist of nonresident students attending the college on the basis of a\ncertificate of residence and a voucher for the amount payable by each county\nfor these students. The billing of the county of residence for each nonresident\nstudent attending a community college shall be determined on the basis of the\nfractional full-time equivalent student load that each student is enrolled in\nas of the census date (as defined by the student data file manual). (e) The operating chargeback rate per\nfull-time equivalent student shall be an amount equal to the community college\nsponsor's actual contributions, including appropriated fund balance for the\nsupport of a full-time equivalent student attending the community college from\nthe sponsorship area as determined in the college operating budget request\napproved by the State University Trustees, rounded downward to the nearest\nmultiple of $10. Such operating chargeback rate and calculated adjustment\nthereto, shall be determined as follows: (1)\nsubtract from the approved total operating budget, the budgeted offsetting\nrevenues including Federal aid, other operating expenses not allowable for\n\nState aid, budgeted student revenues and budgeted State operating\naid; (2)\ndivide the result of\nparagraph (1) by the budgeted number of fulltime equivalent students; (3)\nadjust the result of paragraph (2) by 100\npercent of the difference between budgeted and actual operating cost per\nfull-time equivalent student for the most recent fiscal year for which an\nannual financial report is available; (f) On or before March 31, 1995, and every\nyear thereafter, the State University shall, subject to the availability of\nappropriations therefor, reimburse each county which has issued a certificate\nof residence for any non-resident student in attendance at the Fashion\n\nInstitute of Technology during the 1993-94 academic year and every year\nthereafter in an amount equal to 50 percent of the actual amount paid by each\nsuch county on behalf of such students, upon certification of such payment by\nthe Fashion Institute of Technology, and on or before June 1, 1995, and every\nyear thereafter, the State University shall, subject to the availability of\nappropriations therefor, reimburse each county for the remaining 50 percent of\nthe actual amount paid by each such county on behalf of such students, upon\ncertification of such payment by the Fashion Institute of Technology. (g) Procedures for certificate of residence\nissuance. (1)\n\nThe chief fiscal officer of\neach county, as defined in section\n2.00\nof the\nlocal finance law, shall, upon application and submission to such chief fiscal\nofficer of satisfactory evidence in-person or electronically, issue to any\nperson desiring to enroll in a community college as a non-sponsorship-area\nstudent, a certificate of residence form showing that said person is a resident\nof said county. The Chancellor or designee may issue policy or guidance\nregarding residency determinations on topics including but not limited to what\nshall constitute satisfactory evidence of residency. For incarcerated students, the official last known address prior to incarceration as provided by the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and Community Supervision shall be considered\ndispositive evidence of a student's county of domicile prior to\nincarceration. (2)\n\nFor purposes of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, electronic submission shall include at least\none online-only method, including but not limited to an online-only form, portal or email submission. Counties shall accept application forms submitted\nby mail in addition to electronic submission. While in-person application shall\ncontinue to be provided as an option to students, an in- person appearance\nshall not be required. (3)\n\nThe\n\nChancellor or designee, in consultation with the chancellor of the city\nuniversity of New York, shall publish a standard application form, which shall\nbe required to be accepted by the chief fiscal officer of each county. Certificate of Residence application forms shall not require that students\nprovide a social security number and shall not require notarization. (4)\n\nCommunity colleges shall take the\nfollowing steps to ensure that out-of-sponsorship-area students are aware of\nprocedures necessary to procure a certificate of residence in order to avoid\nadditional tuition charges: (A)\nmake a good\nfaith effort to inform students of the requirement consistent with campus\ncommunication and consent policies, including but not limited to multiple\ncontacts by email and/or text messages to all appropriate email addresses and\nmobile phone numbers on file for the student explaining the certificate of\nresidence deadline, procedure to apply, and the amount of the additional\ntuition charged if a certificate of residence is not received; and\n(B)\nsend a list of names and contact\ninformation of non-sponsorship area students who have not submitted a valid\ncertificate of residence by fifteen (15) days prior to the due date to the\n\nChancellor or designee so that SUNY System Administration staff may make\nadditional attempts to notify such students. Failure to take such actions shall\nbe grounds for the student to appeal to the Chancellor or designee pursuant to\nthe procedures set forth in subdivision 3 of section\n6305\nof the\neducation law; if the college cannot document compliance with the requirements\nof this paragraph, the college will be directed to remove the nonresident\ncharges from the student's account. Community colleges may apply to the\n\nChancellor or designee for an exemption from subparagraph (B) above upon good\ncause shown. (5)\n\nEach\ncommunity college website shall feature resources related to the certificate of\nresidence including, but not limited to, links to county resources provided to\nattain a required certificate of residence; appeal information; and campus\ncontacts who can assist with application questions. The Chancellor or designee\nshall provide model language for colleges to use. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
