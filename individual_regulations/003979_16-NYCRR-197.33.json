  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.33 - Transactions with the municipality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order that the books of the municipal\nelectric utility may show accurately the results of electric operations, each\nmunicipal electric utility shall credit the appropriate account with the cost\nof property, services, materials, supplies, use of space or equipment, etc., furnished to the operating municipality or any department thereof. (See also\naccount 280, Contributions--Operating Municipality, and §§\n197.24, subd. [f], 197.26, subd. [c].)\n(b) Similarly, the accounts\nfor electric operations shall include the cost of all items applicable thereto, including expenses of the municipal electric utility paid out of funds of the\noperating or lessor municipality, and services, materials, water supply, supplies, use of space or equipment, paving, inspection service, etc., furnished by the operating or lessor municipality or any department thereof. (See also account 280, Contributions--Operating Municipality.)\n(c) The offsetting credit or debit for the\ntransactions covered in subdivisions (a) and (b) hereof shall be to account\n280, Contributions-- Operating Municipality, which may show either a credit or\na debit balance. (d) These\nprovisions are intended to make possible an accurate determination of the\nresults of operations of the municipal electric utility by the inclusion in the\noperating accounts of all applicable items whether or not they are represented\nby actual payments. Thus, if an office of a municipal electric utility is\nlocated in a general municipal building and if no rent is paid to the operating\nmunicipality for such space, the appropriate account for such rent shall be\ndebited with an equitable amount and the offsetting credit shall be to account\n280, Contributions--Operating Municipality. If a general municipal officer or\nemployee collects accounts receivable for electricity and the municipal\nelectric utility does not pay from its funds any part of his salary and\nexpenses, an equitable portion of his pay and expenses shall be charged to the\nappropriate electric operating expense account and the offsetting credit shall\nbe to account 280, Contributions--Operating Municipality. In like manner, if\nthe municipal electric utility furnishes any service such as street lighting, power for pumping water, etc., for which no payment is received from the\noperating municipality, the cost to the plant of such service shall be\naccounted for as provided in subdivision (a) hereof and sections 197.24 and\n197.26, and charged to account\n280, Contributions-- Operating Municipality. If payments for items enumerated\nin subdivisions (a) and (b) consist of a nominal amount, the difference between\nthe cost of the service rendered and the amount paid therefor by the\nmunicipality shall be accounted for in like manner. (e) As of the effective date of this system\nof accounts, there shall be determined through an analysis of all transactions\nfrom the date of the first expenditure for the municipal electric utility, the\namount representing the net balance which would result if the transactions\ncovered in this instruction and in account 280, Contributions--Operating\n\nMunicipality, had been treated as provided herein. This net balance shall be\nplaced on the books as a credit or a debit (as the case may be) to account 280, Contributions--Operating Municipality, and a copy of the journal entries\nshowing detail and source of the information shall be filed with the commission\nnot later than one year after the effective date of this system of\naccounts.
