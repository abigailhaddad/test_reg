  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-2.30 - Residential health care facilities patient assessment for certified rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of determining reimbursement rates effective January 1, 1986 and thereafter, for governmental payments, each residential health care facility shall, on an annual basis or more often as determined by the department pursuant to this Subpart, assess all patients to determine case mix intensity using the patient review criteria and standards promulgated and published by the department (patient review instrument [PRI] and instructions: patient review instrument) and specified in subdivision (i) of this section. (b) (1)\n\nThe patient review form (PRI) shall be submitted according to a written schedule determined by the department. Such written schedule shall be established by the Commissioner of Health with notice to residential health care facilities. Extension of the time for filing may be granted upon application received prior to the due date of the patient review forms and only in circumstances where the residential health care facility establishes, by documentary evidence, that the patient review forms cannot be submitted by the due date for reasons beyond the control of the facility. (2)\n\nRate schedules shall not be certified by the Commissioner of Health unless residential health care facilities are in full compliance with the requirements of this section. Compliance with the assessment requirements of this section shall include, but not be limited to, the timely filing of properly certified patient review forms (PRI) which are complete and accurate. Failure of a residential health care facility to file the patient review form (PRI) pursuant to the written schedule established pursuant to this subdivision, shall subject the residential health care facility to the provisions of section\n86-2.2\n(c) of this Subpart. (c) The operator of a residential health care facility shall ensure: (1)\nthat the patient review form (PRI) is completed for all patients of the facility pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section; (2)\nthat the patient review form (PRI) is completed by a registered professional nurse who is qualified by experience and demonstrated competency in long-term care and who has successfully completed a training program in patient case mix assessment approved by the department to train individuals in the completion of the patient review form (PRI) for the purposes of establishing a facility's case mix financial reimbursement; and\n(3)\nthat the patient review form (PRI) is certified by the operator and the nurse assessor responsible for completion of the patient review form (PRI). (The form of the certification required shall be as prescribed in the report form provided by the department.)\n(d) In order to maximize reliability and accuracy, a limited number of personnel for each residential health care facility may be responsible for completion of the patient review form (PRI) during each assessment period. The maximum number of personnel which may be responsible in each residential health care facility is as follows: Bed size of facility\n\nNumber of responsible assessors\n\nUnder 100\n\nTwo\n101 to 200\n\nThree\n201 to 300\n\nFour\n301 to 400\n\nFive\n401+\nFive plus one additional assessor for each additional 100 beds or part thereof. (e) (1)\n\nThe department shall monitor and review each residential health care facility's performance of its patient assessment function as described in this section through the following activities which may include, but shall not be limited to: (i) analysis of patient case mix profiles and statistical data; (ii)\nreview of information provided by the residential health care facility; and\n(iii)\non-site inspections. (2)\n\nThe purpose of the department's monitoring and review shall be to determine whether the residential health care facility is complying with the assessment requirements contained in this section. (3)\n\nThe patient review form (PRI) and any underlying books, records, and/or documentation which formed the basis for the completion of such form shall be subject to review by the department. (4)\n\nThe department shall acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the residential health care facilities patient review forms (PRI). In the event that any information or data that the facility has submitted is inaccurate or incorrect, the facility shall correct such information or data in the following manner: the facility shall submit to the department, within five days of receipt of the department's written acknowledgment provided for in this paragraph, such corrections on a form which meets the same certification requirements as the document being corrected. Once receipt of corrected data is acknowledged in writing by the department, a residential health care facility may not correct or amend the patient review form (PRI) or submit any additional information for the assessment period. (5)\n\nThe department, in order to ensure accuracy of the patient review form (PRI), may also conduct timely on-site observations and/or interviews of patients/residents and review of their medical records. When an additional on-site review is performed by the department as a result of controverted items found during the initial on-site review, the facility shall be afforded an on-site conference prior to the conclusion of such additional on-site review. Upon completion of a department on-site review pursuant to this subdivision, the department, in order to ensure accuracy of the patient review form (PRI), shall correct, where necessary, a residential health care facility's assessment of its patient case mix intensity. The department's on-site determination shall be considered final for purposes of assessing the residential health care facility's case mix intensity for that assessment period and notwithstanding section 186-2.14 of this Subpart, the residential health care facility may not correct or amend the patient review form (PRI) or submit any additional information after department reviewers have concluded the on-site review. The residential health care facility shall be notified in writing regarding the department determination of any controverted items. (f) (1)\n\nIf the department determines pursuant to this section, that a residential health care facility is not performing its case mix intensity assessment function in a timely and/or accurate manner, as required by subdivision (b) of this section, the department shall, in writing: (i) notify the residential health care facility; (ii)\nrequire the residential health care facility to perform its patient case mix assessment function through written agreement with a person or entity approved by the department for the completion of the patient review form (PRI) for the purpose of establishing a residential health care facilities case mix reimbursement; and\n(iii)\nany patient case mix assessment performed pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph shall also be subject to department monitoring and review pursuant to this section. (2)\n\nThe department shall determine that a residential health care facility is not performing its case mix intensity assessment function in an accurate manner where there exists inaccuracies in its case mix assessment which results in a statistically significant modification of the residential health care facility's reimbursement. (3)\n\nThe cost of written agreements required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be considered an allowable cost for determining reimbursement rates pursuant to this Subpart. (4)\n\nCertification. Operators of residential health care facilities completing the department's patient review form (PRI) through written agreement with a department approved nonresidential health care facility person or entity shall have such form certified by such person or entity in lieu of a residential health care facility registered professional nurse as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section. (g) Reconsiderations. (1)\n\nAny residential health care facility after one year from the date it has been notified in writing by the department that it must enter into a written agreement pursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section, may request, in writing, that the department rescind its withdrawal of the residential health care facility's patient case mix assessment function. (2)\n\nThe department shall not rescind its withdrawal of a residential health care facility's patient case mix assessment function unless the residential health care facility satisfies the department that the residential health care facility has the capability to comply with the requirements of the department's patient case mix assessment process which shall include the capability to accurately complete the patient review form (PRI). (3)\n\nThe department shall give written notice of its decision and shall, if negative, give a statement of the reasons for its refusal to rescind its withdrawal of the residential health care facility's patient case mix assessment function. (4)\n\nAny residential health care facility after six months from the date it receives a written department decision pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision, may again request in writing that the department rescind its withdrawal of the residential health care facility's patient case mix assessment function.

USING THESE INSTRUCTIONS: These instructions and the training manual should be read before completing the PRI. These instructions should be kept with the PRIs as they are being completed. FREQUENT REFERENCE TO THE INSTRUCTIONS WILL BE NEEDED TO COMPLETE THE PRI ACCURATELY. 2. ANSWER ALL QUESTIONS: Answer all questions using the numeric codes provided. DO NOT LEAVE ANY QUESTIONS TOTALLY BLANK. UNUSED BOXES FOR A QUESTION SHOULD REMAIN BLANK. For example, Medical Record Number should be entered: /9/6/2/1/0/. If there are unused boxes, they should be on the left side of the number as shown in the example. 3. QUALIFIERS: Many of the PRI questions contain multiple criteria which are labeled qualifiers. All qualifiers must be met for a question to be answered yes. These qualifiers take the following forms: * TIME PERIOD -The time period for the questions is the past four weeks, unless stated otherwise. For patients who have been in the facility less than four weeks (that is, new admissions or readmissions), use the time for admission to PRI completion as the time frame. * FREQUENCY -The frequency specifies how often something needs to occur to meet the qualifier. For example, respiratory care needs to occur daily for four weeks or the PRI cannot be checked for this patient as receiving this care. * DOCUMENTATION -Some of the questions require specific medical record documentation to be present. Otherwise, the question cannot be answered \"yes\" for the patient. * EXCLUSIONS- Some of the questions specifically state to omit certain types of care or behavior when answering the question. For example, inhalators are excluded from respiratory care. 4. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING: The approach to measuring ADLs is slightly different from the other PRI questions. Measure the ADLs according to how the activity was completed 60 percent or more of the time during the past four weeks. Read the specific instructions for ADLs to understand the CHANGED CONDITION RULE and other details. PERFORMANCE: Measure what the patient does, rather than what the patient might be capable of doing. 5. CORRECTIONS: Cross out any responses which you wish to change and reenter clearly to the right of the original response. Example: /3/4. 6. Use pen, not pencil. INSTRUCTIONS: PRI QUESTIONS\nI. ADMINISTRATIVE DATA\n1. OPERATING CERTIFICATE NUMBER: Enter the 8 character identifier (7 numbers followed by the letter \"N\") stated on the facility's operating certificate. The last character \"N\" indicates Nursing Facility. 2. SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER: Your PRIs cannot be processed unless this question is accurately entered. Do not leave this question blank, do not enter zero if there is no social security number. Only use the Social Security number that has been specifically designated for the patient and not the spouse of the patient. Only use the number that has been assigned by the federal Social Security Administration. If there is no such number for a patient, a NEW SYSTEM has been developed to enable all facilities in the State to assign a unique ID number to those patients without a Social Security number. If a patient was assigned a computer generated number by the Department, that number should no longer be used. If the patient has no Social Security number, use this method: Enter the first three (3) letters of the patient's last name (starting to the far left), and then enter the six digits of the patient's date of birth. Omit the century in the birthdate, which will be either a \"19\" or \"18\" as in 1930 or 1896. As an example, if a patient named Cheryl Brant has no social security number and was born on May 8, 1913, you would enter: /B/R/A/0/5/0/8/1/3 on the PRI. 3. RESIDENT IS LOCATED: Former HRF Area or Former SNF Area. This question has been revised to reflect the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 (OBRA '87). It is imperative that nursing facilities formerly deemed \"dual level\" complete this section properly. 4. PATIENT NAME: Enter the patient's name, last name first, in the boxes provided. Enter up to the first 10 letters of the patient's last name. 6. MEDICAL RECORD NUMBER: Enter the unique number assigned by the facility to identify each patient. It is not the Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security number unless that is the number used by the facility to identify each of its patients. 7. ROOM NUMBER: Enter the numbers and/or letters which identify the patient's room in the facility. 8. UNIT NUMBER: Enter the one or the two digit number (01-12) assigned by your facility to each nursing unit for the purpose of this data collection. 11. DATE OF INITIAL ADMISSION: Enter the month, day and year the patient (1) entered the present nursing facility. Use the date of the patient's first admission and not the most recent. If the patient were transferred from another facility, it would be an initial admission to your facility. As another example, consider a patient that was admitted to a hospital from your facility and subsequently loses bed hold. If this patient is eventually readmitted to your facility at the original level of care, use the original admission date to complete this item. 12. MEDICAID NUMBER: Enter these numbers if patient has the coverage available, whether\n13. MEDICARE NUMBER: or not the coverage is being used. If not, enter only one zero in the far right box. 14. PRIMARY PAYOR: Enter the one source of coverage which pays for most of the patient's current nursing home stay. Code \"Other\" only if the primary payor is not Medicaid or Medicare. (Do not code \"Other\" for a patient with Medicaid coverage supplemented by Medicare Part B Code Medicaid.) Medicaid pending is to be coded as \"Medicaid\", if there is no other primary coverage being used for the patient's present stay. 15A. REASON FOR PRI COMPLETION: Select the one reason why the PRI is being completed. Responses 3, 4, and 5 under Utilization Review have been eliminated. REIMBURSEMENT ASSESSMENT CYCLE: Indicate whether this assessment is being completed as a part of a full facility assessment or as part of a quality assessment cycle for new admissions only. 1. Biannual Full Facility Cycle-The data collection during which all the patients residing in the facility are assessed. These PRI assessments include patients who were assessed during your previous PRI data collection and any new admissions. 2. Quarterly New Admission Cycle-The \"new admission only data collection,\" involving only patients who were not assessed at their present level of care during your previous full facility data collection are reviewed. This specific PRI data collection occurs three months after your full facility PRI data collection. A new admission may be a new patient from the hospital, community or another nursing facility; or was hospitalized during your previous full facility assessment (regardless of bedhold). 15B. WAS A PRI SUBMITTED BY YOUR FACILITY FOR THIS PATIENT DURING A PREVIOUS FULL FACILITY AND/OR NEW ADMIT CYCLE: Review your facility's records to determine whether a PRI for reimbursement purposes was ever completed for this patient. II. MEDICAL EVENTS\n16. DECUBITUS LEVEL: Enter the level of skin breakdown (located at pressure points) using the qualifiers stated below: Documentation -\nFor a patient to be cited as level 4, documentation by a licensed clinician must exist which describes the following three components: * A description of the patient's decubitus. * Circumstance or medical condition which led to the decubitus. * An active treatment plan. Definition\nLEVELS: #0 No reddened skin or breakdown. #1 Reddened skin, potential breakdown. #2 Blushed skin, dusty colored, superficial layer of broken or blistered skin. #3 Subcutaneous skin is broken down. #4 Necrotic breakdown of skin and subcutaneous tissue which may involve muscle, fascia and bone. #5 Patient is at level 4, but the documentation qualifier has not been met. 17. MEDICAL CONDITIONS: For a \"YES\" to be answered for any of these conditions, all of the following qualifiers must be met: Time Period -\nCondition must have existed during the past four weeks. (The only exception is to use the past twelve weeks for question 17H, urinary tract infection.)\n\nDocumentation -\nWritten support exists that the patient has the condition.

BOWEL AND/OR BLADDER REHABILITATION: The goal of this treatment to gain or regain optimal bowel and/or bladder function and to reestablish a pattern. It is much more than just a toileting schedule or a maintenance/conditioning program. Rather it is an intense treatment which is very specific and unique for each patient and is of short term duration (\ni.e., usually not longer than six weeks). NOT all patients at level 5 under Toileting Q. 22 may be a \"YES\" with this question. The specific definition for bladder rehabilitation differs from bowel rehabilitation; refer below: Very specific and unique for each patient\n\nMaintenance toileting schedule Restorative toileting program but does not meet the treatment requirements specified in the definitions\n\nBladder rehabilitation: Will generally include these step-by-step procedures which are closely monitored, evaluated and documented: (1) mental and physical assessment of the patient to determine training capacity; (2) a 24 hour flow sheet or chart documenting voiding progress; (3) possibly increased fluid intake during the daytime; (4) careful attention to skin care; (5) prevention of constipation; (6) in the beginning may be toileted 8 to 12 times per day with decreased frequency with progress. Bowel rehabilitation: A program to prevent chronic constipation/impaction. The plan will generally include: (1) assessment of past bowel movements, relevant medical problems, medication use; (2) a dietary regimen of increased fluids and bulk (\ne.g., bran, fruits); (3) regular toileting for purposes of bowel evacuation; (4) use of glycerine suppositories or laxatives; (5) documentation on a worksheet or Kardex. Exclude a bowel maintenance program which controls bowel intinence by development of a routine bowel schedule\n18L. CATHETER: During the past twelve weeks, an indwelling or external catheter has been needed. Indwelling catheter has been used for any duration during the past twelve weeks. The external catheter was used on a continuous basis (with proper removal and replacement during this period) for one or more days during the past twelve weeks. A physician order is required for an indwelling catheter; for an external catheter a physician order is not required. Exclude catheters used to empty the bladder once, secure a specimen or instill medication\n18M. PHYSICAL RESTRAINTS: A physical device used to restrict resident movement. Physical restraints include belts, vests, cuffs, mitts, jackets, harnesses and geriatric chairs. At least two continuous daytime hours for at least 14 days during the past four weeks. Exclude all of following: \" Medication use for the sole purpose of modifying residents behavior\n\" Application only at night\n\" Application for less than two continuous daytime hours for 14 days\n\" Devices which residents can release/ remove such as, velcro seatbelts on wheelchairs\n\" Residents who are bed bound\n\" Side rails, locked doors/ gates, domes\n\nTo Qualify as \"YES\" on the PRI the following qualifiers must be met: 1. The restraint must have been applied for at least two continuous daytime hours for at least 14 days during the past four weeks. Daytime includes the time from when the resident gets up in the morning to when the resident goes to bed at night. 2. An assessment of need for the physical restraint must be written by an M.D. or R.N. 3. The comprehensive care plan based on the assessment must include a written physician's order and specific nursing interventions regarding use of the physical restraint. NEW ADMISSIONS: If a patient is a new admission and will require the use of a physical restraint for at least two continuous daytime hours for at least 14 days as specified by the physician order, then enter \"YES\" on the PRI. III. ACTIVITIES OF DAILY LIVING: EATING, MOBILITY, TRANSFER, TOILETING\nUse the following qualifiers in answering each ADL question: Time Period -\nPast four weeks. Frequency -\nAssess how the patient completed each ADL 60 percent or more of the time performed (since ADL status may fluctuate during the day or over the past four weeks). CHANGED CONDITION RULE: When a patient's ADL has improved or deteriorated during the past four weeks and this course is unlikely to change, measure the ADL according to its status during the past seven days. Definitions -\nSUPERVISION means verbal encouragement and observation, not physical hands- on care. ASSISTANCE means physical hands-on care. INTERMITTENT means that a staff person does not have to be present during the entire activity, nor does the help have to be on a one-to-one basis. CONSTANT means one-to-one care that requires a staff person to be present during the entire activity. If the staff person is not present, the patient will not complete the activity. Note how these terms are used together in the ADLs. For example, there is intermittent supervision and intermittent assistance. CLARIFICATION OF ADL RESPONSES\n19. EATING: #3 \"Requires continual help...\" means that the patient requires a staff person's continual presence and help for reasons such as: patient tends to choke, has a swallowing problem, is learning to feed self, or is quite confused and forgets to eat. #5 \"Tube or parenteral feeding...\" means that all food and drink is given by nursing staff through the means specified. 20. MOBILITY: #3 \"Walks with constant supervision and/or assistance...\" may be required if the patient cannot maintain balance, has a history of falls, has stress fracture potential, or is relearning to ambulate. 21. TRANSFER: Exclude transfers to bath or toilet. #4 \"Requires two people...\" may be required for reasons such as: the patient is obese, has contractures, has fractures (or stress fracture potential), has attached equipment that makes transfer difficult (for example, tubes). There must be a logical medical reason why the patient needs the help of two people to transfer. #5 \"Bedfast...\" may refer to a patient with acute dehydration, severe decubitus, or terminal illness. 22. TOILETING: Definition - INCONTINENT - 60 percent or more of the time the patient loses control of his/her bladder or bowel functions, with or without equipment. #1 \"Continent.... Requires no or intermittent supervision\" and #2 \"... and/or assistance\" can refer to the continent patient or the incontinent patient who needs no/little help with his/her toileting equipment (for example, catheter). #3 \"Continent... Requires constant supervision/total assistance...\" refers to a patient who may not be able to balance him/herself and transfer, has contractures, has a fracture, is confused or is on a rehabilitation program. In addition this level refers to the patient who needs constant help with elimination/incontinence appliances (for example, colostomy, ileostomy). #4 \"Incontinent... Does not use a bathroom\" refers to the patient who does not go to a toilet room, but instead may use a bedpan or continence pads. This patient may be bed bound or mentally confused to the extent that a scheduled toileting program is not beneficial. #5 \"Incontinent... Taken to a Bathroom...\" refers to a patient who is on a formal toileting schedule, as documented in the medical record. This patient may be on a formal bowel and bladder rehabilitation program to regain or maintain control, or the toileting pattern is known and it is better psychologically and physically for the patient to be taken to the toilet (for example, to prevent decubiti). A patient may have different levels of toileting capacity for bowel and bladder function. To determine the level of such a patient, note that level four and five refer to incontinence of either bladder or bowel. Thus if a patient receives the type of care described in one of these levels for either type of incontinence, enter that level. Example 1: A patient needs constant assistance with a catheter (level 3) and is incontinent of bowel and is taken to the bathroom every four hours (level 5). In this instance, enter level 5 on the PRI because he is receiving the type of care described in this question for bowel incontinence. Example 2: The patient requires intermittent supervision for bowel function (level 2) and is taken to the toilet every two hours as part of a bladder rehabilitation program. Enter level 5, as the patient is receiving this type of care for bladder incontinence. IV. BEHAVIORS - VERBAL DISRUPTION; PHYSICAL AGGRESSION; DISRUPTIVE, INFANTILE/SOCIALLY INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR; AND HALLUCINATIONS\nThe following qualifiers must be met: Time Period -\nPast four weeks. Frequency -\nAs stated in the responses to each behavioral question. Documentation -\nTo qualify a patient as LEVEL 4 or to qualify the patient as a \"YES\" to HALLUCINATIONS, the following conditions must be met: * Active treatment plan for the behavioral problem must be in current use. * Psychiatric assessment by a recognized professional with psychiatric training/ education must exist to support the fact that the patient has a severe behavioral problem. The problem addressed by this assessment must still be exhibited by the patient. Definitions -\nThe terms used on the PRI should be interpreted only as they are defined below: * PATIENT'S BEHAVIOR: Measure it as displayed with the behavior modification and treatment plan in effect during the past four weeks. * DISRUPTION: Through verbal outbursts and/or physical actions, the patient interferes with the staff and/or other patients. This interference causes the staff to stop or change what they are doing immediately to control the situation. Without this staff assistance, the disruption would persist or a problem would occur. * NONDISRUPTION: Verbal outbursts and/or physical actions by the patient may be irritating, but do not create a need for immediate action by the staff. * UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR: The staff cannot predict when (that is, under what circumstances) the patient will exhibit the behavioral problem. There is no evident pattern. * PREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR: Based on observations and experiences with the patient, the staff can discern when a patient will exhibit a behavioral problem and can plan appropriate responses in advance. The behavioral problem may occur during activities of daily living (for example, bathing), specific treatments (for example, contracture care, ambulation exercises), or when criticized, bumped into, etc. CLARIFICATION OF RESPONSES TO BEHAVIORAL QUESTIONS\n23. VERBAL DISRUPTION: Exclude verbal outbursts/expressions/utterances which do not create disruption as defined by the PRI. 24. PHYSICAL AGGRESSION: Note that the definition states \"with intent for injury.\"\n25.

V. SPECIALIZED SERVICES\n27. PHYSICAL AND OCCUPATIONAL THERAPIES: * For each therapy these three types of information will be entered on the PRI; \"Level\", \"Days\" and \"Time\" (hours and minutes). * For a patient not receiving a therapy at all, the \"Level\" will always be entered in the answer key as #1 (\"does not receive\"), the \"Days\" will be entered 0 (zero) and the \"Time\" will be 0 (zero). * Use the chart on this page to understand the qualifiers for each of the three types of information that will be entered. Whether a patient is receiving maintenance or restorative therapy will make a difference in terms of the qualifiers to be used.
