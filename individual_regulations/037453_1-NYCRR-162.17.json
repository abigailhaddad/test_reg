The berries are firm, firmly attached to capstems, and are not\nsplit, shattered, crushed, dried or wet, and are free from decay, mold, mildew, berry moth, russeting and hail, and free from damage caused by freezing, disease, insects or other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nMature means that the grapes are juicy, palatable and have reached that stage of development at which the skin or the\nberry easily separates from the pulp. Frozen or slightly frosted stock is not\nto be confused with mature stock. (2)\n\nFirm means that the berry is reasonably\nturgid and does not yield more than slightly to moderate pressure. (3)\n\nWell colored means that the berries show\nfull color characteristics of the variety. (4)\n\nShattered means that the berry is\nseparated from the bunch and may or may not have the capstem\nattached. (5)\n\nCompact means that\nthe bunches are well filled and have no open spaces. (6)\n\nFairly compact means that the bunches are\nwell filled but that the berries are not closely spaced as in compact\nbunches. (7)\n\nDamage means any\nspecific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable\nvariation of this defect, any other defect, or any combination of defects which\nmaterially detracts from the appearance or the edible or shipping quality or\nthe individual berry or the bunch as a whole. The following specific defects\nshall be considered as damage: (i) Mildew. When detracting from the appearance of the individual berry or the bunch as a\nwhole. Berries on the inside of the bunch which show only slight traces of\nmildew are not considered damaged. (ii)\n\nSpray residue. When the residue is heavy\nenough to more than slightly detract from the appearance of the\nbunch. (8)\n\nSerious\ndamage means any defect or combination of defects, which seriously detracts\nfrom the appearance or edible or shipping quality of the individual berry or\nthe bunch as a whole. The following specific defect shall be considered as\nserious damage: (i) Spray residue. When the\nresidue is heavy enough to more than moderately detract from the appearance of\nthe bunch.

(c) Size. (1)\n\nNot less than 90 percent, by count, or\nthe berries, exclusive of dried berries, on each bunch shall have a minimum\ndiameter of 9/16 of an inch, unless otherwise specified. (2)\n\nAt least 50 percent of the bunches in the\ncontainers are compact. They are not excessively small, except that compact\nportions of bunches consisting of not less than 10 berries may be used to fill\nopen spaces between whole bunches. (d) Tolerances. In order to allow for\nvariations incident to proper grading and handling, the following tolerances by\nweight are permitted: (1)\nfive percent for\nbunches in any lot which are straggly; (2)\nten percent for bunches in any lot which\nfail to meet the requirements for minimum diameter of berries; and\n(3)\nten percent for bunches and berries in\nany lot which fail to meet the remaining requirements of this grade, including\ntherein not more than 1/2 this amount, or five percent, for berries which are\nseriously damaged: provided, that included in this latter amount not more than\none percent may be permitted for berries affected by mold or decay, and not\nmore than one percent for dried berries, and not more than 1/2 of one percent\nfor berries affected by berry moth. (e) Application of tolerances. The contents\nof individual packages in the lot based on sample inspection, are subject to\nthe following limitations, provided that the averages for the entire lot are\nwithin the tolerances specified for the grade. (1)\n\nIndividual packages which contain more\nthan five pounds shall contain not more than 1 1/2 times a tolerance of 10\npercent or more and not more than double a specified tolerance of less than 10\npercent. (2)\n\nIndividual packages\nwhich contain five pounds or less shall contain not more than three times the\nspecified tolerance. (f) Packing. Grapes shall be packed in new one, two, four or eight quart\ncontainers, or any other new standard containers subject to the approval of the\n\nDepartment of Agriculture and Markets, which are properly marked to include: variety or varieties (when packed as mixed varieties), name and address of\ngrower, packer or shipper and volume. Container approval shall be based upon\nthe ability of the container to maintain the quality standards and integrity of\nthe product. (g) Markings.
