If the pre-hearing conference is conducted by telephone or video\nconference, the parties shall exchange evidence by e-mail, regular mail or any\nother manner convenient and mutually agreeable to the parties, as long as the\nmanner of exchange will not cause a delay in the hearing and is adequate to\nprotect the confidentiality of such evidence.

(e) The date for the\nhearing shall be scheduled at the pre-hearing conference. (f) The failure of the parties to appear at\nthe pre-hearing conference shall result in a default order, except upon a\nshowing of good cause. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
