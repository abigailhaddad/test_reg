This section contains the administrative procedures for\nthe program (DMAP). DMAP offer s an additional tool to a land/resource manager, or a group of land/resource managers, whose property is in need of site\nspecific deer management efforts, and who meet the eligibility criteria\nestablished herein. Through DMAP, the department may issue a permit and\nantlerless deer tags for use on lands owned and/or controlled by the permit\nholder. Deer taken under a DMAP permit are in addition to any deer an\nindividual may otherwise legally take. (b) General provisions. The provisions of this section shall apply to the taking\nof antlerless deer, as described in subdivision (e) of this section, by\nlongbow, crossbow, muzzleloader or firearm pursuant to a DMAP as provided by\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law (ECL) section 11-0903, subdivision 11. The\ngeneral provisions contained in articles 11 and 71 of the ECL, except as\notherwise noted herein, relating to hunting hours, the manner of taking, tagging, possession, transporting, reporting and other hunting regulations, shall apply to the hunting and taking of antlerless deer pursuant to this\nsection. (c) Open\nseason. DMAP permits and tags are valid during any open deer\nseason established in accordance with sections 11-0903 or 11-0907 of the\nECL. (d) License\nrequirements. No person shall hunt or take antlerless deer under the\nauthority of a DMAP permit unless they are licensed to hunt deer during the\nappropriate hunting season. (e) Legal harvest. Only wild deer without antlers or having antlers\nmeasuring less than three inches in length (''antlerless deer'') may be taken\nunder the authority of a DMAP permit. (f) Permit eligibility. To be eligible for a DMAP permit, the applicant(s) must\nmeet one of the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe applicant(s) owns or controls land(s)\nwhere agricultural deer damage has been documented or can be documented by the\ndepartment; or\n(2)\n\nThe applicant is\na municipality that has identified social or ecological problems due to deer\nwithin their municipal boundary. Participating properties within the\nmunicipality need not be contiguous, but the municipality must be the named\napplicant; or\n(3)\n\nThe applicant(s)\nowns or controls land(s) where deer damage to significant natural plant\ncommunities has been documented or can be documented by the department.

This\nnegative impact must be identified in an existing forest and/or land management\nplan for the property. Parcels of less than 100 acres may also be considered, if enrolled in the Real Property Tax Law Section 480a program. Two or more\nlandowners may cooperate to meet the acreage requirements; or\n(5)\n\nThe applicant(s) owns or controls at\nleast 1,000 acres of land contained in one or more parcels all sharing a\ncontiguous boundary and involved in custom deer management. Two or more\nlandowners may cooperate to meet the acreage requirements. A deer management\nplan specifically designed for the property must be submitted to and approved\nby the department. (6)\n\nThe\napplicant(s) owns or controls land(s) where deer damage has been documented or\ncan be documented by the department, and which is adjacent to or bordering a\nparcel of publically-owned land that is at least 250 acres and is not open to\ndeer hunting by law, regulation, or public agency policy. (g) Application Procedures and permit\nduration. Application instructions will be maintained on the\ndepartment's website. There is no fee for the application or issuance of a DMAP\npermit. All applications are subject to the following requirements: (1)\n\nApplication deadline will be posted with\nthe application instructions on the department's website. Applications not\nmeeting the posted deadline will be considered for enrollment the following\nyear. Permits will expire July 31, three years following the year of\napplication, unless revoked earlier by the department. (2)\n\nEach application must designate one\nperson to be the named \" permit holder \" who will serve as the contact for all\ncommunication with the department. This person must have authority to represent\nall parties having a controlling interest in deer hunting activities on the\nproperty(s) identified in the application.

Municipal applications shall cover all public and\nprivate properties within their border, but the municipal permit holder must\nmaintain a list of all participating properties with written consent of the\nassociated landowners. (4)\n\nEach\napplication shall describe the background and scope of the deer problem or\nstate the deer management goals and the reasons why such goals cannot be met\nthrough standard hunting seasons and permits. Where a deer management plan is\nnot otherwise required under this section, such a plan may be required at the\ndiscretion of the department. (5)\n\nInformation regarding past deer harvests, existing conditions, and deer\nmanagement objectives within the Wildlife Management Unit(s) in which the\napplication is applied for, will be considered each year to determine DMAP\neligibility. (6)\n\nNothing in this\nsection shall be construed as requiring or obligating the department to approve\na DMAP application when in its opinion the deer damage problem will not be\neffectively abated thereby or when in its opinion the deer management goals of\nthe applicant can be met though effective utilization of existing deer hunting\nopportunities.

For those permits where\nmore than two tags per hunter per year may be used, the permit conditions shall\nstate the number of tags allowed per hunter. There is no limit on the number of\nDMAP permits that a hunter may be authorized to take deer on. (4)\nDMAP tags may not be sold. (5)\n\nIt shall be the responsibility of the\npermit holder to distribute all DMAP tags.

The carcass tag must not be removed until the deer is prepared for\nconsumption. The taker must report each harvested deer to the permit holder and\nto the department in accordance with current game harvest reporting\nrequirements as set forth in 6 NYCRR\n180.10. (2)\n\nAntlerless deer taken pursuant to a DMAP\npermit must not be transported without the carcass tag attached to it except in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivisions 4 and 5 of section 11-0911 of\nthe ECL. (3)\n\nThe permit holder is\nresponsible for submitting to the department an annual report of all deer taken\nunder the authority of their DMAP permit, by February 15 for permits issued for\nproperties in Suffolk County and by January 15 for properties in all other\ncounties.

The department may revoke or\nsuspend a DMAP permit where it is obtained through fraud, or where it is\nobtained by persons not entitled to a DMAP permit, or where false statements\nare made in the DMAP application. Failure to comply with conditions of the\nDMAP permit, failure to provide an annual report in accordance with permit\nconditions, and/or violations of the fish and wildlife law may result in\nrevocation of a DMAP permit and/or denial of future DMAP applications at the\ndiscretion of the Department.
