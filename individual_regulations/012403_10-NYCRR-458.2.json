  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 458.2 - Salaries and wages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nIf management is to have maximum control\nover labor costs, close control of the number of man-hours paid is essential. Man-hours are a more stable measure of labor utilization than dollars, because\nman-hours are not affected by inflation. Also, when man-hours are compared to\nunits of service, they can provide management with information that is useful\nboth for internal control and external comparisons. (2)\nA record of man-hours paid that exactly\nparallels the record of salaries and wages paid by department must be\nmaintained. This requires that the residential health care facility establish a\nrecord of paid man-hours by department for all personnel whose compensation is\nincluded on the payroll, including exempt personnel. These man-hour records\nmust include separate records of worked man-hours and nonworked man-hours. Worked man-hours should include regular hours worked, overtime hours worked, hours worked when on call or on standby, hours spent in in-service education, orientation, breaks, paid social functions (such as Christmas parties), and so\nforth. Nonworked man-hours should include paid vacations, holidays, sick pay, military leave, educational leave, (including continuing education) bereavement\nor funeral leave, jury duty, benefit hours paid but not taken as leave, and so\nforth. (3)\n\nOvertime hours are hours\nfor which an overtime pay rate is used. The actual overtime hours are not\ntreated differently from regular worked hours; it is the rate that changes. This is preferable to the common but undesirable practice of adding additional\nhours to the records when calculating the payroll so that the regular pay rate\ncan be used instead of the overtime rate. (4)\n\nOn-call and/or standby pay is\ncompensation to an employee for being available to work. During the period when\nthe employee is on call or on standby, he might or might not actually perform\nwork. The Fair Labor Standards Act differentiates between restricted and\nunrestricted on-call situations. All restricted on-call hours are compensable\nand contribute to the total hours used for determining overtime pay. Unrestricted on-call hours do not contribute to total hours, but unrestricted\non-call compensation does contribute to the salary base used for calculating\novertime premiums only. Thus all restricted on-call hours must be accounted\nfor, but only those hours worked need be accounted for when employees are on\nunrestricted on-call duty. (5)\n\nSalaries and wages are defined as all remuneration, payable in cash, for\nservices performed by an employee for the residential health care facility, and\nthe fair market value of services donated to the facility by persons performing\nin an employee relationship. Reimbursement of independent contractors, such as\nprivate duty nurses, should be excluded. (b) Specific classifications of salaries and\nwages follow: (1)\n\nManagement and Supervision.
