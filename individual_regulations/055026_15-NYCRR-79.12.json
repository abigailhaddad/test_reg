(1)\nA form entitled \"Motor Vehicle Inspection\n\nRecord\" (form VS-1074, VS-1074SD, or VS-1074M) will be furnished without charge\nto the inspection stations. This form will be used to record inspections\nperformed by the station that are not required to be kept in the appropriate\nCVIS equipment. A new form must be started on the first day of each year. Form\nVS-1074 must be kept in an orderly chronological manner. Such forms shall be\ncompleted in accordance with the \"Instructions for Completing Vehicle\n\nInspection Record,\" which is on the reverse of each form. The start of each\nmonth must be clearly marked. The official inspection station shall keep\nseparate form VS-1074 records for each series of inspection stickers (safety, motorcycle, heavy vehicle, diesel safety/emissions), that the station is\nlicensed to issue after inspection. The official inspection station shall\nretain all VS-1074 forms in its files for two years from the date of the last\nentry. (2)\n\nAn official emissions\ninspection station located within the NYMA must record all safety/emissions\n(OBD II and low enhanced), safety, motorcycle, and heavy vehicle safety\ninspections (other than diesel-powered heavy vehicles) in the NYVIP CVIS. An\nofficial emissions inspection station located within the NYMA must record the\nresults of diesel emissions and safety inspection of heavy vehicles subject to\ndiesel emissions inspection on the VS-1074SD form. (3)\n\nAn official emissions inspection station\nlocated outside of the NYMA must record all safety/emissions (OBD II and low\nenhanced), safety, motorcycle, and heavy vehicle safety inspections in the\nNYVIP CVIS. If the official emissions inspection station located outside of the\nNYMA is also licensed as a diesel emissions inspection station, diesel\nemissions inspections will be recorded on the VS-1074SD form and, if the diesel\nvehicle receives a heavy vehicle inspection, the safety portion will be\nrecorded in the NYVIP CVIS. (b) Inspection stations are to maintain a\nsupply of, and use, the following items: (1)\n\nCertificates of inspection. See section\n79.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nInspection rejection\nnotices. See section\n79.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (c) If an\ninspection station fails to maintain a supply of certificates of inspection and\ninspection rejection notices, inspections shall not be performed at the station\nuntil such time as the station has ordered and received a supply of such\ncertificates or notices. An automotive facilities inspector or any other agents\nappointed by the commissioner are empowered to prevent further inspections by a\nstation for failure to maintain a supply of said certificates or notices, and\nto permit inspections to be made again upon obtaining a supply of said\ncertificates or notices. (d) All\nrecords required by these regulations and all records made by the official\ninspection station in connection with inspections, including shop orders and\nall repair bills (except those in amounts less than $5), shall be retained for\na period of at least two years. (e) An official inspection station must account for all certificates of inspection\nissued to it. An official emissions inspection station must record the receipt\nof all inspection certificates (except safety/diesel emissions inspection\ncertificates) immediately upon request by entering the sticker order into the\nNYVIP CVIS as prompted by the CVIS software so that the order received will be\nrecorded in the analyzer system's computer. (f) For official emissions inspection\nstations, procedures for recordkeeping must also include the daily printing of\na copy of the daily inspection report for every day that inspections are\nperformed. The station must keep copies of the inspection reports, in\nchronological order, for two years. Inspection certificate purchase invoices\nmust also be kept for two years. An automotive facilities inspector or any\nother agent appointed by the commissioner must be given access to these records\nand any CVIS for the purpose of conducting an audit of the station's inspection\nrecords and activity.
