  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1960.6 - Significant industrial users\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Required control manhole and/or monitoring station. (1)\n\nEach SIU shall install either a suitable\ncontrol manhole or monitoring station, in each industrial plant connection to\nthe water board POTW or any other connections deemed necessary by the director. Control manholes shall be suitable for inspection, observation, sampling, testing and measurement of plant discharges. Monitoring stations shall provide\nsafe adequate space and equipment for continuous flow rate measurement and\nrecording, and for the taking of 24-hour composite samples proportional to rate\nof flow, with refrigeration of samples. Such equipment shall include an event\nmarker to indicate the time and frequency of sample collection. (2)\n\nEach such control manhole and/or\nmonitoring station shall be readily accessible and shall be located and\nconstructed in accordance with plans approved by the director. The control\nmanhole and/or monitoring station with equipment shall be installed by the\nowner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and\naccessible at all times to designated water board personnel. If continuous and\nimmediate access to the monitoring station is not available, a control manhole\nto which there is such access shall be provided by the SIU in addition to the\nmonitoring station. There shall be no more than two monitoring stations for any\nindustrial plant unless specifically authorized by the director. (3)\n\nAny SIU may be required to provide, install and maintain monitoring and other equipment as deemed necessary and\nappropriate upon determination by the director. (b) Determination of wastewater\ncharacteristics. (1)\n\nSamples shall be\ncollected on a continuous basis unless otherwise specified by the director. Composite samples shall be collected by automatic sample collection equipment\nover a 24-hour period. In the event of an equipment malfunction a manual\ncomposite sample, consisting of a minimum of eight discrete grab samples, shall\nbe collected at equal time intervals over the 24- hour compositing period. The\ngrab samples shall be composited proportional to the flow rate over the 24-hour\ncompositing period. More than the minimum number of discrete samples may be\nrequired in instances where pollutant loading and/or flow rate is highly\nvariable. (2)\n\nSamples shall be\ncollected and preserved in accordance with 40 CFR part\n403.12 including, but\nnot limited to, cooling samples to 4° C during the compositing\nperiod. (3)\n\nUnless waived by the\ndirector, all SIUs are required to collect samples seven days per week. The\ndirector may waive weekend sampling if past performance and process\ncharacteristics indicate such action is warranted. When a weekend composite\nsample is required, it shall be a flow-proportioned composite of each discrete\ndaily composite sample. The 72-hour composite sample shall include Friday a.m. through Monday a.m. Records of daily integrator numbers and the percent of flow\neach day's sample represents shall be recorded and made available upon\nrequest. (4)\n\nEach SIU, unless\nwaived by the director, is required to retain a minimum of three samples on\nrotation at all times. The first sample shall be the current sample undergoing\ncompositing. The second sample is the completed composite sample which\nrepresents the discharge from the preceding 24 hours. The third sample is a\ncompleted composite sample from the next preceding 24 hours. These samples\nshall not be split or otherwise altered without prior authorization from the\ndirector. (5)\nA log shall be\nmaintained in each monitoring station and shall contain the date, time and flow\nintegrator number at the time each daily sample is removed, the gallons\nconversion factor, and daily flow in million gallons per day. Comments\ndetailing unusual events, equipment malfunctions, etc. shall also be\nrecorded. (6)\n\nUpon demonstration by\na person that the characteristics of the wastewater discharged by that person\nare consistent, the director may reduce the frequency of monitoring except as\nmay be required by authority other than this Part, except in no case shall the\nfrequency of monitoring be less than semi-annually for the determination of\ncompliance with pretreatment or local standards. (7)\n\nAll required periodic compliance reports\nshall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial\nuser. (8)\n\nLaboratory and field\nmeasurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of wastewater required\nby this Part shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR part\n403.12. Any\nreport submitted pursuant to this Part shall specify the standard practices\nused. (9)\n\nThe department must be\nnotified by telephone within 24 hours when the monitoring or sampling equipment\nis inoperative for more than one working day. (c) Slug discharges. (1)\n\nEach SIU shall provide protection from a\nslug discharge of prohibited materials or substances regulated by this Part. Facilities to prevent slug discharge(s) of prohibited materials shall be\nprovided for and maintained at the owner's or user's own expense, as determined\nby the director. (2)\n\nEach existing\nSIU shall be evaluated at least once every two years as to whether or not the\nSIU needs a plan to control slug discharge(s). In addition, any new SIU shall\nbe reviewed for the need of a plan at the time of application for an SIU\npermit. The director may require any user to develop, submit for approval, and\nimplement such a plan. Alternatively, the director may develop such a plan for\nany user. In the event a plan is required, the user shall submit this plan to\nthe department for review and approval within 90 calendar days of\nnotification. (3)\n\nReview and\napproval of such plans and operating procedures shall not relieve the user from\nthe responsibility to modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the\nrequirements of this Part. In the case of a slug discharge, it is the\nresponsibility of the user to immediately upon becoming aware of the violation, telephone and notify the water board POTW of the incident. The notification\nshall include location of discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and corrective actions. (4)\n\nIn the\nevent of a violation of any applicable pretreatment limit, the user must\nresample and submit the analytical results of this resampling to the POTW\nwithin 30 days. (5)\n\nWithin five\nbusiness days following a slug discharge, the user shall submit to the director\na detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the\ncorrective action to be taken by the user to prevent similar future\noccurrences. Such report shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the\nwater board POTW, fish kills, or any other damage to person or property. Such\nreport shall be considered in imposing any fines, civil penalties, or other\nliability which may be imposed by this Part. (6)\nA notice shall be permanently posted on\nthe user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising the user's\nemployees whom to notify in the event of a slug discharge. Users and/ or\nemployers shall ensure that all employees who may cause or suffer such a\ndischarge to occur are advised of the emergency notification\nprocedure. (7)\nA slug discharge\ncontrol plan shall address, at a minimum, the following: (i) description of discharge practices, including non-routine discharges; (ii)\ndescription of stored\nchemicals; (iii)\nprocedures to\nimmediately notify the water board POTW of any slug discharge, as required by\nsection\n1960.5\nof this Part; and\n(iv)\nprocedures to prevent adverse impact\nfrom any slug discharge. Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of\nmaterials, loading areas, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic\norganic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for\nemergency response. (d) Permit application, approval, fee. (1)\n\nAll proposed new industrial users shall\ncomplete and submit to the director application for approval to discharge at\nleast 30 calendar days prior to connecting to, or contributing to, the water\nboard's POTW. Upon receipt of all required information, the application will be\nprocessed and the determination of user status shall be made. In the event the\nindustrial user is classified as an SIU, a discharge permit will be issued. The\nfee for such permit and each subsequent renewal shall be $250 which is payable\nin advance to the water board. (2)\nA user wastewater discharge permit shall include at a minimum: (i) a statement of duration; (ii)\na statement of\nnon-transferability; (iii)\napplicable Federal, State and local effluent limits; (iv)\nself-monitoring, sampling, reporting, notification and recordkeeping requirements; and\n(v) a statement of applicable civil\npenalties. (3)\n\nIn the\nevent that the application noted in paragraph (1) of this subdivision results\nin the industrial user not being classified as an SIU, but does indicate\npollutants, which in the opinion of the director are in sufficient quantity or\nquality to warrant monitoring, the industrial user will be issued an ICU\nwastewater discharge permit. The maximum duration of such permit will not\nexceed five years. The fee for such permit, and each renewal thereafter, shall\nbe $100 which is payable to the water board. (4)\n\nAny existing SIU must have a valid\ncurrent SIU permit from the water board in order to lawfully discharge to the\nwater board POTW. (5)\n\nThe director\nshall not issue an SIU permit for any connection to the water board's POTW\nunless there is sufficient capacity, not committed to other users, in the\nwastewater sewers and treatment facilities to convey and adequately treat the\nquantity of wastewater which the requested connection will add to the\nsystem. (e) Permit\nmodifications. (1)\n\nUser permits shall be\nrevised and issued as soon as possible (e.g., within 90 days) subsequent to a\nchange of or promulgation of a categorical pretreatment standard to require\ncompliance with such standard within the time frame prescribed by such\nstandard. Where an SIU, subject to a categorical pretreatment standard, has not\npreviously submitted an application for an SIU permit as required by\nsubdivision (d) of this section, the user shall apply for an SIU permit within\n180 calendar days after the promulgation of the applicable categorical\npretreatment standard. In addition, the user with an existing SIU permit shall\nsubmit application for permit modification to the director within 180 calendar\ndays after the promulgation of an applicable categorical pretreatment\nstandard. (2)\n\nAn SIU shall notify\nthe director in writing not less than 60 calendar days prior to initiating the\ndischarge of industrial wastes from a new plant, or from a plant which has been\nout of operation or purchased from another user. (3)\nSIUs must obtain prior approval from the\ndirector to discharge new or significantly increased wasteloads. The approval\nmay require modification to the SIU permit. (4)\n\nAny request for modification to a current\nSIU wastewater discharge permit shall be made in writing to the water board. Such request shall contain a description of the change including but not\nlimited to the changes in pollutant character, if any. The fee for such\napplication for modification shall be $250 payable at the time of request to\nthe water board. (f) Permit duration. Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to\nexceed five years. A permit may be issued for a period less than a year, or may\nbe stated to expire on a specific date. The user shall apply for permit\nreissuance a minimum of 90 calendar days prior to the expiration of the user's\nexisting permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to\nmodification by the water board, during the term of the permit, as limitations\nor requirements are modified or other just cause exists. Any changes or new\nconditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for\ncompliance. (g) Permit transfer. Permits are issued to a specific user. A permit shall not be reassigned or\ntransferred without the approval of the director. Any succeeding owner or user\nto which a permit has been transferred shall also comply with all terms and\nconditions of the existing permit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
