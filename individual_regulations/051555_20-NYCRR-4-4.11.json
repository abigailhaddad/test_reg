  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.11 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor purposes of these examples, it can be assumed that\nthe corporation has met all the requirements of due diligence, unless otherwise\nprovided, and that the business address presumption does not apply. Example 1: Audit Corp is located in New York and\nprovides accounting and tax services. Audit Corp contracts with Client Corp to\naudit the books and records of Client Corp's three locations in State A, State\nB and New York. Client Corp's managers of the three locations make several\nvisits to Audit Corp to provide their respective locations\" books and records\nto the auditors assigned to the respective audits and to address periodic\ninquiries. In its books and records, Audit Corp tracks the hours each of its\nauditors spent on the respective audits of the three locations. Audit Corp\nbills Client Corp for its services using the same hourly rate for each of its\nauditors. Audit Corp's services are not considered an in-person\nservice because, although there was in-person contact, it was not required for\n\nAudit Corp to be able to perform its service. Therefore, Audit Corp must apply\nthe general rule for determining where the benefit is received. It determines\nthe benefit is received by Client Corp at each location based on Audit Corp's\nbooks and records. The amount Audit Corp includes in its New York receipts is\nthe hourly charge spent on audits of the New York State location. All of Audit\n\nCorp's receipts from Client Corp are included in everywhere receipts. Example 2: Teaching Corp provides in-person seminars in\n\nNew York to individuals and business customers. The seminars and the materials\nused in connection with the seminars are prepared outside New York, the\nteachers who teach the seminars include teachers that are not New York\nresidents, and the students who attend the seminars include students that are\nnot New York residents. Since the customers are in the same location as\n\nTeaching Corp when the service is provided, it is deemed to be an in-person\nservice and the special rule for determining where the benefit is received\napplies. As such, it is presumed that the benefit is received at the location\nwhere the service is performed, which is New York State. 100% of such receipts\nare included in New York receipts and everywhere receipts. Example 3: Watch Corp is a watch repair corporation with\nretail locations in multiple states including New York. The repair work is\nperformed at Watch Corp's New York location. In some instances, the customer\ntakes back possession of the watch in New York State. In other instances, the\ncustomer requests that the repaired watch be shipped to the customer's home\naddress. Since the repair is completed on the customer's watch, which is\ntangible personal property, it is considered a service related to tangible\npersonal property. Therefore, the special rule for determining where the\nbenefit is received for services related to tangible personal property applies\nand it is presumed that the benefit is received at the location where the\nproperty is received after the service is performed. In those instances where\nthe customer takes back possession of the watch in New York State, the benefit\nis received in New York State because the customer receives the repaired watch\nin New York State and the receipts for the repair work are included in New York\nreceipts. In those instances where the watch is shipped to the customer's home\naddress, the benefit is received in New York State only if the watch is shipped\nto a home address in New York. In both instances, all of the receipts are\nincluded in everywhere receipts. Example 4: Troubleshooting Corp operates a call center\nlocated in New York State that provides troubleshooting services for use of\nhome appliances over the telephone to individual customers located throughout\nthe United States. The contract between Troubleshooting Corp and its customers\nprovides that, for a fee per call, the customer can call Troubleshooting Corp\nand the call center employee will walk the customer through troubleshooting the\nappliance. Although provided over the telephone, this service includes a level\nof human interaction and, therefore, it is not a digital service and must be\napportioned under the rules in this Subpart. Home appliances are tangible personal property so the\nservice Troubleshooting Corp is providing is related to tangible personal\nproperty. Under the special rule for determining where the benefit\nis received for services related to tangible personal property, the benefit is\npresumed to be received at the location where the property is received after\nthe service is performed. However, Troubleshooting Corp does not have\ninformation on where the tangible personal property was received by the\ncustomer or where it is currently located. It only has the billing address of\nits customer. Therefore, Troubleshooting Corp uses the billing addresses of its\ncustomers to reasonably approximate where the tangible personal property is\nlocated and will include receipts in New York receipts to the extent that\ncustomers have billing addresses located in New York State. Troubleshooting\n\nCorp must include 100% of its receipts from troubleshooting services in\neverywhere receipts. Example 5: Law Corp, located in State C, is hired by\n\nClient Corp to handle a major litigation matter concerning the sale of its\nmanufacturing plant located in New York State. Client Corp has manufacturing\nplants in New York and State B. The trial takes place in State C, which is the\nlocation of the opposing party in the lawsuit. The court documents, which are\npublic records, reflect that the subject matter is the manufacturing plant\nlocated in New York. Because Law Corp's entire service is related to the\nmanufacturing plant, which is real property, the special rule for determining\nwhere the benefit is received for services related to real property applies. Therefore, the benefit is presumed to be received by Client Corp at the\nlocation of the manufacturing plant. Therefore, Law Corp must include 100% of\nits receipts from Client Corp in both New York receipts and everywhere\nreceipts. Example 6: Consulting Corp provides two main types of\nfacility consulting services - licensing requirements and environmental\ncompliance. Consulting Corp has 60 business customers who have hired them to\nobtain applicable permits and licenses and 200 business customers who have\nhired them to provide environmental compliance services. No more than 5% of\n\nConsulting Corp's receipts are from any particular business customer. Despite\nthe differing subject matter, the consulting services are substantially similar\nenough that the business address presumption applies. Example 7: Consulting Corp provides consulting services\nto determine the safety of train tracks to 200 business customers, including\n\nTrain Corp. Consulting Corp provides consulting services to Train Corp in\nrelation to a portion of train service that runs through New York and 5 other\nstates for a flat fee. As this is a service related to real property, the\nspecial rule for determining where the benefit is received for services related\nto real property applies. Under that rule, the benefit is presumed to be\nreceived at the location of the property. Because the real property involved is\nlocated within six states, it is necessary to look to Consulting Corp's books\nand records to determine the share of the benefit received at the real property\nlocated in New York State. Some areas of the track are more heavily traveled than\nothers, requiring more attention, and some portions of the track require\nspecial attention, such as where signals are located. Consulting Corp's books\nand records indicate only the location of the tracks its services relate to and\nhow many miles of track are located in New York State and each of the 5 other\nstates. Upon reasonable inquiries, Consulting Corp cannot obtain additional\ninformation to determine specifically where Train Corp receives the benefit of\nits service. Consulting Corp should reasonably approximate based on customer\ninformation where the benefit is received by multiplying the total receipts it\nreceives from Train Corp by a fraction, the numerator of which is the miles of\ntrack its service relates to located within New York State and the denominator\nof which is the total miles of track its service relates to located within and\nwithout New York State. Consulting Corp must include 100% of its receipts from\n\nTrain Corp in everywhere receipts. Example 8: Furniture Sales Corp owns showroom locations\nin various states and acts as a sales agent of Couch Corp. Pursuant to the\nagreement between the two parties, Furniture Sales Corp receives a commission\non each piece of furniture it sells. A salesperson at Furniture Sales Corp's\n\nState A location received an order for a couch from a customer and, as part of\nthe process, documents that the customer would like the couch delivered in New\n\nYork State. Furniture Corp's commission is earned for a service related to\ntangible personal property (the couch) and the special rule for determining\nwhere the benefit is received applies. As such, the benefit of its service is\npresumed to be received at the location where the tangible personal property is\nreceived after the service is performed. Therefore, the commission is\napportioned to the delivery address. 100% of Furniture Sales Corp's commission\nis included in both New York receipts and everywhere receipts. Example 9: Architect Corp, located in New York, provides\narchitectural services to Developer Corp, located in State A, to design the\nfloor plan of homes to be built at one of the development sites owned by\n\nDeveloper Corp. Developer Corp knows the floorplan will be used at one of its\ndevelopments, but Developer Corp will not know which floorplan goes to which\nsite until it enters into contracts with homebuyers. Architect Corp is\nproviding a service related to real property. Therefore, the special rule for\ndetermining where the benefit is received for services related to real property\nprovides that the benefit of the service is presumed to be received at the\nlocation of the real property. As Architect Corp does not know where the real\nproperty is located to apportion the receipt based on the special rule for\nservices related to real property and reasonable inquiries to the Developer\n\nCorp do not yield that information, it must use reasonable approximation based\non customer information to determine the real property location. The books and\nrecords, including the contract with Developer Corp, indicate that Developer\n\nCorp owns two development sites, one in New York State and one in State A. Therefore, Architect Corp must use reasonable approximation to apportion the\nreceipt between these two locations and include 50% of the receipt in New York\nreceipts. 100% of the receipts are included in everywhere receipts. Example 10: Retail Corp offers extended warranties on\ncomputers purchased by individual customers for personal use for a flat fee. The extended warranty covers both the computer hardware and any software\ninstalled on the computer. To utilize the warranty, customers bring the\ncomputer to any of Retail Corp's locations for repair. Once the repair is\ncomplete, customers have the choice to take back possession of the computer at\n\nRetail Corp's location where the repair was completed or request that the\nrepaired computer be shipped to the customer's address. The amount Retail Corp receives for the extended\nwarranty does not separately state the portion of the receipt that is for\nhardware repairs (subject to the rules in this section) and software repairs\n(otherwise subject to the rules for receipts from digital products and digital\nservices). As a result, the entire amount is properly apportioned under the\nrules in this section. The sale of the warranty is the sale of an obligation to\nperform a service at an undetermined future date. Therefore, the receipt does\nnot qualify as a sale of a service related to tangible personal property and\ninstead must be apportioned under the general rule for determining where the\nbenefit is received. Retail Corp's customers are individuals, so the benefit is\npresumed to be received at the customers' billing addresses. Retail Corp includes receipts from sales of extended\nwarranties to customers with billing addresses in New York State in New York\nreceipts. 100% of its receipts from the sales of extended warranties are\nincluded in everywhere receipts. Example 11: Model Agency Corp contracts with individual\nmodels to connect the models with modeling jobs in exchange for a commission. The contract between Model Agency Corp and the model specifies the commission\nthat Model Agency Corp receives for each modeling job it books. In addition, such contract requires that Model Agency Corp receives all payments the model\nis entitled to for modeling services and provides that Model Agency Corp must\nretain its commission from the payments and pass the remainder on to the\nmodel. Modeling Agency Corp contracts with two such models, Model 1 who lives in New York and Model 2 who lives in State Z. Modeling Agency\n\nCorp books both models for a photoshoot in New York with ClothesCo. ClothesCo\npays the models\" fees to Modeling Agency Corp, which keeps a portion as its\ncommissions and remits the remainder to the models. Although Modeling Agency\n\nCorp collected the fees from ClothesCo, it is receiving a commission from its\ncontract with each Model. The service provided by Modeling Agency Corp is\nbooking the models for the photoshoot. The models are providing an in-person\nservice to ClothesCo because they must be physically present for the\nphotoshoot. Therefore, the receipt received by Modeling Agency Corp\nis a commission for the facilitation of an in-person service. Therefore, the\nspecial rule for determining where the benefit is received for in-person\nservices provides that the benefit is presumed to be received at the location\nwhere the in-person service is performed, which is the location of the\nphotoshoot. The commissions Model Agency Corp receives from Model 1 and Model 2\nare included in New York receipts. 100% of its receipts from commissions it\nreceives are included in everywhere receipts. Example 12: Statistics Corp provides data compilation\nand analysis services that will be used in policymaking for TUV, a Federal\ngovernment agency, which has regional offices throughout the United States. Statistics Corp's only contact with TUV is with its main office located in\n\nState A, and Statistics Corp does not know the locations of TUV's other\noffices, nor which of TUV's offices focus on policymaking and which focus on\ndirect client services. After reasonable inquiries, Statistics Corp does not\nhave any additional information as to which regional offices will use the data\ncompilation and analysis services. Furthermore, a general information\nmeasurement such as population information would not be relevant because the\ncompilation and analysis services are used by employees rather than the general\npublic. Because no special rules for determining where the benefit is received\napply and Statistics Corp does not have adequate information to determine where\nthe benefit is received, or even to apply reasonable approximation, Statistics\n\nCorp is required to apportion the receipts based on the delivery destination of\nits services. Since the contract of sale is managed by TUV's main office in\n\nState A, the receipts are not included in New York receipts. 100% of the\nreceipts are included in everywhere receipts. Example 13: Sales Corp provides only one type of service\nto approximately 200 business customers and the service is not subject to the\nspecial rules for determining where the benefit is received. In tax year 2021, all of its receipts were apportioned under this Subpart, and, as a result 45%\nof Sales Corp's receipts were included in New York receipts. In tax year 2022, Sales Corp continues to provide only one type of service to its customers. At\nthe end of tax year 2022, Sales Corp's computer system crashes and it is unable\nto recover information it had obtained on where the benefit of its services\nwere received or where the services were delivered. Upon reasonable inquiries\nto its known customers, Sales Corp still cannot obtain information on where the\nbenefits were received or where the services were delivered. Therefore, using\nthe preceding taxable year method, Sales Corp must include 45% of its 2022\nreceipts in New York receipts. 100% of receipts are included in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 14: Taxpayer A has $10,000 in receipts from a new\ntype of service subject to this Subpart. Since the service is not subject to\nany of the special rules for determining where the benefit is received, Taxpayer A must exercise due diligence to determine where the customer received\nthe benefit or where the service was delivered. As Taxpayer A cannot determine\nthose locations, it must determine the portion of the $10,000 to include in New\n\nYork receipts based on the current taxable year method. In the current tax\nyear, Taxpayer A has $80,000 in other business receipts apportioned using the\nwhere benefit received method, of which $20,000 is included in New York\nreceipts. In addition, Taxpayer A has $70,000 in other business receipts\napportioned using the delivery destination method, of which $55,000 are New\n\nYork receipts. Therefore, under the current taxable year method, Taxpayer A\nwould include 50% of the $10,000, or $5,000, of receipts from the new type of\nservice in New York receipts. 100% of receipts from the new type of service are\nincluded in everywhere receipts. Taxpayer B also has $10,000 in receipts from a new type\nof service that, after exercising due diligence, it cannot source using either\nthe where benefit received method or the delivery destination method. However, unlike Taxpayer A, Taxpayer B has been able to source all its receipts from\nother business activities using the where benefit received method and has\ndetermined that 40 percent of all those other receipts are New York receipts. Therefore, under the current taxable year method, $4000, or 40%, of the\nreceipts from this new service are included in Taxpayer B's New York receipts. Taxpayer B includes 100% of the receipts from the new type of digital product\nin everywhere receipts. Example 15: Loan Corp (the taxpayer) is based in New York\nand operates offices whereby individuals and businesses can discuss loan\noptions and obtain a loan from unrelated lenders. Loan Corp also will service\nthe loans it procures. Bank Corp (the business customer) enters into a contract\nwith Loan Corp whereby Bank Corp will pay Loan Corp a fee to procure borrowers\n(consumers) and a fee to handle servicing of loans financed by Bank Corp. Loan\n\nCorp handles all interactions with the consumers, who have no contact or\ninteraction with Bank Corp directly. Loan Corp assists a business consumer in obtaining a\nmortgage loan from Bank Corp to purchase an office building in State C. Because\nthis service is related to real property, Loan Corp must use the special rule\nfor determining where the benefit is received for services related to real\nproperty. The benefit of both the procurement fee and the servicing fee is\npresumed to be received at the location of the real property. Loan Corp assists an individual who is a resident of\n\nState D, in obtaining a personal loan from Bank Corp. Loan Corp sends monthly\nbills to the borrower during the term of the loan. Loan Corp's receipts from\n\nBank Corp for procuring the borrower and servicing the loan is an intermediary\ntransaction because, pursuant to its contract, Loan Corp is providing a service\nat the direction of Bank Corp directly to the location of the consumer. These\nreceipts are not included in New York receipts because the individual's billing\naddress is in State D. 100% of such receipts are included in everywhere\nreceipts. Example 16: Debt Collection Corp (the taxpayer) has\noffices in New York and State A. Student Loan Corp (the business customer), which is located in State C, enters into a contract with Debt Collection Corp\nwhereby Student Loan Corp will pay Debt Collection Corp a fee to collect\noutstanding debt owed to Student Loan Corp by borrowers (consumers). Debt\n\nCollection Corp communicates with borrowers by phone and email, and collects\noutstanding debt directly from borrowers who make debt payments online to Debt\n\nCollection Corp. After retaining a portion of the payment as its fee, Debt\n\nCollection Corp remits the remainder of the collected money to Student Loan\n\nCorp electronically. Despite the electronic means to perform its work and\ntransfer funds, the service has not been fully automated and there is a\nnon-incidental level of human interaction, thus Debt Collection Corp's\nactivities do not satisfy the definition of a digital service. Therefore, the\nreceipt is to be apportioned using the rules in this Subpart. Debt Collection\n\nCorp is providing a service to Student Loan Corp, who instructs Debt Collection\n\nCorp to collect from borrowers on its behalf. This service is provided directly\nto the location of the consumers at Student Loan Corp's direction, which meets\nthe definition of an intermediary transaction. Therefore, Debt Collection Corp\nmust apportion the receipt from the fee earned from Student Loan Corp to the\nlocation of the consumers. Debt Collection Corp uses the billing addresses of the\nconsumers to include receipts in New York receipts to the extent that consumers\nhave billing addresses located in New York. Debt Collection Corp must include\n100% of its receipts from the service provided to Student Loan Corp in\neverywhere receipts. Example 17: Credit Score Corp has a contract with Credit\n\nCard Corp to provide credit rating services to Credit Card Corp for individuals\napplying for credit cards. Credit Card Corp receives all credit rating services\nat its corporate office in State A where it makes determinations on whether or\nnot to issue credit cards to applicants. Applicants from all over the country\nsubmit applications to Credit Card Corp, who then provides information about\nthe applicants to Credit Score Corp to receive a credit rating. Credit Score\n\nCorp issues the rating for each applicant to Credit Card Corp, who utilizes\nthis information to make a determination as to whether or not Credit Card Corp\nwill issue the applicant a credit card. This is not an intermediary transaction\nbecause the service is provided by Credit Score Corp directly to Credit Card\n\nCorp and is not passed on to the applicants applying for the credit cards. Because Credit Card Corp utilizes the service entirely in State A, where it\nmakes credit determinations on credit card applications, Credit Score Corp does\nnot include the receipt in New York receipts. 100% of such receipt is included\nin Credit Score Corp's everywhere receipts. Example 18: Production Corp enters into a contract with\n\nCable Network Corp to provide the service of producing a made-for-television\nmovie. Production Corp delivers the television production to Cable Network\n\nCorp's New York State office, which is the office location responsible for\ncontracting for the production and determining its usage. The production\nservice receipt is not considered an intermediary transaction because the\nproduction service is not provided by Production Corp directly to Cable Network\n\nCorp's consumers at the direction of Cable Network Corp and the production\nservice is completed prior to Cable Network Corp determining if and when the\nproduction will be aired. As Cable Network Corp receives the benefit of this\nservice at its New York State office, the entire receipt is included in both\n\nNew York receipts and everywhere receipts. Example 19: Credit Ratings Corp, located in New York, has a contract with Debt Issuer Corp whereby Credit Ratings Corp opines, via\nthe assignment of a letter grade, on the creditworthiness of Debt Issuer Corp's\ndebt obligation. The rating does not constitute a recommendation of the\nsuitability of an investment for any particular investor. Credit Ratings Corp\nmay issue the rating via press release, which allows potential investors to\nconsider the rating/letter grade. Credit Ratings Corp also includes the rating\nin its database of ratings on its website, which allows for public viewing. However, the principal element of the service is the development of the rating; any dissemination via digital means is incidental to such service. Therefore, the receipt is apportioned under the rules in this Subpart. Furthermore, this\nservice does not constitute an intermediary transaction because the rating is\nnot provided by Credit Ratings Corp directly to individual investors at Debt\n\nIssuer's direction. In addition, the rating is not provided to Debt Issuer Corp\nto pass along directly to individual investors. For this reason, the receipt\nmust be apportioned to the location at which Debt Issuer Corp receives the\nbenefit of the service. Credit Rating Corp's books and records indicate that\nthe rating is being sought on the advice of Debt Issuer's corporate finance\ndivision, which is responsible for overall fiscal strategy and execution and is\nlocated in State A. Therefore, the receipt is not included in Credit Rating\n\nCorp's New York receipts. 100% of such receipt is included in Credit Rating\n\nCorp's everywhere receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
