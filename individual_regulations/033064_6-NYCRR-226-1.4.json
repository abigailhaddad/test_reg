  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 226-1.4 - Equipment specifications and control requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as otherwise permitted by the department pursuant\nto section\n226-1.6\nof this Part, the following\ntypes of control requirements must be used by an owner or operator conducting\nsolvent cleaning: (a) 'Cold cleaning\ndegreasing when the internal volume of the machine is greater than two\ngallons.'\n(1)\nA cover which can be operated\neasily. (2)\n\nAn internal drainage\nfacility (under cover), if practical. (3)\nA control system that limits VOC\nemissions to those achievable with equipment having a freeboard ratio greater\nthan or equal to 0.5, or a water cover when the solvent is insoluble in and\nheavier than water. Remote reservoir degreasers are exempt from this\nrequirement. (4)\n\nCleaning solution\nwith a maximum VOC content of 25 grams per liter at 20°C; prior to December 1, 2020, a cleaning solution with a vapor pressure of 1.0 mm Hg, or less, at 20°C\nmay be used to demonstrate compliance with this subdivision. cleaning covered\nby this subdivision must use compliant solvents or have submitted a process\nspecific RACT demonstration pursuant to section 226.5 of this Part. This\nparagraph does not apply to degreasers: (i) used in special and extreme solvent cleaning; (ii)\nfor which the owner or operator has\nreceived department approval of a demonstration that compliance with the\nrequirement of a cleaning solution with a maximum VOC content of 25 grams per\nliter at 20°C, or with a vapor pressure of 1.0 mm Hg, or less, at 20°C will\nresult in unsafe operating conditions; or\n(iii)\nthat are located in a permanent total\nenclosure having control equipment that is designed and operated with an\noverall VOC removal efficiency of 90 percent or greater. (5)\n\nCleaning solution used to clean\npost-solder printed circuit boards (PCB's) as well as critical adjunct\nprocesses, including the cleaning of raw solder paste and adhesives from hard\nsurfaces, such as stencils and misprinted boards during the printing process, and baked on fluxes (polymerized fluxes) from reflow and wave solder oven\ncomponents, such as conveyor fingers and condensation traps, may contain no\nmore than 150 grams VOC per liter of solution and must follow all other\nprovisions of this Subpart. (b) 'Open top vapor degreasing.'\n(1)\nA cover which can be operated easily\nwithout disturbing the vapor zone. (2)\n\nSafety switches which shut off the sump\nheat if the condenser malfunctions and shall shut off the pump if the vapor\nlevel drops excessively. (3)\n\nOne of\nthe following: (i) a freeboard ratio that is\ngreater than or equal to 0.75, and a powered or mechanically assisted cover if\nthe top opening is greater than 10 square feet; (ii)\na refrigerated chiller; or\n(iii)\nlocal exhaust ventilation and a carbon\nadsorption unit, or an equivalent system, for collection of VOCs. (c) 'Conveyorized\ndegreasing.'\n(1)\n\nOne of the following: (i) a refrigerated chiller; or\n(ii)\nlocal exhaust ventilation and a carbon\nadsorption unit, or an equivalent system, for collection of VOCs. (2)\nA drying tunnel, rotating basket or other device acceptable to the department which prevents\ncarry out of VOCs. (3)\n\nSafety\nswitches which shut off the system when the degreaser malfunctions. (4)\n\nMinimize openings at the entrance and\nexit of the degreaser. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
