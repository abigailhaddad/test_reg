(\nNote: for reimbursement of respite\nservices provided in an IRA, see subdivision [h] of this section.)\n(2)\n\nIndividualized residential alternatives\n(IRAs) which provide residential habilitation services shall be reimbursed as\neither supervised IRAs or supportive IRAs (see section\n635-99.1\nof this Part). (3)\n\nReimbursement for residential\nhabilitation services provided in non-state operated IRAs and CRs on or after\n\nJuly 1, 2014 shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 641-1 of\nthis Title. Subpart 641-1 supersedes the provisions of this subdivision for\nreimbursement of residential habilitation services provided in non-state\noperated supervised and supportive IRAs and CRs on or after July 1, 2014, except those provisions pertaining to enrollment and service days in paragraphs\n(9) - (13) of this subdivision. Note: Subpart 641-1 includes a provision that changes the unit of\nservice for residential habilitation services provided in non-state operated\nsupervised IRAs and CRs from a monthly to a daily unit of service (See\nparagraphs [9] and [13] of this subdivision). (4)\n\nTotal allowable residential habilitation\nservices costs shall be determined pursuant to sections\n635-10.4\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart and 686.13(b) of this Title and Subpart 635-6 of this\n\nPart. (5)\n\nThe total budgeted costs\nfor the residential habilitation services shall be compared to the actual costs\nof other existing programs serving persons with comparable needs including\nthose operated by the provider. The submitted budget costs may be adjusted for\nallowability and comparability with the costs of such programs. (6)\n\nTotal reimbursable residential\nhabilitation services costs shall be related to the service specifications of\neach person's individualized service plan (ISP) and shall be equal to the lower\nof budgeted costs or recommendations from the budget review process. (The\nbudget review is performed utilizing provider cost and reimbursement\ninformation and reimbursement and cost information for comparable\nprograms/services. Historical cost information is derived from the provider's\nown annual cost reporting if available or may also be reviewed against other\ncost and reimbursement information for similar programs.) Based upon documented\nprogrammatic necessity, certain reasonable additional residential habilitation\nservices budget costs in excess of the recommendations from the budget review\nprocess may be reimbursed. Reimbursement shall be based upon prior OPWDD\napproval and documentation that the individuals involved in the reimbursement, in the aggregate, require the requested level of residential habilitation\nservices. (7)\n\nAn annual price\nperiod is a 12-month period as follows: (i) for providers in the counties of New York, Bronx, Queens, Kings, and Richmond, July 1st to June 30th; (ii)\nfor\nproviders in all other counties, January 1st to December 31st; and\n(iii)\nfor IRA providers defined in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, there will be a one- time, six-month price\nperiod from July 1, 2002 to December 31, 2002. (8)\n\nExcept for residential habilitation\nservices provided in a certified family care home or for at home residential\nhabilitation, a monthly price, based upon annual total reimbursable residential\nhabilitation costs, will be established for the 12 months in an annual price\nperiod. One monthly supervised IRA price for each annual price period will be\nestablished for a provider's supervised IRAs, and one monthly supportive IRA\nprice for each annual price period will be established for a provider's\nsupportive IRAs. Effective January 1, 2010, this methodology shall incorporate\na provider's community residences, if any, so that a single IRA price shall be\nestablished as the reimbursement level for a provider's supervised IRA and/or\nsupervised community residence facilities and a single IRA price shall be\nestablished as the reimbursement level for a provider's supportive IRA and/or\nsupportive community residence facilities. (9)\n\nSupervised IRA residential habilitation\n(supervised IRA RH). (i) Reimbursement for\nresidential habilitation services provided in non-state operated IRAs and CRs\non or after July 1, 2014 shall be in accordance with the provisions of Subpart\n641-1 of this Title. Subpart 641-1 supersedes the provisions of subparagraphs\n(iii)-(vii) of this paragraph for reimbursement of residential habilitation\nservices provided in non-state operated supervised IRAs and CRs on and after\n\nJuly 1, 2014. (ii)\n\nThe unit of\nservice for residential habilitation services provided in non-state operated\nsupervised IRAs and CRs on or after July 1, 2014 shall be a daily unit of\nservice. The requirements of this subparagraph supersede the provisions of\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph for residential habilitation services\nprovided in non-state operated supervised IRAs and CRs on or after July 1, 2014. (iii)\nA monthly supervised\nIRA price will be effective for residential habilitation services delivered in\na provider's supervised IRAs and supervised community residences that have: (a) a valid operating certificate; and\n(b) a site-specific price\napproved by the director of the Division of the Budget. (iv)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, the IRA\noperating and capital reimbursement shall be consolidated with the community\nresidence operating and capital reimbursement and the IRA price shall be\ncalculated as follows: (a) For each provider, the total annual allowable residential habilitation, and room, board and\nprotective oversight costs exclusive of property in effect on December 31, 2009\nfor all supervised IRAs shall be combined with the total annual allowable\nresidential habilitation, and room, board and protective oversight costs\nexclusive of property in effect on December 31, 2009 for all supervised\ncommunity residences in order to establish annual aggregate gross reimbursable\noperating costs. (b) The result in\nclause\n(a) of this subparagraph shall be increased by any\ntrend factor effective on January 1, 2010 and applicable to IRAs in accordance\nsubdivision (i) of this section. (c) The total annual capital reimbursement\nlevels updated pursuant to section\n686.13\n(k)(1)(vi)\nof this Title for January 1, 2010 for all supervised IRAs and pursuant to\nsection\n671.7\n(a)(7)\nof\nthis Title for January 1, 2010 for all supervised community residences, if any, shall be combined into an aggregate annual amount and added to the result in\nclause\n(b) of this subparagraph. (d) The result in clause\n(c) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by the reimbursement offsets described in\nsection\n671.7\n(a)(9) and\n(10)\nof this Title which have been adjusted\nto an annual amount based on billing periods and certified capacities in effect\non January 1, 2010. (e) The result\nin clause\n(d) of this subparagraph shall be divided by 12 and\nthen divided by the total certified capacities of these sites less any\ncertified temporary use bed(s) to determine the uniform monthly supervised IRA\nprice that shall be used to reimburse supervised IRA and supervised community\nresidence facilities beginning on January 1, 2010. This combined price will be\nreferred to as the supervised IRA price. (v) Countable service days. (a) The full month supervised IRA price shall\nbe paid for services provided to an individual who meets the enrollment\nrequirement in subparagraph (11)(ii) of this subdivision and who receives\nface-to-face residential habilitation services in accordance with the\nindividual's individualized service plan (ISP) and residential habilitation\nplan on each of the 22 days of the enrollment requirement. These are known as\ncountable service days. (b) One-half of the full month supervised IRA price shall be paid for services\nprovided to an individual who meets the enrollment requirement in subparagraph\n(11)(iii) of this subdivision and who receives face-to-face residential\nhabilitation services in accordance with the individual's ISP and residential\nhabilitation plan on each of the 11 days of the enrollment requirement. These\nare known as countable service days. (vi)\n\nNewly certified sites. A newly certified\nsite is an IRA whose reimbursable costs are not already included in the monthly\nprice and at which a provider is initially approved to deliver services\npursuant to an operating certificate issued by OPWDD. A newly certified site's\nannual total reimbursable residential habilitation costs and certified capacity\nshall be included in the monthly price as calculated in accordance with\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph except for capital moveable equipment and\nproperty insurance components after December 31, 2010. If two countable service\ndays are possible in the month of certification, the new site shall be included\nin the monthly price in the month of certification. If two countable service\ndays are not possible in the month of certification, the new site shall be\nincluded in the monthly price effective the month after the month of\ncertification. (vii)\n\nEffective\n\nJanuary 1, 2011, capital moveable equipment and property insurance shall become\nfixed values contained in the cost category other than personal services. (a) The fixed value amounts for each-capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance-shall be determined by OPWDD after\nreviewing the amounts, if any and as available, reported in a provider's annual\ncost reports for its supervised IRA sites for three successive years. For\n\nRegion I reporting providers, the three fiscal years ending 6/30/2007, 6/30/2008 and 6/30/2009 shall be reviewed. For Region II and Region III\nreporting providers, the three calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009 shall be\nreviewed. The values for capital moveable equipment and the values for property\ninsurance shall be analyzed in terms of bed capacity and detrended to base year\nvalues. The bed capacities shall be those reflected in the prices on the last\nday of the respective reporting years. The highest value for per bed detrended\ncapital moveable equipment and the highest value for per bed detrended property\ninsurance shall be selected. OPWDD will not select any value that exceeds\neither of the other two values by more than 20 percent if that value is\ndetermined not to be representative of the provider's costs. The selected\nvalues shall then be adjusted on a pro rata basis to correspond to the bed\ncapacities reflected in the January 1, 2011, price. For providers which have\nnot operated any supervised IRAs or supervised CRs, the annual budgeted capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance amounts approved by OPWDD will be\ndivided by the units of service OPWDD authorized for the current price\nperiod. (b) For providers which\noperate both supervised IRAs and supervised community residences, the capital\nmoveable equipment values will be the combined amounts, if any and as\navailable, reported in the annual cost reports for the supervised IRAs and the\nsupervised CRs for each of the years. The property insurance values will be the\ncombined amounts, if any and as available, reported in the annual costs reports\nfor the supervised IRAs and the supervised CRs for each of the years. Associated bed capacities for the selected values shall be the combined bed\ncapacities as reflected in the prices of the supervised IRAs and in the fees of\nthe supervised CRs. (c) As of\n\nJanuary 1, 2011, for Region II and Region III reporting providers, or July 1, 2011, for Region I reporting providers, the fixed values for capital moveable\nequipment and property insurance shall be subject to trend factor increases\napplied to the operating components of the price. (d) The residential habilitation efficiency\nadjustment which was effective October 1, 2010, and any efficiency adjustments\neffective after December 31, 2010, shall not be applied to the capital moveable\nequipment and property insurance components of the supervised IRA\nprice. (10)\n\nMonthly supportive IRA price. (i) Reimbursement for residential habilitation services provided in non-state\noperated IRAs and CRs on or after July 1, 2014 shall be in accordance with the\nprovisions of Subpart 641-1 of this Title. Subpart 641-1 supersedes the\nprovisions of subparagraphs (ii) - (v) of this paragraph for reimbursement of\nresidential habilitation services provided in non-state operated supportive\nIRAs and CRs on and after July 1, 2014. (ii)\nA monthly supportive IRA price will be\neffective for residential habilitation services delivered in a provider's\nsupportive IRAs and supportive community residences that have: (a) a valid operating certificate; and\n(b) a site-specific price\napproved by the director of the Division of the Budget. (iii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, the IRA\noperating and capital reimbursement shall be consolidated with the community\nresidence operating and capital reimbursement and the IRA price shall be\ncalculated as follows: (a) For each provider, the total annual allowable residential habilitation, and room, board and\nprotective oversight costs exclusive of property in effect on December 31, 2009\nfor all supportive IRAs shall be combined with the total annual allowable\nresidential habilitation, and room, board and protective oversight costs\nexclusive of property in effect on December 31, 2009 for all supportive\ncommunity residences in order to establish annual aggregate gross reimbursable\noperating costs. (b) The result in\nclause\n(a) of this subparagraph shall be increased by any\ntrend factor effective on January 1, 2010 and applicable to IRAs in accordance\nwith subdivision (i) of this section. (c) The total annual capital reimbursement\nlevels updated pursuant to section\n686.13\n(k)(1)(vi)\nof this Title for January 1, 2010 for all supported IRAs and pursuant to\nsection\n671.7\n(a)(7)\nof\nthis Title for January 1, 2010 for all supported community residences, if any, shall be combined into an aggregate annual amount and added to the result in\nclause\n(b) of this subparagraph. (d) The result in clause\n(c) of this subparagraph shall be reduced by the reimbursement offsets described in\nsection\n671.7\n(a)(9) and\n(10)\nof this Title which have been adjusted\nto an annual amount based on billing periods and certified capacities in effect\non January 1, 2010. (e) The result\nin clause\n(d) of this subparagraph shall be divided by 12 and\nthen divided by the total certified capacities of these sites less any\ncertified temporary use bed(s) to determine the uniform monthly supportive IRA\nprice that shall be used to reimburse supportive IRA and supportive community\nresidence facilities. This combined price will be referred to as the supportive\nIRA price. (iv)\n\nCountable\nservice days. (a) The full month supportive\nIRA price shall be paid for services provided to an individual who meets the\nenrollment requirement in subparagraph (11)(ii) of this subdivision and who\nreceives face-to-face residential habilitation services in accordance with the\nindividual's ISP and residential habilitation plan on four of the 22 days of\nthe enrollment requirement. Services provided on these four days must be\ndelivered, initiated or concluded at the site. No more than two days of service\nwithin a week may be counted toward the four-day requirement. These four days\nare countable service days. (b) One-half of the full month supportive IRA price shall be paid for services\nprovided to an individual who meets the enrollment requirement in subparagraph\n(11)(iii) of this subdivision and who receives face-to-face residential\nhabilitation services in accordance with the individual's ISP and residential\nhabilitation plan on two of the 11 days of the enrollment requirement. Services\nprovided on these two days must be delivered, initiated or concluded at the\nsite. No more than one day of service within a week may be counted toward the\ntwo-day requirement. These two days are countable service\ndays. (v) Newly certified\nsites. A newly certified site is an IRA whose reimbursable costs are not\nalready included in the monthly price and at which a provider is initially\napproved to deliver services pursuant to an operating certificate issued by\nOPWDD. The approved total annual budgeted costs established for newly certified\nsupportive IRA sites after June 30, 2011 shall reflect a two percent reduction\nin operating costs as was implemented for providers on July 1, 2011 pursuant to\nsubparagraph (18)(iii) of this subdivision. A newly certified site's annual\ntotal reimbursable residential habilitation costs and certified capacity shall\nbe included in the monthly price as calculated in accordance with subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph except for capital moveable equipment and property\ninsurance components after December 31, 2010. If two countable service days are\npossible in the month of certification, the new site shall be included in the\nmonthly price in the month of certification. If two countable service days are\nnot possible in the month of certification, the new site shall be included in\nthe monthly price effective the month after the month of\ncertification. (vi)\n\nEffective\n\nJanuary 1, 2011, capital moveable equipment and property insurance shall become\nfixed values contained in the cost category other than personal services. (a) The fixed value amounts for each-capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance-shall be determined by OPWDD after\nreviewing the amounts, if any and as available, reported in a provider's annual\ncost reports for its supportive IRA sites for three successive years. For\n\nRegion I reporting providers, the three fiscal years ending 6/30/2007, 6/30/2008 and 6/30/2009 shall be reviewed. For Region II and Region III\nreporting providers, the three calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009 shall be\nreviewed. The values for capital moveable equipment and the values for property\ninsurance shall be analyzed in terms of bed capacity as reflected in the price\nand detrended to base year values. The bed capacities shall be those reflected\nin the prices on the last day of the respective reporting years. The highest\nvalue for per bed detrended capital moveable equipment and the highest value\nfor per bed detrended property insurance shall be selected. OPWDD will not\nselect any value that exceeds either of the other two values by more than 20\npercent if that value is determined not to be representative of the provider's\ncosts. The selected values shall then be adjusted on a pro rata basis to\ncorrespond to the bed capacities reflected in the January 1, 2011, price. For\nproviders which have not operated any supportive IRAs or supportive CRs, the\nannual budgeted capital moveable equipment and property insurance amounts\napproved by OPWDD will be divided by the units of service OPWDD authorized for\nthe current price period. (b) For\nproviders which operate both supportive IRAs and supportive CRs, the capital\nmoveable equipment values will be the combined amounts, if any and as\navailable, reported in the annual cost reports for the supportive IRAs and the\nsupportive CRs for each of the years. The property insurance values will be the\ncombined amounts, if any and as available, reported in the annual costs reports\nfor the supportive IRAs and the supportive CRs for each of the years. Associated bed capacities for the selected values shall be the combined bed\ncapacities as reflected in the prices of the supportive IRAs and in the fees of\nthe supportive CRs on the last day of the respective reporting year. (c) As of January 1, 2011, for Region II and\n\nRegion III reporting providers, or July 1, 2011, for Region I reporting\nproviders, the fixed values for capital moveable equipment and property\ninsurance shall be subject to trend factor increases applied to the operating\ncomponents of the price. (d) Efficiency adjustments effective after December 31, 2010, shall not be applied\nto the capital moveable equipment and property insurance components of the\nsupportive IRA price. (11)\n\nEnrollment requirements for individuals\nenrolled in a supervised or supportive IRA. (i) Effective July 1, 2014, for the provider\nto be paid for a daily unit of supervised IRA RH the individual must be\nenrolled at the supervised IRA and either services are provided or the person\nis eligible for a therapeutic leave or retainer day in accordance with the\nprovisions of paragraph (12) of this subdivision.

Once OPWDD has informed the provider of the appeal\noutcome, a provider which submits a revised cost report for the period reviewed\nshall not be entitled to an increase in the award determination based on that\nresubmission. (17)\n\nThe prices or\nfees determined in accordance with this subdivision shall not be considered\nfinal unless approved by the director of the Division of the Budget. (18)\n\nDetermination of the efficiency\nadjustment for individualized residential alternatives (IRAs): (i) Effective January 1, 2003, there shall be\nan efficiency adjustment for IRAs as follows: (a) The efficiency adjustment shall be a\npercentage reduction applied to the allowed administration operating\nreimbursements for residential habilitation services and room, board and\nprotective oversight (see section\n686.13\n[k][1]\nof\nthis Title) in the IRA price in effect on December 31, 2002. (b) The efficiency adjustment described\nherein will not apply to: (1)\nany IRA price\nwhich was initially calculated for the conversion of a community residence or\nintermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities\n(ICF/IID), to an IRA providing residential habilitation services; (2)\nany IRA price which was calculated for a\nnewly certified site providing residential habilitation services in which 75\npercent or more of the individuals resided in a developmental center\nimmediately prior to residing in that IRA; or\n(3)\nadministration operating reimbursements\nfor residential habilitation services provided in the individual's home or in a\ncertified family care home. (c) Reimbursement for administration\noperating costs for IRAs newly certified on or after January 1, 2003, except\nthose described in subclauses (\nb\n)(\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this subparagraph, will reflect the percentage\nreductions determined in clause (\ng\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (d) All information\nused to determine the efficiency adjustment percentage described in clause\n(\ng\n) of this subparagraph based on allowed IRA administration\noperating reimbursements for the calendar 2001 or the 2001-2002 price\nperiod. (e) Each provider is\nassigned to one of three geographical regions (see section\n635-4.1\n[b][3]\nof\nthis Part). (f) Within each region, the providers' allowed IRA administration operating reimbursements per\nindividual are ranked in descending order. The rankings are grouped into five\ngroups, beginning with Group 5 which contains the providers with the highest\nadministration operating reimbursement per individual and continuing on to\n\nGroup 1 which contains the providers with the lowest administration operating\nreimbursement per individual. Each such group represents one fifth of the\nproviders in the region. The dollar ranges in administration operating\nreimbursement per individual that determine a provider's placement in a group\nare shown in the following table: Region\n\nGroup 5\n\nGroup 4\n\nGroup 3\n\nGroup 2\n\nGroup 1\nI\n$11,974+\n$11,973-$10,947\n$10,946-$9,698\n$9,697-$8,061\n$8,060-0\nII\n$11,677+\n$11,676-$9,238\n$9,237-$7,707\n$7,706-$6,830\n$6,829-0\nIII\n$10,404+\n$10,403-$8,800\n$8,799-$7,488\n$7,487-$6,059\n+$6,058-0\n(g) The following chart indicates the percentage reduction to allowed IRA\nadministration operating reimbursements for each group in each region: Region\n\nGroup 5\n\nGroup 4\n\nGroup 3\n\nGroup 2\n\nGroup 1\nI\n4.285%\n3.428%\n2.571%\n1.714%\n0.0%\nII\n5.435%\n4.348%\n3.261%\n2.174%\n0.0%\nIII\n5.310%\n4.248%\n3.186%\n2.124%\n0.0%\n(h) Within each region, a provider's adjusted administration operating\nreimbursement per individual shall not be greater than the adjusted\nadministration operating reimbursement of a provider in a higher numbered\ngroup. In those cases where the percentage reductions described herein would\nproduce that result, the provider in the higher numbered group shall have their\nadministration operating reimbursement per individual further adjusted to be\nequal to the adjusted administration operating reimbursement per individual of\nthe highest ranked provider in the lower numbered group. (ii)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, for providers\nin all regions there shall be an efficiency adjustment applied to the IRA price\nfor the residential habilitation services provided in supervised IRAs and\nsupervised community residences. (a) There\nshall be three components of the efficiency adjustment as follows: (1)\n\nNon-personal Services (NPS). Providers\nwhich demonstrate a level of NPS at or above the benchmark described in item\n(\nii\n) of this subclause shall be subject to a reduction in the\nsupervised IRA price. (i) For the purposes of\nthis efficiency adjustment, NPS includes site other than personal services\n(OTPS), transportation, and expensed equipment as contained in the supervised\nIRA price. NPS does not include personal services, contracted personal\nservices, fringe benefits, total program administration, total agency\nadministration, health care adjustments (HCA), capital costs and State paid\nitems. (ii)\n\nThe benchmark is\npredicated on the value of all NPS contained in a provider's supervised IRA\nprice in effect on June 30, 2008 for Region I reporting providers and on\n\nDecember 31, 2007 for Region II and Region III reporting providers. This value\nis expressed as a percentage of the total operating costs including\ntransportation and HCA but exclusive of capitalized property contained in a\nprovider's supervised IRA price on the respective date. The percentages for\neach provider offering residential habilitation services are ranked ordinally. OPWDD has established the benchmark at the 15th percentile. All providers below\nthe 15th percentile in the ordinal ranking are exempt from the NPS\nreduction. (iii)\n\nFor all providers\nranked at or above the benchmark, the reduction shall be applied to NPS\noperating costs contained in the supervised IRA price in effect on October 1, 2010. (iv)\n\nThe percentage reduction\nshall be 18 percent. (2)\n\nAdministration. Providers which demonstrate a level of administration contained\nin the supervised IRA price at or above the benchmark described in item\n(\nii\n) of this subclause shall be subject to a reduction in the\nsupervised IRA price. (i) For the purposes of\nthis efficiency adjustment administration includes total program administration\nand total agency administration contained in the supervised IRA price. Both\ntotal program administration and total agency administration include components\nrepresenting personal services, administrative contracted services, administrative OTPS and administrative fringe benefits. (ii)\n\nThe benchmark is predicated on the\ncombined value of total program administration and total agency administration\ncontained in a provider's supervised IRA price in effect on June 30, 2008 for\n\nRegion I reporting providers and on December 31, 2007 for Region II and Region\nIII reporting providers. This value is expressed as a percentage of the total\noperating costs including transportation and the HCA but exclusive of\ncapitalized property contained in a provider's supervised IRA price on the\nrespective date. The percentages for each provider offering residential\nhabilitation services are ranked ordinally. OPWDD has established the benchmark\nat the 15th percentile. All providers below the 15th percentile in the ordinal\nranking are exempt from the administration reduction. (iii)\n\nFor all providers ranked at or above\nthe benchmark, the reduction shall be applied to total program administration\nand total agency administration operating costs contained in the supervised IRA\nprice in effect on October 1, 2010. (iv)\n\nThe percentage reduction shall be five\npercent. (3)\n\nResidual\nadjustment. For providers subject to either one or both of the reductions\ndescribed in subclauses (\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this\nclause, a residual adjustment shall be implemented as described in items\n(\ni\n) and (\nii\n) of this subclause. The residual\nadjustment shall confine the aggregate effect of this efficiency adjustment and\nan offset factor of $44 per unit of service to a range between a minimum of 1.5\npercent and a maximum of 3.5 percent of the total supervised IRA price on\n\nOctober 1, 2010. (i) For providers which\nwould realize a reduction in the total supervised IRA price less than 1.5\npercent after combining the effects subclauses (\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this clause and $44 per unit of service, the total\nefficiency adjustment shall be increased to 1.5 percent of the total supervised\nIRA price in effect on October 1, 2010. (ii)\n\nFor providers which would realize a\nreduction in the total supervised IRA price greater than 3.5 percent after\ncombining the effects of subclauses (\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this clause and $44 per unit of service, the total\nefficiency adjustment shall be held to 3.5 percent of the total supervised IRA\nprice in effect on October 1, 2010. (b) New sites. To the extent that a provider\nis subject to this efficiency adjustment, a corresponding correction to\napproved budgeted costs for new sites shall be made so that the percentage\noffsets in effect before inclusion of the new site-18 percent NPS, 5 percent\nadministration and any residual adjustment thereto-shall be preserved when the\nnew site's budgeted costs are included in the calculation of the supervised IRA\nprice. (c) For purposes of\nrequesting a price adjustment, the effects of this efficiency adjustment\nresulting from the NPS and administrative reductions as described in subclauses\n(\na\n)(\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this\nsubparagraph as well as any subsequent residual adjustment thereto per\nsubclause (\na\n)(\n3\n) of this subparagraph shall\nnot be construed as a basis for loss. In processing a price adjustment, any\nrevised price will be offset by the monetary effects of the NPS and\nadministrative reductions including the residual adjustment thereto, if\nany. (d) The commissioner at his or\nher discretion may waive all or a portion of the NPS reduction as described in\nsubclause (\na\n)(\n1\n) of this subparagraph and/or\nthe administrative reduction as described in subclause\n(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this subparagraph for a provider\nupon the provider demonstrating that the imposition of the reduction(s) would\njeopardize the continued operation of the IRA(s) and/or community\nresidence(s). (iii)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011, supportive IRA prices shall be revised to reflect a two\npercent reduction to the operating components of the price in effect on June\n30, 2011. For the purposes of a vacancy price adjustment, the effects of this\nreduction shall not be construed as a basis for loss. (iv)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011, supervised IRA\nprices shall be reduced according to the measures outlined in this\nsubparagraph. There are two distinct actions to the price reductions. The\npersonal services action addresses provider surpluses in funding for direct\ncare, clinical and support staff and the associated fringe benefits. The\nadministrative action addresses reimbursable administrative costs and holds\nreimbursement to a level of efficiency. Providers may be subject to only one\naction or to both actions or they may be exempt from both. (a) Applicability. The price reductions will\napply to all providers except for those which meet the criteria for exemption. The first criterion, in order for any provider to be exempt from the impact of\nthe reduction on any basis, is a cost report requirement. Region I providers\nmust have filed a 2008-2009 cost report and Regions II and III providers must\nhave filed a 2008 cost report on or before December 23, 2010, except that a\nprovider may submit the cost report after December 23, 2010 if the cost report\nrepresents an original submission or a resubmission specifically requested by\nOPWDD due to identified inaccuracies or insufficiencies. Cost reports submitted\nafter December 23, 2010 must be submitted by May 1, 2011 unless the\ncommissioner exercises or has exercised his or her discretion to extend the May\n1, 2011 deadline. Providers with cost reports submitted in accordance with the\ndeadlines in this clause may qualify for exemption from the personal services\nsurpluses action pursuant to subclause (\nb\n)(\n1\n)\nof this subparagraph. Providers with cost reports submitted in accordance with\nthe deadlines in this clause may qualify for exemption from the administrative\naction pursuant to subclause (\nc\n)(\n1\n) of this\nsubparagraph. Providers which did not submit cost reports in accordance with\nthe deadlines in this clause shall be subject to price reductions pursuant to\nclause (\nd\n) of this subparagraph. OPWDD shall employ data\nextracted from the most recent 2008/2008-2009 cost report submitted by a\nprovider on or before December 23, 2010, except that data from a 2008/2008-2009\ncost report submitted after December 23, 2010 representing an original\nsubmission or a resubmission specifically requested by OPWDD due to identified\ninaccuracies or insufficiencies and submitted by May 1, 2011 or a later\ndeadline extended by the commissioner shall also be utilized. For providers of\nsupervised residential habilitation services which did not operate group day\nhabilitation or supplemental group day habilitation programs for the cost\nreporting year 2008/2008-2009, the components subjected to analysis relate to\nthe provider's supervised IRAs. For providers which did operate group day\nhabilitation and/or supplemental group day habilitation programs for the cost\nreporting year 2008/2008-2009, the components subjected to analysis relate to\nthe combination of the provider's supervised IRAs, group day habilitation\nand/or supplemental group day habilitation services. Additionally, for\nproviders which converted a residential program to a supervised IRA or a day\nprogram to a group or supplemental group day habilitation program subsequent to\nthe 2008/2008-2009 cost report period, OPWDD incorporated the data included in\nthe 2008/2008-2009 cost report(s) for the converted program(s) prior to\nconversion into its analyses. (b) Personal services surpluses action. (1)\n\nExemptions. (i) Providers with FTE personal\nservices losses and actual personal services fringe benefit percentages greater\nthan the reimbursable percentages are exempt. To qualify for this exemption, a\nprovider must meet each of the two criteria which follow. (A)\nFTE personal services loss. OPWDD\ncompared each provider's actual FTEs for direct care, clinical care and support\nas reported in its 2008/2008-2009 cost report to the maximum reimbursable FTEs\ndesignated for direct care, clinical care and support as reflected in the\ncorresponding price(s). This analysis included the FTE equivalents for\ncontracted services. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated\nan excess of actual FTEs over reimbursable FTEs. They meet the first criterion\nfor this exemption. (B)\n\nFringe\nbenefit percentage. The fringe benefit percentage equals the total fringe\nbenefits costs for direct care, clinical and support staff divided by the\nsalary costs for direct care, clinical and support staff expressed as a\npercentage. For the providers which meet the criterion in subitem\n(\nA\n) of this item, OPWDD compared each provider's actual direct\ncare, clinical and support services associated fringe benefit percentage as\nevidenced by its 2008/2008-2009 cost report data to the reimbursable direct\ncare, clinical and support services associated fringe benefit percentage as\nreflected in the corresponding price(s). OPWDD identified a subset of providers\nwith actual fringe benefit percentages that were higher than the fringe benefit\npercentage in the price(s). They are exempt. (ii)\n\nProviders with a loss in personal\nservices and associated fringe benefits combined are exempt. OPWDD examined\n2008/2008-2009 cost reports for those providers not exempted by virtue of item\n(\ni\n) of this subclause. OPWDD compared each provider's actual\nexpenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the associated fringe\nbenefits to the total reimbursable costs reflected in the corresponding\nprice(s) and designated for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits cost categories. This analysis included contracted\nservices. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated an excess\nof actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits over reimbursable costs reflected in the\ncorresponding price(s) and designated for direct care, clinical care and\nsupport and the associated fringe benefits. They are exempt. (iii)\n\nProviders with aggregate unmodified\nsurpluses. Providers not exempted by virtue of item (\ni\n) or\n(\nii\n) of this subclause were identified as having aggregate\nunmodified surpluses equal to the amount by which the aggregated reimbursable\ncosts as reflected in the prices and designated for direct care, clinical care\nand support and the associated fringe benefits exceeded the corresponding\naggregated actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits as reported in those providers' cost reports for\nreporting year 2008/2008-2009. (iv)\n\nTo/from transportation modification. For all providers with aggregate\nunmodified surpluses as defined in item (\niii\n) of this\nsubclause, OPWDD examined their 2008/2008-2009 cost reports. OPWDD compared the\nprovider's aggregated actual expenses for to/from transportation to the\naggregated total reimbursable costs reflected in the corresponding price(s) and\ndesignated for to/from transportation. If the aggregated total reimbursable\ncosts exceeded aggregated actual expenses for to/from transportation, OPWDD\nadded the amount of this excess to the aggregate unmodified surplus amount\ncalculated pursuant to item (\niii\n) of this subclause to yield\nthe aggregate surplus. Conversely, if the aggregated actual expenses for\nto/from transportation exceeded the aggregated total reimbursable costs\nreflected in the corresponding price(s) for to/from transportation, OPWDD\noffset the unmodified surplus amount calculated pursuant to item\n(\niii\n) of this subclause by this difference to derive the\naggregate surplus. If, however, this calculation yielded a negative number for\nany provider, it is not considered a surplus and such provider is\nexempt. (2)\n\nProviders\nsubject to the personal services surpluses action are those providers which are\nnot specifically exempted pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this\nclause. (3)\n\nUntrended tentative\naggregate gross reduction. A provider identified as having an aggregate surplus\nafter the to/from transportation modification pursuant to the analysis\nconducted by OPWDD as described in item\n(\n1\n)(\niv\n) of this clause shall be subject to a\nprice reduction. This aggregate surplus is referred to as the untrended\ntentative aggregate gross reduction. (4)\n\nTentative aggregate gross reduction. The\ntentative aggregate gross reduction equals the untrended tentative aggregate\ngross reduction pursuant to subclause (\n3\n) of this clause\ntrended to June 30, 2011 dollars. (c) Administrative action. (1)\n\nExemptions. (i) Total agency revenue exemption. Providers\nwith total agency gross revenues less than $1.5 million dollars as reflected in\nthe agency fiscal summaries of their 2008/2008-2009 cost reports are\nexempt. (ii)\n\nCompensation\nexemption. For each provider not exempted by virtue of item\n(\ni\n) of this subclause, OPWDD extracted from the governing\nboard and compensation summaries in its 2008/2008-2009 cost report the total\nannualized compensation of all employees with agency administrative titles. Using this dollar value, OPWDD compared the total annualized compensation to\nthe total agency revenue as described in item (\ni\n) of this\nsubclause to establish a value that expressed the total annualized compensation\nas a percentage of total agency revenue. OPWDD identified a subset of providers\nwith percentages equal to or less than one half of one percent. They are\nexempt. (iii)\n\nAdministrative\nexpenses as a percent of operating expenses exemption. For providers not\nexempted by virtue of item (\ni\n) or (\nii\n) of\nthis subclause, total reimbursable administration (agency and program including\nfringe benefits) costs as reflected in the price(s) corresponding to the\nprovider's 2008/2008-2009 reporting year were expressed as a percentage of the\ntotal reimbursable operating costs in that price (those prices). As a\nprerequisite to this calculation, when appropriate, respective amounts were\nadjusted for capacity changes that occurred throughout the year. OPWDD\nidentified a subset of providers with percentages of less than 10 percent. They\nare exempt. (2)\n\nProviders\nsubject to the administrative action are those providers which are not\nspecifically exempted pursuant to subclause (\n1\n) of this\nclause. (3)\n\nTentative aggregate\ngross reduction. For providers subject to the administrative action, OPWDD used\nthe compensation data also used in item\n(\n1\n)(\nii\n) of this clause and the reported\nnumber of FTEs corresponding to those administrative titles as reported in\nproviders' 2008/2008-2009 cost reports. OPWDD computed a provider-specific\naverage compensation per FTE for the administrative titles. Similarly, OPWDD\ncomputed a provider-specific average compensation per FTE for direct care, clinical and support staff using data from providers' 2008/2008-2009 cost\nreports. (Direct care, clinical and support staff collectively are referred to\nas direct support staff.) The compensation data for both administrative titles\nand direct support titles included fringe benefits. A ratio of average\nadministrative compensation to average direct support compensation was\ndetermined for each provider. Providers' ratios were then ranked and separated\ninto 5 graduated levels. A reduction percentage was established to correspond\nto each level of compensation ratios. The reduction percentage for a provider\nis dependent on a provider's positioning in the five levels. The following\nchart gives the explicit ranges for the compensation ratios and the applicable\nreduction percentage. Compensation Ratios\n\nReimbursable Administrative\n\nCosts\n\nAdministration to Direct\n\nSupport\n\nReduction Percentage\n\nEqual to or greater than 10.0:1\n9.0%\nEqual to or greater than 6.0:1 but less than\n10.0:1\n7.5%\nEqual to or greater than 4.0:1 but less than\n6.0:1\n6.0%\nEqual to or greater than 3.0:1 but less than\n4.0:1\n4.0%\nLess than 3.0:1\n2.0%\nThe tentative aggregate gross reduction equals the\nreduction percentage determined by a provider's ranking in the compensation\nratio comparisons applied to that provider's aggregate reimbursable\nadministrative costs as reflected in the corresponding price(s) at June 30, 2011. (d) Total\nimpact limitation. Before OPWDD revises a provider's supervised IRA price, it\nshall assess the total impact on a provider of all the tentative gross\nreductions and tentative aggregate gross reductions pursuant to this\nsubparagraph and paragraphs (c)(16), (e)(6) of this section and section\n671.7\n(a)(13)\nof\nthis Title, combined with the final price and fee reductions pursuant to\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, paragraph (d)(6) and clauses\n(h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n), and (ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection and 671.7(a)(12) of this Title. The total impact to an individual\nprovider shall be limited to an amount not to exceed 6.5 percent of the\naggregated total gross reimbursable operating costs as reflected in a\nprovider's June 30, 2011 prices and the aggregated total gross allowable\nreimbursement reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 fees for the provider's\nprograms and/or services subject to the price and fee revisions. The lesser of\nthe amount of the total impact or the amount of the total impact as limited by\nthe 6.5 percent provision represents the final impact. For providers for which\nno 2008/2008-2009 cost reports were available because the conditions\nestablished in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph were not met, the total impact is calculated as follows: The aggregated total gross\nreimbursable operating costs as reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 prices\nand the aggregated total gross allowable reimbursement as reflected in a\nprovider's June 30, 2011 fees for the provider's programs and/or services\nsubject to the price and fee revisions are summed. The total is multiplied by\n6.5 percent. The product is the final impact for these providers. (e) Allocation of final impact. Before\nallocation, the final impact on a provider shall be reduced by the final price\nand fee reductions pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, paragraph\n(d)(6) and clauses (h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n) and\n(ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this section and section\n671.7\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Title because those reductions are not subject to any further revisions. The remainder of the final impact on a provider shall be distributed equitably\nacross the reimbursable operating costs in that provider's supervised\nresidential habilitation, group day habilitation, supplemental group day\nhabilitation and prevocational services in proportion to the amount of\nreduction each of these programs would have incurred had the reductions been\ncalculated separately. OPWDD shall make an internal allocation within the price\nfor providers subject to both the personal services surplus action and the\nadministrative action pursuant to this subparagraph. (f) Final supervised IRA price reduction\npercentage. The allocation of the final impact to a provider's supervised\nresidential habilitation services shall be expressed as a percentage of the\ntotal gross reimbursable operating costs reflected in the price in effect on\n\nJune 30, 2011. (g) The final\nsupervised IRA price shall be the supervised IRA price in effect on June 30, 2011 reduced by the final supervised IRA price reduction percentage pursuant to\nclause (\nf\n) of this subparagraph applied to that\nprice. (h) For the purposes of\nrequesting a price adjustment, the effects of this price reduction shall not be\nconstrued as a basis for loss. In processing a price adjustment, any revised\nprice will be offset by the monetary impact, prorated as appropriate, of the\nprice reduction as calculated pursuant to this clause. (i) The commissioner, at his or her\ndiscretion, may waive all or a portion of this adjustment for a provider upon\nthe provider demonstrating that the imposition of the reduction would\njeopardize the continued operation of the residential habilitation\nservices. (19)\n\nAt home residential habilitation (AHRH) services. Only paragraphs (15), (17)\nand (19)-(21) of this subdivision shall apply to AHRH services which were\nprovided on or after February 1, 2009 and prior to November 1, 2010. Effective\n\nNovember 1, 2010, providers which were authorized to provide AHRH services\nimmediately prior to that date are authorized to provide community habilitation\nservices (see subdivision [ab] of this section). (i) AHRH services are residential\nhabilitation services provided to individuals who do not reside in a residence\nwhich is certified or operated by OPWDD. (ii)\nAHRH services may be self-directed, family-directed, or managed solely by an agency. (iii)\nservices must be delivered at the\nindividual's home, or be initiated or concluded there. (iv)\n\nReimbursement shall be contingent upon\nprior OPWDD approval. (v) Reimbursement shall be contingent on documentation that those receiving the\nservice have received the services specified in each person's Individualized\n\nService Plan (ISP) and at home residential habilitation plan. (vi)\n\nThe unit of service for AHRH services\nshall be one hour equaling 60 minutes, and is reimbursed in 15-minute\nincrements. When there is a break in the service delivery during a single day, the provider may combine, for billing purposes, the duration of each continuous\nperiod of service provision (or session) that is provided during the\nday. (vii)\n\nOnly time when AHRH\nstaff are present with the individual and providing services may be counted\ntoward the billable service time. (viii)\n\nFor each continuous service delivery\nperiod or session, the AHRH provider must document the service start time and\nthe service stop time, the ratio of individual to staff at the time of service\ndelivery, and the provision of at least one service/staff action delivered in\naccordance with the individual's AHRH Plan. (ix)\n\nBillable service time is time when staff\nare providing face-to-face AHRH services to an individual in accordance with\nthe individual's AHRH Plan. Time spent receiving another Medicaid service\ncannot be counted toward the AHRH billable service time, except as follows: (a) The individual may concurrently receive\nhospice and AHRH services. (b) Time\nwhen the Medicaid service coordination (MSC) service coordinator is conducting\nthe face-to-face MSC visit with the individual may be counted toward the AHRH\nbilling as long as the AHRH staff is present. This is allowed in order to\npromote the coordination of services. (c) Personal care / home health aide and\nnursing services may be provided concurrently with AHRH services, but only in\ncases where the AHRH Plan describes supports and services that are distinct and\nseparate from the supports and services being provided by the personal care /\nhome health aide or nursing staff. (d) AHRH may be billed when the AHRH staff\nperson is with the person at a medical appointment with a physician (including\npsychiatrist), nurse practitioner or physician assistant, or at a dental\nappointment. The time when an individual is being transported to and from the\nappointment may also be counted as long as the staff accompanies the individual\nand Medicaid is not being charged for a transportation attendant for the\ntrip. (e) AHRH may be billed when\nthe AHRH staff is with the individual at an appointment for a clinical service\nof the type specified in this clause in order to facilitate the implementation\nof therapeutic methods and treatments in the home. The time when an individual\nis being transported to and from the appointment may also be counted as long as\nthe staff accompanies the individual and Medicaid is not being charged for a\ntransportation attendant for the trip. (1)\n\nThe need for the AHRH staff's participation in the specified clinical service\nmust be described in the individual's AHRH Plan. (2)\n\nThe types of clinical service are\noccupational therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, psychology, dietetics\nand nutrition, and social work.

The following applies to the reimbursement of AHRH services provided\non or after February 1, 2009. Reimbursement for AHRH services is not available\nfor services provided on or after November 1, 2010. However, OPWDD may continue\nto effectuate fee reductions on or after November 1, 2010 for services\ndelivered prior to such date in accordance with the provisions of clause\n(ii)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (i) Hourly fee schedule structure. Hourly\nfees are based on the following: (a) The\nregion in which the service is delivered - region I, region II or region III. (1)\n\nRegion I (NYC) is New York City and\nincludes the counties of New York, Bronx, Kings, Queens and Richmond, (2)\n\nRegion II (NYC suburban) includes the\ncounties of Putnam, Rockland, Nassau, Suffolk, and Westchester, (3)\n\nRegion III (upstate New York) includes\nall other counties of New York State; and\n(b) The number of individuals being served\nsimultaneously - individual (1) or group serving (2), (3), or (4) or\nmore. (ii)\n\nTransitional\nhourly fees - 2009 and 2010. Providers may be eligible to receive a\ntransitional hourly fee for AHRH - Individual or AHRH - Group during a 23-month\nphase-in period. For the period beginning February 1, 2009 and ending December\n31, 2009, for each region, there will be the standard hourly fee and there will\nbe level I and level II transitional hourly fees. In 2010, for each region, there will be the standard hourly fee and there will be a level I transitional\nhourly fee. OPWDD shall determine a provider's eligibility for the transitional\nhourly fee(s) based on its examination of the provider's costs relative to an\nestimate of the service hours delivered. (a) To determine a provider's initial level of reimbursement for services in 2009, OPWDD will review a region I reporting provider's cost report for the period\n\nJuly 1, 2005 through June 30, 2006 or a region II or a region III reporting\nprovider's cost report for the period January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2006. OPWDD will also obtain an estimate of service hours delivered from the\nprovider's AHRH Data Collection Form - Summary of Service Hours. In addition, OPWDD may use, or request and use, additional financial or service delivery\ninformation as it deems necessary to make its determination. In order to\nqualify for the level II transitional hourly fee, the provider's hourly cost as\ndetermined from OPWDD's analysis must equal or exceed the level II transitional\nhourly fee amount. In order to qualify for the level I transitional hourly fee, the provider's hourly cost as determined from OPWDD's analysis must equal or\nexceed the level I transitional hourly fee amount and be less than the level II\ntransitional hourly fee amount. Providers which do not qualify for a\ntransitional hourly fee will receive the standard hourly fee. (b) Except for situations described in clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph, providers which qualify for a level\nI or level II transitional hourly fee in 2009 will be eligible for the level I\ntransitional hourly fee in 2010. (c) If data obtained subsequent to OPWDD's\ndetermination of a provider's eligibility for a transitional hourly fee does\nnot support that determination, OPWDD may reduce the provider's fee from the\nlevel II transitional hourly fee to the level I transitional hourly fee or from\na transitional hourly fee to the standard hourly fee, retroactive to the date\nas of which the provider received the transitional hourly fee. (1)\n\nIf OPWDD proposes to reduce a provider's\nfee in accordance with this clause, OPWDD shall give the provider at least 60\ndays written notice of the proposed reduction and the reason for it. (2)\n\nIf the provider disagrees with the\nproposed reduction, it may submit evidence to show that its hourly cost equaled\nor exceeded the level I or level II transitional hourly fee amount. In order to\nreceive consideration, the provider must submit the evidence to OPWDD at least\n30 days prior to the proposed effective date of the reduction. (3)\nOPWDD shall consider the provider's\nevidence and shall notify the provider of its final decision in writing within\n30 days of receipt of the evidence. (4)\n\nAny recoupment to effectuate the fee\nreduction shall take place on the 60th day following OPWDD's notice of the\nproposed reduction if the provider did not submit evidence to show that its\nhourly cost equaled or exceeded the level I or level II transitional hourly fee\nor on the 30th day after OPWDD's notice of its final decision if the provider\ndid submit evidence to show that its hourly fee equaled or exceeded the level I\nor level II transitional hourly fee.

(i) Total\nallowable day habilitation costs shall be determined in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n635-10.4\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart and Subpart 635-6 of this Part. (ii)\n\nTotal budgeted costs for day\nhabilitation services shall be compared to the provider's historical costs for\ncomparable services in day treatment or workshop or similar programs for\npersons demonstrating similar needs, or to the provider's historical costs for\nincluded expenditure categories where the provider had not delivered prior\ncomparable services. (iii)\n\nReimbursement shall be contingent upon prior OPWDD approval and documentation\nthat those participating in the program have received the services as specified\nin each person's individualized service plan (ISP) and day habilitation\nplan. (iv)\n\nFor individual day\nhabilitation and supplemental individual day habilitation services provided\nprior to October 1, 2015, total annual reimbursable costs derived through the\napplication of the above methodology shall be trended in accordance with\nsubdivision (i) of this section and divided by the total annual projected hours\nof utilization.

(b) Effective January 1, 2011, capital moveable equipment and property insurance shall become fixed\nvalues contained in the cost category other than personal services. (1)\n\nThe fixed value amounts for each-capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance-shall be determined by OPWDD after\nreviewing the amounts, if any and as available, reported in a provider's annual\ncost reports for its group day habilitation sites for three successive years. For Region I reporting providers, the three fiscal years ending 6/30/2007, 6/30/2008 and 6/30/2009 shall be reviewed. For Region II and Region III\nreporting providers, the three calendar years 2007, 2008, and 2009 shall be\nreviewed. The values for capital moveable equipment and the values for property\ninsurance shall be analyzed in terms of the greater of annual cost report\nreported units of services or units billed for the respective period and\ndetrended to base year values. The highest value for per unit detrended capital\nmoveable equipment and the highest value for per unit detrended property\ninsurance shall be selected. OPWDD will not select any value that exceeds\neither of the other two values by more than 20 percent if that value is\ndetermined not to be representative of the provider's costs. The selected\nvalues shall then be adjusted on a pro rata basis to correspond to the units of\nservice as reflected in the January 1, 2011, price. For providers which have\nnot operated any group day habilitation services, the annual budgeted capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance amounts approved by OPWDD will be\ndivided by the units of service OPWDD authorized for the current price\nperiod. (2)\n\nAs of January 1, 2011, for Region II and Region III reporting providers or July 1, 2011, for Region I\nreporting providers, the fixed values for capital moveable equipment and\nproperty insurance shall be subject to trend factor increases applied to the\noperating components of the price. (3)\n\nEfficiency adjustments effective after\n\nDecember 31, 2010, shall not be applied to the capital moveable equipment and\nproperty insurance components of the group day habilitation price. (4)\nOPWDD may opt to re-examine the capital\nmoveable equipment and property insurance components of the group day\nhabilitation price for purposes of recalculation after December 31, 2015, for\n\nRegion II and Region III reporting providers, and after June 30, 2016, for\n\nRegion I reporting providers. (5)\n\nThe unit of service for individual day\nhabilitation and supplemental individual day habilitation services provided\nprior to October 1, 2015, shall be one hour equaling 60 minutes and is\nreimbursed in 15-minute increments. When there is a break in the service\ndelivery during a single day, for billing purposes, the provider may combine\nthe duration of each non-continuous period of service provision (or \"session\")\nthat is provided during the day, when at least one service/staff action\ndelivered in accordance with the individual's day habilitation plan is\ndocumented for each session.

(b) On a given day, a maximum of the\nfollowing may be reimbursed: (1)\none full\nunit of group day habilitation; or\n(2)\none full unit of a blended service which\nincludes group day habilitation (a blended service is a combination of day\nhabilitation, prevocational services and/or supported employment services); or\n(3)\none full unit of\nprevocational services; or\n(4)\nany\ncombination of two half units of: group day habilitation, prevocational\nservices or blended services. (ii)\n\nLimit of one and a half units or three\nhalf units. (a) This limit applies to an\nindividual who receives supplemental group day habilitation on a given\nday. (b) On a given day, a maximum\nof the following may be reimbursed: (1)\none\nfull unit of group day habilitation, supplemental group day habilitation, prevocational services or blended services and one half unit of any of these\nservices; or\n(2)\nthree half units\nof any of these services. (iii)\n\nFor individuals who live in an IRA, CR\nor FCH and receive community habilitation on a given day, additional billing\nlimits are described in paragraph (ab)(11) of this section. (iv)\n\nWhere more than one agency delivers\nservices on a given day to the same individual, the total number of units\nand/or hours of CH services billed for that day by all agencies may not exceed\nthe maximum allowed daily units and/or hours described in subparagraphs\n(i)-(iv) of this paragraph. (v) Exceptions. The following applies only to requests made prior to October 1, 2014. (a) An agency providing, or proposing\nto provide, services to an individual who is eligible to receive supplemental\ngroup day habilitation may request a waiver from the limits established in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (b) The billing limits established in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may be waived on an individual basis by the\ncommissioner if the commissioner finds, based on the request submitted by the\nagency: (1)\nthat services in excess of the\nlimit are necessary to preserve the health or safety of the individual; and\n(2)\nthat alternative services\nwhich are not subject to the limit have been considered to meet the health or\nsafety needs of the individual, but that the alternative services are either\ninappropriate and/or unavailable. (c) Any waiver by the commissioner shall\nspecify the maximum number of units of service that may be reimbursed for\nservices to the individual on a given day and shall specify the duration of the\nwaiver. In no case shall the waiver period exceed six months. The approval may\nbe extended (or re-extended) by the commissioner at the end of the specified\nperiod for an additional specified period which cannot exceed six\nmonths. (8)\n\nIf\nOPWDD determines that there has been, or will be, a deviation between the\nactual units of service paid to a provider and the projected units of services\nused in determining the price, OPWDD may recalculate the price using the actual\nunits of service paid. In deciding whether to recalculate a price using actual\nunits of service, OPWDD will consider the material difference between projected\nand annual units of service, the effect that the recalculation would have on\nthe provider's reimbursement for day habilitation services, the provider's\nfinancial position, and changes in the provider's programs or\nservices. (9)\n\nEffective July 1, 1996, costs associated with the provision of transportation shall be allowable\ncosts. These costs shall be determined for each day habilitation program using\nthe following methodology. (i) Using a\npayment/rate data sample from calendar years 1995 and 1996, the weighted\ntransportation average shall be calculated by dividing the aggregate\ntransportation payments by the aggregate transportation units of service. One\nround trip shall equal one unit of service. (a) The weighted transportation average for\neach day habilitation program shall be ranked among all day habilitation\nprograms statewide. (1)\n\nIf a program's\nweighted transportation average is $5.42 or less, the weighted transportation\naverage shall be held 100 percent harmless. (2)\n\nIf a program's weighted transportation\naverage exceeds $5.42, 40 percent of the weighted transportation average shall\nbe held harmless. (b) After deducting the 40 percent to be held harmless, the net weighted\ntransportation average for each day habilitation program\n(\ni.e., the remaining 60 percent of the weighted transportation\naverage) shall be re-ranked. Based on the new percentile rankings, a percentage\noffset shall be deducted from the net weighted transportation average. A\nprogram's percentage offset shall be determined by locating its net weighted\ntransportation average (\ni.e., the remaining 60 percent of the\nweighted transportation average) in the following table: Percentile\n\nRank\n\nNet Weighted Transportation\n\nAverage\n\nPercentage\n\nOffset\n5 or <\n$0 - $4.59\n5\n6 to 9\n$4.60 - $6.69\n7.5\n10 to 29\n$6.70 - $9.59\n10\n30 to 49\n$9.60 - $12.18\n12.5\n50 to 59\n$12.19 - $13.76\n15\n60 to 69\n$13.77 - $13.79\n16.5\n70 to 79\n$13.80 - $14.44\n20\n80 to 84\n$14.45 - $15.71\n22.5\n85 or >\nOver $15.71\n25\n(c) The amount remaining after the application of the percentage offset (the 60\npercent of the weighted transportation average reduced by the offset percentage\nin the table above) shall be added to the hold harmless amount to determine a\nprogram's modified weighted transportation average. (1)\n\nIf the modified weighted transportation\naverage falls below $5.42, the modified weighted transportation average shall\nbe adjusted to $5.42. (2)\n\nIf the\nmodified weighted transportation average exceeds $30, the modified weighted\ntransportation average shall be adjusted to $30. (d) The modified weighted transportation\naverage shall be multiplied by the total to and from day habilitation\ntransportation units and divided by the total day habilitation units of service\nto create a day habilitation transportation cost. This cost shall be included\nin the day habilitation fee. (ii)\n\nIf an agency currently providing day\nhabilitation does not have to and from transportation payment/rate data\navailable for a particular program for the period used to calculate the\nmodified weighted transportation averages, or if an agency opens a new day\nhabilitation program, the modified weighted transportation average shall be\nequal to the lesser of the program's budgeted amount for transportation based\non the transportation requirements of the person(s) to be transported to and\nfrom the day habilitation program or the average of the modified weighted\ntransportation averages for all other day habilitation programs operated by the\nagency. (iii)\n\nIf an agency does not\ncurrently operate a day habilitation program, and opens a day habilitation\nprogram or if an agency does not have to and from transportation payment/rate\ndata for any of its day habilitation programs for the period used to calculate\nthe modified weighted transportation averages, the modified weighted\ntransportation average shall be equal to the lesser of the day habilitation\nprogram's budgeted amount for transportation based on the transportation\nrequirements of the person(s) to be transported to and from the new day\nhabilitation program or the average of the modified weighted transportation\naverages for all day treatment facilities operated by the agency as described\nin section\n690.7\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Title. (iv)\n\nIf the agency does\nnot currently operate a day habilitation program or day treatment facility, the\nmodified weighted transportation average shall be equal to the lesser of the\nnew day habilitation program's budgeted amount for transportation based on the\ntransportation requirements of the persons to be transported to and from the\nnew day habilitation program or 75 percent of the regional modified weighted\ntransportation average associated with transporting individuals to and from day\nhabilitation programs. The table below shows the regional modified weighted\ntransportation averages: Region\n\nAverage\n75 Percent of Average\n1\n$20.85\n$15.64\n2\n$18.22\n$13.67\n3\n$17.32\n$12.99\n(v) Agencies that operated only day treatment facilities prior to July 1, 1996, and\nopened a day habilitation program for the first time between July 1, 1996 and\n\nSeptember 3, 1996 shall receive a one time fee adjustment if the agency\nreceived 75 percent of the regional modified weighted transportation average\nfor day habilitation transportation and is now receiving either the new day\nhabilitation program's budgeted transportation amount or the average of the\nagency's day treatment modified weighted transportation averages. The one time\nfee adjustment shall be either: (a) a one\ntime fee increase if the lesser of the need-based budgeted transportation\namount or the average of the agency's day treatment modified weighted\ntransportation averages is greater than 75 percent of the regional modified\nweighted average for transportation to and from day habilitation programs; or\n(b) a one time fee decrease if\nthe lesser of the need-based budgeted transportation amount or the average of\nthe agency's day treatment modified weighted transportation averages is less\nthan 75 percent of the regional modified weighted average for transportation to\nand from day habilitation programs. (10)\n\nThe fee determined through the\napplication of this subdivision may be appealed. In order to appeal the fee, the facility must send to OPWDD a fee adjustment application within one year of\nthe close of the fee period in question. Such appeal shall be pursuant to\nsection\n686.13\n(i) of this\n\nTitle, except that the determination following such first level appeal process\nshall be the commissioner's final decision. In addition, arithmetic or\ncalculation errors identified within 90 days of the fee notification by either\nOPWDD or the service provider, will be adjusted accordingly. At the conclusion\nof the first level appeal process, OPWDD shall notify the provider of any\nrevised price or denial of the request. Once OPWDD has informed the provider of\nthe appeal outcome, a provider which submits a revised cost report for the\nperiod reviewed shall not be entitled to an increase in the award determination\nbased on that resubmission. (11)\n\nThe fee determined in accordance with this subdivision shall not be considered\nfinal unless approved by the Director of the State Division of the\n\nBudget. (12)\n\nFor day habilitation\nservice providers authorized to provide day habilitation services on or after\n\nOctober 4, 1991 but prior to July 7, 1992, the OPWDD will make a one time\npayment for services actually delivered during this period of time. This\npayment will be computed by multiplying the fee calculated through the\napplication of this subdivision, by the total units of service provided to\neligible persons for day habilitation services for the previously designated\ntime period. (13)\n\nEffective July 1, 1996, there shall be an efficiency adjustment as described in subdivision (j)\nof this section and applied to reimbursement for administration for day\nhabilitation services. (14)\n\nEffective January 1, 2006, for all regions there shall be an efficiency\nadjustment to day habilitation programs as described herein applied as a\nreduction to reimbursable operating costs. (i) A determination shall be made as to\nwhether each provider has a surplus or loss for all its day habilitation\nprograms. (a) Surplus/loss shall equal the\ndifference between costs and the greater of: (1)\nbilled revenue; or\n(2)\ngross revenue plus or minus any prior\nperiod revenue adjustments. (b) For purposes of this efficiency\nadjustment: (1)\n\nRevenue and costs include day\nhabilitation transportation. (2)\n\nCosts, and revenue other than billed revenue, for determining the surplus/loss\ncalculations are from the 2003 or 2003-2004 cost reporting year. (3)\n\nBilled revenue is from the 2003 or\n2003-2004 fee period. (ii)\n\nRegional ranking of the surplus/loss. (a) Within each of the three regions, the\nsurplus/loss values are ranked by provider and identified in descending\norder. (b) Within each region, the\nranking is dividend into five groups: Region I\nSurplus/loss range\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$622,373 or more\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$158,879 to $622,372\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$ 73,343 to $158,878\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n$ 2,353 to $ 73,342\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n$ 2,352 or less\n\nRegion II\nSurplus/loss range\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$229,056 or more\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$ 75,604 to $229,055\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$ 70,116 to $ 75,603\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n$ 2,575 to $ 70,115\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n$ 2,574 or less\n\nRegion III\nSurplus/loss range\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$206,347 or more\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$ 69,121 to $206,346\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$ 21,400 to $ 69,120\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n$(8,598) to $ 29,399\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n$ (8,599) or more\n(c) Each of the five groups within each region is assigned an ordinal weight. Group\n5 = 5 Group 4 = 4 Group 3 = 3 Group 2 = 2 Group 1 = 1\n(iii)\n\nDetermination of total adjustment per\nfee. (a) The total of the units of service in\nthe 2005 or 2005-2006 day habilitation fee is multiplied with the provider's\nassigned ordinal weight and the result is multiplied by $0.3579. (b) The reimbursable operating costs in the\nfee are reduced by the amount determined in clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (iv)\n\nExceptions to assignment of efficiency group. (a) A provider which had not submitted 2003\nor 2003-2004 day habilitation costs to OPWDD by June 15, 2005 shall be assigned\nto Group 5 in its appropriate region. (b) A provider which initially commenced\noperation of day habilitation programs between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 in Regions II and III or one which initially commenced operation between\n\nJuly 1, 2004 and December 31, 2005 in Region I shall be assigned to Group 3 in\nits appropriate region. (v) Recalculation of surplus/loss. (a) Except for providers described in clause\n(iv)(\na\n) of this paragraph, a provider may request a\nrecalculation of the surplus/loss status determined in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (b) The request shall be\nsubmitted to OPWDD in writing, via certified mail, return receipt requested, within 90 days of receipt of the fee computation in which the efficiency\nadjustment described in this paragraph is initially applied. (c) The request shall include the provider's\njustification for the recalculation and shall be accompanied by programmatic\nand fiscal data substantiating the request. Such fiscal cost and revenue data\nshall be certified. OPWDD may request additional documentation as it deems\nnecessary. (d) OPWDD shall\nrecalculate the provider's surplus/loss status. Such recalculation shall be\nsent to the provider in writing. (15)\n\nEffective May 1, 2010, for all regions\nthere shall be an efficiency adjustment to group day habilitation and\nsupplemental group day habilitation prices. The efficiency adjustment shall\ntake the form of a two-tiered reduction in reimbursable operating costs as\nfollows: (i) All providers shall be subject\nto the first tier of the efficiency adjustment which shall reduce total\nreimbursable operating costs inclusive of transportation and health care\nadjustments (HCA) in the price in effect on May 1, 2010. The reduction shall be\n2.5 percent. (ii)\n\nThe second tier\nadjustment shall be applied to all non-personal services (NPS) reimbursable\noperating costs reflected in the reimbursement prices for providers at or above\nthe benchmark described in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. (a) For purposes of this paragraph, non-personal services (NPS) include other than personal services (OTPS), transportation, program administration OTPS and agency administration OTPS. NPS\ndoes not include personal services, contracted personal services, fringe\nbenefits, and HCA. (b) The\nbenchmark is predicated on the value of all NPS reflected in a provider's group\nday habilitation price in effect on June 30, 2008 for Region I reporting\nproviders and on December 31, 2007 for Region II and Region III reporting\nproviders. This value is expressed as a percentage of the total reimbursable\noperating costs including transportation and HCA in a provider's group day\nhabilitation price on the respective date. The percentages for each provider of\ngroup day habilitation services are ranked ordinally. OPWDD has established the\nbenchmark to coincide with the 40th percentile. All providers below the 40th\npercentile are exempt from the second tier reduction. (c) For all providers ranked at or above the\nbenchmark, the second tier reduction shall be applied to gross NPS reimbursable\noperating costs in the price in effect on May 1, 2010 without consideration of\nthe effect of the first tier reduction described in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (d) The second tier\npercentage reduction shall be 4.29 percent. (e) The commissioner may waive all or a\nportion of this reduction for a provider upon a showing that the imposition of\nthe full NPS reduction would jeopardize the continued operation of the group\nday habilitation and/or supplemental group day habilitation\nprogram. (iii)\n\nFor\npurposes of price adjustments, the effects of this efficiency adjustment shall\nbe not be construed as a basis for loss. OPWDD shall offset any price\nadjustment it would otherwise make by the efficiency adjustment described in\nthis paragraph. (16)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011, group day habilitation and supplemental group day\nhabilitation prices shall be reduced according to the measures outlined in this\nparagraph. There are two distinct actions to the price reductions. The personal\nservices action addresses provider surpluses in funding for direct care, clinical and support staff and the associated fringe benefits. The\nadministrative action addresses reimbursable administrative costs and holds\nreimbursement to a level of efficiency. Providers may be subject to only one\naction or to both actions or they may be exempt from both. (i) Applicability. The price reductions will\napply to all providers except for those which meet the criteria for exemption. The first criterion, in order for any provider to be exempt from the impact of\nthe reductions on any basis, is a cost report requirement. Region I providers\nmust have filed a 2008-2009 cost report and Regions II and III providers must\nhave filed a 2008 cost report before or on December 23, 2010, except that a\nprovider may submit the cost report after December 23, 2010 if the cost report\nrepresents an original submission or a resubmission specifically requested by\nOPWDD due to identified inaccuracies or insufficiencies. Cost reports submitted\nafter December 23, 2010 must be submitted by May 1, 2011 unless the\ncommissioner exercises or has exercised his or her discretion to extend the May\n1, 2011 deadline. Providers with cost reports submitted in accordance with the\ndeadlines in this subparagraph may qualify for exemption from the personal\nservices surpluses action pursuant to clause (ii)(\na\n) of this\nparagraph. Providers with cost reports submitted in accordance with the\ndeadlines in this subparagraph may qualify for exemption from the\nadministrative action pursuant to clause (iii)(\na\n) of this\nparagraph. Providers which did not submit cost reports in accordance with the\ndeadlines in this subparagraph shall be subject to price reductions pursuant to\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. OPWDD shall employ data extracted from the\nmost recent 2008/2008-2009 cost report submitted by a provider on or before\n\nDecember 23, 2010, except that data from a 2008/2008-2009 cost report submitted\nafter December 23, 2010 representing an original submission or a resubmission\nspecifically requested by OPWDD due to identified inaccuracies or\ninsufficiencies and submitted by May 1, 2011 or a later deadline extended by\nthe commissioner shall also be utilized. For providers of group day\nhabilitation and/or supplemental group day habilitation services which did not\noperate any supervised IRAs for the cost reporting year 2008/2008-2009, the\ncomponents subjected to analysis relate to the provider's group day\nhabilitation and supplemental group day habilitation services. For providers\nwhich did operate a supervised IRA(s) for the cost reporting year\n2008/2008-2009, the components subjected to analysis relate to the combination\nof the provider's group day habilitation, supplemental group day habilitation, and supervised IRA services. Additionally, for providers which converted a day\nprogram to a group day habilitation or supplemental group day habilitation\nprogram or a residential program to a supervised IRA subsequent to the\n2008/2008-2009 cost report period, OPWDD incorporated the data included in the\n2008/2008-2009 cost reports for the converted program(s) prior to conversion\ninto its analyses. (ii)\n\nPersonal\nservices surpluses action. (a) Exemptions. (1)\n\nProviders with FTE personal services\nlosses and actual personal services fringe benefit percentages greater than the\nreimbursable percentages are exempt. To qualify for this exemption, a provider\nmust meet each of the two criteria which follow. (i) FTE personal services loss. OPWDD\ncompared each provider's actual FTEs for direct care, clinical care and support\nas reported in its 2008/2008-2009 cost report to the maximum reimbursable FTEs\ndesignated for direct care, clinical care and support as reflected in the\ncorresponding price(s). This analysis included the FTE equivalents for\ncontracted services. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated\nan excess of actual FTEs over reimbursable FTEs. They meet the first criterion\nfor this exemption. (ii)\n\nFringe\nbenefit percentage. The fringe benefit percentage equals the total fringe\nbenefits costs for direct care, clinical and support staff divided by the\nsalary costs for direct care, clinical and support staff expressed as a\npercentage. For the providers which meet the criterion in item\n(\ni\n) of this subclause, OPWDD compared each provider's actual\ndirect care, clinical and support services associated fringe benefit percentage\nas evidenced by its 2008/2008-2009 cost report data to the direct care, clinical and support services associated fringe benefit percentage as reflected\nin the corresponding price(s). OPWDD identified a subset of providers with\nactual fringe benefit percentages that were higher than the fringe benefit\npercentage in the prices. They are exempt. (2)\n\nProviders with a loss in personal\nservices and associated fringe benefits combined are exempt. OPWDD examined\n2008/2008-2009 cost reports for those providers not exempted by virtue of\nsubclause (\n1\n) of this clause. OPWDD compared each provider's\nactual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the associated\nfringe benefits to the total reimbursable costs reflected in the corresponding\nprice(s) and designated for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits cost categories. This analysis included contracted\nservices. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated an excess\nof actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits over reimbursable costs reflected in the\ncorresponding prices and designated for direct care, clinical care and support\nand the associated fringe benefits. They are exempt. (3)\n\nProviders with aggregate unmodified\nsurpluses. Providers not exempted by virtue of subclause (\n1\n)\nor (\n2\n) of this clause were identified as having aggregate\nunmodified surpluses equal to the amount by which the aggregated reimbursable\ncosts as reflected in the prices and designated for direct care, clinical care\nand support and the associated fringe benefits exceeded the corresponding\naggregated actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits as reported in providers' cost reports for reporting\nyear 2008/2008-2009. (4)\n\nTo/from\ntransportation modification. For all providers with aggregate unmodified\nsurpluses as defined in subclause (\n3\n) of this clause, OPWDD\nexamined their 2008/2008-2009 cost reports. OPWDD compared the provider's\naggregated actual expenses for to/from transportation to the aggregated total\nreimbursable costs reflected in the corresponding price(s) and designated for\nto/from transportation. If the aggregated total reimbursable costs exceeded\naggregated actual expenses for to/from transportation, OPWDD added the amount\nof this excess to the aggregate unmodified surplus amount calculated pursuant\nto subclause (\n3\n) of this clause to yield the aggregate\nsurplus. Conversely, if the aggregated actual expenses for to/from\ntransportation exceeded the aggregated total reimbursable costs reflected in\nthe corresponding price(s) for to/from transportation, OPWDD offset the\naggregate unmodified surplus amount calculated pursuant to subclause\n(\n3\n) of this clause by this difference to derive the aggregate\nsurplus. If, however, this calculation yielded a negative number for any\nprovider, it is not considered a surplus and such provider is\nexempt. (b) Providers\nsubject to the personal services surpluses action are those providers which are\nnot specifically exempted pursuant to clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (c) Untrended\ntentative aggregate gross reduction. A provider identified as having an\naggregate surplus after the to/from transportation modification pursuant to the\nanalysis conducted by OPWDD as described in subclause\n(\na\n)(\n4\n) of this subparagraph shall be subject\nto a price reduction. This aggregate surplus is referred to as the untrended\ntentative aggregate gross reduction. (d) Tentative aggregate gross reduction. The\ntentative aggregate gross reduction equals the untrended tentative aggregate\ngross reduction pursuant to clause (\nc\n) of this subparagraph\ntrended to June 30, 2011 dollars. (iii)\n\nAdministrative action. (a) Exemptions. (1)\n\nTotal agency revenue exemption. Providers\nwith total agency gross revenues less than $1.5 million dollars as reflected in\nthe agency fiscal summaries of their 2008/2008-2009 cost reports are\nexempt. (2)\n\nCompensation exemption. For each provider not exempted by virtue of subclause (\n1\n) of\nthis clause, OPWDD extracted from the governing board and compensation\nsummaries in its 2008/2008-2009 cost report, the total annualized compensation\nof all employees with agency administrative titles. Using this dollar value, OPWDD compared the total annualized compensation to the total agency revenue as\ndescribed in subclause (\n1\n) of this clause to establish a value\nthat expressed the total annualized compensation as a percentage of total\nagency revenue. OPWDD identified a subset of providers with percentages equal\nto or less than one half of one percent. They are exempt. (3)\n\nAdministrative expenses as a percent of\noperating expenses exemption. For providers not exempted by virtue of subclause\n(\n1\n) or (\n2\n) of this clause, total reimbursable\nadministration (agency and program including fringe benefits) costs as\nreflected in the price(s) corresponding to the provider's 2008/2008-2009\nreporting year were expressed as a percentage of the total reimbursable\noperating costs in that price (those prices). As a prerequisite to this\ncalculation, when appropriate, respective amounts were adjusted for capacity\nchanges that occurred throughout the year. OPWDD identified a subset of\nproviders with percentages of less than 10 percent. They are\nexempt. (b) Providers\nsubject to the administrative action are those providers which are not\nspecifically exempted pursuant to clause (\na\n) of this\nsubparagraph. (c) Tentative\naggregate gross reduction. For providers subject to the administrative action, OPWDD used the compensation data also used in subclause\n(\na\n)(\n2\n) of this subparagraph and the reported\nnumber of FTEs corresponding to those administrative titles as reported in\nproviders' 2008/2008-2009 cost reports. OPWDD computed a provider-specific\naverage compensation per FTE for the administrative titles. Similarly, OPWDD\ncomputed a provider-specific average compensation per FTE for direct care, clinical and support staff using data from providers' 2008/2008-2009 cost\nreports. (Direct care, clinical and support staff collectively are referred to\nas direct support staff.) The compensation data for both administrative titles\nand direct support titles included fringe benefits. A ratio of average\nadministrative compensation to average direct support compensation was\ndetermined for each provider. Providers' ratios were then ranked and separated\ninto five graduated levels. A reduction percentage was established to\ncorrespond to each level of compensation ratios. The reduction percentage for a\nprovider is dependent on a provider's positioning in the five levels. The\nfollowing chart gives the explicit ranges for the compensation ratios and the\napplicable reduction percentages. Compensation Ratios\n\nReimbursable Administrative Costs\n\nAdministration to Direct\n\nSupport\n\nReduction Percentage\n\nEqual to or greater than 10.0:1\n9.0%\nEqual to or greater than 6.0:1 but less than\n10.0:1\n7.5%\nEqual to or greater than 4.0:1 but less than\n6.0:1\n6.0%\nEqual to or greater than 3.0:1 but less than\n4.0:1\n4.0%\nLess than 3.0:1\n2.0%\nThe tentative aggregate gross reduction equals the\nreduction percentage determined by a provider's ranking in the compensation\nratio comparisons applied to that provider's aggregate reimbursable\nadministrative costs as reflected in the corresponding price(s) at June 30, 2011. (iv)\n\nTotal\nimpact limitation. Before OPWDD revises a provider's group day habilitation\nand/or supplemental group day habilitation price, it shall assess the total\nimpact on a provider of all the tentative gross reductions and tentative\naggregate gross reductions pursuant to this paragraph and subparagraph\n(b)(18)(iv), paragraph (e)(6) of this section and section\n671.7\n(a)(13)\nof\nthis Title combined with the final price and fee reductions pursuant to\nsubparagraph (b)(18)(iii), paragraph (d)(6), clauses\n(h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n), (ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection and section\n671.7\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Title. The total impact to an individual provider shall be limited to an\namount not to exceed 6.5 percent of the aggregated total gross reimbursable\noperating costs as reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 prices and the\naggregated total gross allowable reimbursement reflected in a provider's June\n30, 2011 fees for the provider's programs and/or services subject to the price\nand fee revisions. The lesser of the amount of the total impact or the amount\nof the total impact as limited by the 6.5 percent provision represents the\nfinal impact. For providers for which no 2008/2008-2009 cost reports were\navailable because the conditions established in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph were not met, the total impact is calculated as follows: The\naggregated total gross reimbursable operating costs as reflected in a\nprovider's June 30, 2011 prices and the aggregated total gross allowable\nreimbursement as reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 fees for the\nprovider's programs and/or services subject to the price and fee revisions are\nsummed. The total is multiplied by 6.5 percent. The product is the final impact\nfor these providers. (v) Allocation\nof final impact. Before allocation, the final impact on a provider shall be\nreduced by the final price and fee reductions pursuant to subparagraph\n(b)(18)(iii), paragraph (d)(6), clauses (h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n), (ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this section and section\n671.7\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Title because those reductions are not subject to any further revisions. The remainder of the final impact on a provider shall be distributed equitably\nacross the reimbursable operating costs in that provider's group day\nhabilitation and supplemental group day habilitation services, supervised\nresidential habilitation, and prevocational services in proportion to the\namount of reduction each of these programs would have incurred had the\nreductions been calculated separately. OPWDD shall make an internal allocation\nwithin the price for providers subject to both the personal services surplus\naction and the administrative action pursuant to this paragraph. (vi)\n\nFinal group day habilitation and\nsupplemental group day habilitation price reduction percentage. The allocation\nof the final impact to a provider's group day habilitation and supplemental\ngroup day habilitation services shall be expressed as a percentage of the total\ngross reimbursable operating costs reflected in the price in effect on June 30, 2011. (vii)\n\nThe final group day\nhabilitation and supplemental group day habilitation price shall be the group\nday habilitation and supplemental group day habilitation price in effect on\n\nJune 30, 2011 reduced by the final group day habilitation and supplemental\ngroup day habilitation price reduction percentage pursuant to subparagraph (vi)\nof this paragraph applied to that price. (viii)\n\nFor the purposes of requesting a price\nadjustment, the effects of this price reduction shall not be construed as a\nbasis for loss. In processing a price adjustment, any revised price will be\noffset by the monetary impact, prorated as appropriate, of the price reduction\nas calculated pursuant to this clause. (ix)\n\nThe commissioner, at his or her\ndiscretion, may waive all or a portion of this adjustment for a provider upon\nthe provider demonstrating that the imposition of the reduction would\njeopardize the continued operation of the group day habilitation and/or\nsupplemental group day habilitation services. (17)\n\nLimits on billable service time. (i) On a given weekday, a maximum of the\nfollowing may be reimbursed for group day habilitation services: (a) one unit of group day habilitation\nservices; or\n(b) the combination\nof: (1)\none half unit of site based\nprevocational services, or four hours of community prevocational services; and\n(2)\none half unit of group day\nhabilitation services. (c) additional combinations: (1)\nfor individuals residing in\nindividualized residential alternatives (IRAs), community residences (CRs) and\n\nFamily Care Homes: (i) one half unit of site\nbased prevocational services, or four hours of community habilitation or\ncommunity prevocational services or a combination of both; and\n(ii)\none half unit of group day habilitation\nservices. (2)\nfor\nindividuals who receive one half unit of supplemental group day habilitation: (i) one half unit of site based prevocational\nservices, or four hours of community prevocational services and one half unit\nof group day habilitation; or\n(ii)\none unit of group day habilitation services. (3)\nfor individuals who receive one full unit\nof supplemental group day habilitation, one half unit of group day habilitation\nservices. (ii)\n\nDelivery of group day habilitation services is not permitted on a weekend\nday. (iii)\n\nOn a given weekend day a\nmaximum of the following may be reimbursed for supplemental group day\nhabilitation: (a) one unit of supplemental\ngroup day habilitation; or\n(b) the\ncombination of: (1)\nfor individuals who\nreceive one half unit of supplemental group day habilitation, six hours of\ncommunity prevocational services or one full unit of site based prevocational\nservices (where allowed, see paragraph [ag][7] of this section). (2)\nfor individuals who receive one full unit\nof supplemental group day habilitation, four hours of community prevocational\nservices or one half unit of site based prevocational services (where allowed, see paragraph [ag][7] of this section). (c) services specified in clauses\n(\na\n)-(\nb\n) of this subparagraph cannot be\nprovided simultaneously with community habilitation. (iii)\n\nTime spent receiving another Medicaid\nservice shall not be counted toward billable service time in instances when the\n\nMedicaid service is received simultaneously with group day habilitation\nservices (see section\n635-10.4\n[b][2]\nof\nthis Subpart). An exception is the provision of Medicaid Service Coordination\n(MSC), which may be received simultaneously with group day habilitation\nservices. (18)\n\nDuring the\nperiod beginning on July 22, 2020 and ending on October 14, 2020, due to the\nCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency, providers billing for services rendered using\nthe flexible definitions of the program day duration for day habilitation\nauthorized by subpart 635-10.5(c)(6)(i)(c) are subject to all the following\nconditions: (i) The total monthly number of\nday habilitation units claimed during the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency do\nnot exceed the average monthly units for each service claimed from the period\nof July 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019; (ii)\n\nThe combined average monthly revenue for\nday habilitation, site based prevocational services, community-based\nprevocational services, and community habilitation during the COVID-19 Public\n\nHealth Emergency claimed by the provider may not exceed the provider's combined\naverage monthly revenue for those services for the period of July 1, 2019\nthrough December 31, 2019; (iii)\n\nAny claims in excess of the monthly averages from this period will be subject\nto immediate recoupment if the agency has submitted any claims during the month\nthat do not meet the full program day duration requirements; and\n(iv)\n\nProviders will continue to work in\npartnership with OPWDD to make more available non-center-based and telehealth\nmodalities in an effort to increase community involvement of waiver enrollees\nand to protect the delivery of services during future\nemergencies. (19)\n\nBeginning on October 15, 2020 and ending upon revocation by OPWDD, due to the\nCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency, providers will be authorized to bill for\nservices rendered using the flexible definitions of the program day duration\nfor day habilitation authorized by subpart 635-10.5(c)(6)(i)(d) if either of\nthe following conditions (i) or (ii) and condition (iii) are met: (i) The provider operates day habilitation\nservices in a geographic area that meets Department of Health thresholds for\nprogram closure due to increased rates of COVID-19 cases or the local public\nhealth agency has required a program to close. This designation requires that\ncenter-based day services are closed and that community-based services are\noperating at a reduced capacity. This authorization for the use of the modified\nbilling rules will end with the de-designation of the area; or\n(ii)\n\nThe provider is not required to close\nits day habilitation services by either New York State or the local public\nhealth agency. However, the provider closes the program as a preemptive measure\ndue to the elevated percentage of individuals and staff at a particular site\nthat have either tested positive for COVID-19 or are required to quarantine\nbecause of close contact with a person who tests positive for COVID-19. These\nmodifications to the program day durations associated with nonmandatory\nclosures may be in effect for a period of up to fourteen (14) days for risk\nmitigation. Longer durations of the flexibilities (beyond fourteen days) would\noccur only where there is a subsequent designation of the region as being\nsubject to closure or another period of quarantine is determined to be\nnecessary. The agency must report the closure to OPWDD and demonstrate the need\nfor the closure based on Incident Reporting Management Application (IRMA)\nreporting of positive COVID-19 cases among individuals and staff at the\naffected sites; and\n(iii)\n\nProviders\nwill continue to work in partnership with OPWDD to make more available\nnon-center-based and telehealth modalities in an effort to increase community\ninvolvement of waiver enrollees and to protect the delivery of services during\nfuture emergencies. (d) Supported employment (SEMP)\nservices prior to July 1, 2015. (For SEMP provided on and after July 1, 2015, see\nsubdivision [af] of this section.)\n(1)\n\nReimbursement for HCBS waiver supported employment services provided in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n635-10.4\n(d) of\nthis Subpart, shall be a monthly supported employment services fee which\nincorporates a level of support and varies by region, unless the provisions of\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph apply. (i) The regions will consist of New York City\n(including the counties of New York, Bronx, Kings, Queens and Richmond) and, the rest of the State. (ii)\n\nThe\nlevel of support will be established based on information obtained in\naccordance with the Developmental Disabilities Profile (DDP-2) (1/87), which is\na developmental/demographic inventory of each person's personal\ncharacteristics. (a) Support points are\ngenerated as follows for each data element that is answered in the affirmative\non the DDP-2: (1)\nthe DDP item G. 27. Index is\nless than 100 =.956 support points; (2)\nthe DDP item G. 28. Index is less than 90\n=.598 support points; (3)\nthe DDP\nHealth/Medical Factor, a combination of DDP items C. 14., 15., 16., and 17., is\ngreater than 1 =1.216 support points; (4)\nthe DDP item B. 13 is answered \"yes\"\n=.594 support points; (5)\nthe DDP\nitem F. 25 e. is greater than 1 =.657 support points; (6)\nthe DDP item F. 25 a. is greater than 1\n=.891 support points; and\n(7)\nthe\nDDP item F. 25 g. is greater than 1 = 1.343 support points; (b) The DDP-2 (1/87) is contained in \"Scoring\nthe DDP,\" an OPWDD publication. This document is available from: (1)\n\nThe New York State Office for People With\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. (2)\n\nIt may also be reviewed in person during\nregular business hours at the: (i) NYS\nDepartment of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12231; and\n(ii)\n\nThe New York State Office for People\n\nWith Developmental Disabilities, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. (c) Total support points\nfor a person are calculated by adding the support points for each element in\nthe affirmative. Monthly supported employment service fees are payable based\nupon documented service delivery and will vary by level of support and by\nregion as follows: (1)\n\nFor those providers of\nthe service that instituted the salary enhancement for direct care and support\nworkers, pursuant to chapter 54 of the Laws of 2000, page 389, line 36 - page\n390, line 9, the monthly supported employment service fee will be as follows: Level of\nsupport\n\nTotal support\npoints\nNYC fees\n\nRest of the State\nfees\n1\nless than.7534\n$359\n$257\n2\ngreater than or equal to.7534 and less than\n2.9505\n$480\n$343\n3\ngreater than or equal to 2.9505\n$540\n$387\n(2)\n\nFor all other providers of the service the fee is as follows: Level of\nsupport\n\nTotal support\npoints\nNYC fees\n\nRest of the State\nfees\n1\nless than.7534\n$349\n$250\n2\ngreater than or equal to.7534 and less than\n2.9505\n$470\n$336\n3\ngreater than or equal to 2.9505\n$530\n$380\n(d) If the required data is unavailable to\ncalculate a person's level of support, reimbursement of the monthly supported\nemployment service fee shall be made at the lowest fee level for the\nappropriate region until the required data can be collected and entered into\nthe data system. (iii)\n\nIf\nthe historical monthly budgeted average cost per person for HCBS waiver\nsupported employment service exceeds the average monthly regional fee per\nperson receiving the service by 80 percent or more, the historical monthly\nbudgeted cost per person for HCBS waiver supported employment service shall\napply. (iv)\n\nEffective April 1, 2005, costs incurred as a result of requests for criminal history record checks\nunder section\n16.33\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law and section\n845-b\nof the\n\nExecutive Law shall be allowable costs and shall be considered part of the\nfee. (v) Effective January 1, 2008, for providers which participated in Health Care Enhancement (III) and which\nwere deemed eligible for funding below the benchmark level, an amount equal to\n1.0 percent of the fee will be added to the fees prescribed pursuant to\nsubclauses (ii)(\nc\n)(\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nEffective November 1, 2009. In addition\nto the health care enhancements (HCE) I through III and health care adjustments\n(HCA) IV and V prospective add-ons to the fees which will be effective on\n\nJanuary 1, 2010 as described in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, providers\nmay be eligible to receive HCA IV and HCA V funding according to the catch-up\nprovision described in subparagraph (n)(4)(ii) of this section. (3)\n\nFees effective January 1, 2010. Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2010, there shall be one schedule of fees for all providers of\nsupported employment services. The monthly fees shall incorporate health care\nadjustments (HCE I through III and HCA IV and V) equivalent to a 1.0 percent\nfunding increase per adjustment applied to the fees sequentially to effect\ncompounding of the adjustments. Level of\nsupport\n\nTotal support\npoints\nNYC fees\n\nRest of the State\nfees\n1\nless than.7534\n517\n371\n2\nequal to or greater than.7534 and less than\n2.9505\n691\n494\n3\nequal to or greater than 2.9505\n779\n558\n(4)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, the monthly fees shall incorporate health care\nadjustment (HCA) VI funding equivalent to a 1.0 percent increase applied to the\nfees in effect on April 1, 2010. Level of\nsupport\n\nTotal support\npoints\nNYC fees\n\nRest of the State\nfees\n1\nless than.7534\n$549\n$394\n2\nequal to or greater than.7534 and less than\n2.9505\n$734\n$525\n3\nequal to or greater than 2.9505\n$828\n$593\n(5)\n\nReserved. (6)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011, the fees are as follows: Level of\nsupport\n\nTotal support\npoints\nNYC fees\n\nRest of the State\nfees\n1\nless than.7534\n$538\n$386\n2\ngreater than or equal to.7534 and less than\n2.9505\n$720\n$515\n3\ngreater than or equal to 2.9505\n$812\n$581\n(7)\n\nReimbursement for HCBS waiver supported employment services shall be claimed on\na person-specific basis. The unit of service for supported employment services\nshall be a calendar month. (i) A provider may\nclaim the monthly supported employment service fee, as calculated in clause\n(1)(ii)(\nc\n) of this subdivision, for an eligible person who is\nemployed and to whom the provider has rendered, on separate days, at least two\nface-to-face documented supported employment services in accordance with the\nperson's individualized service plan (ISP) and supported employment\nplan. (ii)\nA provider may claim the\nmonthly supported employment service fee, as calculated in clause\n(1)(ii)(\nc\n) of this subdivision, for an eligible person for\nwhom the provider is actively engaged in preparatory and placement activities\nleading to competitive employment or reemployment. The provider must have\nrendered, on separate days, at least four such documented supported employment\nservices, in accordance with the person's ISP and supported employment plan, of\nwhich at least two are face-to-face contacts. (iii)\n\nOnly one provider of supported\nemployment service may claim for a supported employment service fee for an\neligible person in a given calendar month. (8)\n\nReimbursement shall be contingent upon\nOPWDD's prior approval of HCBS waiver supported employment service to the\nperson and documentation that the service is provided in accordance with the\nperson's ISP and supported employment plan. (9)\n\nThe supported employment service monthly\nfees specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall be trended on an\nannual basis utilizing the trend factors identified in subdivision (i) of this\nsection. (10)\n\nThe fees determined\nin accordance with this subdivision shall not be considered final unless\napproved by the Director of the State Division of the\n\nBudget. (e) Prevocational services delivered before July 1, 2015. (1)\n\nThe following shall apply to site based\nprevocational services provided on and after January 1, 2006 and before July 1, 2015. (For prevocational services delivered on and after July 1, 2015, see\nsubdivisions [ag] and [ah] of this section.)\n(2)\n\nAn annual price period is a 12-month\nperiod as follows: (i) for providers in the\ncounties of New York, Bronx, Queens, Kings and Richmond, July 1st to June\n30th; (ii)\nfor providers in all\nother counties, January 1st to December 31st; (iii)\nfor prevocational services providers\ndefined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph there will be a one-time, six-month price period from January 1, 2006 to June 30, 2006. (3)\n\nPrevocational\nservice costs are those costs related to the aggregate of all prevocational\nservices and are selected and identified in the individualized service plan\n(ISP) and prevocational service plan for each person receiving prevocational\nservices. (4)\n\nAllowable\nprevocational costs shall be based on allowable prevocational services as\nidentified in section\n635-10.4\n(c) of\nthis Subpart, and Subpart 635-6 of this Part, and incurred by an approved\nprovider of service responsible for the delivery of such services. (5)\n\nReimbursement for prevocational services\nshall be determined through a budget review process. (i) In such budget review, OPWDD shall\nconsider the following limitations: provider historical costs for salaries, fringe and administration for such services. If service specific costs are not\navailable, OPWDD shall consider regional salary, fringe and administration\ncosts and the provider's historical costs for salaries, fringe and\nadministration in other comparable OPWDD programs. In addition, OPWDD will\nconsider specific service requirements documented in the ISPs of persons to be\nserved, approved fringe benefit appeals in other OPWDD programs, levels of\nstaff treatment responsibility, the impact of provider agency expansion on\nagency administration costs, and the allocation of clinical titles required for\nservice. (ii)\n\nThat portion of costs\nrelated to actual products (\ni.e., the production of a saleable\ngood or performance of a service of economic benefit), shall not be\nreimbursable under this section. Such shall include wages and fringe benefits\nof the service recipient and others not included in the approved budget; the\ncost of raw materials and manufacturing equipment; capital costs solely related\nto production work space; and administration and overhead solely related to the\njob task oriented aspects of the prevocational service environment. (iii)\n\nThe hourly price for prevocational\nservice shall be determined by dividing the approved budgeted costs for all\nindividuals included in the budget by the total annual projected full and half\nunits. (iv)\n\nEffective January 1, 2009, the capital cost portion for prevocational services shall be reimbursed\nas follows: (a) OPWDD shall determine the\nproperty component add-on by dividing the annual amount specified in the\nprovider's prevocational sites' total allowable costs of real property by the\ntotal number of units of service OPWDD authorized for the period. (b) OPWDD shall determine the capital\nequipment component add-on by dividing the annual prevocational allowable\ncapital equipment expense reported by the provider in its cost report by the\nunits of service OPWDD authorized for the current price period. The capital\nequipment expense will be extracted from the cost report for a reporting period\nthat precedes the price period by two years, provided that the cost report\nconforms to the requirements in Subpart 635-4 of this Part. Otherwise, OPWDD\nwill use the capital equipment component add-on in the previous price. For\nproviders which have not operated any prevocational services during the cost\nreporting period (two years prior to the beginning of the price period), the\nannual budgeted capital equipment amount approved by OPWDD will be divided by\nthe units of service OPWDD authorized for the current prior period. For\nproviders with an existing prevocational site(s) in operation during the cost\nreporting period two years prior to the price period, and which open a new\nprevocational site during the price period, the approved annual budgeted\ncapital equipment costs for the new site will be combined with the capital\nequipment expenses reported on the cost report described above and divided by\nthe new total OPWDD authorized units of service. (6)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011, prevocational\nservices prices shall be reduced according to the measures outlined in this\nparagraph. This personal services action addresses provider surpluses in\nfunding for direct care, clinical and support staff and the associated fringe\nbenefits. (i) Applicability. The price\nreduction shall apply to all providers except for those which meet the criteria\nfor exemption. The first criterion, in order for any provider to be exempt from\nthe impact of the reduction on any basis, is a cost report requirement. Region\nI providers must have filed a 2008-2009 cost report and Regions II and III\nproviders must have filed a 2008 cost report on or before December 23, 2010, except that a provider may submit the cost report after December 23, 2010 if\nthe cost report represents an original submission or a resubmission\nspecifically requested by OPWDD due to identified inaccuracies or\ninsufficiencies. Cost reports submitted after December 23, 2010 must be\nsubmitted by May 1, 2011 unless the commissioner exercises or has exercised his\nor her discretion to extend the May 1, 2011 deadline. Providers with cost\nreports submitted in accordance with the deadlines in this subparagraph may\nqualify for exemption pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. Providers which did not submit cost reports in accordance with the deadlines in\nthis subparagraph shall be subject to price reductions pursuant to subparagraph\n(vii) of this paragraph. OPWDD shall employ data extracted from the most recent\n2008/2008-2009 cost report submitted by a provider on or before December 23, 2010, except that data from a 2008/2008-2009 cost report submitted after\n\nDecember 23, 2010 representing an original submission or a resubmission\nspecifically requested by OPWDD due to identified inaccuracies or\ninsufficiencies and submitted by May 1, 2011 or a later deadline extended by\nthe commissioner shall also be utilized. (ii)\n\nExemptions. (a) FTE personal services loss. OPWDD\ncompared each provider's actual FTEs for direct care, clinical care and support\nas reported in its 2008/2008-2009 cost report to the maximum reimbursable FTEs\ndesignated for direct care, clinical care and support as reflected in the\ncorresponding price. This analysis included the FTE equivalents for contracted\nservices. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated an excess\nof actual FTEs over reimbursable FTEs. They are exempt. (b) Providers with a loss in personal\nservices and associated fringe benefits combined are exempt. OPWDD examined\n2008/2008-2009 cost reports for those providers not exempted by virtue of\nclause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. OPWDD compared each\nprovider's actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits to the total reimbursable costs reflected in the\ncorresponding price and designated for direct care, clinical care and support\nand the associated fringe benefits cost categories. This analysis included\ncontracted services. OPWDD identified a subset of providers which demonstrated\nan excess of actual expenses for direct care, clinical care and support and the\nassociated fringe benefits over reimbursable costs reflected in the\ncorresponding price and designated for direct care, clinical care and support\nand the associated fringe benefits. They are exempt. (iii)\n\nProviders subject to prevocational\nservices price reduction are those providers which are not specifically\nexempted pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nUntrended gross surplus. A provider is\nidentified as having an untrended gross surplus when the analysis as conducted\nand described in clause (ii)(\nb\n) of this paragraph demonstrated\nan excess of reimbursable costs as reflected in the price for the respective\nreporting period and designated for direct care, clinical care and support and\nthe associated fringe benefits over actual expenses for direct care, clinical\ncare and support and the associated fringe benefits as reported in the\nprovider's 2008/2008-2009 cost report. The amount of this excess is the\nuntrended gross surplus. (v) Untrended tentative gross reduction. The untrended gross surplus multiplied by\n40 percent is referred to as the untrended tentative gross reduction. (vi)\n\nTentative gross reduction. The tentative\ngross reduction equals the untrended tentative gross reduction pursuant to\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph trended to June 30, 2011 dollars. (vii)\n\nTotal impact limitation. Before OPWDD\nrevises a provider's prevocational services price, it shall assess the total\nimpact on a provider of all the tentative gross reductions and tentative\naggregate gross reductions pursuant to this paragraph and subparagraph\n(b)(18)(iv), paragraph (c)(16) of this section, and section\n671.7\n(a)(13)\nof\nthis Title, combined with the final price and fee reductions pursuant to\nsubparagraph (b)(18)(iii), paragraph (d)(6), clauses\n(h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n), (ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection and section\n671.7\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Title. The total impact to an individual provider shall be limited to an\namount not to exceed 6.5 percent of the aggregated total gross reimbursable\noperating costs as reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 prices and the\naggregated total gross allowable reimbursement reflected in a provider's June\n30, 2011 fees for the provider's programs and/or services subject to the price\nand fee revisions. The lesser of the amount of the total impact or the amount\nof the total impact as limited by the 6.5 percent provision represents the\nfinal impact. For providers for which no 2008/2008-2009 cost reports were\navailable because the conditions established in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph were not met, the total impact is calculated as follows: The\naggregated total gross reimbursable operating costs as reflected in a\nprovider's June 30, 2011 prices and the aggregated total gross allowable\nreimbursement as reflected in a provider's June 30, 2011 fees for the\nprovider's programs and/or services subject to the price and fee revisions are\nsummed. The total is multiplied by 6.5 percent. The product is the final impact\nfor these providers. (viii)\n\nAllocation of final impact. Before allocation, the final impact on a provider\nshall be reduced by the final price and fee reductions pursuant to subparagraph\n(b)(18)(iii), paragraph (d)(6), clauses (h)(3)(iii)(\nd\n), (ab)(12)(iii)(\nb\n) of this section and section\n671.7\n(a)(12)\nof\nthis Title because those reductions are not subject to any further revisions. The remainder of the final impact on a provider shall be distributed equitably\nacross the reimbursable operating costs in that provider's prevocational, supervised residential habilitation, group day habilitation, and supplemental\ngroup day habilitation services in proportion to the amount of reduction each\nof these programs would have incurred had the reductions been calculated\nseparately. (ix)\n\nFinal\nprevocational services price reduction percentage. The allocation of the final\nimpact to a provider's prevocational services shall be expressed as a\npercentage of the total gross reimbursable operating costs reflected in the\nprice in effect on June 30, 2011. (x) The final prevocational services price\nshall be the prevocational services price in effect on June 30, 2011 reduced by\nthe final prevocational services price reduction percentage pursuant to\nsubparagraph (ix) of this paragraph applied to that price. (xi)\n\nFor the purposes of requesting a price\nadjustment, the effects of this price reduction shall not be construed as a\nbasis for loss. In processing a price adjustment, any revised price will be\noffset by the monetary impact, prorated as appropriate, of the adjustment as\ncalculated pursuant to this paragraph. (xii)\n\nThe commissioner, at his or her\ndiscretion, may waive all or a portion of this adjustment for a provider upon\nthe provider demonstrating that the imposition of the reduction would\njeopardize the continued operation of the prevocational services. (7)\n\nReimbursement shall\nbe contingent upon prior OPWDD approval and documentation that prevocational\nservices are specified in each person's ISP and prevocational services\nplan. (8)\n\nUnit of service for\nreimbursement for prevocational services. (i) Reimbursement for prevocational services shall be claimed on an individual\nbasis.

(b) The agency may bill a half unit when the\nagency delivers and documents at least one face-to-face service delivered in\naccordance with the individual's prevocational services plan and provides a\nprogram day duration of at least two hours. (ii)\n\nThe program day duration for\nprevocational services is the length of time that the person is present at the\nprovider's \"vocational/work program\" where prevocational services are provided. The following cannot be counted as part of the program day duration: (a) time spent at any other separately\nreimbursed service that occurs during the prevocational services program day, e.g., clinic services; (b) time spent traveling from the\nprevocational service to the separately reimbursed service and returning from\nthe separately reimbursed service; (c) time spent traveling to the first\nprevocational services activity of the day and time spent traveling home or to\nanother service at the conclusion of the prevocational services program day; and\n(d) mealtime.

(iii)\n\nFor individuals who live in an IRA, CR\nor FCH and receive community habilitation on a given day, additional billing\nlimits are described in paragraph (ab)(11) of this section. (iv)\n\nOn a given day, a maximum of one full\nunit per individual, either one full unit or two half units, may be reimbursed\nfor supplemental group day habilitation. (v) Where more than one agency delivers\nservices on a given day to the same individual, the total number of units\nand/or hours of CH services billed for that day by all agencies may not exceed\nthe maximum allowed daily units and/or hours described in subparagraphs\n(i)-(iv) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nExceptions. The following applies only to requests made prior to October 1, 2014.

(b) The billing limits established in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph may be waived on an individual basis by the\ncommissioner if the commissioner finds, based on the request submitted by the\nagency: (1)\nthat services in excess of the\nlimit are necessary to preserve the health or safety of the individual; and\n(2)\nthat alternative services\nwhich are not subject to the limit have been considered to meet the health or\nsafety needs of the individual, but that the alternative services are either\ninappropriate and/or unavailable. (c) Any waiver by the commissioner shall\nspecify the maximum number of units of service that may be reimbursed for the\nindividual on a given day and shall specify the duration of the waiver. In no\ncase shall the waiver period exceed six months.

(11)\n\nIf OPWDD determines that there has been, or will be, a deviation between the\nactual units of service paid to a provider and the projected units of services\nused in determining the price, OPWDD may recalculate the price using the actual\nunits of service paid. In deciding whether to recalculate a price using actual\nunits of service, OPWDD will consider the material difference between projected\nand annual units of service, the effect that the recalculation would have on\nthe provider's reimbursement for prevocational services, the provider's\nfinancial position, and changes in the provider's programs or\nservices. (12)\n\nTotal reimbursable\ncosts derived through the application of the above methodology shall be trended\non an annual basis utilizing the trend factors identified in subdivision (i) of\nthis section.

Each provider shall be assigned a percentage value from the table at\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, based on a program surplus/deficit group\ndesignation and an administration percentage group designation. This percentage\nvalue shall be used to determine the amount by which existing reimbursement for\nadministration will be reduced in the current fee. (i) Determination of program surplus/deficit\ngroup designation. A determination shall be made as to whether each provider\nhas a program surplus or deficit, for the combined total of all of its\ncommunity residence and day treatment programs and all individualized\nresidential alternative and at home residential habilitation and day\nhabilitation services.

(a) For those providers with a reported\ndeficit, this deficit shall be considered the final deficit amount for the\npurpose of this calculation. (b) For those providers with a reported program surplus, a certain portion of that\nsurplus shall be exempted to establish an adjusted surplus. The adjusted\nsurplus shall be the reported surplus minus the exempt amount. Exempt amounts\nshall be determined as follows. For providers whose total program costs are: (1)\nless than $1 million, the exempt amount\nshall be $10,000; (2)\nbetween $1\nmillion and less than $3 million, the exempt amount shall be $22,500; (3)\nbetween $3 million and $7 million, the\nexempt amount shall be $35,000; (4)\nover $7 million, the exempt amount shall be $40,000.

(1)\nS2 if the\nadjusted surplus is equal to or greater than $200,000; (2)\nS1 if the adjusted surplus is from\n$20,000 to $199,999; (3)\nBE if the\nreported deficit is not greater than ($19,999) or the adjusted surplus is not\ngreater than $19,999 (BE - break even); (4)\nD1 if the reported deficit is from\n($20,000) to ($199,999); (5)\nD2 if\nthe reported deficit is equal to or greater than\n($200,000). (ii)\n\nDetermination of a calculated\nadministration percentage group. A determination shall be made of a provider's\ncalculated administration percentage, where administration percentage shall\nequal the sum of agency administration plus the program administration divided\nby the result of total program cost minus the sum of capital costs, agency\nadministration and program administration. There shall be five group\ndesignations that express the calculated administration percentage as a\ndeparture from the regional average percentage for all provider agencies within\na total program cost size designation. Those percentages centered around the\naverage are designated with the abbreviation AVG. There are also two group\ndesignations for percentages over the average, abbreviated OA2 and OA1 and two\ngroup designations for under the average, abbreviated UA2 and UA1. These\nabbreviations appear in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph as well as in the\nfollowing regional tables. Each provider's assignment to one of the five group\ndesignations shall be based on the provider's calculated administration\npercentage, total program cost and elected or assigned region (refer to section\n686.13\n[c][1][vii]\nof this Title).

(2)\n\nProviders may request that OPWDD use a more recent cost reporting period, as an\nalternative to their 1992 or 1992-93 reporting period, to determine the\nefficiency adjustment percentage as described herein. Approval to use an\nalternative reporting period shall be granted if, upon a fiscal review by the\ncommissioner, it is determined that the cost report for the alternative\nreporting period more accurately reflects the provider's current financial\nstatus. For the purposes of determining the efficiency adjustment percentage\nonly, providers may submit corrections to their 1992 or 1992-93 cost report. Such corrections shall be certified by a certified public accountant. Providers\nmay request the use of an alternative reporting period or may submit\ncorrections to their 1992 or 1992-93 cost report only once.

It shall be\ncalculated as follows: (a) The individual\nmonthly price from the IRA price sheet in effect on September 30, 2012 shall be\nutilized and the split between non-room and board, and room and board, shall be\nmaintained. The individual monthly price shall include all operating cost\ncategories, efficiency adjustments, offsets, miscellaneous items itemized\nseparately in the price, and property. The price shall be expressed in terms of\na full month's reimbursement per individual served.

The result shall be multiplied by a statewide average\ngroup day habilitation occupancy factor. The individual monthly price shall be\nexpressed in terms of a full month's reimbursement per individual. (c) The non-room and board component of the\nindividual CH II price shall be the sum of: (1)\nthe non-room and board component of the\nindividual monthly price derived from the IRA price sheet as described in\nclause (\na\n) of this subparagraph; and\n(2)\nthe individual monthly price derived from\nthe group day habilitation price sheet as described in clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph. (d) The room and board component of the CH II\nprice shall be the room and board component of the individual monthly price\nfrom the IRA price sheet in effect on September 30, 2012. (e) The non-room and board component and the\nroom and board component summed together yield the individual CH II\nprice. (f) For a half month\nreimbursement, the individual CH II price shall be halved. (ii)\n\nSubsequent prices. In the event that\neither the IRA price or the group day habilitation price used to calculate the\nindividual CH II price is revised, the CH II price shall be revised\naccordingly. (iii)\n\nThe prices\ndetermined in accordance with this paragraph shall not be considered final\nunless approved by the director of the Division of the Budget. (iv)\n\nThe individual CH II price determined\nthrough the application of this paragraph may be corrected or appealed pursuant\nto either section\n686.13\n(h) or (i)\nof this Title, except that the determination following a first level appeal\nprocess shall be the commissioner's final\ndecision.
