  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-7.9 - Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (hvac) systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Isolation. HVAC\nsystems shall be isolated from the regulated abatement work area. Acceptable\nmeans of HVAC system isolation include: (1)\n\nShutdown and isolation. Shutdown and isolation of HVAC systems to prevent\ncontamination and asbestos dispersal to other areas of the building or\nstructure. (2)\n\nLocal isolation. Local isolation and provision for temporary HVAC. (3)\n\nPositive pressurization. Positive\npressurization of the HVAC system. (i) Positive pressurization shall be restricted to circumstances where HVAC must\nservice the remainder of the building or structure and the HVAC equipment is in\nthe regulated abatement work area or the ducts run through the regulated\nabatement work area. The appropriate HVAC duct and plenum outlets, inlets and\nexhaust dampers shall be sealed with caulking and a minimum 3/8-inch thickness\nplywood, or oriented strand board, or sufficient gauge sheet metal, covered\nwith a double layer of at least six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting and\nduct taped airtight. The HVAC duct and plenum joints shall be duct taped\nairtight. The mixing and balancing damper positions shall be altered and the\nreturn fan(s) shall be shut down to produce the required positive\npressures. (ii)\n\nProject phasing, climate conditions, load conditions and HVAC equipment limitations and controls\nshall be considered when this alternate procedure is evaluated. Aerodynamics in\nthe duct system, particularly spurs or trunks, shall be considered and, if\nnecessary, the ducts or dampers shall be altered or removed to prevent loss of\npositive pressure in any part of the system. Precautions shall be taken during\nabatement activities to insure that the ducts, seals and static pressure lines\nare not damaged. (iii)\n\nThe presence\nof positive pressure shall be demonstrated daily by testing, including days\nwhen no Phase II work or support activities are scheduled, and the results must\nbe noted in the asbestos abatement contractor supervisor's daily project log. Air sampling in occupied, downstream, non-work areas shall be performed on a\ndaily basis as per the requirements of section\n56-7.1\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart, except days when there are no Phase II A, II B, or II C\nactivities. Positive pressure verification shall be done on a continuous basis. The differential pressure shall be easily verifiable by use of a leak free, rigid static pressure taps, static lines on the supply and return ducts and\nstatic lines originating in the regulated abatement work area, adjacent areas\nor downstream non-work areas. (b) HVAC filters and ducts. Potentially\ncontaminated HVAC filters in existing building/structure HVAC systems shall be\nhandled and disposed of as asbestos contaminated waste material. The ducts and\nfilter assembly shall be wet cleaned and HEPA-vacuumed where system air samples\nor bulk samples indicate asbestos contamination within the interior of the HVAC\nducts. Existing building/structure HVAC system filters shall be treated as\npotentially contaminated for all friable OSHA Class I and Class II asbestos\nprojects, and shall be removed and disposed of by the asbestos abatement\ncontractor after the affected filters are identified by the building/structure\nowner's HVAC contractor or maintenance personnel. The building owner or their\nagent shall supply appropriate replacement HVAC system filters to the asbestos\nabatement contractor during HVAC system filter removal and\nreplacement. (c) Chimney effects. All boilers and other equipment exhausts within the regulated abatement work\narea shall be shut down and the burner/boiler/equipment accesses and openings\nshall be sealed until abatement is complete and satisfactory clearance\nair-sampling results have been achieved. If the boiler(s) or other exhausted\nequipment will be subject to abatement, all breeching, stacks columns, flues, shafts and double-walled enclosures serving as exhausts or vents, shall be\nsegregated from the affected boilers or equipment and sealed airtight to\neliminate potential chimney effects within the regulated abatement work\narea. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-7.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
