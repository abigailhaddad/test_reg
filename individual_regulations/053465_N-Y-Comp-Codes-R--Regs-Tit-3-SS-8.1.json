  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 8.1 - Interest payments by a person other than the borrower\n\nState Regulations\nA borrower asked whether there would be a violation of the\nusury laws if a lender, upon the security of a single family residence, required the seller or broker (not the borrower) to pay a certain amount, as\ndiscount or points, in addition to charging the borrower interest at a rate\nslightly below the maximum rate permitted by law. The borrower's attention was called to the language of\nsection\n4.2\nof Part 4 of the general\nregulations of the Banking Board which defines interest to include \"all other\namounts paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by any\nperson, to or for the account of the lender\nin consideration\nfor making the loan or forbearance.\"\n(Emphasis added) The borrower was\nadvised that amounts paid in consideration for the making of the loan or\nforbearance would, thus, be included as interest regardless of whether they\nwere paid by the borrower or by someone else. If the amount so paid brought the\ninterest rate over the maximum rate permitted by law, then the loan would be\nusurious. DATED: July 23, 1969\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n8.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
