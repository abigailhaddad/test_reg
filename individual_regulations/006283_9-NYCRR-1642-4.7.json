  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.7 - Rent roll and vacancy loss control book\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This form (Exhibit 26 of Appendix S-8)\nprovides a recapitulation of the interim dwelling rent adjustments resulting\nfrom move-ins, move-outs, transfers, and changes in rent surcharges and a\nsummarization of the changes in the rent roll. It also provides the\npredetermined figure for authorized rentals which controls the charges to\ntenants on the first day of the month (see §\n1642-4.4\n) and is the source of the\nfigures for income from rents to be recorded in the general ledger and the\nincome analysis ledger by journal voucher at the end of each month (see §\n1642-4.8, below). The rent roll and\nvacancy loss control book shall be a bound book. A separate rent roll and\nvacancy loss control book shall be maintained for each tenants\nledger. (b) Suitable modifications\nin the specimen form (Exhibit 26, Appendix S-8) and in the tenants charge and\ncredit book (Exhibit 25, Appendix S-8) should be made where the need for the\nsurcharge or retroactive surcharge classifications is not present such as, for\nexample, in the operation of property included the related programs or in the\noperation of the site prior to demolition and construction. The established\nrent schedule of such property will not ordinarily vary from month to month, except as buildings are added or demolished. The established rent schedule will\nthen be the control over charges and furnish the income figure to be recorded. The specimen form (Exhibit 26) may then be reduced to a vacancy loss control\nbook to be operated in conjunction with the established rent\nschedule. (c) The first entry for\nthe month in the rent roll and vacancy loss control book is to record the\nsurcharges at the beginning of the month, as brought forward from the previous\nmonth, in columns 10 and 20 of the form. The total of this figure and the basic\nrent schedule, which will have been recorded as the authorized dwelling rental\non the last line of column 10 for the previous month, is the control over the\ncharges to tenants accounts and to vacancy losses as of the first day of the\ncurrent month, as described in subdivision (c) of section\n1642-4.3. The second step is to\nlist the dwelling units vacant or vacated on the last day of the previous\nmonth, simultaneously with the posting of the authorized rent charges to the\ntenants' accounts, entering in column 15 the scheduled basic monthly rent for\neach dwelling unit so listed. Thereafter, the dwelling rent and vacancy loss\nadjustments resulting from move-ins, move-outs, transfers, and surcharge\nadjustments, as reflected in miscellaneous charge and credit tickets, are\nlisted and entered in the appropriate columns. Detailed instructions follow: (column 1) Enter here the date of the miscellaneous\ncharge and credit ticket. The initial entries for the basic rent, surcharges, and vacancies at the beginning of the month should be dated the first day of\nthe month. (column 2) Enter here the account number of the unit\nbeing vacated, rented or with respect to which a surcharge adjustment or a\nretroactive surcharge, based on a rent change authorization, is being effected. Units vacant or vacated on the last day of the month shall be listed at the\nstart of the subsequent month as previously described. In order to provide for\nthe recording of the necessary information with respect to a unit as it is\nrented, one line shall separate the listing of each vacant unit. (column 3) Enter here the name of the tenant vacating\nor moving into a unit or with respect to whom a surcharge adjustment or a\nretroactive surcharge, based on a rent change authorization, is being effected. With respect to those units vacant or vacated on the last day of the previous\nmonth, enter the word \"vacant\". (column 4) Enter here the number of the miscellaneous\ncharge or credit ticket. (column 5) Enter here the date on which rent charges to\na tenant moving into a unit commence. (column 6) Enter here the date on which the rent\ncharges to a tenant vacating a unit terminate. No entry will be made in this\ncolumn for those units vacant as of the last day of the previous month. (column 7) Enter here the effective date of a surcharge\nadjustment authorized by a rent change authorization. (column 8) Enter here the full monthly surcharge to be\nmade to a tenant moving into a unit or the new monthly surcharge to be made to\na tenant on the basis of a rent change authorization, whether or not the\nmonthly surcharge to be made is greater or smaller than the old or former\nmonthly surcharge. Do not enter the difference between the surcharge to be made\nand the old or former surcharge. (column 9) Enter here the full monthly surcharge made\nto the tenant vacating a unit or previously charged to a tenant affected by a\nrent change authorization, whether or not such surcharge is greater or less\nthan the new surcharge to be made. Do not enter the difference between the old\nand new surcharges. (column 10) The amount appearing on the total line of\ncolumn 10 for the previous month shall be entered on the first line of this\ncolumn. No further entries are made in this column until the end of the month. At the end of the month, the difference between columns 8 and 9 is entered in\ncolumn 10 on the net adjustments line and the amount on the first line of the\ncolumn, as adjusted by the difference between columns 8 and 9, is brought down\nto the total line of column 10. To this total is added the basic rent schedule, which does not change from month to month. The sum of the basic rent schedule\nand the surcharges, as adjusted, is entered on the last line of column 10 as\nthe authorized dwelling rental, which controls the charges to be made as of the\nfirst day of the subsequent month. (column 11) Enter here the amount representing a\nretroactive reduction in surcharges charged to a tenant, as supported by a rent\nchange authorization. Do not enter retroactive surcharges written off as a\ncollection loss (see § 1642- 4.6). (column 12) Enter here retroactive surcharges made to\ntenants, as supported by a rent change authorization. (column 13) At the end of the month, enter on the last\nline of this column the difference between columns 11 and 12.

As units are vacated thereafter, the difference, between the\nfull basic monthly rent (exclusive of surcharges) and the pro rata basic\nmonthly rent (if any) through the charge-through date is entered in this\ncolumn. (column 16) As units are rented, enter the pro rata\nbasic monthly rent for the fraction of the month charged to the tenant moving\ninto a unit. Pro rata surcharges to tenants moving in will be reflected in\ncolumn 19. (column 17) At the end of the month, enter on the total\nline of this column the difference between columns 15 and 16.
