Reimbursement\nfor physicians' services for which a maximum reimbursable allowance has been\nestablished in this Part shall be based upon payments actually made. However, reimbursement shall not be available for amounts paid in excess of the maximum\nreimbursable allowance prescribed nor for services not included in Part 505 of\nthis Subchapter. (1)\n\nIf a physicians' service\nor procedure for which no maximum reimbursable allowance has been established\nin this Part is necessarily rendered, reimbursement shall be based upon the\nexpenditures actually made therefor, in accordance with applicable regulations\nof the department. (2)\n\nIf, in\naccordance with the accepted practice, a physician's service or a procedure\nhereinafter listed in this Part is commonly carried out as an integral part of\nthe total service, only the value of the principal service or procedure shall\nbe the basis for reimbursement. When such a procedure is carried out as a\nseparate entity not immediately related to other services, reimbursement shall\nbe based upon the fee for the particular service or procedure. (i) When a special procedure is performed\nduring a medical emergency when the physician is rendering intensive care, items 9072 and 9073, for which there would be a separate allowance, reimbursement shall be available for the higher of the two allowances, i.e., the allowance for service or allowance for time. (3)\n\nIf immunization is administered at the\ntime of an office visit, reimbursement will be based upon the immunization fee\nin addition to the fee appropriate for the level of services provided during an\noffice visit. (4)\n\nCharges for\nspecial diagnostic procedures which are not considered to be a routine part of\na physician's or consultant's examination ( e.g., complete blood count, diagnostic X-ray, lumbar puncture) are reimbursable in addition to the\nphysician's usual office or home visit fee. (b) Intensive or unusual services. (1)\n\nFor intensive or unusual medical\ntreatment rendered to a patient who has an illness of such serious, critical or\nunusual nature as to require time and study far beyond normal limits, a fee in\nexcess of that listed in the fee schedule may be approved by the appropriate\nauthority. Decision shall be based on the facts of the case supplied by the\nattending physician. (2)\n\nWhen a\nspecial procedure is performed during a medical emergency for which there would\nbe a separate fee, the physician shall receive the higher of the two fees (fee\nfor special service or fee for time). (c) Services by more than one physician. When\nwarranted by the necessity of supplemental skills, reimbursement shall be\navailable for expenditures for services rendered to a patient by two or more\nphysicians. (d) Multiple visits. If\nan individual patient is necessarily seen on more than one occasion during a\nsingle day, expenditures for each such visit shall be subject to\nreimbursement. (e) Drugs and\nsupplies. Expenditures made by a social services district for necessary drugs, materials and supplies provided by a physician, where separate payment therefor\nis made in accordance with the local medical plan, shall be subject to\nreimbursement in accordance with applicable regulations of the\ndepartment. (f) Consultation fees. (1)\n\nReimbursement for consultation fee\nexpenditures shall be available only when an examination is made by an\naccredited specialist, within the scope of his specialty, upon request of the\nresponsible physician who is treating the medical problem for which\nconsultation is required. The responsible physician shall certify that he\nrequested such consultation and that it was incident to and necessary for his\nfurther treatment of the patient. (2)\n\nWhen the consultant physician assumes the\ncontinuing care of the patient, any subsequent services rendered by him shall\nnot be considered as consultation, and the established visit fees shall\napply. (g) Specialists'\nfees. Reimbursement for a specialist's fee shall be available only where the\nservices rendered are within the field of his specialty. Services performed by\na specialist outside his field of specialization shall be charged in accordance\nwith the general practitioner's fee schedule. (h) Complete physical examination. Reimbursement for expenditures for a complete physical examination shall be\navailable only when such examination has prior approval by the appropriate\nauthority except when such examination is required in an emergency. (i) Telephone calls. The services rendered by\na physician directly to a patient over the telephone are not reimbursable. Long\ndistance calls by a physician to another physician who has previously attended\nthe patient or to a hospital or other medical facility to obtain additional\nmedical information are reimbursable.
