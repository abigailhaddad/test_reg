  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-9.8 - Special procedures for a new portion or portion class\n\nState Regulations\n\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Subpart to the\ncontrary, where there was no taxable real property in a portion class on the\n1989 assessment roll, and taxable real property appears in the portion class on\na subsequent assessment roll, the adjusted base proportions shall be determined\nas provided herein. When a new portion is created, each class within the\nportion will be considered a new portion class. (a) For the first assessment roll on which\nthe portion class appears, the following applies. (1)\n\nThe current base proportion for the new\nportion class is zero. (2)\n\nThe\nadjusted base proportion for the portion class is the current base proportion\nadjusted for physical change as follows: (i) Determine the market value of the new portion class in the following manner: (a) Multiply the special assessing unit class\nequalization rate for the appropriate class on the assessment roll immediately\npreceding the roll on which the new class first appears by the special\nassessing unit class change in level of assessment factor determined between\nthe assessment roll immediately preceding the roll on which the portion class\nfirst appears and the assessment roll on which the portion class first\nappears. (b) Divide the taxable\nassessed value of the new portion class on the assessment roll on which the new\nportion class first appears by the rate determined in clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph. (ii)\n\nDetermine the market value of the existing classes in the portion in the\nfollowing manner: (a) Multiply the class\nequalization rate for each portion class on the assessment roll immediately\npreceding the assessment roll on which the new portion class first appears by\nthe appropriate class change in level of assessment factor as determined in\nsection\n8186-9.5\n(b) of this Subpart. (b) Divide the\ntaxable assessed value of each class on the assessment roll on which the new\nportion class first appears by the appropriate rate determined in clause (a) of\nthis subparagraph. (iii)\n\nSum the market values obtained in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nDivide the class\nmarket value obtained in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by the sum of the\nmarket values obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. The quotient\nobtained, expressed as a percentage to at least four decimal places to the\nright of the decimal point, is the adjusted base proportion for the new portion\nclass. (3)\n\nThe adjusted\nbase proportions for the classes other than the new portion class are\ndetermined in accordance with the procedures described in section\n8186-9.5\nof this Subpart except for the following adjustment: (i) Subtract the adjusted base proportion for\nthe new portion class determined in subparagraph (2)(iv) of this subdivision\nfrom one. (ii)\n\nProrate the adjusted\nbase proportions of the remaining classes by dividing the difference obtained\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by 100 and then multiplying each class\nadjusted base proportion, other than the new portion class, by the\nquotient. (iii)\n\nThe products\nobtained in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, expressed as percentages to at\nleast four places to the right of the decimal point, are the adjusted base\nproportions. The sum of the adjusted base proportions obtained in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph plus the adjusted base proportion for the new portion\nclass must equal one. (b) For the assessment roll immediately\nsubsequent to the first assessment roll on which the new portion class appears, the following applies: (1)\n\nThe local base\nproportion for each portion class is the adjusted base proportion determined\nfor the first assessment roll on which the new portion class first\nappears. (2)\n\nThe current base\nproportion for each portion class is the local base proportion. (3)\n\nThe adjusted base proportion for each\nportion class is the current base proportion adjusted for physical change\noccurring between the first assessment roll on which the new portion class\nappears and the immediately subsequent assessment roll. The adjusted base\nproportions are determined in accordance with the procedures described in\nsection\n8186-9.5\nof this Subpart. (c) For\neach subsequent assessment roll the following applies: (1)\n\nThe base percentage for each portion\nclass shall be determined as follows: (i) Determine the estimated market value of each portion class, other than the new\nportion class, by dividing the taxable assessed value of the real property in\nthe portion class on the final assessment roll on which the new portion class\nfirst appears by the appropriate final class equalization rate determined by\nORPTS in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 8186-2 of this Part for such\nportion class on such roll. (ii)\n\nDetermine the estimated market value of the new portion class by dividing the\ntaxable assessed value of the real property in such portion class on the final\nassessment roll on which such portion class first appears by the final class\nequalization rate determined for the appropriate special assessing unit class\nby ORPTS in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 8186-2 of this Part on\nsuch final assessment roll. (iii)\n\nDetermine the total estimated market value of the portion by summing the\nestimated market value of each class obtained in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of\nthis paragraph. (iv)\n\nDetermine the\nbase percentage of each portion class by dividing the estimated market value of\neach class obtained in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph by the total\nestimated market value of the portion obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. The base percentage shall be expressed as a percentage to at least\nfour places to the right of the decimal point. (2)\n\nThe current percentage for each portion\nclass shall be determined in the manner provided in section\n8186-9.3\n(b) of this Subpart except that the class equalization rate used for the new\nportion class shall be the class equalization rate for the class in the special\nassessing unit for the applicable assessment roll. The special assessing unit\nclass equalization rate shall be used until a class equalization rate for the\nnew portion class is established. (3)\n\nThe local base proportion for each\nportion class is the adjusted base proportion determined for the first\nassessment roll on which the new portion class first appears. (4)\n\nThe current base proportions are\ndetermined in accordance with the procedures described in section\n8186-9.3\n(c) of this Subpart. (5)\n\nThe adjusted\nbase proportions are determined in accordance with the procedures described in\nsection\n8186-9.5\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
