  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 651.57 - Granting of state aid\n\nState Regulations\n\nState aid will be paid on eligible direct operation and\nmaintenance costs. Where State aid, applied for by one municipality, is not\nreimbursed on an equitable basis to those entities outside its geographical\nboundaries which contribute flow to its sewage treatment plant (contracting\nmunicipalities, individual residents, school districts, Federal and State\nfacilities, and private, commercial, institutional and industrial enterprises, etc.), all such revenues will be deducted from the total direct operation and\nmaintenance costs before State aid is computed. Examples of eligible items for\n\nState aid reimbursement are: (a) salaries paid for labor and direct supervision of personnel necessary to\noperate and maintain the sewage treatment works; (b) the municipality's share of retirement, social security, workers' compensation and insurance costs for the above\npersonnel; (c) costs of materials\nand supplies, including fuel, chemicals, lubricants, power and similar\nexpenditures; (d) costs of\ninsurance premiums on sewage treatment plant structures and\nequipment; (e) prorated insurance\ncosts of self-insured municipalities if the self-insurance plan is submitted to\nand approved by the commissioner; (f) costs of operating and maintaining\nvehicles, vessels and other equipment, and for the replacement of vehicles, vessels and other equipment that are used exclusively or are an integral part\nof the treatment and/or disposal process; (g) real property taxes assessed by a\nmunicipal corporation on eligible sewage treatment works located outside of the\ncorporate limits of the applicant municipality; and\n(h) such other costs as in the judgment of\nthe commissioner are necessary for effective operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n651.57\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
