  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 370.6 - Soil productivity index system\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The soil productivity index system shall\nbe used to rank and classify soil map units, representing mineral soils or\nsubdivisions thereof, and classified pursuant to section\n370.8\nof this Part into mineral\nsoil groups 1 through 10. The commissioner shall assign a specific soil\nproductivity index to each such soil map unit as follows: (1)\nA soil map unit that represents the\nmineral soil that is determined to be capable of producing the most tons of TDN\nper acre per year shall be assigned a soil productivity index of 100. For the\npurpose of this paragraph, such soil map unit shall be known as the base soil\nmap unit. (2)\n\nIn the case of all\nother soil map units representing mineral soils, the soil productivity index to\nbe assigned to an individual soil map unit shall be determined by: (i) dividing the number of tons of TDN per\nacre per year that the soil map unit is determined to be capable of producing\nby; (ii)\nthe number of tons of TDN\nper acre per year that the base soil map unit is determined to be capable of\nproducing; and\n(iii)\nby multiplying\nthe resulting quotient by 100. (b) The number of tons of TDN per acre per\nyear that a mineral soil's soil map unit is capable of producing shall be\ndetermined as follows: (1)\n\nOne or more crops\nshall be selected on the basis of their significance to agriculture in New York\n\nState. (2)\nA maximum rotation for\nthe selected crops shall be derived by using the universal soil loss equation, considering prudent management necessary to maintain soil productivity and\ncapability. (3)\n\nYields, expressed\nin tons or other appropriate unit of measurement per acre per year, shall be\nestimated for each of the selected crops and shall be weighted in accordance\nwith the relative importance of each of the selected crops in the\nrotation. (4)\nTDN factors shall be\ndeveloped for each of the selected crops. (5)\n\nThe number of tons of TDN per acre per\nyear shall be calculated by multiplying the weighted yield for each selected\ncrop by the TDN factor developed for that crop and by summing the\nresults. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n370.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
