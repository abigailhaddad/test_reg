On any burner\nequipped with a proved pilot, regardless of firing rate, the main flame\ntrial-for-ignition period shall not exceed 60 seconds and the main flame shall\nbe continually supervised while the burner is firing. The electrical circuit to\nthe main fuel valve shall be automatically de-energized within four seconds\nafter flame failure and the de-energized valve shall close automatically within\nthe next five seconds. The burner may make one attempt to relight automatically\nduring this flame failure reaction time before the valve\ncloses. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
