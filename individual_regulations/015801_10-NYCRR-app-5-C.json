Approved methods for analysis of water samples to determine\ncompliance with this Subpart\nII. Sample compositing requirements\nA. Inorganic chemical compositing requirements\nB. Water sample compositing requirements for pesticides, dioxin, and PCBs\nI. Approved methods for analysis of water samples to\ndetermine compliance with this Subpart\n\nAll samples shall be analyzed using approved methods as\nrecognized by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and/or\nthe New York State Environmental Laboratory Approval Program (ELAP). A list of\napproved methods is available from ELAP on The Wadsworth Center's website at\nhttps://wadsworth.org/sites/default/files/WebDoc/I180_1_39_0.pdf or by request\nfrom the Records Access Officer, Department of Health, Corning Tower, Room\n2364, Albany, New York 12237-0044. Method references are cited in 40 CFR\n141\nat\n141.21(f), 141.24(e), 141.40(c), 141.131(a)(2), 141.704(a), 141.707(c) and\n141.852(c). Test strips for free chlorine, Method D99-003, may be used for\ncompliance monitoring only when approval of the State has been provided in\nwriting. Method D99-003, Revision 3.0, \"Free Chlorine Species (HOC1- and OC1-)\nby Test Strip,\" November 21, 2003, is available from Industrial Test Systems, Inc., 1875 Langston St., Rock Hill, SC 29730 or from the Records Access\n\nOfficer, Department of Health, Corning Tower, Room 2364, Albany, New York\n12237-0044. II. Sample compositing requirements\nA. Inorganic chemical sample compositing\nrequirements\n\nThe State may reduce the total number of samples which must be\nanalyzed in accordance with Tables 8A-8D of section\n5-1.52\nof this Subpart by allowing\nthe use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five samples are\nallowed, provided that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is\nless than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of samples shall be done in an ELAP\ncertified laboratory. If the concentration in the composite sample is greater than or\nequal to one-fifth of the MCL of any inorganic chemical, then a follow-up\nsample shall be taken within 14 days at each sampling point included in the\ncomposite. Each of the follow-up samples shall be analyzed for the\ncontaminant(s) that exceeded one-fifth of the MCL in the composite\nsample. B. Water sample compositing requirements for pesticides, dioxin, and PCBs\n\nThe State may reduce the total number of samples collected and\nanalyzed in accordance with Table 9C of section\n5-1.52\nof this Subpart by allowing\nthe use of compositing. Composite samples from a maximum of five samples are\nallowed, provided that the detection limit of the method used for analysis is\nless than one-fifth of the MCL. Compositing of samples shall be done in an ELAP\ncertified laboratory. (a) If the concentration in the composite sample is greater\nthan or equal to the detection limit of any organic chemicals listed in section\n5-1.52\n\nTable 9C, then a separate\nfollow-up sample shall be taken within 14 days at each sampling point included\nin the composite. Each of the follow-up samples shall be analyzed for the\ncontaminant(s) which were detected in the composite sample. (b) If duplicates or residual portions of the original sample\ntaken from each sampling point used in the composites are available, the system\nmay use such samples if additional sampling is necessary. Additional samples\nshall be analyzed and the results reported to the State within 14 days of\ncollection. (c) In systems serving fewer than 3,300 persons, the State may\npermit compositing among different systems provided the five-sample limit is\nmaintained. In systems serving 3,300 or more persons, the State may permit\ncompositing of samples from up to five sampling locations within the system, provided the reporting limit is maintained. Notes\nN.Y.
