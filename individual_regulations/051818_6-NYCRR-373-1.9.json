  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.9 - Special forms of permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Hazardous waste incinerator permits. Except as set forth in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, the standards of this subpart do not apply to a hazardous waste incineration\nunit that becomes subject to this Part permit requirements after October 12, 2005, or no longer apply to a hazardous waste incineration unit when the owner\nor operator of the hazardous waste incineration unit demonstrates compliance\nwith the air emission standards and limitations in 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title (\ni.e., by conducting a comprehensive performance\ntest and submitting a Notification of Compliance under\n40 CFR\n63.1207\n[j] and 63.1210[d] of subpart EEE, documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n[a] and [d]\nof this Title). (1)\n\nFor the purposes\nof determining operational readiness following completion of physical\nconstruction, the commissioner must establish permit conditions, including but\nnot limited to allowable waste feeds and operating conditions, in the permit to\na new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit conditions will be effective\nfor the minimum time required to bring the incinerator to a point of\noperational readiness to conduct a trial burn, not to exceed 720 hours\noperating time for treatment of hazardous waste. The commissioner may extend\nthe duration of this operational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the applicant when good cause is shown. The permit may be\nmodified to reflect the extension according to section\n373-1.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart (minor modifications of permit). (i) Applicants must submit a statement with the permit application which suggests\nthe conditions necessary to operate in compliance with the performance\nstandards of section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis part during this period. This statement must include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates and the operating\nparameters identified in section\n373-2.15\n(f). (ii)\n\nThe commissioner will review this\nstatement and any other relevant information submitted with the permit\napplication, and specify requirements for this period sufficient to meet the\nperformance standards of section\n373-2.15\n(d). (2)\n\nFor the purposes of\ndetermining feasibility of compliance with the performance standards of section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis Part and of determining adequate operating conditions under subdivision\n(f) of such section, the commissioner must establish conditions in the permit\nfor a new hazardous waste incinerator to be effective during the trial burn. (i) Applicants must propose a trial burn\nplan, prepared under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, with the permit\napplication. (ii)\n\nThe trial burn\nplan must include the following information: (a) an analysis of each waste or mixture of\nwastes to be burned, that includes: (1)\nheat\nvalue of the waste in the form and composition it will be burned; (2)\nviscosity (if applicable), or description\nof the physical form of the waste; (3)\nan identification of any hazardous\norganic constituents listed in Appendix 23 of this Title that are present in\nthe waste to be burned, except that the applicant need not analyze for\nconstituents listed in Appendix 23 which would reasonably not be expected to be\nfound in the waste. The constituents excluded from analysis must be identified, and the basis for the exclusion stated. The waste analysis must rely on\nappropriate analytical techniques that are ELAP-certified analytical methods. If ELAP certified methods are not available, analysis should be performed using\nEPA standard methods. If neither of those are available, the department will\nevaluate and approve proposals to use other methods to ensure that resulting\ndata will meet data quality objectives; and\n(4)\nan approximate quantification of the\nhazardous constituents identified in the waste, within the precision produced\nby appropriate analytical methods that are ELAP-certified analytical methods. If ELAP certified methods are not available, analysis should be performed using\nEPA standard methods. If neither of those are available, the department will\nevaluate and approve proposals to use other methods to ensure that resulting\ndata will meet data quality objectives. (b) a detailed engineering description of the\nincinerator for which the permit is sought, including: (1)\nmanufacturer's name and model number of\nthe incinerator (if available); (2)\ntype of incinerator; (3)\nlinear\ndimensions of the incinerator unit, including the cross-sectional area of the\ncombustion chamber; (4)\ndescription\nof the auxiliary fuel system (type/feed); (5)\ncapacity of prime mover; (6)\ndescription of automatic waste feed\ncutoff system; (7)\nstack gas\nmonitoring and pollution control equipment; (8)\nnozzle and burner design; (9)\nconstruction materials; (10)\nlocation and description of temperature, pressure and flow indicating and control devices; and\n(11)\nflow sheets; (c) a detailed description of sampling and\nmonitoring procedures, including sampling and monitoring location in the\nsystem, the equipment to be used, sampling and monitoring frequency, and\nplanned analytical procedures for sample analysis; (d) a detailed test schedule for each waste\nfor which the trial is planned, including date(s), duration, quantity of waste\nto be burned, and other factors relevant to the commissioner's decision under\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph; (e) a detailed test protocol, including, for\neach waste identified, the ranges of temperature, waste feed rate, combustion\ngas velocity, use of auxiliary fuel, and any other relevant parameters that\nwill be varied to affect the destruction and removal efficiency of the\nincinerator; (f) a description of, and planned operating conditions for, any emission control equipment which will\nbe used; (g) procedures for rapidly\nstopping waste feed, shutting down the incinerator, and controlling emissions\nin the event of an equipment malfunction; and\n(h) other information the commissioner finds\nnecessary to determine to approve the trial burn plan in light of the purposes\nof this paragraph and the criteria in subparagraph (v) of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner, in reviewing the trial burn plan, will evaluate the sufficiency\nof the information provided, and may require that the applicant supplement this\ninformation, if necessary, to achieve the purposes of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nBased on the waste analysis\ndata in the trial burn plan, the commissioner will specify as trial principle\norganic hazardous constituents (POHC's), those constituents for which\ndestruction and removal efficiencies must be calculated during the trial burn. These trial POHC's will be specified by the commissioner based on his or her\nestimate of the difficulty of incineration of the constituents identified in\nthe waste analysis, their concentration or mass in the waste feed, and for\nwastes listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title, the hazardous\nwaste organic constituent(s) identified in Appendix 22, infra, as the basis for listing. (v) The\ncommissioner shall approve a trial burn plan if the commissioner finds that: (a) the trial burn is likely to determine\nwhether the incinerator performance standards required by section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis Part can be met; (b) the trial\nburn itself will not present an imminent hazard to human health or the\nenvironment; (c) the trial burn\nwill help the commissioner to determine operating requirements to be specified\nunder section\n373-2.15\n(f) of\nthis Part; and\n(d) the information\nsought in clauses (\na\n) and (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph cannot reasonably be developed through other means. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner must send a\nnotice to all persons on the facility mailing list as set forth in section\n621.7\nof this Title and to the\nappropriate units of local government as set forth in section\n621.7\nof this Title announcing the\nscheduled commencement and completion dates for the trial burn. The applicant\nmay not commence the trial burn until after the commissioner has issued such\nnotice. (a) This notice must be mailed within\na reasonable time period before the scheduled trial burn. An additional notice\nis not required if the trial burn is delayed due to circumstances beyond the\ncontrol of the facility or the permitting agency. (b) This notice must contain: (1)\nthe name and telephone number of the\napplicant's contact person; (2)\nthe\nname and telephone number of the permitting agency's contact office; (3)\nthe location where the approved trial\nburn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and\n(4)\nan expected time period for\ncommencement and completion of the trial burn. (vii)\n\nDuring each approved trial burn (or as\nsoon after the burn as is practicable), the applicant must make the following\ndeterminations: (a) a quantitative analysis\nof the trial POHC's in the waste feed to the incinerator; (b) a quantitative analysis of the exhaust\ngas for the concentration and mass emissions of the trial POHC's, oxygen and\nhydrogen chloride (HCl); (c) a\nquantitative analysis of the scrubber water (if any), ash residues and other\nresidues, for the purpose of estimating the fate of the trial POHC's; (d) a computation of destruction and removal\nefficiency (DRE), in accordance with the DRE formula specified in section\n373-2.15\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Part; (e) if the HCl emission\nrate exceeds 1.8 kilograms of HCl per hour (4 pounds per hour), a computation\nof HCl removal efficiency in accordance with section\n373-2.15\n(d)(2); (f) a computation of particulate emissions, in accordance with section\n373-2.15\n(d)(3); (g) an identification of sources of fugitive\nemissions and their means of control; (h) a measurement of average, maximum and\nminimum temperatures and combustion gas velocity; (i) a continuous measurement of carbon\nmonoxide (CO) in the exhaust gas; and\n(j) other information as the commissioner may\nspecify as necessary to ensure that the trial burn will determine compliance\nwith the performance standards in section\n373-2.15\n(d) and to\nestablish the operating conditions required by section\n373-2.15\n(f) as\nnecessary to meet that performance standard. (viii)\n\nThe applicant must submit a\ncertification to the commissioner that the trial burn has been conducted in\naccordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must submit the results of\nall the determinations required in subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph. This\nsubmission must be made within 90 days of completion of the trial burn, or\nlater if approved by the commissioner. (ix)\n\nAll data collected during any trial burn\nmust be submitted to the commissioner following the completion of the trial\nburn. (x) All submissions required\nby this paragraph must be certified on behalf of the applicant by the signature\nof a person authorized to sign a permit application or a report under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. (xi)\n\nBased on the\nresults of the trial burn, the commissioner shall set the operating\nrequirements in the final permit according to section\n373-2.15\n(f) of\nthis Part. The permit modification shall proceed as a minor modification\naccording to section\n373-1.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nFor the\npurposes of allowing operation of a new hazardous waste incinerator, following\ncompletion of the trial burn and prior to final modification of the permit\nconditions to reflect the trial burn results, the commissioner may establish\npermit conditions, including, but not limited to, allowable waste feeds and\noperating conditions sufficient to meet the requirements of section\n373-2.15\n(f) of\nthis Part, in the permit to a new hazardous waste incinerator. These permit\nconditions will be effective for the minimum time required to complete sample\nanalysis, date computation and submission of the trial burn results by the\napplicant, and modification of the facility permit by the commissioner. (i) Applicants must submit a statement with\nthe permit application, identifying the conditions necessary to operate in\ncompliance with the performance standards of section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis Part, during this period. This statement should include, at a minimum, restrictions on waste constituents, waste feed rates and the operating\nparameters in section\n373-2.15\n(f). (ii)\n\nThe commissioner will review this\nstatement and any other relevant information submitted with the permit\napplication, and specify those requirements for this period most likely to meet\nthe performance standards of section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis Part. (4)\n\nFor the\npurposes of determining feasibility of compliance with the performance\nstandards of section\n373-2.15\n(d) of\nthis Part, and of determining adequate operating conditions under section\n373-2.15\n(f) of\nthis Part, the applicant for a permit for an existing hazardous waste\nincinerator must prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn\nin accordance with section\n373-1.5\n(f)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart and subparagraphs (2)(ii) through (v) and (vii) through (x) of\nthis subdivision or, instead, submit other information as specified in section\n373-1.5\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart. The commissioner must announce an intention to approve the trial\nburn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of\nsubparagraph (2)(vi) of this subdivision. The contents of the notice must\ninclude: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the\nname and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the\nlocation where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed\nand copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit\nissuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the\nplan and the time period during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants submitting information under section\n373-1.5\n(f)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart are exempt from compliance with section\n373-2.15\n(d) and\n(f) of this Part and, therefore, are exempt\nfrom the requirement to conduct a trial burn. Applicants who submit trial burn\nplans and receive approval before submission of a permit application must\ncomplete the trial burn and submit the results, specified in subparagraph\n(2)(vii) of this subdivision, with the permit application. If the completion of\nthis process conflicts with the date set for submission of the permit\napplication, the applicant must contact the commissioner to establish a later\ndate for submission of the application or the trial burn results. Trial burn\nresults must be submitted prior to issuance of the permit. When the applicant\nsubmits a trial burn plan with the permit application, the commissioner will\nspecify a time period prior to permit issuance in which the trial burn must be\nconducted and the results submitted. (5)\n(i) The\ndepartment may request additional information related to the hazardous waste\nincineration unit in accordance with section\n373-1.4\n(h) and (i)\nof this Subpart, and impose permit conditions as necessary to protect human\nhealth and the environment in accordance with section\n373-1.6\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (ii)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator of the hazardous waste incineration unit elects to comply with section\n373-1.12\n(a)(1)(i)\n(\na\n) of this Subpart to minimize emissions of toxic compounds\nfrom startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, then the owner or operator must\ncomply with those provisions that the department determines are necessary to\nensure compliance with section\n373-2.15\n(f)(1) and\n(3)\nof this Part. (b) Permits for\nland treatment demonstrations using field test or laboratory analyses. (1)\n\nTo allow an owner or operator to meet the\ntreatment demonstration requirements of section\n373-2.13\n(c) of\nthis Part, the commissioner may issue a treatment demonstration permit. The\npermit must contain only those requirements necessary to meet the standards in\nsection\n373-2.13\n(c)(3). The permit may be issued either as a treatment or disposal permit covering only\nthe field test or laboratory analyses, or as a two-phase facility permit\ncovering the field tests, or laboratory analyses, and design, construction, operation and maintenance of the land treatment unit. (i) The commissioner may issue a two-phase\nfacility permit if the commissioner finds that, based on information submitted\nin the application although incomplete or inconclusive, substantial information\nalready exists upon which to base the issuance of a facility permit. (ii)\n\nIf the commissioner finds that not\nenough information exists upon which the commissioner can establish permit\nconditions to attempt to provide for compliance with all of the requirements of\nsection\n373-2.13\nof this Part, a treatment\ndemonstration permit must be issued covering only the field test or laboratory\nanalyses. (2)\n\nIf the\ncommissioner finds that a phased permit may be issued, the first phase of the\nfacility permit must contain conditions for conducting the field tests or\nlaboratory analyses. These permit conditions will include design and operating\nparameters (including the duration of the tests or analyses and, in the case of\nfield tests, the horizontal and vertical dimensions of the treatment zone), monitoring procedures, post-demonstration cleanup activities, and any other\nconditions the commissioner finds necessary under section\n373-2.13\n(c)(3)\nof\nthis Part. The commissioner will include conditions in the second phase of the\nfacility permit in an attempt to meet all section\n373-2.13\nrequirements pertaining to\nunit design, construction, operation and maintenance. The commissioner will\nestablish these conditions in the second phase of the permit based upon the\nsubstantial but incomplete or inconclusive information contained in the permit\napplication. (3)\n\nWhen the owner or\noperator of a facility with a two-phase permit has completed the treatment\ndemonstration, the owner or operator must submit to the commissioner a\ncertification, signed by a person authorized to sign a permit application or\nreport under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart, that the field tests or laboratory analyses have been carried out\nin accordance with the conditions specified in the permit for conducting such\ntests or analyses. The owner or operator must also submit all data collected\nduring the field tests or laboratory analyses within 90 days of completion of\nthose tests or analyses, unless the commissioner approves a later\ndate. (4)\n\nIf the commissioner\ndetermines that the results of the field tests or laboratory analyses meet the\nrequirements of section\n373-2.13\n(c) of\nthis Part, the second phase of the permit will be modified to incorporate any\nrequirements necessary for operation of the facility in compliance with section\n373-2.13, based upon the results of\nthe field tests or laboratory analyses. (i) This permit modification may proceed as a minor modification under section\n373-1.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, provided any such change is minor, or otherwise must proceed as a\nmodification under section\n373-1.7. (ii)\n\nIf no modifications of the second phase\nof the permit are necessary, or if only minor modifications are necessary and\nhave been made, the commissioner will give notice of his or her final decision\nto the permit applicant and to each person who submitted written comments on\nthe phased permit or who requested notice of the final decision of the second\nphase of the permit. (iii)\n\nIf\nmodifications under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart are necessary, the second phase of the permit shall become effective\nonly after those modifications have been made. (c) Research, development, and\ndemonstration permits. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may issue a research, development, and demonstration permit for\nany hazardous waste treatment facility which proposes to utilize an innovative\nand experimental hazardous waste treatment technology or process for which\npermit standards for such experimental activity have not been promulgated under\n\nPart 373 or Part 374. This permit must include terms and conditions to assure\nprotection of human health and the environment. The permits: (i) must provide for the construction of\nfacilities as necessary, and for operation of the facility for not longer than\none year unless renewed as provided in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision; (ii)\nmust provide for\nthe receipt and treatment by the facility of only those types and quantities of\nhazardous waste which the commissioner deems necessary for purposes of\ndetermining the efficacy and performance capabilities of the technology or\nprocess and the effects of such technology or process on human health and the\nenvironment; and\n(iii)\nmust include\nsuch requirements as the commissioner deems necessary to protect human health\nand the environment (including, but not limited to, requirements regarding\nmonitoring, operation, financial responsibility, closure, and remedial action), and such requirements as the commissioner deems necessary regarding testing and\nproviding of information to the commissioner with respect to the operation of\nthe facility. (2)\n\nFor\nthe purpose of expediting review and issuance of permits under this section, the commissioner may, consistent with the protection of human health and the\nenvironment, modify or waive permit application and permit issuance\nrequirements in this Subpart and Parts 621 and 624 of this Title except that\nthere may be no modification or waiver of regulations regarding financial\nresponsibility (including insurance) or of procedures regarding public\nparticipation. (3)\n\nThe commissioner\nmay order an immediate termination of all operations at the facility at any\ntime the commissioner determines that termination is necessary to protect human\nhealth and the environment, provided that nothing in this Part shall preclude\nor affect the commissioner's authority to issue summary abatement orders under\nsection\n71-0301\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, or to take emergency actions summarily suspending a permit\nunder subdivision 3 of section 401 of the State Administrative Procedure\n\nAct. (4)\n\nPermits issued under this\nsubdivision may be renewed not more than three times. Each renewal period will\nnot exceed one year. (d) Permits for boilers and industrial furnaces burning hazardous\nwaste. Except as set forth in paragraph (8) of this subdivision, the standards of this Subpart do not apply to a cement kiln, lightweight\naggregate kiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid\nproduction furnace that becomes subject to this Part permit requirements after\n\nOctober 12, 2005, or no longer apply to a cement kiln, lightweight aggregate\nkiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production\nfurnace when the owner or operator of the cement kiln, lightweight aggregate\nkiln, solid fuel boiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production\nfurnace demonstrates compliance with the air emission standards and limitations\nin 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by\nsection\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, (\ni.e., by conducting a comprehensive\nperformance test and submitting a Notification of Compliance under\n40 CFR\n63.1207\n[j] and 63.1210[d] of subpart EEE, documenting compliance with all applicable requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n[a] and [d]\nof this Title). (1)\n\nGeneral. Owners\nand operators of new boilers and industrial furnaces (those not operating under\nthe interim status standards of section\n374-1.8\n[d]\nof this\n\nTitle) are subject to paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subdivision. Boilers\nand industrial furnaces operating under the interim status standards of section\n374-1.8\n(d) of this\n\nTitle are subject to paragraph (7) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nPermit operating periods for new boilers\nand industrial furnaces. A permit for a new boiler or industrial furnace shall\nspecify appropriate conditions for the following operating periods: (i) Pretrial burn period. For the period\nbeginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste and ending with\ninitiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time required to bring\nthe boiler or industrial furnace to a point of operational readiness to conduct\na trial burn, not to exceed 720 hours operating time when burning hazardous\nwaste, the commissioner must establish permit conditions for the pretrial burn\nperiod, including but not limited to, allowable hazardous waste feed rates and\noperating conditions. The commissioner may extend the duration of this\noperational period once, for up to 720 additional hours, at the request of the\napplicant when good cause is shown. The permit may be modified to reflect the\nextension according to section\n373-1.7\nof this Subpart. (a) Applicants must submit a statement, with\nthe Part 373 permit application, that proposes conditions necessary to operate\nin compliance with the standards of section\n374-1.8\n(e) through\n(h) of this Title during this period.

(4)\n\nTrial burn procedures. (i) A trial burn must be conducted to\ndemonstrate conformance with the standards of section\n374-1.8\n(e) through\n(h) of this Subpart under an approved trial\nburn plan. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner\nshall approve a trial burn plan if he/she finds that: (a) the trial burn is likely to determine\nwhether the boiler or industrial furnace can meet the performance standards of\nsection\n374-1.8\n(e) through\n(h) of this Subpart; (b) the trial burn itself will not present an\nimminent hazard to human health and the environment; (c) the trial burn will help the commissioner\nto determine operating requirements to be specified under section\n374-1.8\n(c)(5)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(d) the information\nsought in the trial burn cannot reasonably be developed through other\nmeans. (iii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner must send a notice to all persons on the facility mailing list as\nset forth in section\n621.7\nof this Title and to the\nappropriate units of local government as set forth in section\n621.7\nof this Title announcing the\nscheduled commencement and completion dates for the trial burn. The applicant\nmay not commence the trial burn until after the commissioner has issued such\nnotice. (a) This notice must be mailed within\na reasonable time period before the trial burn. An additional notice is not\nrequired if the trial burn is delayed due to circumstances beyond the control\nof the facility or the permitting agency. (b) This notice must contain: (1)\nthe name and telephone number of\napplicant's contact person; (2)\nthe\nname and telephone number of the permitting agency contact office; (3)\nthe location where the approved trial\nburn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed and copied; and\n(4)\nan expected time period for\ncommencement and completion of the trial burn. (iv)\n\nThe applicant must submit to the\ncommissioner a certification that the trial burn has been carried out in\naccordance with the approved trial burn plan, and must submit the results of\nall the determinations required in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. This\nsubmission shall be made within 90 days of completion of the trial burn, or\nlater if approved by the commissioner. (v) All data collected during any trial burn\nmust be submitted to the commissioner following completion of the trial\nburn. (vi)\n\nAll submissions required\nby this paragraph must be certified on behalf of the applicant by the signature\nof a person authorized to sign a permit application or a report under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. (5)\n\nSpecial procedures for DRE trial burns. When a DRE trial burn is required under\nsection\n374-1.8\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart, the commissioner will specify (based on the hazardous waste\nanalysis data and other information in the trial burn plan) as trial principal\norganic hazardous constituents (POHC's) those compounds for which destruction\nand removal efficiencies must be calculated during the trial burn. These trial\nPOHC's will be specified by the commissioner based on information including an\nestimate of the difficulty of destroying the constituents identified in the\nhazardous waste analysis, their concentrations or mass in the hazardous waste\nfeed, and, for hazardous waste containing or derived from wastes listed in\nsection\n371.4\nof this Title, the hazardous\nwaste organic constituent(s) identified in Appendix 22, infra, as the basis for listing. (6)\n\nDeterminations based on trial burn. During each approved trial burn (or as soon\nafter the burn as is practicable), the applicant must make the following\ndeterminations: (i) a quantitative analysis\nof the levels of antimony, arsenic, barium, beryllium. cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, thallium, silver, and chlorine/chloride, in the feed streams\n(hazardous waste, other fuels, and industrial furnace feedstocks); (ii)\nwhen a DRE trial burn is required under\nsection\n374-1.8\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Title: (a) a quantitative analysis of the\ntrial POHC's in the hazardous waste feed; (b) a quantitative analysis of the stack gas\nfor the concentration and mass emissions of the trial POHC's; and\n(c) a computation of destruction and removal\nefficiency (DRE), in accordance with the DRE formula specified in section\n374-1.8\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Title; (iii)\nwhen a\ntrial burn for chlorinated dioxins and furans is required under section\n374-1.8\n(e)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart, a quantitative analysis of the stack gas for the concentration\nand mass emission rate of the 2,3,7,8-chlorinated tetra-octa cogeners of\nchlorinated dibenzo- p-dioxins and furans, and a computation showing\nconformance with the emission standard; (iv)\nwhen a trial burn for particulate\nmatter, metals, or HCl/Cl2 is required under section\n374-1.8\n(f), (g)(3), (4), (h)(2)(ii) or\n(h)(3)\nof this Subpart, a quantitative\nanalysis of the stack gas for the concentrations and mass emissions of\nparticulate matter, metals, or hydrogen chloride (Hcl) and chlorine (Cl2), and\ncomputations showing conformance with the applicable emission performance\nstandards; (v) when a trial burn\nfor DRE, metals, or HCl/Cl2 is required under section\n374-1.8\n(e)(1), (g)(3) or (4), (h)(2)(ii) or\n(h)(3)\nof this Subpart, a quantitative\nanalysis of the scrubber water (if any), ash residues, other residues, and\nproducts for the purpose of estimating the fate of the trial POHC's, metals, and chlorine/chloride; (vi)\nan\nidentification of sources of fugitive emissions and their means of\ncontrol; (vii)\na continuous\nmeasurement of carbon monoxide (CO), oxygen, and where required, hydrocarbons\n(HC), in the stack gas; and\n(viii)\nsuch other information as the commissioner may specify as necessary to ensure\nthat the trial burn will determine compliance with the performance standards in\nsection\n374-1.8\n(e) through\n(h) of this Title and to establish the\noperating conditions required by section\n374-1.8\n(c)(5)\nof\nthis Title as necessary to meet those performance standards. (7)\n\nInterim status boilers and\nindustrial furnaces. For the purpose of determining feasibility of compliance\nwith the performance standards of section\n374-1.8\n(e) through\n(h) of this Title and of determining adequate\noperating conditions under section\n374-1.8\n(d) of this\n\nTitle, applicants owning or operating existing boilers or industrial furnaces\noperated under the interim status standards of section\n374-1.8\n(d) of this\n\nTitle must either prepare and submit a trial burn plan and perform a trial burn\nin accordance with the requirements of this subdivision or submit other\ninformation as specified in section\n373-1.5\n(i)(1)(vi)\nof this Subpart. The commissioner must announce an intention to approve the\ntrial burn plan in accordance with the timing and distribution requirements of\nsubparagraph (4)(iii) of this subdivision. The contents of the notice must\ninclude: the name and telephone number of a contact person at the facility; the\nname and telephone number of a contact office at the permitting agency; the\nlocation where the trial burn plan and any supporting documents can be reviewed\nand copied; and a schedule of the activities that are required prior to permit\nissuance, including the anticipated time schedule for agency approval of the\nplan and the time periods during which the trial burn would be conducted. Applicants who submit a trial burn plan and receive approval before submission\nof the Part 373 permit application must complete the trial burn and submit the\nresults specified in paragraph (6) of this subdivision with the Part 373 permit\napplication. If completion of this process conflicts with the date set for\nsubmission of the Part 373 application, the applicant must contact the\ncommissioner to establish a later date for submission of the Part 373\napplication or the trial burn results. If the applicant submits a trial burn\nplan with the Part 373 permit application, the trial burn must be conducted and\nthe results submitted within a time period prior to permit issuance to be\nspecified by the commissioner. (8)\n\nThe requirements of this subdivision continue to apply as follows: (i) The department may request additional\ninformation related to the cement kiln, lightweight aggregate kiln, solid fuel\nboiler, liquid fuel boiler, or hydrochloric acid production furnace in\naccordance with section\n373-1.4\n(h) and (i)\nof this Subart, and impose permit conditions as necessary to protect human\nhealth and the environment in accordance with section\n373-1.6\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (ii)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator elects to comply with section\n373-1.12\n(a)(1)(i)\n(\na\n) of this Subpart to minimize emissions of toxic compounds\nfrom startup, shutdown, and malfunction events, then the owner or operator must\ncomply with those provisions that the department determines are necessary to\nensure compliance with section\n374-1.8\n(c)(5)(i) and\n(ii)\n(\nc\n) of this\n\nSubpart.
