  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 434.7 - Discontinuance of service to entire multiple dwellings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No steam corporation shall discontinue\nservice to an entire multiple dwelling (as defined in the Multiple Dwelling Law\nor the Multiple Residence Law) where the owner, person, firm or corporation to\nwhom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered, or from whom or which\nthe steam corporation has received payment therefor, has failed to pay such\nutility bills, until it has complied with the following procedure: (1)\n\nThe steam corporation must give 15 days'\nwritten notice of its intention to so discontinue by personally serving such\nnotice on the owner of the premises affected or on the person, firm, or\ncorporation to whom or which the last preceding bill was rendered, or from whom\nor which the utility has received payment therefor, and on the superintendent\nor other person in charge of the building, if it can be readily ascertained\nthat there is such superintendent or other person in charge; or\n(2)\n\nThe steam corporation must give 18 days'\nwritten notice to the owner, person, firm or corporation specified in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision if such notice is mailed in a postpaid wrapper to the\naddress of such persons, firm or corporation. (3)\n\nIn addition to the notice prescribed by\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, 15 days' written notice shall be\nposted in the public areas of such multiple dwelling, and 18 days' notice shall\nbe mailed to the \"Occupant\" of each unit in that multiple dwelling, to the\nlocal health officer and director of the social services district for the\npolitical subdivision in which the multiple dwelling is located; if the\nmultiple dwelling is located in a city or village, to the mayor thereof, or if\nthere be none, to the manager; or, if the multiple dwelling is located in a\ntown, then to the town supervisor; and to the county executive of the county in\nwhich the multiple dwelling is located, or if there be none, then to the\nchairman of such county's legislative body. Notice to mayors, managers, town\nsupervisors, county executives, and chairmen of county legislatures may be\nmailed to the persons specified therein or to their designees. Notice to health\nofficers, directors of social services, mayors, managers, supervisors, county\nexecutives and chairmen of county legislatures shall be repeated not more than\nfour working days nor less than two working days prior to such\ndiscontinuance. (4)\n\nWhenever a\nnotice of intention to discontinue steam service has been made pursuant to the\nprovisions of this section and obligations owed the steam corporation have been\nsatisfied, the steam corporation shall notify, in the same manner as it gave\nsuch notice of intention, the occupant of each unit that the intention to\ndiscontinue steam service no longer exists. (b) Notwithstanding the provisions contained\nin subdivision (a) of this section, no steam corporation shall discontinue\nservices to a multiple dwelling, where the owner, person, firm or corporation\nresponsible for making payment fails to pay utility bills, as long as occupants\nof such multiple dwellings continue to make timely payments for service in\naccordance with procedures filed by the utility and approved by the Public\n\nService Commission. All notices referred to in subdivision (a) of this section\nshall contain the intended date of discontinuance of service and a utility\ncontact, including a telephone number, who will advise occupants of the amount\ndue for steam service and who will arrange meetings with occupants to attempt\nto work out a mechanism for avoiding discontinuance of service in the event\nthat the owner continues to fail to make requisite payments or arrangements for\nsuch payments. The notice shall also refer to the provisions contained in\nsection 235-a of the New York Real Property Law authorizing occupants to\nset-off, against their rent, payments to utilities in such\ncircumstances. (c) A steam\ncorporation, following the procedure outlined in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, may require occupants in a multiple dwelling to pay no more than the\ncurrent steam charges incurred by the owner, person, firm or corporation to\nwhom or which the last preceding bill has been rendered or from whom or which\nthe utility has received payment therefor. A currentcharge for purposes of this\nsection means the amount properly billed the owner, etc., for steam used during\nthe billing period covered by the first bill rendered on or after the date when\nthe disconnect notice is issued. The current charges will not include any\narrears for earlier billing periods that may appear on such a bill. (d) If occupants in a multiple dwelling find\nthey are unable to reach an agreement with the utility to avoid discontinuance\nof service, they may contact the Consumer Service Section of the commission's\n\nPower Division. After such a request is received, a representative of the\n\nConsumer Service Section of the Power Division will attempt to work out such an\nagreement and will, if necessary, arrange a meeting with occupant\nrepresentatives, the utility, and the owner, person, firm or corporation\nresponsible for making payment for steam service; provided, however, that such\na meeting will be required only if the Consumer Service Section receives a\nwritten petition signed by at least 25 percent of the occupants in a multiple\ndwelling. (e) The Consumer Service\n\nSection may stay a threatened disconnection of service to an entire multiple\ndwelling where it concludes that good faith efforts are being made by the\noccupants to arrange for the payment of current steam bills. (f) Whenever an owner of a multiple dwelling, or the person, firm or corporation responsible for making payment for steam\nservice, fails to pay two consecutive bills for utility service by the time the\nthird bill has been prepared, the utility must notify the commission within 15\ndays that it has invoked the procedures outlined in subdivisions (a) and (b) of\nthis section. Unless otherwise authorized, the notification should be in the\nform of a semi-monthly report filed with the Consumer Service Section. Such\nreport should be cumulative, specify the total amount due for each overdue\naccount, the period of arrearage, and indicate if a notice of discontinuance\nhas been sent. If these reports demonstrate a need for changes in collection\nprocedures, the Consumer Service Section shall advise the commission. (g) Sections 434.3 through\n434.6\nof this Part shall be\napplicable with respect to the discontinuance of service to entire multiple\ndwellings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
