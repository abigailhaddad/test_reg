  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-9.5 - Permit contents\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following terms and conditions, at a minimum, must be\nincluded in a permit which establishes a PAL: (a) The PAL contaminant, the applicable\nfacility-wide emission limitation in tpy, and required monitoring provisions\nconsistent with this section. (b) The effective date of the permit and the expiration date of the PAL (PAL\neffective period). (c) The emissions\ncalculations to be used for compliance purposes. These calculations must\ninclude emissions from start-ups, shutdowns, and malfunctions. (d) The procedures to convert the monitoring\nsystem data to monthly emissions and annual emissions based on a 12-month\nrolling total as required by this Subpart. (e) 'Monitoring requirements'. (1)\n\nGeneral requirements. (i) A requirement that the monitoring system\naccurately determines facility emissions of the PAL contaminant in terms of\nmass per unit of time according to the criteria contained in the following\nparagraphs of this section as applicable. (ii)\n\nThe PAL monitoring system must employ\none or more of the four monitoring approaches meeting the minimum requirements\nset forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. If the facility utilizes CEMS\nto monitor a particular contaminant for which a PAL is sought, the facility\nmust use the CEMS data to demonstrate compliance with the\nPAL. (2)\n\nMinimum\nperformance requirements for approved monitoring approaches. The following are\nacceptable monitoring approaches when conducted in accordance with the minimum\nrequirements in paragraphs (3) through (9) of this subdivision: (i) mass balance calculations for activities\nusing coatings or solvents; (ii)\nCEMS; (iii)\nother monitoring\nsystems as approved by the department; and\n(iv)\nemission factors. (3)\n\nMass balance calculations. A facility\nusing mass balance calculations to monitor PAL contaminant emissions from\nactivities using coating or solvents must meet the following requirements: (i) provide a demonstrated means of\nvalidating the published content of the PAL contaminant that is contained in or\ncreated by all materials used in or at the emission source; (ii)\nassume that the emission source emits\nall the PAL contaminant that is contained in or created by any raw material or\nfuel used in or at the emission source, if it cannot otherwise be accounted for\nin the process; (iii)\nwhere the\nvendor of a material or fuel, which is used in or at the emission source, publishes a range of contaminant content from such material, the facility must\nuse the highest value of the range to calculate the PAL contaminant emissions\nunless the department determines there is site specific data or a site specific\nmonitoring program to support another content within the\nrange. (4)\nCEMS. A\nfacility using CEMS to monitor PAL contaminant emissions must meet the\nfollowing requirements: (i) CEMS must comply\nwith applicable performance specifications found in either 40 CFR part\n60, appendix B, or 40 CFR part\n75. (ii)\nCEMS must sample, analyze and record data at least every 15 minutes while the\nemission source is operating. (5)\n\nOther monitoring systems. A facility\nusing other monitoring systems to monitor PAL contaminant emissions must meet\nthe following requirements: (i) the\nmonitoring system must be based on current site specific data demonstrating a\ncorrelation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL contaminant\nemissions across the range of operation of the emission source; and\n(ii)\neach monitoring system must sample, analyze, and record data at least every 15 minutes, or at another less frequent\ninterval approved by the department, while the emission source is\noperating. (6)\n\nEmission\nfactors. A facility using emission factors to monitor PAL contaminant emissions\nmust meet the following requirements: (i) all\nemission factors must be adjusted, if appropriate, to account for the degree of\nuncertainty or limitations in the factors development; (ii)\nthe emission source must operate within\nthe designated range of use for the emission factor, if applicable; and\n(iii)\nif technically\npracticable, any facility with a significant PAL emission source that relies on\nan emission factor to calculate PAL contaminant emissions must conduct\nvalidation testing to determine a site specific emission factor within six\nmonths of permit issuance, unless the department determines that testing is not\nrequired. (7)\nA facility\nowner or operator must record and report maximum potential emissions without\nconsidering enforceable emission limitations or operational restrictions for an\nemission source during any period of time that there is no monitoring data, unless another method for determining emissions during such periods is\nspecified in the permit. (8)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements in paragraphs (3) through (7) of this\nsubdivision, where an owner or operator of a facility cannot demonstrate a\ncorrelation between the monitored parameter(s) and the PAL contaminant\nemissions rate at all operating points of the emission source, the department\nmust include in the permit default value(s) for determining compliance with the\nPAL based on the highest potential emissions reasonably estimated at such\noperating point(s). Alternatively, the department must determine that operation\nof the emission source during circumstances where there is no correlation\nbetween monitored parameter(s) and the PAL contaminant emissions is a violation\nof the PAL. (9)\n\nRe-validation. All\ndata used to establish the PAL contaminant must be re-validated through\nperformance testing or other scientifically valid means approved by the\ndepartment. Such testing must occur at least once every five years after\nissuance of the PAL. (f) 'Recordkeeping requirements'. (1)\n\nThe\nfacility must retain a copy of all records necessary to determine compliance\nwith any requirement of this Subpart and of the PAL, including a determination\nof each emission source's 12-month rolling total emissions, for five years from\nthe date of such record. (2)\n\nThe\nfacility must retain a copy of the following records for the duration of the\nPAL effective period plus five years: (i) a\ncopy of the permit application and any applications for revisions to the PAL; and\n(ii)\neach annual certification\nof compliance pursuant to Part 201 of this Title and the data relied on for\nsuch certification. (3)\n\nThe records must be maintained on-site or at an alternative location approved\nby the department. Such records may be retained in an electronic\nformat. (g) 'Reporting and\nnotification requirements'. Semi-annual monitoring reports and prompt deviation\nreports must be submitted to the department. The reports must meet the\nrequirements in this section and Subpart 231-11 of this Part. (1)\n\nSemi-annual report. The semi-annual\nreport must be submitted to the department within 30 days of the end of each\nreporting period, and include the following: (i) total annual emissions (tons/year) based\non a 12-month rolling total for each month in the reporting period recorded\npursuant to paragraph (f)(1) of this section. (ii)\nall data relied upon, including, but not\nlimited to, any quality assurance or quality control data, in calculating the\nmonthly and annual PAL contaminant emissions; (iii)\na list of any emission sources modified\nor added to the major facility during the preceding six-month period; (iv)\nthe number, duration, and cause of any\ndeviations or monitoring malfunctions (other than the time associated with zero\nand span calibration checks), and any corrective action taken; and\n(v) a notification of the shutdown of any\nmonitoring system stating, whether the shutdown was permanent or temporary, the\nreason for the shutdown, the anticipated date that the monitoring system will\nbe fully operational or replaced with another monitoring system, and whether\nthe emission source monitored by the monitoring system continued to operate. The notification shall also include a calculation of the emissions of the PAL\ncontaminant according to the provisions in paragraph (e)(7) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nDeviation\nreport. The major facility owner or operator must promptly submit a report of\nany deviations or exceedance of the PAL requirements, including periods where\nno monitoring is available. The deviation report must be submitted within the\ntime limits prescribed by Part 201 of this Title and the Title V permit. A\ndeviation report submitted in accordance with Subpart 201-6 of this Title will\nsatisfy this reporting requirement. The report must contain, among other\ninformation required under Subpart 201-6 of this Title, identification of the\nowner or operator, the PAL requirement that experienced the deviation or that\nwas exceeded, emissions resulting from the deviation or exceedance, and a\nsigned statement by the responsible official as defined by the applicable title\nV permit certifying the truth, accuracy, and completeness of the information\ncontained in the report. (3)\n\nRe-validation results. The owner or operator must submit to the department the\nresults of any re-validation test or method within three months after\ncompletion of such test or method. (h) Provisions which implement the\nmonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting and notification requirements\ncontained in this Subpart and any other requirements that the department deems\nnecessary to implement and enforce the PAL.
