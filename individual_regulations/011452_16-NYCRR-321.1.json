Tit. 16 § 321.1 - Classification of utilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurpose of applying the system of accounts prescribed herein, utilities are\ndivided into two classes as follows: Class C:Utilities having annual gas operating revenues of\nmore than $150,000 but not more than $1,000,000. Such utilities shall keep all\nthe accounts prescribed herein which are applicable to their operations. Class D:Utilities having annual gas operating revenues of\nmore than $25,000 but not more than $150,000. Such utilities shall keep all the\naccounts prescribed herein which are applicable to their operations, except\nthose accounts in which the letter D does not appear in the prefix. (b) The class to which any utility\nbelongs shall be determined by the average of its annual gas operating revenues\nfor the three years next preceding the effective date of this system of\naccounts. If the average of its gas operating revenues for the three years\nended December 31st of any year following the effective date of this system of\naccounts is greater than the maximum specified for the class within which the\nutility has therefore been included, such utility shall for the succeeding year\nkeep the accounts prescribed for such higher class. (c) Any utility, which because of its\nrevenues falls within a given class, may, at its option, adopt the system of\naccounts prescribed for a higher class. Notice of such action shall be promptly\nfiled with the commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
