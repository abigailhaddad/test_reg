  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-9.3 - Application of NOLs\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 210(1), 210-C)\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this\n\nSubpart, an NOL must be carried back three years preceding the taxable year of\nthe loss (the \"loss year\"). However, no NOL can be carried back to a taxable\nyear beginning before January 1, 2015. The NOL is first carried to the earliest\nof the three taxable years preceding the loss year. If the NOL is not entirely\nused to offset income in that year, the remainder is carried to the second\ntaxable year preceding the loss year, and any remaining amount is carried to\nthe taxable year immediately preceding the loss year. Any unused amount of NOL\nthen remaining may be carried forward for as many as twenty taxable years\nfollowing the loss year. NOLs carried forward are carried first to the taxable\nyear immediately following the loss year and then to the next immediately\nsucceeding taxable year or years until the NOL is used up or to the twentieth\ntaxable year following the loss year, whichever comes first. (b) When there are two or more NOLs, or\nportions thereof, to be carried back or carried forward and deducted in one\nparticular taxable year, the earliest NOL incurred must be applied\nfirst. (c) An NOL from a separate\nreturn year of a corporation that is filing as a new member of a combined group\nmay not be carried back to offset income of that combined group in a taxable\nyear in which the corporation was not a member of the combined group. (d) In the case of a combined report, the\nportion of the combined NOL attributable to any member of the group that files\na separate report, or to a member of a different group that files a combined\nreport for a preceding or succeeding taxable year will be an amount bearing the\nsame relation to the combined loss as the NOL of such corporation bears to the\ntotal NOLs of all members of the group having such losses, to the extent that\nsuch losses are taken into account in computing the combined NOL. The NOL\nattributable to a member filing a separate report, or as a member of a\ndifferent group filing a combined return, is to be calculated by applying the\nbusiness apportionment factor (BAF) of the combined group to that member's\nproportional share of the group's business loss. A corporation's share of the\ncombined group's NOL may be carried back to a separate return year of such\ncorporation to offset only that corporation's business income in such year. A\nNOL of a combined group may not be carried back to offset the income of a\ncorporation that was not a member of the combined group when the loss was\nincurred. (e) If the taxpayer makes\nthe election to waive the carryback period, it shall be irrevocable for that\ntaxable year. In the case of a combined report, the election is made by the\ndesignated agent and applies to all members of the combined group. Therefore, a\nmember of a combined group that has elected to waive the entire carry back\nperiod may not carry back its share of the combined group's NOL to a separate\nreturn year. A separate election must be made for each loss year. Failure to\naffirmatively waive the entire carryback period in the manner prescribed by the\ncommissioner means that such NOL must be carried back. (f) If a corporation calculates a higher tax\nliability for a taxable year under the capital base tax or the fixed dollar\nminimum tax than under the business income base, it does not need to utilize an\nNOLD. However, the year will be treated as a taxable year for purposes of\ndetermining the number of taxable years to which an NOL may be carried forward\nor back. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
