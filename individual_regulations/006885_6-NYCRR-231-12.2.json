  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-12.2 - Modeling analysis methodologies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The ambient impact analysis must follow\nthe procedures in the applicable guidelines at 40 CFR part\n51, appendix W: Guideline on Air Quality Models of the EPA and a modeling protocol which has\nbeen approved by the department. Emissions of PM-10 and PM-2.5 used in a\nmodeling analysis for this Part must include both the filterable and\ncondensable fractions (see definitions of PM-10 and PM-2.5 in Part 200 of this\n\nTitle). (b) Where an air quality\nmodel specified in appendix W of 40 CFR part\n51\nis deemed inappropriate, the\nmodel may be modified or another model substituted. Such a modification or\nsubstitution of a model may be made on a case-by-case basis or, where\nappropriate, on a generic basis for a specific program. Written approval from\nthe department must be obtained for any modification or substitution. In\naddition, use of a modified or substituted model shall be subject to public\nnotice and opportunity for public comment, with the determination of a complete\npermit application, in accordance with Parts 201 and 621 of this\n\nTitle. (c) For the purposes of\n\nSubparts 231-7 and 231-8 of this Part, the owner or operator of the proposed\nnew or modified facility must demonstrate that allowable emission increases\nfrom the proposed facility or modification, in conjunction with all other\napplicable emissions increases or reductions (including secondary emissions)\nwould not, at a minimum, cause or contribute to air pollution in violation of: (1)\nany national ambient air quality standard\nin any air quality control region; (2)\nquantified air quality related values\n(AQRVs) including visibility for the applicable Federal class I areas; and\n(3)\nany applicable maximum\nallowable PSD increment increase over the baseline concentration in any area, as defined in the following table: 'Contaminant'\n'Maximum allowable increase\n\nFederal Class I\nParticulate matter: PM-10, annual arithmetic mean......... 4\nPM-10, 24-hr maximum.............. 8\nPM-2.5, annual arithmetic mean........ 1\nPM-2.5, 24 hour maximum............ 2\n\nSulfur dioxide: Annual arithmetic mean.............. 2\n24-hr maximum..................... 5\n3-hr maximum...................... 25\n\nNitrogen dioxide\n\nAnnual arithmetic mean.............. 2.5\n\nClass II\nParticulate matter: PM-10, annual arithmetic mean......... 17\nPM-10, 24-hr maximum.............. 30\nPM-2.5, annual arithmetic mean........ 4\nPM-2.5, 24 hour maximum............ 9\n\nSulfur dioxide: Annual arithmetic mean..................... 20\n24-hr maximum............................ 91\n3-hr maximum............................ 512\n\nNitrogen dioxide\n\nAnnual arithmetic mean..................... 25\n\nClass III\nParticulate matter: PM-10, annual arithmetic mean............... 34\nPM-10, 24-hr maximum.................... 60\nPM-2.5, annual arithmetic mean............... 8\nPM-2.5, 24 hour maximum................... 18\n\nSulfur dioxide: Annual arithmetic mean..................... 40\n24-hr maximum............................ 182\n3-hr maximum............................ 700\n\nNitrogen dioxide\n\nAnnual arithmetic mean..................... 50\n\nFor any period other than an annual period, the\napplicable maximum allowable increase may be exceeded during one such period\nper year at any one location. (d) The emission rates for any existing\nemission sources to be used for the analysis of increment increases in\nparagraph (c)(3) of this section can be based on representative actual\nemissions instead of the allowable emission rates, provided the maximum actual\nrates under representative normal operations are used for short term\nincrements. Any increment expansions analysis for the purposes of paragraph\n(c)(3) of this section must use representative actual short term and annual\nemissions instead of the allowable emissions. (e) For the purposes of Subparts 231-5 and\n231-6 of this Part, the owner or operator of the proposed new or modified\nfacility must demonstrate that allowable emission increases from the proposed\nnew or modified facility would not, at a minimum, cause or contribute to air\npollution in violation of any national ambient air quality standard in any\nnonattainment area in accordance with the significance levels in section\n231-12.6\nof this Subpart. (f) For the purposes of the required net air\nquality benefit analysis of Subparts 231-5 and 231-6 of this Part, the owner or\noperator of the proposed new or modified facility must use the allowable\nemission increases from the proposed new or modified facility. For the impact\noffsetting sources, this analysis must use representative actual short term and\nannual emissions corresponding to the averaging times of the standards. The\nmodeling methods for conducting the net air quality benefit analyses must be\napproved by the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
