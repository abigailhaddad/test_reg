  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 172.1 - New York State information statement for employee and specifications for taxpayer-designed New York State wage and withholding tax statements\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 672\n(a) General. (1)\n\nEvery employer required to deduct and\nwithhold New York State personal income tax from an employee as set forth in\nthis Article, or who would have been required to deduct and withhold New York\n\nState personal income tax under the withholding methods and procedures\nprescribed in Part 171 of this Article and Appendix 10 of this Title if the\nemployee had claimed no more than one withholding exemption, is required to\nfurnish to each such employee, in respect to the wages, tips and other\ncompensation paid by such employer to such employee during the calendar year, a\nstatement, in duplicate, on\n\nWage and Tax Statement\nform\nIT-2102, showing the amount of wages, tips and other compensation paid by the\nemployer to the employee during the calendar year, the amount deducted and\nwithheld as New York State personal income tax, and all of the other\ninformation required to be shown on such form. To meet this requirement, an\nemployer must furnish the employee with the copy to be filed with the\nemployee's New York State personal income tax return and the employee's copy of\nthe completed form IT-2102. (2)\n\nCorrection of New York State wage and withholding tax statement. If it is\nnecessary to correct form IT-2102 after it has been given to an employee, a\ncorrected form IT-2102, clearly marked \"Corrected by Employer,\" must be issued\nto the employee. If a form IT-2102 is lost or destroyed, a substitute copy, clearly marked \"Reissued by Employer\" is to be furnished to the\nemployee. (3)\n\nTime for furnishing\n\nNew York State wage and withholding tax statements. Each form IT-2102 required\nby this section for a calendar year and any corrected form IT-2102 required for\nsuch calendar year must be furnished to the employee on or before February 15th\nof the succeeding calendar year or, if such employee's employment is terminated\nbefore the close of such calendar year, within 30 days from the date on which\nthe last payment of wages was made to the employee. If such employee is later\nreemployed by the same employer, a separate form IT-2102 must be furnished to\nthe employee covering such period of employment within the calendar\nyear. (4)\n\nIn determining whether a\n\nWage and Tax Statement\non form IT-2102 must be furnished to an\nemployee, if, for example, the wage bracket table method of withholding\nprovided for in section\n171.4\nof this Article and Appendix 10 of this Title is used, a\n\nWage and Tax\n\nStatement\non form IT-2102 must be furnished to each employee whose\nwages during any payroll period are equal to or in excess of the lowest wage\nfrom which New York State personal income tax must be withheld in the case of\nan employee claiming one exemption. In determining whether a\n\nWage and\n\nTax Statement\non form IT-2102 must be furnished to an employee in\nrespect to whom withholding is computed pursuant to section\n171.5\n(b) of this Article, such determination must be made under the rule set out in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, except that it must be made without regard\nto the reduction in the amount to be withheld provided for in section\n171.5\n(b) of this Article. Thus, an employer must make the determination of whether form\nIT-2102 must be furnished to an employee without regard to any reduction in the\namount of the New York State personal income tax to be withheld where the\nemployer is also required to deduct and withhold income taxes of other states, political subdivisions of other states or the District of Columbia. (5)\n\nWhere New York State personal income tax\nhas been withheld from annuity, pension, retirement, or individual retirement\naccount payments (see section\n171.10\nof this Title) or from certain gambling winnings (see section\n171.11\nof this Title), any reference in this section to (i) \"employer\" shall be deemed\nto include reference to \"payer\" or, where applicable, the \"New York State\n\nDivision of the Lottery\", (ii) \"employee\" shall be deemed to include reference\nto \"payee\", and (iii) \"Wage and Tax Statement\" form IT-2102 shall be deemed to\ninclude reference to \"Statement for Recipients of Annuities, Pensions, Retired\n\nPay, or IRA Payments\" form IT-2102P or, \"Report of Certain Gambling Winnings\"\nform IT-2102G, as the case may be. (6)\n\nUndeliverable forms IT-2102, IT-2102P and\nIT-2102G. Any copies of form IT-2102, IT-2102P or IT-2102G which, after\nreasonable effort, cannot be delivered are to be transmitted with the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return covering the second calendar\nquarter of the following calendar year, on or before July 31st of such year, or\nwith an employer's final return if filed earlier, along with a letter stating\nthat such forms IT-2102, IT-2102P and IT-2102G are undeliverable. Instead of an\nemployer transmitting the undeliverable forms with the quarterly combined\nwithholding and wage reporting return, an employer who issues forms IT-2102 and\nIT-2102P from branch establishments may, if such employer so desires, have the\nbranch establishments send the undeliverable forms to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (b) Wages, tips and other compensation\nto be reported on form IT-2102. Where form IT-2102 is required to be furnished to an\nemployee, whether the employee is a resident or a nonresident, the total of\nsuch employee's wages, tips and other compensation with respect to services\nperformed both within and without New York State must be reported on such form\nIT-2102. (c) Specifications for taxpayer-designed forms IT-2102, IT-2102P and\nIT-2102G. Employees and payers must comply with the instructions\nand requirements of the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance with\nrespect to the design and preparation of acceptable substitutes for the\nofficial forms IT-2102, IT-2102P and IT-2102G, and the information to be shown\ntherein.
