  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 382.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Retirement and Social Security Law contains various\nprovisions designed to assist a member or beneficiary in obtaining disability\nretirement or death benefits by creating rebuttable presumptions that an\ninjury, illness or disease was incurred in the performance and discharge of\nduties and, in some instances, as the natural and proximate result of an\naccident not caused by the member's own willful negligence. Once brought into\nplay, these presumptions are rebuttable by competent evidence. Many of the\npresumption provisions require that the member must have successfully passed a\nphysical examination upon entry into employment that failed to disclose\nevidence of the injury, illness or disease. The requirement, which must be\nsatisfied in order to raise the presumption, is intended to disqualify those\nindividuals who clearly sustained the injury or contracted the illness or\ndisease prior to obtaining the employment upon which membership is based. However, from time to time, the member and/or employer are unable to provide\nevidence of a successful pre-employment physical despite a diligent search for\nrecords and acknowledgement that an examination took place. With the passage of\ntime, records of examinations may be purged under Records Retention schedules\nor simply lost or destroyed. In one particularly poignant example, shortly\nafter the enactment of chapters 93 and 104 of the Laws of 2005, which created\nthe disability presumption for the participants in rescue, recovery and\nclean-up operations following the World Trade Center disaster, the Retirement\n\nSystem was confronted with a situation wherein the medical records of the Port\n\nAuthority of New York \"\" New Jersey were destroyed in the towers collapse. To\navoid the untenable outcome of denying the presumption to Port Authority Police\n\nOfficers, the Retirement System accepted a written statement from the Port\n\nAuthority's Chief Medical Officer detailing the examinations, including\nmedical, given during the police officer selection process with his assurance\nthat only those who successfully complete all requirements are considered for\nappointment as a Port Authority Police Officer. A further complicating factor\nfor the World Trade Center presumption was the realization that not every\notherwise eligible member was required to undergo a pre-employment physical at\nthe time of employment. It simply is not a requirement of many public\npositions. As a result, the World Trade Center presumption was amended in 2008\nto provide that an authorized release of all relevant medical records could\nsubstitute when the member had not had an examination. Although helpful to\nsome, the amendment did not address those who had undergone examinations for\nwhich the records were subsequently lost or destroyed. It seems highly unlikely\nthat the Legislature, in providing presumptions to assist members in obtaining\ndisability benefits, intended to bar those whose examination records were no\nlonger available through no fault of their own. This part is promulgated to\naddress this issue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
