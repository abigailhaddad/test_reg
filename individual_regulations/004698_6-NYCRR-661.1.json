Tit. 6 § 661.1 - Purpose of this part\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the public policy of the State, as set forth in the\n\nTidal Wetlands Act, to preserve and protect tidal wetlands, and to prevent\ntheir despoliation and destruction, giving due consideration to the reasonable\neconomic and social development of the State. It is the purpose of this Part to\nimplement that policy by establishing regulations that allow only those uses of\ntidal wetlands and areas adjacent thereto that are compatible with the\npreservation, protection and enhancement of the present and potential values of\ntidal wetlands (including but not limited to their value for marine food\nproduction, wildlife habitat, flood and hurricane and storm control, recreation, cleansing ecosystems, absorption of silt and organic material, education and research, and open space and aesthetic appreciation), that will\nprotect the public health and welfare, and that will be consistent with the\nreasonable economic and social development of the State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n661.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
