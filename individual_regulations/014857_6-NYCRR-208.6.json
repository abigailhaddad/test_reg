Tit. 6 § 208.6 - Compliance provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nprovided in section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(i)(b)\nof this Part, the specified methods in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this\nsubdivision shall be used to determine whether the gas collection system is in\ncompliance with section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(i)\nof\nthis Part. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of calculating\nthe maximum expected gas generation flow rate from the landfill to determine\ncompliance with section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(ii)(a)\n(1)\nof this Part, one of the following\nequations shall be used. The k and L\no\nkinetic factors\nshould be those published in the most recent Compilation of Air Pollutant\n\nEmission Factors (AP-42) or other site specific values demonstrated to be\nappropriate and approved by the department. If k has been determined as\nspecified in section 208.5(a)(4) of this Part, the value of k determined from\nthe test shall be used. A value of no more than 15 years shall be used for the\nintended use period of the gas mover equipment. The active life of the landfill\nis the age of the landfill plus the estimated number of years until closure. (i) For sites with unknown year-to-year solid\nwaste acceptance rate: Q\nm\n= 2L\no\nR\n(e-kc - e-kt)\nwhere, Q\nm\n= maximum expected gas\ngeneration flow rate, cubic meters per year\nL\no\n= methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste\nR = average annual acceptance rate, megagrams per year k =\nmethane generation rate constant, year1\nt = age of the landfill at equipment installation plus the\ntime the owner or operator intends to use the gas mover equipment or active\nlife of the landfill, whichever is less. If the equipment is installed after\nclosure, t is the age of the landfill at installation, years c = time since\nclosure, years (for an active landfill c = 0 and e-kc = 1)\n(ii)\n\nFor sites with known year-to-year solid\nwaste acceptance rate: n\nQ\nM\n= <\n> 2 k L\no\nM\ni\n(e-kt i)\ni = 1\nwhere, Q\nM\n= maximum expected gas\ngeneration flow rate, cubic meters per year k = methane generation rate\nconstant, year-1\nL\no\n= methane generation potential, cubic meters per megagram solid waste\nM\ni\n= mass of solid waste in the ith\nsection, megagrams t\ni\n= age of the ith section, years\n(iii)\n\nIf a collection\nand control system has been installed, actual flow data may be used to project\nthe maximum expected gas generation flow rate instead of, or in conjunction\nwith, the equations in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. If the\nlandfill is still accepting waste, the actual measured flow data will not equal\nthe maximum expected gas generation rate, so calculations using the equations\nin subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph or other methods shall be used to\npredict the maximum expected gas generation rate over the intended period of\nuse of the gas control system equipment. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of determining\nsufficient density of gas collectors for compliance with section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(ii)(a)(2)\nof this Part, the owner or operator shall design a system of vertical wells, horizontal collectors, or other collection devices, satisfactory to the\ndepartment, capable of controlling and extracting gas from all portions of the\nlandfill sufficient to meet all operational and performance\nstandards. (3)\n\nFor the purpose of\ndemonstrating whether the gas collection system flow rate is sufficient to\ndetermine compliance with section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(ii)(a)(3)\nof this Part, the owner or operator shall measure gauge pressure in the gas\ncollection header at each individual well, monthly. If a positive pressure\nexists, action shall be initiated to correct the exceedance within five\ncalendar days, except for the three conditions allowed under section 208.4(b)\nof this Part. If negative pressure cannot be achieved without excess air\ninfiltration within 15 calendar days of the first measurement, the gas\ncollection system shall be expanded to correct the exceedance within 120 days\nof the initial measurement of positive pressure. Any attempted corrective\nmeasure shall not cause exceedances of other operational or performance\nstandards. An alternative timeline for correcting the exceedance may be\nsubmitted to the department for approval. (4)\n\nOwners or operators are not required to\nexpand the system as required in paragraph (3) of this subdivision during the\nfirst 180 days after gas collection system startup. (5)\n\nFor the purpose of identifying whether\nexcess air infiltration into the landfill is occurring, the owner or operator\nshall monitor each well monthly for temperature and nitrogen or oxygen as\nprovided in section 208.4(c) of this Part. If a well exceeds one of these\noperating parameters, action shall be initiated to correct the exceedance\nwithin five calendar days. If correction of the exceedance cannot be achieved\nwithin 15 calendar days of the first measurement, the gas collection system\nshall be expanded to correct the exceedance within 120 days of the initial\nexceedance. Any attempted corrective measure shall not cause exceedances of\nother operational or performance standards. An alternative timeline for\ncorrecting the exceedance may be submitted to the department for\napproval. (6)\n\nAn owner or operator\nseeking to demonstrate compliance with section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(ii)(a)(4)\nof this Part through the use of a collection system not conforming to the\nspecifications provided in section 208.10 of this Part, shall provide\ninformation satisfactory to the USEPA as specified in section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(i)(c)\ndemonstrating that off-site migration is being controlled. (b) For purposes of compliance with section\n208.4(a) of this Part, each owner or operator of a controlled landfill shall\nplace each well or design component as specified in the approved design plan as\nprovided in section\n208.3\n(b)(2)(i)\nof\nthis Part. Each well shall be installed no later than 60 days after the date on\nwhich the initial solid waste has been in place for a period of: (1)\nfive years or more if active; or\n(2)\ntwo years or more if closed\nor at final grade. (c) The following procedures shall be used for compliance with the surface methane\noperational standard as provided in section 208.4(d) of this Part. (1)\n\nAfter installation of the collection\nsystem, the owner or operator shall monitor surface concentrations of methane\nalong the entire perimeter of the collection area and along a pattern that\ntraverses the landfill at 30 meter-intervals (or a site-specific established\nspacing) for each collection area on a quarterly basis using an organic vapor\nanalyzer, flame ionization detector, or other portable monitor meeting the\nspecifications provided in subdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nThe background concentration shall be\ndetermined by moving the probe inlet upwind and downwind outside the boundary\nof the landfill at a distance of at least 30 meters from the perimeter\nwells. (3)\n\nSurface emission\nmonitoring shall be performed in accordance with section 4.3.1 of method 21 of\nappendix A of 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n200.9\nof this Title), except that\nthe probe inlet shall be placed within 5 to 10 centimeters of the ground. Monitoring shall be performed during typical meteorological\nconditions. (4)\n\nAny reading of 500\nparts per million or more above background at any location shall be recorded as\na monitored exceedance and the actions specified in subparagraphs (i) through\n(v) of this paragraph shall be taken. As long as the specified actions are\ntaken, the exceedance is not a violation of the operational requirements of\nsection 208.4(d) of this Part. (i) The\nlocation of each monitored exceedance shall be marked and the location\nrecorded. (ii)\n\nCover maintenance or\nadjustments to the vacuum of the adjacent wells to increase the gas collection\nin the vicinity of each exceedance shall be made and the location shall be\nremonitored within 10 calendar days of detecting the exceedance. (iii)\n\nIf the remonitoring of the location\nshows a second exceedance, additional corrective action shall be taken and the\nlocation shall be monitored again within 10 days of the second exceedance. If\nthe remonitoring shows a third exceedance for the same location, the action\nspecified in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph shall be taken, and no further\nmonitoring of that location is required until the action specified in\nsubparagraph (v) of this paragraph has been taken. (iv)\n\nAny location that initially showed an\nexceedance but has a methane concentration less than 500 ppm methane above\nbackground at the 10-day remonitoring specified in subparagraph (ii) or (iii)\nof this paragraph shall be remonitored one month from the initial exceedance. If the one-month remonitoring shows a concentration less than 500 parts per\nmillion above background, no further monitoring of that location is required\nuntil the next quarterly monitoring period. If the one-month remonitoring shows\nan exceedance, the actions specified in subparagraph (iii) or (v) of this\nparagraph shall be taken. (v) For\nany location where monitored methane concentration equals or exceeds 500 parts\nper million above background three times within a quarterly period, a new well\nor other collection device shall be installed within 120 calendar days of the\ninitial exceedance. An alternative remedy to the exceedance, such as upgrading\nthe blower, header pipes or control device, and a corresponding timeline for\ninstallation may be submitted to the department for approval. (5)\n\nThe owner or operator shall\nimplement a program to monitor for cover integrity and implement cover repairs\nas necessary on a monthly basis. (d) Each owner or operator seeking to comply\nwith the provisions in subdivision(c) of this section shall comply with the\nfollowing instrumentation specifications and procedures for surface emission\nmonitoring devices: (1)\n\nThe portable analyzer\nshall meet the instrument specifications provided in section 3 of Method 21 of\nappendix A of 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n200.9\nof this Title), except that\n\"methane\" shall replace all references to VOC. (2)\n\nThe calibration gas shall be methane, diluted to a nominal concentration of 500 parts per million in air. (3)\n\nTo meet the performance evaluation\nrequirements in section\n3.1.3 of method 21 of appendix A of\n40 CFR part\n60, the instrument evaluation procedures of section 4.4 of method\n21 of appendix A shall be used (see section\n200.9\nof this Title). (4)\n\nThe calibration procedures provided in\nsection\n4.2\nof method 21 of appendix A of\n40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n200.9\nof this Title) shall be\nfollowed immediately before commencing a surface monitoring survey. (e) The provisions of this section\napply at all times, except during periods of start-up, shutdown or malfunction, provided that the duration of start-up, shutdown or malfunction shall not\nexceed five days for collections systems and shall not exceed one hour for\ntreatment or control devices.
