  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.10 - Security deposits fund investments\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe advisability of investing security deposits funds\nshould be carefully considered by local agencies in view of the bookkeeping\nproblems raised by the requirement in the New York State Real Property Law to\nthe effect that the return, if any, on the investment of security deposits\naccrues to the tenant. The local agency, therefore, derives no benefit from the\ninvestment of such funds and the benefit to the individual tenants, in view of\nthe size of most security deposits, is not only nominal, but out of all\nproportion to the expense to the local agency of keeping the records involved. In addition, the factor of possible loss on disposition of security deposit\nfund investments, which by law, are in the nature of trust funds, must be\nconsidered. Local agencies desiring, nevertheless, to invest security deposit\nfunds should consult with the division and secure approval of the accounting\nsystem and procedures for recording and apportioning to the tenants accounts\nthe interest earned. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1645-2.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
