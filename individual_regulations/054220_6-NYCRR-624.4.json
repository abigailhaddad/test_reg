  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 624.4 - Public comment hearing and issues conference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Public comment hearing.'\n(1)\n\nThe ALJ will hear and receive the unsworn\nstatements of parties and non-parties relating to the permit applications. A\nstenographic transcript of the statements will be made but will not be part of\nthe record of the evidentiary hearing, as defined by section\n624.12\nof this Part (except as\ndescribed in paragraph (3) of this subdivision or as otherwise admitted into\nevidence). At the ALJ's discretion, the public comment hearing may be conducted\nby video conference, telephone conference, or other similar service allowing\nfor attendance from remote locations, upon request from department staff, the\napplicant or the public and good cause shown, or upon the ALJ's own initiative, provided that the public has the ability to participate in the public comment\nhearing. (2)\n\nThe ALJ may require\nthat lengthy statements be submitted in writing and summarized for oral\npresentation. (3)\n\nWhenever a DEIS\naccompanies the application and the department is the lead agency as defined in\n\nPart 617 of this Title, all statements made at the public comment hearing will\nconstitute comments on the DEIS and all substantive comments must be addressed\npursuant to the procedures set forth in section\n617.9\nof this Title, unless\notherwise addressed pursuant to subdivision\n624.13\n(c) of the\n\nPart. (4)\n\nThe statements made at\nthe public comment hearing do not constitute evidence but may be used by the\nALJ as a basis to inquire further of the parties and potential parties at the\nissues conference. (5)\n\nWhen a\npublic comment hearing presided over by an ALJ has been held pursuant to Part\n621 of this Title before the permit application was referred to the Office of\n\nHearings and Mediation Services for proceedings pursuant to this Part, at the\ndiscretion of the ALJ, the record of the Part 621 public comment hearing and\nany written comments received may be accepted by the ALJ and no further public\ncomment hearing or written comment period will be required. (b) 'Issues conference.'\n(1)\n\nFollowing the public comment hearing, the\nALJ will schedule an issues conference (if one was not scheduled in the hearing\nnotice) that will be held in advance of the evidentiary hearing. At the\ndiscretion of the ALJ, the issues conference may be conducted solely on papers, orally or both. At the ALJ's discretion, the issues conference may be\nreconvened at any time to consider issues based on new information upon a\nshowing that the new information was not reasonably available at the time of\nthe issues conference. Upon a demonstration that the public review period for\nthe application prior to the issues conference was insufficient to allow\npotential parties to adequately prepare for the issues conference, the ALJ will\nadjourn the issues conference, extend the time for written submittals or make\nsome other fair and equitable provision to protect the rights of the potential\nparties. (2)\n\nThe purpose of the\nissues conference is: (i) to hear argument\non: ('a')\nwhether party status should be\ngranted to any petitioner; or\n('b')\nwhether applicant has raised issues for adjudication; (ii)\nto narrow or resolve disputed issues of\nfact without resort to taking testimony; (iii)\nto hear argument on whether disputed\nissues of fact that are not resolved meet the standards for adjudicable issues\nset forth in subdivision (c) of this section; (iv)\nto determine whether legal issues exist\nwhose resolution is not dependent on facts that are in substantial dispute and, if so, to hear argument on the merits of those issues; and\n(v) to decide any pending motions. (3)\n\nThe ALJ will preside over the\nissues conference and the participants will be department staff, the applicant\nand any person who has filed a petition for party status pursuant to section\n624.5\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe ALJ may require the submission of\nwritten argument to supplement the record of the issues conference. (5)\n\nUpon the completion of the issues\nconference or as soon as practicable thereafter, but in no event later than\nthirty (30) days after the issues conference or the receipt of written\nsubmissions thereafter, the ALJ will: (i) determine which persons will be granted party status; (ii)\ndetermine which issues satisfy the\nrequirements of adjudicable issues as set forth in subdivision (c) of this\nsection and define those issues as precisely as possible; (iii)\nrule on the merits of any legal issue\nwhere the ruling does not depend on the resolution of disputed issues of fact; and\n(iv)\ndecide any pending motions\nto the extent practicable. (c) 'Standards for adjudicable issues.'\n(1)\n\nGenerally applicable rules. Subject to\nthe limitations set forth in paragraphs (6), (7), (8) and (9) of this\nsubdivision, an issue is adjudicable if: (i) it relates to a dispute between the department staff and the applicant over a\nsubstantial term or condition of the permit or draft permit and the applicant\nhas provided a statement of issues that complies with subdivision\n624.2\n(c) or\nparagraph 624.5(a)(1) of this Part; however, with respect to SPDES permits\nsubject to section 750-1.26 of this Title, only SPDES permit conditions that\nare stayed in accordance with paragraph 750-1.26(e)(2) of this Title may be\nconsidered for adjudication; (ii)\nit relates to a matter cited by the department staff as a basis to deny the\npermit application and is contested by the applicant; or\n(iii)\nit is proposed by a potential party and\nis both substantive and significant. (2)\n\nAn issue is substantive if there is\nsufficient doubt about the applicant's ability to meet statutory or regulatory\ncriteria applicable to the project, such that a reasonable person would require\nfurther inquiry. In determining whether that demonstration has been made, the\nALJ must consider the proposed issue in light of the application and related\ndocuments, the permit or draft permit, the statement of issues filed by the\napplicant, the content of any petitions filed for party status, the record of\nthe issues conference and any subsequent written arguments authorized by the\nALJ. (3)\n\nAn issue is significant if\nit has the potential to result in the denial of a permit, a major modification\nto the proposed project, or the imposition of significant permit conditions in\naddition to those proposed in the draft permit. (4)\n\nIn situations where department staff has\nreviewed an application and finds that a component of the applicant's project, as proposed or as conditioned by the draft permit, conforms to all applicable\nrequirements of statute and regulation, the burden of persuasion is on the\npotential party proposing any issue related to that component to demonstrate\nthat it is both substantive and significant. (5)\n\nIf the ALJ determines that there are no\nfact issues to adjudicate and finally determines all legal issues raised by the\nparties, the ALJ will direct in writing that the evidentiary hearing be\ncanceled and the matter remanded to department staff for further appropriate\npermit processing, including completing the SEQRA review, subject to any appeal\npursuant to section\n624.8\nof this Part. For proceedings\ninvolving a DEIS, issues raised in petitions not addressed by the ALJ\nconstitute comments on the DEIS. (6)\nSEQRA Issues. (i) Department is the lead agency or there\nhas been no coordinated review. ('a')\n\nAs part\nof the issues ruling, the ALJ may review a determination by department staff to\nnot require the preparation of an environmental impact statement. Where the ALJ\nfinds that the determination was irrational or otherwise affected by an error\nof law, the determination must be remanded to staff with instructions for a\nredetermination. In all other cases, the ALJ will not disturb staff's\ndetermination. ('b')\n\nWhenever the\ndepartment, as lead agency, has required the preparation of a DEIS, the\ndetermination to adjudicate issues concerning the sufficiency of the DEIS or\nthe ability of the department to make the findings required pursuant to section\n617.11\nof this Title will be made\naccording to the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nAnother\nagency serves as the lead agency. ('a')\n\nWhenever the lead agency has determined that the proposed action does not\nrequire the preparation of a DEIS, the ALJ will not consider any issues related\nto SEQRA. SEQRA related issues may be considered, however, if lead agency\nstatus is re-established with the department pursuant to the provisions in\nsection\n617.6\nof this Title. ('b')\n\nWhenever the lead agency has required\nthe preparation of a DEIS, no issue that is based solely on compliance with\nSEQRA and not otherwise subject to the department's jurisdiction will be\nconsidered for adjudication unless: ('1')\nthe\ndepartment notified the lead agency during the comment period on the DEIS that\nthe DEIS was inadequate or deficient with respect to the proposed issue and the\nlead agency failed to adequately respond; or\n('2')\nthe department is serving as lead\nagency for purposes of supplementing the FEIS. In such case, only issues that\nare the subject of the supplementation will be considered for\nadjudication. ('c')\n\nWhenever issues addressed in this subparagraph are eligible for adjudication, the determination to require adjudication will be made according to the\nstandards set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (7)\nUPA Issues. The completeness\nof an application, as defined in Part 621 of this Title, will not be an issue\nfor adjudication. The ALJ may require the submission of additional information\npursuant to subdivision\n621.14\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (8)\n\nDepartment initiated\nmodifications, suspensions or revocations. The only issues that may be\nadjudicated are those related to the basis for modification, suspension or\nrevocation cited in the department's notice to the permittee. Whenever those\nissues are proposed for adjudication, the determination to require adjudication\nwill be made according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (9)\nSPDES permits\nsubject to section 750-1.26 of this Title. The only issues that may be\nadjudicated are those related to the SPDES permit conditions that are stayed in\naccordance with paragraph 750-1.26(e)(2) of this Title. Whenever those issues\nare proposed for adjudication, the determination to require adjudication will\nbe made according to the standards set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. Notes\nN.Y.
