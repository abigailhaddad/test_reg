  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 61.10 - Dental anesthesia certification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall\napply: (1)\n\nAcceptable accrediting body means\nan accrediting body which is accepted by the department as a reliable authority\nfor the purpose of accrediting educational programs in anesthesia, applying its\ncriteria for granting accreditation in a fair, consistent, and\nnondiscriminatory manner, and which accredits such programs on a national\nbasis. (2)\n\nConscious (moderate)\nsedation means a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients\nrespond purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied by light\ntactile stimulation. Reflex withdrawal from a painful stimulus is not\nconsidered a purposeful response. No interventions are required to maintain a\npatent airway, and spontaneous ventilation is adequate. Cardiovascular function\nis usually maintained. (3)\n\nDeep\nsedation means a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which patients\ncannot be easily aroused but respond purposefully following repeated or painful\nstimulation. The ability to independently maintain ventilatory function may be\nimpaired. Patients may require assistance in maintaining a patent airway, and\nspontaneous ventilation may be inadequate. Cardiovascular function is usually\nmaintained. (4)\n\nGeneral anesthesia\nmeans a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not\narousable, even by painful stimulation. The ability to independently maintain\nventilatory function is often impaired. Patients often require assistance in\nmaintaining a patent airway, and positive pressure ventilation may be required\nbecause of depressed spontaneous ventilation or drug-induced depression of\nneuromuscular function. Cardiovascular function may be impaired. (5)\n\nEnteral means a technique of\nadministration in which the agent is absorbed through the gastrointestinal\ntract or oral mucosa, including but not limited to oral, rectal, and sublingual\nadministration. (6)\n\nParenteral\nmeans a technique of administration in which the drug bypasses the\ngastrointestinal tract, including but not limited to intramuscular, intravenous, intranasal, submucosal, subcutaneous, and intraocular\nadministration. (7)\n\nInhalation\nmeans a technique of administration in which a gaseous or volatile agent is\nintroduced into the pulmonary tree and whose primary effect is due to the\nabsorption through the pulmonary bed. (8)\n\nContinual or continually means repeated\nregularly and frequently in a steady succession. (9)\n\nContinuous or continuously means\nprolonged without any interruption in time. (10)\n\nPatent means open, unobstructed, or not\nclosed. (11)\n\nTime-oriented\nanesthesia record means an organized document which shows at appropriate time\nintervals, drugs and doses administered, and physiologic data obtained through\npatient monitoring, during the course of conscious (moderate) sedation, deep\nsedation, or general anesthesia, to include the preoperative, intraoperative\nand recovery stages of treatment. (12)\n\nAmerican Society of Anesthesiologists\n(ASA) Patient Physical Status Classification\nASA I - A normal healthy patient\nASA II - A patient with mild systemic disease ASA III - A\npatient with severe systemic disease\nASA IV - A patient with severe systemic disease that is a\nconstant threat to life ASA V - A moribund patient who is not expected to\nsurvive without the operation ASA VI- A declared brain-dead patient whose\norgans are being removed for donor purposes\nE - Emergency operation of any variety (used to modify one\nof the above classifications, i.e., ASA III-E)\n(b) Certification requirements. (1)\nA licensed dentist shall not employ\nconscious (moderate) sedation, deep sedation, or general anesthesia in the\npractice of dentistry, at any location other than a general hospital, unless\nsuch dentist possesses a dental anesthesia certificate issued by the department\npursuant to this section, except that such certification shall not be required\nfor use of anesthesia as prescribed in section\n6605-a\n(3)\nof the Education Law. For such\ncertification the licensed dentist shall meet the requirements of this section, including the educational and training requirements prescribed in subdivision\n(c) of this section and the practice requirements prescribed in subdivision (d)\nof this section. Such certificates shall be issued for a three-year\nterm. (2)\n\nEffective January 1, 2018, certificates shall be issued in the titles: (i) dental general anesthesia, which\nauthorizes a licensed dentist to employ conscious (moderate) sedation (enteral\nor parenteral route with or without inhalation agents), deep sedation, and\ngeneral anesthesia; (ii)\ndental\nparenteral conscious (moderate) sedation for patients 13 years old and older, which authorizes a licensed dentist to employ conscious (moderate) sedation\n(enteral or parenteral route with or without inhalation agents) on all patients\n13 years old and older; (iii)\ndental parenteral conscious (moderate) sedation for patients 12 years old and\nyounger, which authorizes a licensed dentist to employ conscious (moderate)\nsedation (enteral or parenteral route with or without inhalation agents) on all\npatients; (iv)\ndental, enteral\nconscious (moderate) sedation for patients 13 years old and older, which\nauthorizes a licensed dentist to employ conscious (moderate) sedation (enteral\nroute only with or without inhalation agents) on all patients 13 years old and\nolder; and\n(v) dental enteral\nconscious (moderate) sedation for patients 12 years old and younger, which\nauthorizes a licensed dentist to employ conscious (moderate) sedation (enteral\nroute only with or without inhalation agents) on all patients.

(iii)\n\nIf a licensed dentist who seeks to\nadminister dental enteral or dental parenteral conscious (moderate) sedation to\npatients 12 years old and younger does not meet the aforementioned\nrequirements, the department may issue him or her the corresponding certificate\nfor patients 13 years old and older, if the licensed dentist meets the renewal\nrequirements for said certificate as set forth in paragraph (3) of subdivision\n(c) of this section. (4)\n\nUpon the request of the department, the licensed dentist shall submit to the\ndepartment copies of time-oriented anesthesia records that satisfy the\nrecordkeeping requirements contained in paragraph (8) of subdivision (d) of\nthis section, with or without the patient charts, to verify that the licensed\ndentist is in compliance with the above-referenced record-keeping requirements\nand ensure that the licensed dentist is practicing within the scope of the\ndental anesthesia certificate held by him or her.
