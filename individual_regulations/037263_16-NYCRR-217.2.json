Tit. 16 § 217.2 - (second district) stenciling and numbering poles and structures for carrying overhead wire\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each and every\nelectrical corporation, municipality, telephone corporation, telegraph\ncorporation, railroad corporation, and street railroad corporation owning\npoles, towers, or frames, hereinafter termed structures, in streets, highways, or public places, or on private rights of way, for supporting and carrying\noverhead electric wire system for the transmission or distribution of electric\nenergy for light, heat, or power, or for the operation of electric cars or\ntrains, or for telephoning or telegraphing, or for supporting electric lamps or\nfixtures, shall on or before January 1, 1913, stencil each such structure, except as hereinafter provided, as follows: to wit, (1)\nwith the initials of its name, abbreviation of its name, corporate symbol, or other distinguishing mark by\nwhich the owner of each such structure readily and definitely may be\ndetermined; (2)\nwith a number by\nwhich the location of each such structure may be described. (b) The manner of making such\nstencils shall be preferably with paint, otherwise with metal tags, badges, or\nstamps as each such corporation may elect to use; and that the characters of\nthe stencil shall be of such size and so spaced and hereafter maintained as to\nbe easily read from the surface of the ground at a distance of six feet from\nthe structure. (c) In the case of\ntwo or more companies jointly owning any such structure, the distinguishing\nmark of each company shall be placed on such structure but not more than one\nnumber necessarily shall be placed thereon. (d) In the case of such structures carrying\nor supporting overhead trolley wires where there is a double line of\nstructures, one on each side of the railroad track, such stencil need be\naffixed to but one line of such structures. (e) In the case of such structures erected\nupon private rights of way or on the public highways, of such character that\nthe construction may be deemed to be a through or trunk line, such stencil need\nbe affixed only to every fifth structure; provided however that each and every\nsuch structure situate within the limits of any city, village, or hamlet shall\nbe stenciled, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) herein. Where\nevery fifth structure is stenciled, the commission suggests that the number of\nthe mile from the starting point of the construction be placed on the structure\nstenciled, and also the number of every fifth structure within that mile. And\nthe commission further suggests that all such structures situate within the\nlimits of every city, village, and hamlet shall be numbered consecutively along\neach street, avenue, or highway for the distance upon which structures are\nlocated. (f) The requirements\nherein shall apply to all existing and future constructed structures and to all\nchanges in the ownership of structures. (g) Every such corporation shall file with\nthis commission on or before May 1, 1912, a statement showing: (1)\nthe initials, abbreviation of name, corporate symbol, or other distinguishing mark intended to be used; (2)\nthe means of stenciling to be employed: to wit, paint, metal tags, badges, or stamps; (3)\nthe method intended to be followed in\nnumbering structures: to wit, within the limits of cities, villages, and\nhamlets; and upon through or trunk lines.
