  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 216.4 - Opacity of emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Owners or\noperators of any iron and/or steel process must not cause or allow emissions\nfrom that process to have an opacity, determined by the method of subdivision\n(b) of this section, which exceed the limits contained in Table 2 of this Part, unless exempted under section\n216.10\n(b) or (c)\nof this Part. (b) Compliance with\nthe opacity standards will be determined by observing visible emissions\ndischarged during the operation of the iron and/or steel process. The observer\nmust stand at a distance sufficient to provide a clear view of the visible\nemissions with the sun oriented in the 140° sector of his back. The opacity of\nemissions will be computed by averaging the results of 24 consecutive opacity\nobservations made at 15-second intervals. For cyclic processes that generate\nemissions for less than six minutes per cycle, observations will be made only\nduring the operation of the process when visible emissions are generated. A\nsufficient number of process cycles must be observed to accumulate the required\nminimum of 24 consecutive opacity readings. (c) The fugitive opacity limits in Table 2 of\nthis Part are applicable to emissions emanating from building\nopenings. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n216.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
