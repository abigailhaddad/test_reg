  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8002.4 - Victim impact statement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Parole Board policy and intent. It is the policy of the Board of Parole that\ncrime victims are an integral part of the criminal justice process, that they\nshould be treated with fairness, sensitivity and dignity at all times, and that\nvictims of the most serious crimes should be permitted an opportunity to make\nan oral statement to a member of the Board of Parole in a setting that permits\nconfidentiality and a nonthreatening atmosphere. The board's intention is to\ncreate a meaningful opportunity for individuals whose lives have been severely\naffected by serious crimes to explain the impact of the crime in a face-to-face\nsetting. The board recognizes that some crimes may affect the lives of more\nthan one person and that in some cases a victim may need the support of another\nperson to enable him or her to make an oral statement to a board member. However, the board has finite resources and must place limits on who may make\nan oral statement, and under what circumstances and procedures, in order to\npermit it to manage all of its statutory responsibilities. The board's policy\nof permitting victim oral statements in some cases has been codified by the\n\nLegislature in chapter 559 of the Laws of 1994, amending the Criminal Procedure\n\nLaw and the Executive Law. These regulations set forth the procedures and\nlimitations specified in Criminal Procedure Law, section 440.50. (b) The Board of Parole will consider the\nwritten or oral statement submitted or made by the crime victim, or the\nvictim's representative where the victim is deceased or is mentally or\nphysically incapacitated, prior to rendering a decision to grant or deny parole\nrelease, provided that the victim's written statement is received by the\ndivision at least 10 business days prior to the date of the inmate's scheduled\nappearance before the board and that the request to make an oral statement\ncomplies with the provisions of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section. The\nvictim may obtain information concerning the inmate's scheduled appearance upon\nwritten request to the Victim Impact Unit. (c) (1)\nA\nwritten victim impact statement, or a request to make an oral statement, should\nbe addressed to the Victim Impact Unit, New York State Division of Parole, 97\n\nCentral Avenue, Albany, NY 12206. (2)\nA request to make an oral victim impact\nstatement must be in writing, and such a request or a written victim impact\nstatement must clearly identify the inmate's name and New York State\nidentification number (NYSID or \"NYSIIS\" number, which consists of seven digits\nfollowed by a letter). The NYSID number may be obtained from the office of the\ndistrict attorney in the county in which the inmate was convicted. (3)\nA letter may serve as a written victim\nimpact statement. If a letter is received from a crime victim which does not\nhave a NYSID number, the Victim Impact Unit will attempt to identify the inmate\nbased upon whatever other identifying information may be contained in the\nstatement. If the Victim Impact Unit is unable to identify the inmate based on\nthe information provided, the victim will be so advised. If the appropriate\ninmate can be identified, the written statement will be sent to the inmate's\nfacility of incarceration so that the statement may be available for\nconsideration by the board. (d) Personal meetings between a crime victim\nand a member of the board will be conducted for the purpose of permitting a\ncrime victim to make an oral victim impact statement only in accordance with\nthe procedures and limitations set forth in this section in order to permit the\nboard to allocate finite resources for this purpose. However, in its sole\ndiscretion, the board may waive one or more requirements of this section in\norder to further its policy of ensuring that crime victims are treated with\nfairness, sensitivity and dignity. (1)\nA\nrequest to make an oral statement should be made not later than six months\nbefore the inmate's appearance before the board for the board's decision\nwhether to grant or deny release. (2)\n\nThe time, place and date of the personal\nmeeting between the victim and a board member will be designated by the Victim\n\nImpact Unit on behalf of the board. (3)\n\nThe personal meeting/victim oral\nstatement should be scheduled and take place at least 30 days prior to the\ninmate's next appearance before the board for release consideration. (4)\n\nThe board reserves the right to limit the\nvictim oral statement to a reasonable time period. (5)\n\nLimitation on who may make a statement. In furtherance of its policy to create a meaningful opportunity for individuals\nwhose lives have been severely affected by serious crimes to explain the impact\nof the crime in a face-to-face setting and its recognition that some crimes may\naffect the lives of more than one person, the board may permit multiple oral\nstatements to be made. However, in order to conserve finite resources, the\nboard reserves the authority to permit only one oral statement by one victim, or victim's representative, for one crime. A victim's representative may make\nan oral statement in place of the victim only when the victim is deceased or\nincapacitated, and the board reserves the authority to determine who, in a\nspecific case, is the appropriate victim's representative. In order to conserve\nits finite resources, the board also limits the opportunity to make an oral\nstatement to victims of the following offenses, or a victim who the Chairman of\nthe Board of Parole has determined has been affected within the intent of this\npolicy by an offense other than one listed below: (i) a violent felony offense, as defined in\n\nPenal Law, section 70.02; (ii)\none\nof the following A-I felonies: murder in the first degree, murder in the second\ndegree, kidnapping in the first degree and arson in the first degree when there\nis serious physical injury to a nonparticipant or a nonparticipant is present\nin the building or motor vehicle; or\n(iii)\none of the following offenses, which\nare not included in Penal Law, section 70.02: manslaughter in the second\ndegree, vehicular manslaughter in the first degree, vehicular manslaughter in\nthe second degree, criminally negligent homicide, rape in the second degree, rape in the third degree, sodomy in the second degree, sodomy in the third\ndegree, attempted sexual abuse in the first degree, attempted rape in the\nsecond degree, attempted sodomy in the second degree. (6)\n\nLimitation on content. The oral statement\nmay not simply repeat the circumstances of the crime. The oral statement should\ndescribe the impact of the crime on the victim or the survivor. (7)\n\nMethod of recording the statement. The\nboard member conducting the personal meeting with the victim will prepare a\nwritten report of the oral statement. A copy of the report will be sent to the\nfacility to be included in the inmate's parole folder so that it is available\nfor the board at the time of the inmate's board appearance. The written report\nof the oral statement will be considered by the board panel that interviews the\ninmate as one factor in making a decision whether to grant or deny release\npursuant to Executive Law, section 259-i(2). (e) A written victim impact statement or\nwritten report of an oral statement shall be maintained in confidence by the\ndivision, unless disclosure to the inmate is expressly authorized by the victim\nor by court order.
