  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 180.8 - Definition of archery equipment\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purposes of the Fish and Wildlife Law and this\n\nTitle, a barbed broadhead shall be any arrowhead with a protrusion forming a\nhook, notch or backward point which impedes withdrawal of an arrow when the\narrow is pulled from the flesh of an animal. The physical measurement which\ndetermines if a blade or other protuberance is barbed is the angle of the rear\nedge of the protuberance in relation to the arrow shaft or the forward\nprojection of the arrow shaft. If the rear edge of the protuberance is\nperpendicular to the shaft, or angles forward as it progresses outward from the\nshaft, then the protuberance is not barbed. If any part of the rear edge of the\nprotuberance angles toward the rear as it progresses outward from the shaft, then the broadhead is a barbed broadhead. Notwithstanding the above definition, a protuberance which appears to form a barb, but freely swings forward to a\nnonbarbed position upon withdrawal of the arrow shall not be considered a barb; and a notch at the base of a blade extending no more than two millimeters from\nthe shaft shall not be considered a barb. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n180.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
