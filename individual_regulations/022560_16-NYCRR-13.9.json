(1)\n\nEvery backbill shall contain a written\nexplanation of the reason for the backbill that shall be sufficiently detailed\nto apprise the customer of the circumstances, error or condition that caused\nthe underbilling, and, if the backbill covers more than a 24-month period, a\nstatement setting forth the reason(s) the utility did not limit the backbill\nunder subdivision (c) of this section. (2)\n\nEvery backbill shall contain, or be\naccompanied by, all required information applicable under section\n13.11\nof this Part. (3)\n\nEvery backbill covering more than a\none-month period, other than a catch-up backbill, shall contain a notice that\nthe customer may obtain upon request a detailed billing statement showing how\nthe charges were calculated, including any late payment charges. All catch-up\nbackbills shall clearly indicate how the backbill was calculated, whether as if\nthe service were used during the current cycle, or as if redistributed back to\nthe last actual reading. (4)\nA\nbackbill shall be accompanied by an offer of a deferred payment agreement in\naccordance with section\n13.5\nof this Part, if\napplicable. (b) Limitations on backbill rendering. (1)\nA\nutility shall not render a backbill more than six months after the utility\nactually became aware of the circumstance, error or condition that cause the\nunderbilling, unless a court extends the time to render a backbill. (2)\nA utility shall not upwardly revise a\nbackbill unless the first backbill explicitly stated that the utility reserved\nthe right to do so, the revised backbill is rendered within 12 months after the\nutility actually became aware of the circumstance, error or condition that\ncaused the underbilling, and: (i) the customer\nknew or reasonably should have known that the original billing or the first\nbackbill was incorrect; or\n(ii)\nnew\ninformation shows that the first backbill was incorrect. (3)\nA utility shall render a downwardly\nrevised backbill as soon as reasonably possible and within two months after the\nutility becomes aware that the first backbill was excessive. (4)\nA utility shall not render a backbill for\nany underbilling when the reason for the underbilling is apparent from the\ncustomer's service application, or could have been revealed in a service\napplication and the utility failed to obtain and retain one. (c) Limitations on backbilling\nperiod. (1)\n\nWhen the failure to bill at an\nearlier time was due to utility deficiency, a utility shall not bill a customer\nfor service rendered more than 12 months before the utility actually became\naware of the circumstance, error or condition that caused the underbilling, unless the utility can demonstrate that the customer knew or reasonably should\nhave known that the original billing was incorrect. (2)\nA utility shall not bill a customer for\nservice rendered more than 24 months before the utility actually became aware\nof the circumstance, error or condition that cause the underbilling, unless the\nutility can demonstrate that the customer knew or reasonably should have known\nthat the original billing was incorrect. (d) Rebilling of estimated demands. (1)\nA utility shall not upwardly revise an\nestimated demand unless it can demonstrate that, for the period during which\nthe demand was estimated, it complied with the meter-reading requirements and\nthe no-access procedures of section\n13.8\nof this Part. (2)\n\nAll revised demands shall be based on the\nbest available information, including the customer's present and historical\nenergy consumption and load factor. (3)\n\nNo revised demand shall exceed 95 percent\nof the subsequent actual demand, unless the utility has, along with the\nestimated demand bill, offered a special appointment to read the meter, and the\ncustomer failed to arrange and keep such appointment, in which case the\nestimated demand may be revised up to the level of the subsequent actual\ndemand. (4)\nA utility shall\ndownwardly revise any estimated demand that exceeds the subsequent actual\ndemand, which 30 calendar days after such actual demand was obtained. (5)\nA utility may only upwardly revise an\nestimated demand within 60 calendar days after the subsequent actual demand was\nobtained. (e) Utilities\nshall comply with this section no later than March 18, 1988. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
