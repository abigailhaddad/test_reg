  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 155.9 - Sponsor contributions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Commencing on November 15th of the year in which State administration begins, and each November 15th thereafter, the program actuary shall estimate the\namount that each sponsor is required to contribute to a State-administered\ndefined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program for the current\ncalendar year, including the actuarially determined normal cost of the program, any prior service contributions required to be paid in such year pursuant to\nsection\n155.8\nof this Part, and any\nadditional amounts determined by the program actuary to be necessary to fully\nfinance all existing obligations of such program. The administrator shall\nsubmit to the fiscal officer of each sponsor a statement of the amount so\npayable plus any administrative costs payable by the sponsor. For good cause\nshown, the program actuary may recalculate the contribution, and, in such case, the administrator shall issue a corrected statement. If, as a result of the\namount determined to be paid for any calendar year, a sponsor overpaid its\nactual obligation for that year, the amount to be determined by the program\nactuary for the next succeeding November 15th shall reflect the amount of the\noverpayment, plus interest, as a reduction in the amount otherwise required to\nbe paid by such sponsor. (b) Within\n60 days after the date of a statement issued pursuant to subdivision (a) of\nthis section, the sponsor shall pay to the administrator the total amount due\nas shown on such statement. (c) The\nactuarial methodology and assumptions used by the program actuary to calculate\nsuch contributions shall be the same for all State-administered defined benefit\nvolunteer firefighter service award programs. (d) Interest shall accrue and be paid by the\nsponsor on all amounts due, but not received by the administrator within 60\ndays after the date of the statement issued pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection. The interest rate or rates used to calculate such interest shall be\nthe greater of: (1)\nthe investment return rate\n(or rates) assumed by the program actuary in the calculation of the normal cost\ncomponent of such unpaid contribution; or\n(2)\nthe actual investment return rate earned\nby the volunteer firefighters' defined benefit service award program trust fund\nduring the calendar year (or years) in which such unpaid contributions were due\nto be paid. (e) The\nadministrator shall notify the Comptroller of any amounts remaining unpaid more\nthan 90 days after the date of the statement issued pursuant to subdivision (a)\nof this section. (f) In the event\nthat a sponsor does not submit to the administrator an approved list in\naccordance with section\n155.7\nof this Part, the\nadministrator shall bill the sponsor for the contribution due for the calendar\nyear in which the list should have been submitted in an amount calculated by\nthe program actuary equal to the estimated contribution due during such year. Such estimated contribution shall be calculated by the program actuary as if\nall volunteer firefighters named on the latest year's approved list received by\nthe administrator continued to be volunteer firefighters and all such persons\nearned a year of service credit during the calendar year for which the list\nshould have been prepared in accordance with section\n155.7\nof this Part. Payment of such\ncontribution shall be made in accordance with subdivisions (b) and (d) of this\nsection as if the program actuary's cost calculations were based upon the\nactual certified listings prepared in accordance with section\n155.7\nof this Part. Upon receipt by\nthe administrator of the actual approved certified list prepared in accordance\nwith section\n155.7\nof this Part, the program\nactuary shall estimate the contributions due for such calendar year. In the\nevent that additional contributions are owed by the sponsor (including any\nadditional administration costs), the administrator shall bill the sponsor for\nsuch additional amounts. Interest shall be paid by the sponsor on all\nadditional amounts owed and shall accrue from the due date of the payment of\nthe estimated contribution billed to the sponsor by the administrator with such\ninterest calculated in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section. Any\nexcess of the estimated contributions over the actual contributions shall be\ntreated as an overpayment by the sponsor in the manner provided in subdivision\n(a) of this section. The amount of such overpayment shall be reduced by any\nrelated additional administration costs charged by the administrator or the\nprogram actuary. The assessment of any extra additional administration charges\npayable by the sponsor to either the administrator or the program actuary\nbecause of the failure to comply with section\n155.7\nof this Part shall be in\naccordance with the contract(s) between the Comptroller and the\nadministrator/program actuary. (g) Forfeitures shall be treated by the program actuary as an actuarial gain in the\nprogram cost calculations in the same manner as any other forfeiture of a\nservice award. The funds accumulated to pay the participant or the\nparticipant's beneficiary shall remain within the defined benefit service award\nprogram trust fund as if such funds were the accumulated funds associated with\nthe forfeiture of a non-vested service award. Should the person to whom service\naward payments are owed subsequently file an application for payment with the\nadministrator, the administrator shall determine and pay the amount of the\nservice award owed to the person and the actuarial liability for such payments\nshall be included in subsequent actuarial calculations of the sponsor's funding\ncosts of the State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service\naward program by the program actuary.
