  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 455.31 - Physical therapy\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis functional reporting center must contain all the\nexpenses associated with employing therapeutic exercises and massage and\nutilizing effective properties of heat, light, cold water and electricity for\ndiagnosis and rehabilitation of patients with neuromuscular, orthopedic and\nother impairments. Such services are provided in a coordinated and integrated\nprogram under the direction and prescription of a physician or a registered\nphysical therapist. Additional activities include but are not limited to the\nfollowing: the provision of clinical and consultative services; the direction\nof patients in the use, function and care of braces, artificial limbs and other\ndevices; prescribing therapeutic exercises; counseling patients and their\nrelatives; organizing and conducting medically prescribed physical therapy\nprograms; applying diagnostic muscle tests; administering whirlpool and compact\nbaths; changing linen on physical therapy department beds and treatment tables; assisting patients in changing clothes and other personal needs and\nparticipating in discharge coordination as required by the code. (a) Standard unit of measure: number of\ntreatments. (1)\nA treatment should be\nsynonymous with a visit. The treatment would consist of one or more modalities\nand/or procedures rendered during one patient visit. If a patient received two\nsuch visits in one day, that would constitute two treatments. The main\ndifference between a skilled (or rehabilitative) treatment and a maintenance\nvisit lies in the purpose and method of provision. A skilled treatment is\nrendered with the expectation of improving the patient's condition and is given\nby the licensed therapist or under the therapist's direct supervision. A\nmaintenance procedure is designed to help keep the patient at his/her present\nlevel of function and is most often performed by ancillary personnel and does\nnot require direct supervision. Maintenance procedures, for the most part, do\nnot require the therapist's skills and do not utilize the more refined\nmodalities or procedures. (2)\n\nFor\npurposes of reporting under this Article, a count of the total number of\ntreatments, both skilled and maintenance, will be required. However, facilities\nmust also maintain statistics which segregate skilled treatments from\nmaintenance procedures as they will be required for reporting to the Department\nof Health for other purposes, i.e., management assessment, PMR/IPR's and\nsurveys. (b) Data\nsource. The number of treatments shall be an actual count maintained by the\nphysical therapy department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n455.31\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
