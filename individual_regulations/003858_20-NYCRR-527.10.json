Any person who is the owner, licensee, or lessee of any place of amusement\nwhich he leases, subleases or grants a license to use to other persons who make\namusement charges or admission charges.

Cross reference: See section\n526.11\nof this Title. (c) Computation. (1)\n\nThe tax imposed on admission charges\nshall be computed as follows: (i) individual\nadmission charges are taxed on the total price when in excess of 10 cents, at\nthe rate of tax in effect at the place of amusement; (ii)\nstrip tickets or ticket books are taxed\non the total selling price thereof regardless of the individual price of each\nticket; (iii)\nseason tickets are\ntaxed on the total selling price thereof regardless of the price of the\nadmission to each event. Example 1: An amusement park operator does not charge admission to the\npark but sells tickets for rides at 25¢ each or a book of six tickets for\n$1.00. The charge for the single tickets is taxable at the price of 25¢ and the\ncharge for the book is taxable at the purchase price of the book. Example 2: An amusement park operator sells tickets at 10¢ each, but\neach admission requires the use of more than one ticket. The sale of the\ntickets is taxable as an admission charge in excess of 10¢\nExample 3: A season ticket holder pays $40 for a season ticket, entitling him to attend all home games of a professional football team. The tax\nis computed on the $40 admission, whether or not the holder attends the games, and regardless of the price at which the seat would have been sold for\nindividual games. Example 4: A summer theatre has 10 events during he summer, two of\nwhich are subject to tax. The tickets for each event sell for $10 each or an\nindividual may purchase a season ticket for $80 (20% discount). The tax on the\nseason ticket is to be computed on $16, $20 less the 20%\ndiscount. (2)\n\nThe\ntax imposed with respect to the permanent use or possession of a box or seat or\na lease or a license other than a season ticket, of a box or seat is computed\non the amount for which a similar box or seat is sold for each performance or\nexhibition at which the box or seat is used or reserved for an event which is\nsubject to tax. Example 5: The X Coliseum has four events during a reporting quarter. The charge for a seat, similar to that held by an individual under a permanent\nuse arrangement, at each of the performances is as follows: Rodeo\n$10.00\n\nBasketball Game\n5.00\n\nMusical Comedy\n15.00\n\nBoxing Match\n30.00\n\nThe individual is required to pay a tax on the $10.00\nadmission to the rodeo and the $5.00 admission to the basketball game, whether\nor not he attends. No tax is due on the admission to the musical comedy or the\nboxing match since these events are not subject to the tax on\nadmissions. Example 6: A corporation owning a stadium gives the exclusive right to\nthe permanent use of a particular box for a year to each stockholder owning a\ncertain number of shares. Since the stockholder has exclusive use of the box\nfor the period, the tax applies to the amount for which a similar box or seat\nsold for each taxable performance or exhibition at which the box or seat is\nused or reserved by the stockholder and shall be paid by the\nstockholder. (d) Admissions excluded from tax. (1)\n\nCharges for admission to race tracks, boxing, sparring or wrestling matches, or exhibitions which are taxed under any\nother law of this State, are excluded from tax under subdivision (f) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law.

Example 2: Charge for admissions from closed circuit television\nbroadcasts of boxing matches which originate within New York State are not\nsubject to tax as such admissions are taxed by the New York State Athletic\n\nCommission. (2)\n\nCharges for\nadmission to dramatic or musical arts performances are excluded from tax. Dramatic and musical arts performances do not include variety shows, magic\nshows, circuses, animal acts, ice shows, aquatic shows and similar\nperformances. Example 3: An organization sponsors a blue grass festival in which\ncountry singers and instrumentalists will perform. The admissions are exempt\nsince they are admissions to a musical arts performance. Example 4: A theatre in the round has a show which consists\nexclusively of dance routines. The admission is exempt since choreography is\nincluded within the term musical arts. Example 5: A show is composed of several acts in which performers\ndressed as story-book characters, appearing with musical accompaniment, portray\nscenes from books, and invite audience participation. This does not qualify as\na dramatic or musical arts presentation. (3)\n\nCharges for admission to motion picture\ntheatres for the showing of films are not subject to tax.

It does not include booths or\nother devices for individual showing of films. (4)\n\nCharges to a patron to or for the use of\nsporting facilities or activities in which the patron is to be a participant\nare excluded from tax. Example 6: Admission charges for the use of bowling lanes and swimming\npools are not subject to tax.

Example 7: A ski resort's charge for lift tickets is an exempt\nadmission charge to a sporting facility in which the patron will be a\nparticipant.

Example 9: An exempt organization hires a carnival operator to operate\na series of games and rides. The operator charges admission and divides the net\nproceeds with the exempt organization.
