Subpart 373-3)\nEXAMPLES OF POTENTIALLY INCOMPATIBLE\nWASTE\nMany hazardous wastes, when mixed with other waste or\nmaterials at a hazardous waste facility, can produce effects which are harmful\nto human health and the environment, such as (1) heat or pressure, (2) fire or\nexplosion, (3) violent reaction, (4) toxic dusts, mists, fumes or gases, or (5)\nflammable fumes or gases. Below are examples of potentially incompatible wastes, waste\ncomponents, and materials, along with the harmful consequences which result\nfrom mixing materials in one group with materials in another group. The list is\nintended as a guide to owners or operators of treatment, storage and disposal\nfacilities, and to enforcement and permit-granting officials, to indicate the\nneed for special precautions when managing these potentially incompatible waste\nmaterials or components. This list is not intended to be exhaustive. An owner or\noperator must, as the regulation requires, adequately analyze his wastes so\nthat he can avoid creating uncontrolled substances or reactions of the type\nlisted below, whether they are listed below or not. It is possible for potentially incompatible wastes to be\nmixed in a way that precludes a reaction (\ne.g, adding acid to\nwater rather than water to acid) or that neutralizes them\n(\ne.g., a strong acid mixed with a strong base), or that\ncontrols substances produced (\ne.g., by generating flammable\ngases in a closed tank equipped so that ignition cannot occur, and burning the\ngases in an incinerator). In the lists below, the mixing of a Group A material with a\n\nGroup B material may have the potential consequence as noted. Group 1-A\nGroup 1-B\nAcetylene sludge\n\nAcid sludge\n\nAlkaline caustic liquids\n\nAcid and water\n\nAlkaline cleaner\n\nBattery acid\n\nAlkaline corrosive liquids\n\nChemical cleaners\n\nAlkaline corrosive battery fluid\n\nElectrolyte, acid\n\nCaustic waste water\n\nEtching acid liquid or solvent\n\nLime sludge and other corrosive alkalies\n\nPickling liquor and other corrosive acids\n\nLime waste water\n\nSpent acid\n\nLime and water\n\nSpent mixed acid\n\nSpent caustic\n\nSpent sulfuric acid\n\nPotential consequences: Heat generation; violent reaction. Group 2-A\nGroup 2-B\nAluminum\n\nAny waste in Group 1-A or 1-B\nBeryllium\n\nCalcium\n\nLithium\n\nMagnesium\n\nPotassium\n\nSodium\n\nZinc powder\n\nOther reactive metals and metal hydrides\n\nPotential consequences: Fire or explosion; generation of flammable hydrogen gas. Group 3-A\nGroup 3-B\nAlcohols\n\nAny concentrated waste in Group 1-A or 1-B\nWater\n\nCalcium\n\nLithium\n\nMetal hydrides\n\nPotassium\nSO\n2\n\nCl\n2\nSOCl\n2\nPCl\n3\nCH\n3\n\nSiCl\n3\n\nOther water reactive waste\n\nPotential consequences: Fire, explosion, or\nheat generation; generation of flammable or toxic gases. Group 4-A\nGroup 4-B\nAlcohols\n\nConcentrated Group 1-A or 1-B wastes\n\nAldehydes\n\nHalogenated hydrocarbons\n\nGroup 2-A wastes\n\nNitrated hydrocarbons\n\nUnsaturated hydrocarbons\n\nOther reactive organic components and solvents\n\nPotential consequences: Fire, explosion, or\nviolent reaction. Group 5-A\nGroup 5-B\nSpent cyanide and sulfide solutions\n\nGroup 1-B wastes\n\nPotential consequences: Generation of toxic\nhydrogen cyanide or hydrogen sulfide gas. Group 6-A\nGroup 6-B\nChlorates\n\nAcetic acid and other organic acids\n\nChlorine\n\nChlorites\n\nConcentrated mineral acids\n\nChromic acid\n\nHydrochlorites\n\nGroup 2-A wastes\n\nNitrates\n\nGroup 4-A wastes\n\nNitric acid, fuming\n\nOther flammable and combustible wastes\n\nPerchlorates\n\nPermanganates\n\nPeroxides\n\nOther strong oxidizers\n\nPotential consequences: Fire, explosion, or\nviolent reaction.
