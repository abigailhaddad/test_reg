  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 212-1.3 - Determination of Environmental Rating\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with the applicability requirements of\n\nSection\n212-1.1\nof this Part, the\ndepartment will assign an environmental rating for each air contaminant emitted\nfrom each process emission source or emission point in accordance with\n\nSubdivisions (a) through (e) of this Section. The factors in Subdivisions (a)\nthrough (d) will be considered in making a determination of the environmental\nrating to be applied to an air contaminant pursuant to subdivision (e), Table 1\n- Environmental Rating Criteria of this section. (a) Toxic and other properties and emission\nrate potential of the air contaminant; (b) location of the process emission source\nor emission point(s) for the air contaminant with respect to residences or\nother sensitive environmental receptors, taking into account the area's\nanticipated growth; (c) emission\ndispersion characteristics at or near the process emission source or emission\npoint(s), taking into account the physical location of the process emission\nsource or emission point(s) relative to the surrounding buildings and terrain; and\n(d) the projected maximum\ncumulative impact of an air contaminant taking into account emissions from all\nprocess emission sources at the facility under review and the pre-existing\nambient concentration of the air contaminant under review. (e) Table 1 - Environmental Rating Criteria\n'Rating'\n'Criteria'\nA\nAn air contaminant whose discharge results, or\nmay result, in serious adverse effects on receptors or the environment. These\neffects may be of a health, economic or aesthetic nature or any combination of\nthese. B\nAn air contaminant whose discharge results, or\nmay result in only moderate and essentially localized effects; or where the\nmultiplicity of sources of the contaminant in any given area require an overall\nreduction of the atmospheric burden of that contaminant. C\nAn air contaminant whose discharge may result\nin localized adverse effects of an aesthetic or nuisance nature. D\nAn air contaminant whose discharge will not\nresult in measurable or observable effects on receptors, nor add to an existing\nor predictable atmospheric burden of that contaminant which may cause adverse\neffects, considering properties and concentrations of the emissions, isolated\nconditions, stack height, and other factors.
