  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6000.7 - Required medical standards; potentially disqualifying conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe MPTC establishes the following medical standards\nwhich shall be used in evaluating whether a candidate can, with or without\nreasonable accommodations, perform the essential functions of the position. The\nexistence of any one of the following conditions is only to be considered\npotentially disqualifying. Each police agency must consider the medical\nstandard to ensure that it is job-related and consistent with business\nnecessity with respect to their entry-level police officer position. The\nexamining physician or practitioner must determine, based upon his/her medical\njudgment, whether the existence of such condition renders the candidate unable\nto perform the essential functions of an entry-level police officer. (a) Eyes and vision. Requires a case-by-case\nassessment of each candidate to determine if the candidate is able to perform\nthe essential functions of the position. Unless otherwise specified, all\ntesting under this subdivision must be administered by a qualified physician or\npractitioner. (1)\n\nVisual acuity. For visual\nacuity, the Snellen test is generally recognized as standard. All candidates\nshould have vision better than or equal to 20/30 in each eye. If a candidate\nmust use corrective lenses (glasses or contacts) in order to satisfy the 20/30\nvision standard, then such candidate's uncorrected vision should be no worse\nthan 20/100 in each eye. (2)\n\nColor\nperception. (i) For color perception, only\nthe 24-plate edition of the Ishihara Test (1974 or subsequent equivalent\nedition) should be used. Generally, perception of color should be deemed\nacceptable if the candidate correctly reads at least 9 or more of the first 13\nplates of the 24-plate edition of the Ishihara Test. As described in the test\nmanual, this test should be given under lighting conditions approximating a\ndaylight illuminated room (indirect daylight), and not primarily using tungsten\nor fluorescent lamps. The MacBeth Easel Lamp or the True Daylight Illuminator\n(TDI), which meets the standards specified by the International Commission on\n\nIllumination, or equivalent may be used. (ii)\n\nIf the candidate's color perception is\ndeemed unacceptable through the use of said test, and he/she believes the\nresults to be incorrect, then such individual must be informed that he/she has\nrecourse to additional testing and a facility identified where he/she may, at\nhis or her own expense, take the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test under the\nfollowing conditions: (a) The division must be\nnotified in writing, with a copy to the appropriate municipal civil service\nagency, of the candidate's intention to take the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue\n\nTest. (b) The test must be taken at\na hospital, medical center, or an academic ophthalmology center having the\nproper equipment as hereafter specified and the notice must set forth the name\nof the institution and the New York State (NYS) licensed optometrist or\nophthalmologist who will administer the examination. (c) Written approval, or under extenuating\ncircumstances, verbal approval, for the taking of said examination must be\nreceived from the division by the candidate before the test is administered and\nthe test must be administered within 45 days of the mailing date of the\napproval. Such approval shall be granted in every instance provided that the\ndivision finds that the hospital, medical center or academic ophthalmology\ncenter at which the candidate proposes to be tested has the capability and\nequipment necessary to perform such test and that the optometrist or\nophthalmologist who will administer or interpret the test is properly\nqualified. In the event that the division finds the facility at which the\napplicant proposes to be tested is not properly equipped or that the individual\nwho is proposed to administer or interpret the test is unqualified, it shall\ndirect the candidate to a person and/or facility, as conveniently located as\npracticable, by whom or where such test may be properly administered. Where\nsuch an alternate test site is directed, the 45-day period referred to above\nshall be adjusted or extended to accommodate the candidate's needs and\nconvenience. (d) If the candidate\ntakes and completes the Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test, the optometrist or\nophthalmologist administering the test shall set forth in writing the results\nof said test, including the \"total error score,\" the type, nature and degree of\nany apparent confusion axis, and, if available, the percentile rank of the\ntotal error score with reference to the normal population. The optometrist or\nophthalmologist shall certify, whether or not the candidate meets the required\ncolor perception standards. If upon receipt by the division and by the\nappropriate municipal civil service agency, the test results demonstrate that\nthe candidate meets said certification, the candidate shall be deemed to have\nmet the color perception requirement. (iii)\n\nThe test distance stipulated in the\n\nIshihara instruction manual is 75 cm (approximately 30 inches) which makes this\nprimarily a near vision task. Although no specific distance is stipulated for\nthe Farnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test, it is assumed that it would be\napproximately the same or closer distance than that used for the Ishihara Test\nsince the test boxes must be within easy reaching and viewing distance from the\ncandidate. (iv)\n\nThe qualified\nphysician, practitioner, optometrist or ophthalmologist administering the\nvision test should test at least near visual acuity immediately prior to\nadministration of the Ishihara and Farnsworth-Munsell 100- Hue tests, respectively, and the visual acuity thresholds noted and reported along with\nthe color vision test scores. The \"Rosenbaum Pocket Vision Screener\" or\nequivalent with testing administered under recommended lighting conditions and\nat approximately 14 inches from the candidate should ensure accurate\nresults. (v) If the candidate's\nnear visual acuity is within normal limits (Jaeger 2 or Snellen Equivalent of\n20/30), the color vision tests should be performed without correction\n(glasses). For example, even a mild tint in glasses could distort viewing\nconditions for the color vision tasks and invalidate the test\nresults. (vi)\n\nIf the candidate is\nfurther examined by the use of the Farnsworth Munsell 100-Hue Test, said test\nshould be administered under CIE type C (6740) illumination by using a MacBeth\n\nEasel Lamp or the True Daylight Illuminator (TDI) or equivalent. The use of\nnon- specific tungsten or fluorescent illumination is not acceptable for this\ntest. If a candidate fails the initial test, he/she should, upon request, be\nimmediately retested and the lower total error score used for the purposes of\nqualification. A total error score of not more than 124 is deemed acceptable. The use of any lens by a candidate in order to meet the color perception\nstandards is not acceptable. Note: Prior to administration of the Farnsworth-Munsell\n100-Hue Test, the optometrist or ophthalmologist may deem it advisable to\nadminister as an adjunct the Farnsworth Panel D-15 Test. This may be done to\nfamiliarize the candidate with the procedural task common to both tests, and\nsupplement interpretation of the required Test. The Farnsworth Panel D-15 Test\nmust likewise be given with the illumination specified for the\n\nFarnsworth-Munsell 100-Hue Test\n(3)\n\nDepth perception. Depth perception shall\nbe sufficient to demonstrate normal stereo depth perception to the correctable\nstandard of 80 ARC seconds\n(4)\n\nPeripheral vision\n(b) Ears and hearing. Requires a case-by-case assessment of each candidate to\ndetermine if the candidate is able to perform the essential functions of the\nposition\n(1)\n\nHearing acuity. Hearing levels\nshould be tested from 500 Hertz (Hz) to 6,000 Hz. For purposes of\nqualification, single hearing levels should not exceed 25 decibels (DB) at\neither 500, 1,000, or 2,000 Hz nor exceed 30 DB at 3,000 Hz frequencies in each\near. For abnormal testing results between 4,000 and 6,000 Hz frequencies, further refined audiological evaluation is recommended. Unless otherwise\nspecified, the hearing tests are to be administered by a qualified physician or\npractitioner in an environment and using equipment that meet the current\nstandards (ANSI 1969 or Subsequent Specifications). Any other testing system or\nconditions are not valid and may not be used\n(2)\n\nRecourse testing. If the candidate's pure\ntone screening test is deemed unacceptable, such candidate may, at his/her own\nexpense, have an audiological examination administered by a NYS licensed\naudiologist, including: (i) hearing\nsensitivity; (ii)\nspeech\ndiscrimination in quiet; and\n(iii)\nspeech discrimination in noise. Testing should be performed in a sound treated\nenvironment meeting the 1969 ANSI or any subsequent standard. The CID W-22 word\nlists should be presented at 50 DB HL via a calibrated speech audiometer\nthrough a single speaker stationed at 0 degrees azimuth with the candidate\nseated at approximately 1 meter (39 inches) from the speaker. Speech (hearing)\ndiscrimination testing in a background of broad-band noise should be conducted\nin the same sound field environment. Again, using a different version of one of\nthe CID W-22 word lists presented at 50 DB HL, a competing noise should be\nsimultaneously presented at 40 DB HL (S/N = +10) through the same speaker (0\ndegrees azimuth) as the test words or through a separate speaker located at 180\ndegrees azimuth. The minimal acceptable standard of speech (hearing)\ndiscrimination shall be a score no poorer than 90 percent in quiet and 70\npercent in noise on two of the pre-recorded versions of the CID W-22 word\nlists. An open-test response format should be utilized with the candidate\nresponding in writing. Hearing Aid Check -- Biological (HAC-B): Use of hearing\naids to achieve such standards are permitted as long as they are self-contained\nand fit within (auricular) or behind or over (post-auricular) the ear. Hearing\n\nAid Check -- Acoustical (HAC-A): Candidates with hearing aids shall, at their\nown expense, provide evidence from a licensed audiologist, using functional\ngain or real ear measurements, that such aid(s) meet the stipulated\nmanufacturer's standards\n(3)\n\nPerforated Tympanic Membrane\n(4)\n\nAcute Otitis Media, Otitis Externa, and\n\nMastoiditis\n(5)\n\nInner/middle/outer\near disorders affecting equilibrium\n\nIf the candidate has historically had episodes of\nvertigo, he/she may require further evaluation\n(c) Nose, throat and mouth.

(Note: according to the New York Heart Association, Inc., a\nfunctional classification of Class 1 refers to patients with cardiac disease, but without resulting limitations of physical activity. Ordinary physical\nactivity does not cause undue fatigue, palpitation, dyspnea or anginal pain. A\ntherapeutic classification of Class A refers to patients with cardiac disease\nwhose physical activity need not be restricted in any way.)
