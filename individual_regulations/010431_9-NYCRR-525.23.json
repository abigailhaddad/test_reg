(1)\n\nThe people's right to know the\nprocess of government decision-making and the documents and statistics leading\nto determinations is basic to our society. Access to such information should\nnot be thwarted by shrouding it with the cloak of secrecy of\nconfidentiality. (2)\n\nThese\nregulations provide information concerning the procedures by which records may\nbe obtained. (3)\n\nPersonnel shall\nfurnish to the public the information and records required by the Freedom of\n\nInformation Law, as well as records otherwise available by law. (4)\n\nAny conflicts among laws governing public\naccess to records shall be construed in favor of the widest possible\navailability of public records. (b) Designation of records access officer. (1)\n\nThe Office of Victim Services is\nresponsible for insuring compliance with the regulations herein, and designates\nthe counsel to the Office of Victim Services as records access\nofficer. (2)\n\nThe records access\nofficer is responsible for insuring appropriate agency response to public\nrequests for access to records. The designation of a records access officer\nshall not be construed to prohibit officials who have in the past been\nauthorized to make records or information available to the public from\ncontinuing to do so. The records access officer shall insure that agency\npersonnel: (i) maintain an up-to-date subject\nmatter list; (ii)\nassist persons\nseeking records to identify the records sought, if necessary, and when\nappropriate, indicate the manner in which the records are filed, retrieved or\ngenerated to assist persons in reasonably describing records; (iii)\ncontact persons seeking records when a\nrequest is voluminous or when locating the records involves substantial effort, so that personnel may ascertain the nature of records of primary interest and\nattempt to reasonably reduce the volume of records requested; (iv)\nupon locating the records, take one of\nthe following actions: (a) make records\navailable for inspection; or\n(b) deny access to the records in whole or in part and explain in writing the\nreasons therefor; (v) upon request for copies of records: (a) make\na copy available upon payment or offer to pay established fees, if any, in\naccordance with subdivision (h) of this section; or\n(b) permit the requester to copy those\nrecords; (vi)\nupon\nrequest, certify that a record is a true copy; and\n(vii)\nupon failure to locate records, certify\nthat: (a) the Office of Victim Services is not\nthe custodian for such records; or\n(b) the records of which the Office of Victim\n\nServices is a custodian cannot be found after diligent search. (c) Location. Records shall be available for public inspection and copying at: New York State\n\nOffice of Victim Services, Alfred E. Smith State Office Building, 80 South Swan\n\nStreet, 2nd Floor, Albany, NY 12210-8002. (d) Hours for public inspection. Requests for\npublic access to records shall be accepted and records produced during all\nhours regularly open for business. These hours are Monday through Friday, 9:00\na.m. to 5:00 p.m. (e) Requests for\npublic access to records. (1)\nA written\nrequest may be required, but oral requests may be accepted when records are\nreadily available. (2)\n\nIf records\nare maintained on the internet, the requester shall be informed that the\nrecords are accessible via the internet and in printed form either on paper or\nother information storage medium. (3)\nA response shall be given within five\nbusiness days of receipt of a request by: (i) informing a person requesting records that the request or portion of the\nrequest does not reasonably describe the records sought, including direction, to the extent possible, that would enable that person to request records\nreasonably described; (ii)\ngranting\nor denying access to records in whole or in part; (iii)\nacknowledging the receipt of a request\nin writing, including an approximate date when the request will be granted or\ndenied in whole or in part, which shall be reasonable under the circumstances\nof the request and shall not be more than 20 business days after the date of\nthe acknowledgment, or if it is known that circumstances prevent disclosure\nwithin 20 business days from the date of such acknowledgment, providing a\nstatement in writing indicating the reason for inability to grant the request\nwithin that time and a date certain, within a reasonable period under the\ncircumstances of the request, when the request will be granted in whole or in\npart; or\n(iv)\nif the receipt of\nrequest was acknowledged in writing and included an approximate date when the\nrequest would be granted in whole or in part within 20 business days of such\nacknowledgment, but circumstances prevent disclosure within that time, providing a statement in writing within 20 business days of such acknowledgment\nspecifying the reason for the inability to do so and a date certain, within a\nreasonable period under the circumstances of the request, when the request will\nbe granted in whole or in part. (4)\n\nIn determining a reasonable time for\ngranting or denying a request under the circumstances of a request, personnel\nshall consider the volume of a request, the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating records, the complexity of the request, the need to\nreview records to determine the extent to which they must be disclosed, the\nnumber of requests received by the agency, and similar factors that bear on the\nability to grant access to records promptly and within a reasonable\ntime. (5)\nA failure to comply with\nthe time limitations described herein shall constitute a denial of a request\nthat may be appealed. Such failure shall include situations in which an officer\nor employee: (i) fails to grant access to the\nrecords sought, deny access in writing or acknowledge the receipt of a request\nwithin five business days of the receipt of a request; (ii)\nacknowledges the receipt of a request\nwithin five business days but fails to furnish an approximate date when the\nrequest will be granted or denied in whole or in part; (iii)\nfurnishes an acknowledgment of the\nreceipt of a request within five business days with an approximate date for\ngranting or denying access in whole or in part that is unreasonable under the\ncircumstances of the request; (iv)\nfails to respond to a request within a reasonable time after the approximate\ndate given or within 20 business days after the date of the acknowledgment of\nthe receipt of a request; (v) determines to grant a request in whole or in part within 20 business days of\nthe acknowledgment of the receipt of a request, but fails to do so, unless the\nagency provides the reason for its inability to do so in writing and a date\ncertain within which the request will be granted in whole or in part; (vi)\ndoes not grant a request in whole or in\npart within 20 business days of the acknowledgment of the receipt of a request\nand fails to provide the reason in writing explaining the inability to do so\nand a date certain by which the request will be granted in whole or in part; or\n(vii)\nresponds to a request, stating that more than 20 business days is needed to grant or deny the request\nin whole or in part and provides a date certain within which that will be\naccomplished, but such date is unreasonable under the circumstances of the\nrequest. (f) Subject matter list. (1)\n\nThe records access\nofficer shall maintain a reasonably detailed current list by subject matter of\nall records in its possession, whether or not records are available pursuant to\nsubdivision 2 of section\n87\nof the Public Officers Law.

(6)\nA failure to determine an appeal within\n10 business days of its receipt by granting access to the records sought or\nfully explaining the reasons for further denial in writing shall constitute a\ndenial of the appeal.
