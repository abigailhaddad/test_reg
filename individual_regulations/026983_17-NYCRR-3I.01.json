  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 3I.01 - General\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 01A While islands frequently serve more than one purpose, they are generally classified according to their main function as pedestrian\nrefuge islands, traffic divisional islands, or traffic channelizing\nislands. 01B Pedestrian refuge islands: Refuge islands provide areas for pedestrians where it is\ndifficult to cross the entire roadway at one time. Refuge islands are particularly useful in urban areas where\nthere is a significant volume of pedestrian traffic and heavy vehicular traffic\nvolumes make it difficult for pedestrians to cross, such as on multi-lane\nroadways, in large or irregularly shaped intersections, and at signalized\nintersections. A continuous median between intersections is appropriate\nwhen refuge islands are required at each intersection along a highway. Passenger loading islands are a special class of refuge\nislands that provide pedestrian refuge while loading and unloading passengers\nfrom transit vehicles. 01C Divisional islands: Divisional islands are used to separate traffic. They are\nused between opposing traffic streams (for example, the median of a divided\nhighway) or between traffic lanes in the same direction (for example, to\nseparate a left-turn lane from the adjacent through traffic lane). Divisional\nislands are also used to guide traffic past an obstruction in the roadway, to\nseparate opposing traffic in advance of an intersection, or to prevent passing\nand/or lane encroachment at certain locations such as sharp curves or narrow\nunderpasses. Medians are continuous divisional islands. They provide a\nbuffer area between opposing streams of traffic, protection and control of\ncrossing and turning traffic, and refuge for pedestrians. 01D Channelizing islands: The primary function of a channelizing island is to control\nand guide a motorist into the proper lane for the intended movement. Channelizing islands are also used in broad expanses of pavement to promote an\norderly flow of traffic. Channelization is particularly helpful at highways\nintersecting at oblique angles, at three-leg junctions, and at multi-leg\nintersections. Channelizing islands are used for separation and special\ncontrol of turning movements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n3I.01\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
