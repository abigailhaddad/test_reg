  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1626-1.6 - Maintenance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Maintenance of\nbuildings on site and offsite property will be kept at a minimum consistent\nwith the safety of the occupants. Buildings declared unsafe by local building\ndepartment will be vacated immediately with the authority's counsel initiating\nany necessary legal action. No major repairs will be made to any site or\noffsite building unless approved by the division. (b) Determination should be made as to\nwhether fixtures and equipment (plumbing and heating items, refrigerators, ranges, etc.) can be properly safeguarded if left in apartments or whether they\nshould be removed immediately from each apartment as it becomes vacant and\nplaced in a central storage room. If it is determined to let such equipment\nremain in apartments, demolition contract will specify that such items will be\nremoved by contractor. If equipment is removed from individual apartments and\ncentrally stored, they will be accumulated in sufficient quantity and then sold\non basis of best bid received. Bids will be solicited from used equipment\ndealers and salvage yards. Vacated apartments should be checked as soon as\npossible to insure that authority owned fixtures and equipment were not taken\nby the vacated tenant. Vacated buildings are to be boarded up and the police\ndepartment notified so that they can take steps to prevent damage by vandals or\nentry by vagrants. An authority employee should also check such buildings at\nleast once a week. (c) Preparation\nfor demolition, including award of contract, should be made in advance so that\ndemolition can start as early as possible after buildings are vacated. If\nsituation warrants, contract may call for demolition of buildings on an\nindividual basis as they become vacant. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1626-1.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
