Prizes for a variation of the LOTTO game shall be\ncalculated as follows: (1)\n\nThe first prize\nwill be a prize of up to an amount designated by the commission, which will be\npaid as a lump sum. A first prize will be awarded to game panels matching six\nof six winning numbers for a particular drawing. The commission may limit the\nnumber of top first prizes for a particular drawing to no more than a\ndesignated number. If the limited number of top first prizes designated by the\ncommission exceeded for a particular drawing, the winning first-prize game\npanels will share equally in a maximum first-prize pool equal to the product of\nthe top first-prize amount multiplied by the limited number of top first prizes\ndesignated by the commission. At the commission's discretion, the commission\nmay change the top first-prize amount and any such change will be publicly\nannounced in advance of the effective date. (2)\n\nPrizes paid to the second- through\nfourth-prize levels shall be fixed prizes as prescribed by the commission. There shall be a limit imposed on the second- through fourth-prize levels equal\nto a fixed percentage of the gross ticket sales receipts for that particular\ndrawing. In the event that the limit would be exceeded for a particular draw, the second- through fourth-prize levels shall be calculated on a pari-mutuel\nbasis in accordance with a formula established by the commission.
