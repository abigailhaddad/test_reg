Replacement cards shall not be drawn until needed and\nshall be drawn in accordance with the rules of the game, to allow for\nmulti-deck and depleting decks. (b) Cards removed from the deck shall not be returned to the deck except as\nprovided by the rules of the game depicted. (c) As cards are removed from the deck, such\ncards shall be used immediately as directed by the rules of the game (i.e., the\ncards are not to be discarded due to adaptive behavior by the gaming\ndevice). (d) It is acceptable to\ndraw random numbers for replacement cards at the time of the first-hand random\nnumber draw, so long as the replacement cards are used sequentially as\nneeded. Notes\nN.Y.
