(2)\n\nAn adjustment or recovery under\nsubparagraph (1)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision may be made from a person's\nestate only after the death of the person's surviving spouse, and only when the\nperson has no surviving child who is under 21 years of age or who is certified\nblind or certified disabled.
