Tit. 3 § 36.2 - Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A bank or trust\ncompany may invest in the shares of any single fund without express limit, subject to the limitations contained in subdivision(b) of this\nsection. (b) Banks or trust\ncompanies which invest in funds which contain assets subject to investment\nlimits must review the fund portfolios on a periodic basis in order to\nascertain whether the combined investment of the bank or trust company in the\nobligations of a single issuer (taking into account the bank or trust company's\nproportionate holding of fund shares together with any other investment) would\ncomply with the limitations contained in sections 97(4- b), 103 and 106 of the\n\nBanking Law, if said sections were to be applied to such investments, and must\nreduce excessive holdings within a reasonable period of time to conform to such\nlimitations. (c) It is also\nexpected that a bank or trust company investing in funds shall periodically\nmonitor the portfolios of such funds to determine the appropriateness of the\nfunds' investments for the portfolio of the bank or trust company.
