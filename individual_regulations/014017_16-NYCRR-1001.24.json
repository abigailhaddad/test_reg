  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.24 - Exhibit 24: visual impacts\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 24 shall contain: (a) A visual impact assessment (VIA) to\ndetermine the extent and assess the significance of facility visibility. The\ncomponents of the VIA shall include identification of visually sensitive\nresources, viewshed mapping, confirmatory visual assessment fieldwork, visual\nsimulations (photographic overlays), cumulative visual impact analysis, and\nproposed visual impact mitigation. The VIA shall address the following issues: (1)\nthe character and visual quality of the\nexisting landscape; (2)\nvisibility\nof the facility, including visibility of facility operational characteristics, such as visible plumes from the exhaust stacks; (3)\nvisibility of all above-ground\ninterconnections and roadways to be constructed within the facility study area\nas determined by the viewshed analysis; (4)\nappearance of the facility upon\ncompletion, including building/structure size, architectural design, facade\ncolors and texture, and site lighting; (5)\nlighting (including lumens, location and\ndirection of lights for facility area and/or task use, and safety including\nworker safety and tall structure marking requirements) and similar\nfeatures; (6)\nrepresentative views\n(photographic overlays) of the facility, including front, side and rear views, indicating approximate elevations; (7)\nnature and degree of visual change\nresulting from construction of the facility and above-ground\ninterconnections; (8)\nnature and\ndegree of visual change resulting from operation of the facility; (9)\nanalysis and description of related\noperational effects of the facility such as visible plumes, shading, glare, and\nshadow flicker; (10)\nproposed\nmitigation and mitigation alternatives based on an assessment of mitigation\nstrategies, including screening (landscaping), architectural design, visual\noffsets, relocation or rearranging facility components, reduction of facility\ncomponent profiles, alternative technologies, facility color and design, lighting options for work areas and safety requirements, and lighting options\nfor stack lighting if required by the Federal Aviation Administration; and\n(11)\na description of all\nvisual resources that would be affected by the facility. (b) The viewshed analysis component of the\nVIA shall be conducted as follows: (1)\n\nViewshed maps depicting areas of project visibility within the facility study\narea shall be prepared and presented on a 1:24,000 scale recent edition\ntopographic base map. A line of sight profile shall also be done for resources\nof statewide concern located within the VIA study area. The viewshed maps shall\nprovide an indication of areas of potential visibility based on topography and\nvegetation and the highest elevation of facility structures. The potential\nscreening effects of vegetation shall also be shown. The map(s) shall be\ndivided into foreground, midground and background areas based on visibility\ndistinction and distance zone criteria. Visually-sensitive sites, cultural and\nhistorical resources, representative viewpoints, photograph locations, and\npublic vantage points within the viewshed study area shall be included on the\nmap(s) or an overlay. An overlay indicating landscape similarity zones shall be\nincluded. (2)\n\nThe VIA shall include\na detailed description of the methodology used to develop the viewshed maps, including software, baseline information, and sources of data. (3)\n\nThe viewshed mapping shall be used to\ndetermine the sensitive viewing areas and locations of viewer groups in the\nfacility vicinity. These shall include recreational areas, residences, businesses, historic sites (listed or eligible for listing on the State or\n\nNational Register of Historic Places), and travelers (interstate and other\nhighway users). (4)\n\nThe applicant\nshall confer with municipal planning representatives, DPS, DEC, OPRHP, and\nwhere appropriate, APA in its selection of important or representative\nviewpoints. Viewpoint selection is based upon the following criteria: (i) representative or typical views from\nunobstructed or direct line- of-sight views; (ii)\nsignificance of viewpoints, designated\nscenic resources, areas or features (which features typically include, but are\nnot limited to: landmark landscapes; wild, scenic or recreational rivers\nadministered respectively by either the DEC or the APA pursuant to ECL article\n15 or Department of Interior pursuant to\n16 USC section\n1271; forest preserve lands, scenic vistas\nspecifically identified in the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan, conservation easement lands, scenic byways designated by the Federal or State\ngovernments; scenic districts and scenic roads, designated by the Commissioner\nof Environmental Conservation pursuant to ECL Article 49 scenic districts; scenic areas of statewide significance; State parks or historic sites; sites\nlisted on National or State Registers of Historic Places; areas covered by\nscenic easements, public parks or recreation areas; locally designated historic\nor scenic districts and scenic overlooks; and high-use public areas; (iii)\nlevel of viewer exposure, i.e., frequency of viewers or relative numbers, including residential areas, or high\nvolume roadways; (iv)\nproposed land\nuses; (v) input from local public\nsources; and\n(vi)\nbuilding/structure data collected for each potentially eligible property\nprepared in a format acceptable to OPRHP and DPS and submitted to OPRHP and DPS\nfor review prior to completing the viewpoint selection. (5)\n\nPhotographic simulations of the facility\nand interconnections shall be prepared from the representative viewpoints to\ndemonstrate the post-construction appearance of the facility. Where vegetation\nscreening is relied on for project mitigation, leaf-off and leaf-on simulation\nshall be provided. Representative viewpoints shall be established in\nconsultation with DEC, DPS, OPRHP, and APA where appropriate. (6)\n\nAdditional revised simulations\nillustrating mitigation shall be prepared for those observation points for\nwhich mitigation is proposed in the application. (7)\n\nEach set of existing and simulated views\nof the facility shall be compared and rated and the results of the visual\nimpact assessment shall be summarized. Documentation of the steps followed in\nthe rating and assessment methodology shall be provided including results of\nrating impact panels and a description of the qualifications of the individuals\nserving on the panels. Where visual impacts from the proposed facility are\nidentified, potential mitigation measures shall be outlined, and the extent to\nwhich they effectively minimize such impact shall be discussed. (8)\n\nAs applicable to the proposed facility\ntechnology, the analysis shall include analyses of overall appearance and\noperational characteristics of the facility and related facilities, including\nstack and cooling tower plume visibility, shading, glare, shadow flicker, or\nrelated visible effects of facility operation, including an assessment of the\npredicted extent, frequency, and duration of any such visible effects created\nby the facility.
