  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.132 - Fixed assets\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Assets of a\nrelatively permanent nature held for continuous use in hospital operations and\nnot intended to be converted into cash through sales. (b) A balance sheet classification denoting\ncapital assets other than intangibles and investments in affiliated companies\nor other long-term investments. (c) Included in the usual fixed-asset categories are land (from which the flow of\nservices is seemingly permanent), land improvements, buildings, fixed\nequipment, tools, leasehold improvements, major movable and minor movable\nequipment; generally excluded are goodwill, patents, and other intangibles. The\ncharacteristic fixed asset has a limited life (land is the one important\nexception), and, in organizations where expenses are accounted for, its cost, less estimated salvage at the end of its useful life, is distributed over the\nperiods it benefits by means of provisions for depreciation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.132\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
