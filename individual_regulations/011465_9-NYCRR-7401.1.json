  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7401.1 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe law requires that juvenile offenders held criminally\nresponsible be committed to the custody of the commissioner of the Office and\n\nChildren and Family Services and be confined in a secure facility maintained in\naccordance with Executive Law, section 508. S ecure facilities are considered\ncorrectional facilities for purposes of the commission's oversight only. It is\nacknowledged that secure facilities differ from adult correctional facilities\nin several significant respects. These regulations provide a framework for the\noversight of the secure facilities and set forth a minimum standard of care to\nensure the health, safety and well-being of the youth in confinement in\ncompliance with constitutional requirements. It is further acknowledged that\nthe Office of Children and Family Services may, in the exercise of its\nstatutory authority pursuant to Executive Law, section 508, mandate adherence\nto good child care practices based on evidence based models in the operation of\nits secure facilities and provide strength based interventions and services to\njuvenile offenders confined therein. This regulatory framework will guide the\ncommission's oversight within the context of a secure juvenile justice setting\nthat recognizes the unique needs of young people who are still developing\nmentally, emotionally, and physically, and as such, have great potential for\npositively transforming their lives with proper rehabilitative support in a\nsafe and secure environment.
