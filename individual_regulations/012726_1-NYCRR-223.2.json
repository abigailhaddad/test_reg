  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 223.2 - Cherry measurement tanks\n\nState Regulations\n\nTanks used in the volumetric measurement of cherries shall be\nas follows: (a) A cherry measurement\ntank shall be designed to be in a normal operating position when it is in\nlevel. (b) A tank shall be of the\ncenter reading type, that is, it shall be so designed that a gauge rod, when\nproperly positioned for use, will be approximately in the vertical axis of the\ntank centrally positioned with respect to the tank walls. (c) A tank shall be rectangular or square in\ndesign but its length shall not exceed its width by more than one\nthird. (d) The cross sectional area\nof a tank shall be constant at any level and the tank shall be so constructed\nthat under any condition of lading it will not be distorted sufficiently to\ncause a change in the capacity at any level equal to more than 16 cubic inches. This requirement prescribes a limit on permissible distortion only, and is not\nto be construed as an additional tolerance to subdivision (h) hereof. (e) A tank shall be of such material, design\nand construction that under normal handling it will maintain its rectangular or\nsquare design and required accuracy for a reasonable length of time. (f) A tank shall be conspicuously and\npermanently marked to indicate the cubic capacity of the tank per inch depth\nthroughout its measurement range. (g) A tank manufactured and offered for sale\nafter the effective date of this section shall be marked with a model number, serial number and the name and address of the manufacturer. (h) The maintenance and acceptance tolerance\non a tank with a capacity of 30 cubic feet or less shall be 150 cubic inches in\nexcess or deficiency, that is, the cubical content at any point in the tank\nwithin the measurement range shall not differ more than 150 cubic inches from a\ncalculated volume determined by multiplying the depth of the tank from that\npoint by the indicated cubical capacity of the tank per inch depth, except as\nprovided for in subdivision (i) hereof. (i) The maintenance tolerance for a tank now\nin use for the determination of volume measurement shall be one percent excess\nor deficiency within the measurement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n223.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
