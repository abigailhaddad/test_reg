In\naddition, public notice by means of radio is required for public comment\nhearings or issues conferences on all HWMF permits or RAP applications. These\nrequirements are minimums and the ALJ will direct the applicant to provide\nadditional notice or to provide the notice further in advance of the public\ncomment hearing or issues conference where the ALJ finds it necessary to do so\nin order to adequately inform the potentially affected public about the public\ncomment hearing or issues conference.
