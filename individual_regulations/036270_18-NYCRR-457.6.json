  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 457.6 - Serving involuntary clients\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. When the district believes that\nthere is a serious threat to an adult's well being and that the adult is\nincapable of making decisions on his or her own behalf because of mental\nimpairments, the social services official has a responsibility to pursue\nappropriate legal intervention in accordance with the provisions of sections\n473\nand\n473-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, articles 9, 15 and 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law, article 8 of the Family Court Act and article 17-A of the Surrogate's Court\n\nProcedure Act, even though such intervention may be against the wishes of or\nwithout the knowledge of the adult at risk. The districts must employ the least\nrestrictive intervention necessary to effectively protect the adult. The\nimmediacy and seriousness of the threat to the individual will determine\nwhether crisis intervention procedures and/or other legal procedures are\nwarranted as set forth in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. (b) Crisis intervention. For an adult who\nexhibits such a degree of self-destructive behavior or who is living in such a\nhazardous situation that there is substantial risk of harm to himself, herself\nor others and such adult is incapable of making decisions on his or her own\nbehalf because of mental impairments, the social services official has a\nresponsibility to initiate appropriate action even though it may be without the\nadult's consent or knowledge. Such actions of intervention will usually include\nenlisting the services of other agencies and professionals. The district shall\nutilize the appropriate intervention or procedures as follows: (1)\nenlist immediate help of a peace officer\nto take an adult into custody pursuant to section\n9.41\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law or for other appropriate assistance; (2)\nrequest the local director of community\nservices to apply for admission of an adult to a hospital or to direct the\nremoval of an adult to a hospital pursuant to sections\n9.37\nand\n9.45\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law or to take other appropriate action; (3)\ninitiate application for admission to a\nmental hygiene facility on certification of two examining physicians pursuant\nto sections\n9.27\nand\n15.27\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law; (4)\nenlist\nhelp from public health officials and call an ambulance or other emergency\nmedical care provider in acute situations; (5)\ntake the necessary action for the\ninitiation by a social services official of a petition to obtain an order\nauthorizing the provision of short-term involuntary protective services\npursuant to section\n457.10\nof this Part; and/or\n(6)\ntake the necessary\naction to initiate proceedings for an order of protection against an abusive\nhousehold or family member pursuant to sections\n119, 822\nand\n842\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act. (c) Other legal procedures. There are other procedures established in the Mental\n\nHygiene Law and the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act to be utilized in\nnon-crisis situations in order to provide long range planning or protection to\ncertain PSA clients. These procedures require more time to implement than\nafforded in emergency or crisis situations. In appropriate situations the\ndistrict must: (1)\ninitiate efforts to\narrange for the appointment of a guardian in accordance with the provisions of\narticle 81 of the Mental Hygiene Law; (2)\nserve in the capacity of guardian in\nthose situations in which a PSA client is in need of a guardian and no one else\nis willing and able to serve responsibly; or\n(3)\ninitiate efforts to arrange for the\nappointment of a guardian for the mentally retarded in accordance with article\n17-A of the Surrogate's Court Procedure Act. (d) Local social services districts must\ndevelop and implement procedures for the provision of services to involuntary\nclients. Such procedures must include provisions for: (1)\ntraining PSA and legal staff in the\nappropriate utilization of the various interventions which may be employed on\nbehalf of involuntary PSA clients, as described in this section and in\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of subdivision (c) of section\n457.5\nof this Part; (2)\ncontinuing community education and\nnetworking activities in accordance with section\n457.7\nof this Part, including\nmeetings with representative community agencies for the purpose of establishing\nspecific agency roles and areas of responsibility in the provision of services\nto involuntary clients; (3)\nobtaining mental health evaluations on behalf of PSA clients when involuntary\ninterventions are being considered; (4)\nassuring the availability of the agency's\nlegal staff for timely consultation with PSA staff when requested and the\ntimely implementation of legal interventions on behalf of involuntary clients\nin appropriate situations; and\n(5)\nassuring that any significant disagreements between PSA and legal staff\nregarding the need for legal intervention on behalf of an involuntary PSA\nclient are promptly referred to the local social services commissioner or his\nor her designee for resolution.
