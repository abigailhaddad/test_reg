(5)\n\nFor a homemade\nboat, acceptable evidence of ownership shall consist of supporting\ndocumentation with respect to acquisition of parts and proof of the assignment\nand the affixing of a hull identification number provided by the Office of\n\nParks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. (6)\n\nDocumented boats. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing requirements of this subdivision, if the evidence of ownership\nsubmitted with an application for registration (and title, if appropriate)\nconsists in whole or in part of documentation issued by the United States Coast\n\nGuard or similar agency of any foreign government, such document shall be\nacceptable as evidence of ownership. However, the provisions of paragraph (8)\nor (9) of this subdivision, whichever may be appropriate, with respect to proof\nof transfer of ownership shall also apply. (7)\n\nManufacturer's statement or certificate\nof origin. A manufacturer's statement or certificate of origin must be issued\nby the manufacturer of the boat or by a duly designated agent of such\nmanufacturer and must contain at least the following: identification as a\ncertificate or statement of origin for a boat, the name and address of the\nmanufacturer, the date of the statement or certificate, an identifying number, the hull identification number of the boat, the year, make, model and length of\nthe boat, the name and address of the distributor or dealer to whom the boat\nhas been transferred, a statement that such transfer is the first transfer of a\nnew boat in ordinary trade and commerce, the signature of an authorized\nrepresentative of the manufacturer and on the reverse must contain appropriate\nlanguage for at least two distributor-dealer assignments including lien\ninformation.

In such\ncases, the sales tax will be collected and evidence thereof will be given by\nthe district office of the department or the county clerk acting as agent of\nthe commissioner for the issuance of boat registrations.

The\ntransferor need not notify the commissioner of such transfer. (f) Exemption for documented\nboats.
