  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 54.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The operation\nof motorcycles has been found to result in a high incidence of disabling\npersonal injuries. The effects of such injuries extend beyond the person\ninjured to the family of the person injured and to the people of this State. Any disabling personal injury may have an economic impact on the public by\nrequiring the furnishing of medical, rehabilitative or welfare aid or\nassistance. Therefore, the prevention or mitigation of injuries resulting from\nthe more common types of motorcycle accidents by the use of protective helmets, goggles, face shields or wind screens is deemed to be a legitimate concern of\nthis State. (b) Chapter 979 of the\n\nLaws of 1966 provides that the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles shall establish\nspecifications with respect to protective helmets, goggles, face shields and\nwind screens for motorcycles, and that on and after January 1, 1967, no\nprotective helmet, goggles, or face shield may be sold, offered for sale or\ndistributed for use on a motorcycle, unless such device is approved by the\n\nCommissioner of Motor Vehicles in accordance with the regulations established\nherein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n54.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
