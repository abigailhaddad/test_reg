  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-3.3 - Subtraction modifications for community banks and thrifts\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(9)(r), (s) and (t))\n(a) Captive REIT modification. (1)\nA corporation that is a small thrift\ninstitution or qualified community bank, both as defined in section 208(9)(s), that maintained a captive REIT on April 1, 2014, must utilize the REIT\nsubtraction provided for in this subdivision in any taxable year it maintained\nsuch captive REIT on the last day of the tax year. Such corporation maintained\na captive REIT if it owned, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the voting\nstock of such captive REIT on the required date. The REIT subtraction is equal\nto 160% of the dividends paid deductions allowed to that captive REIT for the\ntaxable year for Federal income tax purposes. (2)\n\nWhen computing the combined business\nincome base, there is no elimination of intercompany dividends received from\nthe combined captive REIT by any member of the combined group in any taxable\nyear in which the subtraction modification described in this subdivision is\nutilized. (3)\nA combined group that\nincludes a small thrift institution or qualified community bank is not allowed\nto utilize the subtraction modification for qualified residential loan\nportfolios described in subdivision (b) of this section or the subtraction\nmodification for qualified community banks and small thrifts described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section in any taxable year in which such thrift\ninstitution or community bank owns the captive REIT referred to in paragraph\n(1) on the last day of the taxable year. (b) Subtraction modification for qualified\nresidential loan portfolios. (1)\nA\ncorporation that is a thrift institution, as defined in section 208(9)(r)(3), or a qualified community bank, as defined in section 208(9)(s)(2), that\nmaintains a qualified residential loan portfolio as defined in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision is allowed as a deduction in computing ENI the amount, if any, by which: (i) 32% of its ENI determined\nwithout regard to this subtraction modification exceeds; (ii)\nthe amounts deducted by the taxpayer\npursuant to IRC sections 166 and 585 less any amounts included in Federal\ntaxable income because of a recovery of a loan. (2)\n\nQualified residential loan portfolio. A\ncorporation maintains a qualified residential loan portfolio if at least 60% of\nthe amount of the total assets at the close of the taxable year of the thrift\ninstitution or qualified community bank consists of the assets described in\nclauses\n(a) through\n(l) of subparagraph (i)\nof this paragraph, with the application of the rule in clause\n(m) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. At the election of\nthe corporation, such percentage shall be applied based on the average assets\noutstanding during the taxable year, in lieu of the close of the taxable year. The corporation can elect to compute an average using the assets measured on\nthe first day of the taxable year and on the last day of each subsequent\nquarter, or month or day during the taxable year. This election may be made\nannually. (i) Assets: (a) cash, which includes cash and cash\nequivalents, including cash items in the process of collection, deposit with\nother financial institutions, including corporate credit unions, balances with\n\nFederal reserve banks and Federal home loan banks, Federal funds sold, and cash\nand cash equivalents on hand. Cash shall not include any balances serving as\ncollateral for securities lending transactions; (b) obligations of the United States or of a\nstate or political subdivision thereof, and stock or obligations of a\ncorporation that is an instrumentality or a government sponsored enterprise of\nthe United States or of a state or political subdivision thereof; (c) loans secured by a deposit or share of a\nmember; (d) loans secured by an\ninterest in real property that is (or from the proceeds of the loan, will\nbecome) residential real property or real property used primarily for church\npurposes, loans made for the improvement of residential real property or real\nproperty used primarily for church purposes, or loans secured by stock in a\ncooperative housing cooperation that entitles the stockholders to occupy for\ndwelling purposes a specified unit in the building owned by the cooperative\nhousing corporation pursuant to a proprietary lease of that unit. For purposes\nof this clause, residential real property includes single or multi-family\ndwellings, facilities in residential developments dedicated to public use or\nproperty used on a nonprofit basis for residents, and mobile homes not used on\na transient basis; (e) property\nacquired through the liquidation of defaulted loans described in clause\n(d) of this subparagraph; (f) any regular or residual interest in a\nREMIC, as defined in IRC section 860D, but only in the proportion that the\nassets of such REMIC consist of property described in clauses\n(a) through\n(e) of this paragraph, except\nthat if 95% or more of the assets of such REMIC are assets described in clauses\n(a) through\n(e) of this subparagraph, the\nentire interest in the REMIC will qualify; (g) any mortgage-backed security that\nrepresents ownership of a fractional undivided interest in a trust, the assets\nof which consist primarily of mortgage loans, if the real property that serves\nas security for the loans is (or from the proceeds of the loan, will become)\nthe type of property described in clause\n(d) of this\nsubparagraph and any collateralized mortgage obligation, the security for which\nconsists primarily of mortgage loans that maintain as security the type of\nproperty described in clause\n(d) of this\nsubparagraph; (h) certificates of\ndeposit in, or obligations of, a corporation organized under a state law that\nspecifically authorizes such corporation to insure the deposits or share\naccounts of member associations; (i) loans secured by an interest in\neducational, health, or welfare institutions or facilities, including\nstructures designed or used primarily for residential purposes for students, residents, and persons under care, employees, or members of the staff of such\ninstitutions or facilities; (j) loans made for the payment of expenses of college or university education or\nvocational training; (k) property\nused by the taxpayer in support of business that consists principally of\nacquiring the savings of the public and investing in loans; and\n(l) loans for which the taxpayer is the\ncreditor and that are wholly secured by loans described in clause\n(d) of this subparagraph. (m) The value of accrued interest receivable\nand any loss-sharing commitment or another loan guaranty by a governmental\nagency will be considered part of the basis in the loans to which the accrued\ninterest or loss protection applies. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of clause\n(d) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph: (a) if a multifamily structure securing a\nloan is used in part for nonresidential use purposes, the entire loan is deemed\na residential real property loan if the planned residential use exceeds 80% of\nthe property's planned use (measured, at the taxpayer's election, by using\nsquare footage or gross rental revenue, and determined as of the time the loan\nis made), and\n(b) loans made to\nfinance the acquisition or development of land shall be deemed to be loans\nsecured by an interest in residential real property if there is a reasonable\nassurance that the property will become residential real property within a\nperiod of three years from the date of acquisition of such land; but this\nclause shall not apply for any taxable year unless, within such three-year\nperiod, such land becomes residential real property. For purposes of\ndetermining whether any interest in a REMIC qualifies under clause\n(f) of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, any regular\ninterest in another REMIC held by such REMIC shall be treated as a loan\ndescribed in a preceding item under principles like the principle of such\nclause\n(f), except that if such REMICs are part of a tiered\nstructure, they shall be treated as one REMIC for purposes of such clause\n(f). (3)\n\nCombined groups. (i) In the case of a combined report, the\ndeduction provided for in this subdivision will be computed on a combined\nbasis. For purposes of calculating this subtraction, the ENI of the combined\nreporting group shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\nthe average total assets of all the thrift institutions and qualified community\nbanks included in the combined report and the denominator of which is the\naverage total assets of all the corporations included in the combined\nreport. (ii)\n\nThe determination of\nwhether the combined group maintains a qualified residential loan portfolio\nwill be made by aggregating the assets of the thrift institutions and qualified\ncommunity banks that are members of the combined group. (4)\nA taxpayer or, in the case of a combined\ngroup, a combined group claiming the subtraction modification described in this\nsubdivision is not allowed to utilize the captive REIT subtraction modification\ndescribed in subdivision (a) of this section or the subtraction modification\nfor community banks and small thrifts described in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (c) Subtraction\nmodification for community banks and small thrifts. (1)\nA corporation that is a qualified\ncommunity bank or a small thrift institution, both as defined in section\n208(9)(s), is allowed a deduction in computing ENI equal to the amount computed\nas follows: (i) Multiply the corporation's\nnet interest income from loans during the taxable year by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the gross interest income during the taxable year from\nqualifying loans and the denominator of which is the gross interest income\nduring the taxable year from all loans. (ii)\n\nMultiply the amount determined in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph by 50%. This product is the amount of the\ndeduction allowed under this paragraph. (2)\n\nNet interest income from loans means\ngross interest income from loans less gross interest expense from loans, provided the result cannot be less than zero. Gross interest expense from loans\nis determined by multiplying gross interest expense by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the average total value of loans owned by the thrift\ninstitution or community bank during the taxable year and the denominator of\nwhich is the average total assets of the thrift institution or community bank\nduring the taxable year. (3)\nA\nqualifying loan is a loan that meets the conditions specified in subparagraphs\n(i) and (ii) of this paragraph. A loan that meets the definition of a\nqualifying loan in a prior taxable year (including years prior to 2015) remains\na qualifying loan in taxable years during and after which such loan is acquired\nby another member of the same combined group. (i) The loan is originated by the qualified\ncommunity bank or small thrift institution or is purchased by the qualified\ncommunity bank or small thrift institution immediately after its origination in\nconnection with a commitment to purchase made by the bank or thrift institution\nprior to the loan's origination. (ii)\n\nThe loan is a small business loan or a\nresidential mortgage loan, the principal amount of which loan is $5 million or\nless, and either the borrower is located in this state and the loan is not\nsecured by real property, or the loan is secured by real property located in\n\nNew York. A loan is secured by real property located in New York if, at the\ntime the real property loan is originated, more than 50% of the fair market\nvalue (FMV) of property used to secure the loan is located in New York. (a) For purposes of this paragraph, a small\nbusiness loan means a loan made to an active business that, in its immediately\npreceding taxable year, had an average number, determined on a quarterly basis, of full-time employees of 100 or fewer, not including general executive\nofficers, and total gross receipts of not greater than $10 million. A business\nqualifies as an active business if the average value, determined on a quarterly\nbasis, of its loans, Federal, state and municipal debt, asset backed securities\nand other government agency debt, corporate bonds, reverse repurchase\nagreements and securities borrowing agreements, Federal funds, stocks and\npartnership interests, physical commodities and other financial instruments\nthat it owns does not exceed 50% of the average value of its total assets. In\nthe event that the active business applies for the loan in its first year of\noperations, satisfaction of the requirements in the preceding two sentences is\ndetermined by the employees, receipts and assets of the business on the date of\nthe loan application. In addition, the business may not be part of an\naffiliated group, as defined in IRC section 1504, unless the group itself would\nhave met, as a group, the active business, employee and the gross-receipts\nrequirements. A loan made to an entity that meets these requirements to be a\nsmall business at the time of the filing of the loan application is deemed to\nbe a small business loan throughout the term of such loan. (b) For purposes of this paragraph, a\nresidential mortgage loan is a loan described in clause\n(d) of\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section. (4)\n\nExamples. Example 1: A retail clothing business located in New York\nsubmits an application for a loan from a qualified community bank on February\n1, 2021. The bank determines that, during the 2020 tax year, the business had\nan average number of 30 employees, and that for the same tax year the\nbusiness's gross receipts were $3 million and its assets consisted entirely of\ninventory (valued at $75,000) and bank deposits (valued at $25,000). The bank\nfurther determines that the business is not part of an affiliated group. The\nloan is a qualifying loan for purposes of this subtraction modification. Example 2: The business in example 1 submits an\napplication for a second loan from the same community bank on February 1, 2022. The bank determines that, during the 2021 tax year, the business had an average\nnumber of 40 employees, and that for the same tax year the business's gross\nreceipts were $4 million. The bank further determines that for the 2016 tax\nyear the business was part of an affiliated group; and that during that tax\nyear the members of the affiliated group together had an average number of 90\nemployees, and total gross receipts were $9 million. The loan is a qualifying\nsmall business loan for purposes of this subtraction modification. Example 3: A partnership submits an application for a\nloan from a qualified community bank on February 1, 2022. The bank determines\nthat, during the 2021 tax year, the partnership had no employees and its gross\nreceipts were $2 million for the year. The bank also determines that its assets\nconsist of corporate stock that has an average value equal to $40 million and\nland that has an average value equal to $10 million. The partnership holds the\ncorporate stock for investment. The partnership is not an active business\nbecause more than 50% of its assets are financial investments. Therefore, the\nloan is not a qualifying loan for purposes of this subtraction modification\nbecause it is not a small business loan. Example 4: Jane Smith, a resident of New York, submits\nan application to a small thrift for a residential mortgage loan of $1 million\nto purchase a second home in Massachusetts. Ms. Smith will use both the\n\nMassachusetts property and her primary residence in New York to secure the\nmortgage loan. At the time the loan is originated, the FMV of the New York\nproperty is $700,000 and the FMV of the Massachusetts property is $300,000. Since more than 50% of the loan is secured by real property in New York, the\nentire loan is considered secured by real property in New York. As such, the\nloan is a qualifying loan for purposes of this subtraction modification. (5)\n\nIn the case of a combined\nreport, the subtraction modification described in this subdivision must be\ncomputed separately for each qualified community bank or small thrift\ninstitution included in the combined report. The sum of such amounts is the\namount of the deduction allowed under this paragraph. (6)\nA taxpayer or, in the case of a combined\ngroup, a combined group claiming the subtraction modification provided for in\nthis subdivision is not allowed to utilize the captive REIT subtraction\nmodification described in subdivision (a) of this section or the subtraction\nmodification for qualified residential loan portfolios described in subdivision\n(b) of this section. (d) For purposes of determining if a corporation is a qualified community bank or\nsmall thrift institution, the average value determined under section\n3-2.4\nof the taxpayer's assets or, if the taxpayer is included in a combined report, the combined group's assets\ndetermined under section 210-C, must not exceed $8 billion. Such assets will be\nincluded only if the income, loss or expense of which are properly reflected\n(or would have been properly reflected if not fully depreciated or expensed, or\ndepreciated or expensed to a nominal amount) in the computation of entire net\nincome for the taxable year. (e) For purposes of all other assets used in this section, the following rules\nshall apply: (1)\n\nTotal assets are those\nassets that are properly reflected on a balance sheet, computed in the same\nmanner as is required by the banking regulator of the taxpayers included in the\ncombined return. Total assets include leased real property that is not properly\nreflected on a balance sheet. (2)\n\nAssets will only be included if the income or expenses of which are properly\nreflected (or would have been properly reflected if not fully depreciated or\nexpensed, or depreciated or expensed to a nominal amount) in the computation of\nthe combined group's ENI for the taxable year. Assets will not include deferred\ntax assets and intangible assets identified as goodwill. (3)\n\nTangible real and personal property, such\nas buildings, land, machinery, and equipment shall be valued at cost. Leased\nreal property that is not properly reflected on a balance sheet will be valued\nat the annual lease payment multiplied by eight. Intangible property, such as\nloans and investments, shall be valued at book value exclusive of\nreserves. (4)\n\nIntercorporate\nstockholdings and bills, notes and accounts receivable and payable, and other\nintercorporate indebtedness between the corporations included in the combined\nreport shall be eliminated. (5)\n\nAverage assets are computed using the assets measured on the first day of the\ntaxable year, and on the last day of each subsequent quarter of the taxable\nyear or month or day during the taxable year.
