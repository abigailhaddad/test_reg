  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.2 - Standards and guidance values for protection of human health and sources of potable water supplies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Standards\nand guidance values for protection of the best usage as a source of potable\nwater supply shall protect human health and drinking water sources and are\nreferred to as Health (Water Source) values. (b) The standard or guidance value shall be\nthe most stringent of the values derived using the procedures found in sections\n702.3 through\n702.7\nof this Part. (c) Standards or guidance values based on\noncogenic effects that are based on the 95 percent lower confidence limit on\nthe human dose corresponding to an excess lifetime cancer risk of one-in-one\nmillion or on chemical correlation to such effects shall be derived using\nage-specific water consumption rates and points-of-departure for a lifetime\nexposure period of 70 years if scientific evidence is sufficient to show that\nchildren may be more sensitive than adults to such oncogenic effects. If such\nscientific evidence is not available, a consumption rate of two liters of water\nper day for a lifetime exposure period of 70 years shall be used. (d) Standards or guidance values based on\noncogenic effects that are based on the human equivalent dose at the\npoint-of-departure divided by an uncertainty factor, chronic nononcogenic\neffects, or chemical correlation to such effects shall be derived using\nage-specific water consumption rates for a childhood exposure period (18 years\nor less) if scientific evidence is sufficient to show that children may be more\nsensitive than adults to such effects. If such scientific evidence is not\navailable, a consumption rate of two liters of water per day shall be\nused. (e) Standards or guidance\nvalues based on acute nononcogenic effects or chemical correlation to acute\nnononcogenic effects shall be derived using a consumption rate of one liter of\nwater per day or a different water consumption rate if deemed more appropriate\nbased on scientific evidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
