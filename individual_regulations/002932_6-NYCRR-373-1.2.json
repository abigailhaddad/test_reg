  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.2 - Requirements for permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nperson shall operate an existing hazardous waste management facility without a\npermit issued pursuant to this Part or without interim status pursuant to this\n\nPart. (b) A person that operates an\nexisting hazardous waste management facility without a permit issued pursuant\nto this Part must meet the requirements of Subpart 373-3 of this Part and the\napplicable interim status provisions of this Subpart. (c) No person shall begin physical\nconstruction of or operate a new hazardous waste management facility without a\npermit issued pursuant to this Part. (d) Owners and operators of hazardous waste\nmanagement facilities must have a Part 373 permit during the active life\n(including the closure period) of the unit, and, for any unit which closes\nafter January 26, 1983, during any post-closure care period required under\nsection\n373-2.7\n(g) of this\n\nPart and during any compliance period specified under section\n373-2.6\n(g) of this\n\nPart, including any extension of the compliance period under section\n373-2.6\n(g)(3)\nof\nthis Part. An RCRA part B permit issued by the United States Environmental\n\nProtection Agency under 40 CFR parts\n270\nand\n124\ndoes not relieve an owner or\noperator of the responsibility for obtaining a permit pursuant to this Part. Facilities which currently have a permit issued pursuant to Part 360 of this\n\nTitle for the management of hazardous waste and qualify for the extension\nallowed under the State Administrative Procedure Act (SAPA), have authorization\nto operate until final administrative and judicial disposition of a permit\napplication are made. Both of these facilities must also comply with the\nrequirements of Subpart 373-3 of this Part and the applicable interim status\nprovisions of this Subpart except section\n373-1.3\n(g). (e) Scope of the Part 373 permit\nrequirement. The ECL and RCRA require a permit for the treatment, storage, and disposal of any hazardous waste as identified or listed in Part\n371 of this Title. The terms treatment, storage, disposal, and hazardous waste\nare defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. Owners and operators of hazardous waste management units must have\npermits during the active life (including the closure period) of the unit. Owners or operators of surface impoundments, landfills, land treatment units, and waste pile units that received wastes after July 26, 1982, or that\ncertified closure (according to section\n373-3.7\n[f][1]\nof\nthis Part) after January 26, 1983, must have post-closure permits, unless they\ndemonstrate closure by removal or decontamination as provided under paragraphs\n(1) and (2) of this subdivision, or obtain an enforceable document in lieu of a\npost-closure permit, as provided under paragraph (3) of this subdivision. If a\npost-closure permit is required, the permit must address applicable Subpart\n373-2 (Groundwater Monitoring, Unsaturated Zone Monitoring, Corrective Action, and Post-Closure Care Requirements) of this Part. The denial of a permit for\nthe active life of a hazardous waste management facility or unit does not\naffect the requirement to obtain a post-closure permit under this Part. (1)\n\nClosure by removal. Owners or operators\nof surface impoundments, land treatment units, and waste piles closing by\nremoval or decontamination under Subpart 373-3 of this Part standards must\nobtain a post-closure permit unless they can demonstrate to the commissioner\nthat the closure met the standards for closure by removal or decontamination in\nsection\n373-2.11\n(f), 373-2.13\n(h)(5)\nor\n373-2.12\n(h) of\nthis Part, respectively. The demonstration may be made in the following ways: (i) If the owner or operator has submitted a\n\nPart 373 application for a post-closure permit, the owner or operator may\nrequest a determination, based on information contained in the application, that Subpart 373-2 closure by removal standards were met. If the commissioner\nbelieves that Subpart 373-2 standards were met, he or she will notify the\npublic of this proposed decision, allow for public comment, and reach a final\ndetermination according to the procedures in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (ii)\n\nIf the owner or\noperator has not submitted a Part 373 application for a post-closure permit, the owner or operator may petition the commissioner for a determination that a\npost- closure permit is not required because the closure met the applicable\n\nSubpart 373-2 closure standards. (a) The\npetition must include data demonstrating that closure by removal or\ndecontamination standards were met, or it must demonstrate that the unit closed\nunder the Subpart 373-2 closure by removal standard. (b) The commissioner shall approve or deny\nthe petition according to the procedures outlined in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nProcedures for closure equivalency\ndetermination. (i) If a facility owner or\noperator seeks an equivalency demonstration under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, the commissioner will provide the public, through a newspaper\nnotice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the information submitted\nby the owner or operator within 30 days from the date of the notice. The\ncommissioner will also, in response to a request or at his or her own\ndiscretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or\nmore issues concerning the equivalence of the Subpart 373-3 closure to a\n\nSubpart 373-2 closure. The commissioner will give public notice of the hearing\nat least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given\nat the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to submit written\ncomments, and the two notices may be combined.)\n(ii)\n\nThe commissioner will determine whether\nthe Subpart 373-3 closure met Subpart 373-2 closure by removal or\ndecontamination requirements within 90 days of its receipt. If the commissioner\nfinds that the closure did not meet the applicable Subpart 373-2 standards, he\nor she will provide the owner or operator with a written statement of the\nreasons why the closure failed to meet Subpart 373-2 standards. The owner or\noperator may submit additional information in support of an equivalency\ndemonstration within 30 days after receiving such written statement. The\ncommissioner will review any additional information submitted and make a final\ndetermination within 60 days. (iii)\n\nIf the commissioner determines that the facility did not close in accordance\nwith Subpart 373-2 closure by removal standards, the facility is subject to\npost-closure permitting requirements. (3)\n\nEnforceable documents for post-closure\ncare. At the discretion of the department, an owner or operator may obtain, in\nlieu of a post-closure permit, an enforceable document imposing the\nrequirements of section\n373-3.7\n(k) of this\n\nPart. Enforceable document\nmeans an order, a plan or other\ndocument issued by the department under article 27 or 71 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law (ECL), including, but not limited to a corrective action\norder, a CERCLA or State inactive hazardous waste site remedial order or a\nclosure or post-closure plan, and enforceable under article 71 of the\nECL.
