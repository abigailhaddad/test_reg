Tit. 10 § 455.1 - Depreciation, leases and rentals\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis functional reporting center must contain all\ndepreciation and amortization expenses on buildings, fixed equipment and\nleasehold improvements recorded at their historical cost. In addition, the\ncenter must also contain all lease and rented expenses for land, buildings, fixed equipment and leasehold improvements. (a) Standard unit of measure: gross square\nfeet. Gross square feet shall be determined using the outer dimensions of the\nfacility. Measurement should be taken by floor, to account for structural\nirregularities that may exist on various floors. When changes have been made\nduring the year as a result of new construction or expansion, or curtailment of\nservice, statistical data should be maintained to allow for the development of\n\"weighted\" areas for the fractional part of the year. (b) Data source. Gross square feet shall be\ndetermined from the blueprints of the residential health care facility, or\nactual measurement if blueprints are not available. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
