  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-2.5 - Compliance options\n\nState Regulations\n\nWith the exception of the compliance options described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, the compliance options established below do\nnot involve case-by-case RACT determinations with the need to individually\nselect an appropriate technology and/or alternative emission limit. As such, this option provides flexibility to any owner or operator of a major facility\nof NO\nx\nto meet the control requirements of section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart but is not\nof the type that require the additional approval of the administrator as a\nseparate SIP revision. (a) Fuel\nswitching option. The owner or operator of an emission source subject to\nthis Subpart may commit to burning a cleaner fuel, between May 1st and\n\nSeptember 30th of each year. Fuel switching must result in quantifiable annual\nNO\nx\nemissions equal to or less than the\nNO\nx\nemissions expected if the emission source complied\nwith the applicable presumptive RACT emission limits set forth in section\n227-2.4\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) System\naveraging plan. The owner or operator of an emission source subject to\nthis Subpart may apply to have the emission source included in a system\naveraging plan. Every system averaging plan must have the following\ncharacteristics: (1)\n\nThe system\naveraging plan must employ a weighted average permissible emission\nrate. (2)\n\nAveraging of emissions\nfrom sources within the severe ozone nonattainment area with those outside the\nsevere ozone nonattainment area is not allowed. (3)\n\nIn the event of a forced outage, the\nweighted average permissible emission rate must be adjusted to account for the\nemission source or major electrical inter-tie (345 kV or greater) not in\noperation as a result of the forced outage. The adjusted emission rate will be\ndeemed in compliance for the period of the forced outage. In the event of a\nforced outage, the facility owner or operator must, within 30 days thereafter, submit a written report to the department which describes why the outage was\nunavoidable and includes the following: (i) a\ncontemporaneous operating log signed by the responsible official identifying\nthe location of the emission source which was subject to the forced outage and\nthe cause of such outage; (ii)\na\ndemonstration that the emission source was being properly operated at the time\nthe outage occurred; (iii)\na\ndemonstration that, during the outage, the facility owner or operator took all\nreasonable steps to minimize emissions from the operating emission sources\nincluded in the system averaging plan, or other requirements of the permit; and\n(iv)\na proposed repair or\nreplacement schedule for the subject emission source or a proposed revised\nsystem averaging plan. (4)\n\nEvery owner or operator of an emission\nsource participating in the system averaging plan is liable for any and all\nviolations of the provisions of this Subpart by any owner or operator of any\nemission source participating in the system averaging plan. (c) For those emission sources\nwhere the owner or operator demonstrates the applicable presumptive RACT\nemission limit in section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart is not\neconomically or technically feasible or which must submit a case-by-case RACT\nanalysis as required in Section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart, the owner\nor operator must submit to the department the following analysis (which at a\nminimum includes an evaluation of the use of fuel switching the use of a system\naveraging plan): (1)\nthe available\nNO\nx\ncontrol technologies, the projected effectiveness of\nthe technologies considered, and the costs for installation and operation for\neach of the technologies; and\n(2)\nthe technology and the appropriate emission limit selected as RACT considering\nthe costs for installation and operation of the\ntechnology.
