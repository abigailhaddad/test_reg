  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.07 - Horizontal Alignment Signs (W1-1 through W1-5, W1-11, W1-15)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section. INSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 00A If Table 2C-5 indicates that a horizontal alignment\nsign (see Figure 2C-1) is required, recommended, or allowed, the sign installed\nin advance of the curve shall be a Curve (W1-2) sign unless a different sign is\nrequired, recommended, or allowed by the provisions of this Section. 00B A Turn (W1-1) sign shall be used instead of a Curve\nsign in advance of curves that have advisory speeds of 30 mph or less (see\n\nFigure 2C-2). Option: 00C Where the legal speed limit is 30 MPH and the advisory\nspeed is higher than the speed limit, a horizontal alignment sign, if used, may\nbe either the Turn (W1-1) or Curve (W1-2) sign. Guidance: 00D Signs are not required, and normally should not be\nused, for curves having advisory speeds more than five mph above the legal and\n85th-percentile speeds. Standard: 00E Where the advisory speed is less than the legal speed\nlimit, the horizontal alignment sign shall be supplemented with an Advisory\n\nSpeed plaque (see Section\n2C.08\n). 00F Where the advisory speed is greater than the legal\nspeed limit, an Advisory Speed plaque shall not be used. Option: 00G Where the advisory speed is equal to the legal speed\nlimit, an Advisory Speed plaque may be used. 00H If the change in horizontal alignment is 135 degrees or\nmore, the Hairpin Curve (W1-11) sign (see Figure 2C-1) may be used instead of a\n\nCurve or Turn sign. If the change in horizontal alignment is approximately 270\ndegrees, such as on a cloverleaf interchange ramp, the 270-degree Loop (W1-15)\nsign (see Figure 2C-1) may be used instead of a Curve or Turn sign. Guidance: 00I When the Hairpin Curve sign or the 270-degree Loop sign\nis installed and the advisory speed is equal to or 5 MPH above the legal speed\nlimit, either a One-Direction Large Arrow (W1-6) sign or Chevron Alignment\n(W1-8) signs should be installed on the outside of the curve. Standard: 00J Curves in the same direction separated by 200 feet or\nmore shall be signed separately, except as provided elsewhere in this section. Curves in opposite directions separated by more than 600 ft shall be signed\nseparately. Option: 00K Two curves in the same direction separated by less than\n200 feet may be considered a single curve having an advisory speed equal to the\nlower of the two curves. Support: 00L Separate signing of two curves in the same direction\nseparated by less than 200 feet is preferable where the first curve is long and\nhas an advisory speed higher than the second curve. 00M Separate signing of two curves in opposite directions\nseparated by 600 feet or less is preferable where the first curve is long and\nhas an advisory speed higher than the second curve. Separate signing may also\nbe preferable where the distance between curves is more than 400 ft. Option: 00N The Winding Road sign may be used where warning is\nrequired for a series of three or more curves, generally alternating in\ndirection and separated by distances of 600 feet or less. Standard: 00O Where a Winding Road sign is needed, the W1-5L sign\nshall be used where the first curve in the series is to the left, and the W1-5R\nsign shall be used where the first curve in the series is to the right. 00P The advisory speed used with a Reverse Turn (W1-3), Reverse Curve (W1-4), or a Winding Road (W1-5) sign shall be the lowest\nadvisory speed of any curve in the series, except as provided below. Option: 00Q Each Winding Road sign in advance of, and within, the\ncurve series may be supplemented with a Next Distance (W16-4p) plaque (see\n\nSection\n2C.55\n) stating the distance to the\nend of the series. 00R Within the series of curves, appropriate Turn, Curve, Reverse Turn, and Reverse Curve signs may be used for individual curves, or\ncurve combinations, having advisory speeds significantly lower than the other\ncurves in the series. Guidance: 00S An appropriate Turn, Curve, Reverse Turn, or Reverse\n\nCurve sign should be placed following an individually-signed curve, or curve\ncombination, to provide warning for the remaining curves in the series. Advisory speeds for the portions of the series which precede and follow any\nindividually-signed curve, or curve combination, should be determined\nindependently. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.07\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
