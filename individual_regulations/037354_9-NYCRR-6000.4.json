  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6000.4 - Post-offer medical review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The qualified physician or practitioner\nshall assess each candidate on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the\ncandidate can, with or without reasonable accommodations, perform the essential\nfunctions of an entry-level police officer for the local police agency seeking\nto employ the candidate. (b) The\nexamining physician or practitioner shall complete a medical examination form\nbased upon the medical review of the candidate. The existence of a potentially\ndisqualifying condition shall not preclude the qualified physician or\npractitioner from determining that the candidate is able to perform the\nessential job functions of an entry-level officer. Nothing herein, however, shall preclude the qualified physician or practitioner from noting the\nexistence of any other potentially disqualifying conditions not specifically\nset forth in this Part, which, in the opinion of such physician or\npractitioner, may render the candidate unable to perform the essential\nfunctions of an entry-level police officer. (c) Upon the conclusion of the medical\nexamination, the qualified practitioner or physician shall sign the medical\nexamination form and shall render his/her medical opinion to the employing\nagency as to whether the candidate can perform the essential functions of an\nentry-level police officer, noting all relevant medical information. However, in the event that the medical examination reveals the existence of a\npotentially disqualifying condition, the MPTC strongly recommends that a\nqualified physician sign the medical examination form (after further review if\nthe initial examination was performed by a qualified practitioner) and render\nhis/her medical opinion to the employing agency as to whether the candidate can\nperform the essential functions of an entry-level police officer, noting all\nrelevant medical information. (d) The qualified physician or practitioner shall determine whether in his/her\nprofessional judgment each candidate can, with or without reasonable\naccommodations, perform the essential functions of an entry-level police\nofficer upon the results of the clinical tests as set forth in section\n6000.6\nof this Part, the medical\nstandards as set forth in section\n6000.7\nof this Part, the essential\njob functions for police officer candidates as set forth in section\n6000.9\nof this Part, and other\nrelevant medical criteria which in the opinion of the qualified physician or\npractitioner, may be used to base his/her judgment. (e) Based upon the recommendations of the\nqualified physician or practitioner, the local police agency wishing to employ\nthe candidate shall render the final decision as to whether the offer of\nemployment shall be revoked.
