  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.26 - Exhibit 26: effect on communications\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 26 shall contain: (a) An identification of all existing\nbroadcast communication sources within a two-mile radius of the facility and\nthe electric interconnection between the facility and the point of\ninterconnection, unless otherwise noted, including: (1)\nAM radio; (2)\nFM radio; (3)\ntelevision; (4)\ntelephone; (5)\nmicrowave transmission (all affected\nsources, not limited to a two-mile radius); (6)\nemergency services; (7)\nmunicipal/school district\nservices; (8)\npublic utility\nservices; (9)\ndoppler/weather radar\n(all affected sources, not limited to a two- mile radius); (10)\nair traffic control (all affected\nsources, not limited to a two-mile radius); (11)\narmed forces (all affected sources, not\nlimited to a two-mile radius); (12)\nGPS; (13)\nLORAN (all affected\nsources, not limited to a two-mile radius); and\n(14)\namateur radio licenses registered to\nusers. (b) An\nidentification of all existing underground cable and fiber optic major\ntransmission telecommunication lines within a two-mile radius of the facility\nand the electric interconnection between the facility and the point of\ninterconnection. (c) A statement\ndescribing the anticipated effects of the proposed facility and the electric\ninterconnection between the facility and the point of interconnection on the\ncommunications systems required to be identified pursuant to subdivisions (a)\nand (b) of this section, including the potential for: (1)\nstructures to interfere with broadcast\npatterns by re-radiating the broadcasts in other directions; (2)\nstructures to block necessary\nlines-of-sight; (3)\nphysical\ndisturbance by construction activities; (4)\nadverse impacts to co-located lines due\nto unintended bonding; and\n(5)\nany\nother potential for interference. (d) An evaluation of the design configuration\nof the proposed facility and electric interconnection between the facility and\nthe point of interconnection demonstrating that there shall be no adverse\neffects on the communications systems required to be identified pursuant to\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. (e) A description of post-construction\nactivities that shall be undertaken to identify and mitigate any adverse\neffects on the communications systems required to be identified pursuant to\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section that occur despite the design\nconfiguration of the proposed facility and electric interconnection between the\nfacility and the point of interconnection. (f) For wind power facilities, an evaluation\nof the design configuration of the proposed facility and electric\ninterconnection between the facility and the point of interconnection\ndemonstrating that there shall be no adverse effects on or interference with\nradar or instrument systems used for air traffic control, guidance, weather, or\nmilitary operations including training. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.26\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
