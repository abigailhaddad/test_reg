  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 600.1 - Authority, intent and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is adopted pursuant to section\n913\nof the\n\nExecutive Law to implement the provisions of the Waterfront Revitalization of\n\nCoastal Areas and Inland Waterways Act. (b) This Part is intended to provide for\n\nState agencies acting in the coastal area and inland waterways the necessary\nframework for the consideration and application of the State's policies with\nrespect to waterfront revitalization and coastal resources, as contained in\narticle 42 of the Executive Law. (c) It was the intention of the Legislature\nthat the preservation, enhancement and utilization of the natural and man-made\nresources of the State's unique coastal area take place in a coordinated and\ncomprehensive manner to insure the proper balance between those natural\nresources and the need to accommodate the needs of population growth and\neconomic development. Accordingly, it is the intention of this Part to achieve\na balance between economic development and preservation that will permit the\nbeneficial use of coastal and inland waterway resources while preventing the\nloss of living marine resources and wildlife, diminution of open space areas or\npublic access to the waterfront, shoreline erosion, impairment of scenic\nbeauty, or permanent adverse changes to ecological systems. (d) In adopting the Waterfront Revitalization\nof Coastal Areas and Inland Waterways Act, it was the Legislature's intention\nthat review by State agencies required pursuant to article 42 of the Executive\n\nLaw, to determine the consistency of proposed actions with the policies of\narticle 42 and with any applicable approved local Waterfront Revitalization\n\nProgram, be coordinated with and made a part of each agency's existing\nprocedures, including reviews conducted under the State Environmental Quality\n\nReview Act (SEQR) ( Environmental Conservation Law, article 8). Accordingly, in\ncompliance with article 42, this Part provides a framework which is compatible\nwith and capable of coordination with a State agency's existing review\nresponsibilities under SEQR (6 NYCRR Part\n617\n). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n600.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
