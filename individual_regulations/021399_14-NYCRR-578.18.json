  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 578.18 - Interest\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Necessary\ninterest on both current and capital indebtedness is an allowable\ncost. (b) To be considered as an\nallowable cost, interest shall be incurred to satisfy a financial need, and at\na rate not in excess of what a prudent borrower would have had to be in the\nmoney market at the time the loan was made. (c) Such interest shall be paid to a lender\nnot related through control, ownership, affiliation or personal relationship to\nthe borrower, except in instances where the prior approval of the commissioner\nhas been obtained. (d) Interest\nexpense shall be reduced by investment income with the exception of income from\nfunded depreciation, qualified pension funds, deferred compensation funds, and\ngifts, grants or endowments, whether restricted or unrestricted. (e) Interest on current working capital\nindebtedness shall be treated and reported as an operating administrative\nexpense. (f) Interest on capital\nindebtedness is an allowable cost if the debt generating the interest is\napproved by the commissioner, incurred for authorized purposes, and the\nprincipal of the debt does not exceed that which is either approved by the\ncommissioner or the cost of the authorized purposes. Capital indebtedness shall\nmean all debt obligations of a residential treatment facility that are: (1)\nevidenced by a mortgage note or bond and\nsecured by a mortgage on the land, building or nonmovable equipment, a note\npayable secured by the nonmovable equipment of a facility, a capital\nlease; (2)\nincurred for the purpose\nof financing the acquisition, construction or renovation of land, building or\nnonmovable equipment; (3)\nfound by\nthe commissioner to be reasonable, necessary and in the public interest with\nrespect to the residential treatment facility. Interest related to refinancing\nindebtedness shall be considered an allowable cost only to the extent that it\nis payable with respect to an amount equal to the unpaid principal of the\nindebtedness then being refinanced. However, interest incurred on refinanced\ndebt in excess of the previously unpaid balance of the refinanced indebtedness\nwill be allowable on acceptable demonstration to the commissioner that such\nrefinancing will result in a debt service savings over the life of the\nindebtedness; or\n(4)\nincurred for\nthe purpose of advance refunding of debt. Losses resulting from the advanced\nrefunding of debt shall be treated and reported as deferred charge. This\ndeferred charge is to be amortized on a straight-line basis over the period to\nthe scheduled maturity date of the refunding debt. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
