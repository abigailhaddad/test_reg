  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5605.6 - Protection of contestant funds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Contestant deposits in trust. (1)\n\nFunds deposited by contestants with the\nSPE of an interactive fantasy sports operator or registrant shall be, by\noperation of this section, received as assets of a trust for the purposes set\nforth in this section, not property belonging to such SPE or the operator or\nregistrant. Such deposits shall include, without limitation, any funds provided\non a contestant's behalf by a credit card processor and any prize or award won\nby a contestant in a contest offered by the operator or registrant that is\ncredited to such person's contestant account. (2)\n\nPursuant to the trust relationship and\nobligations created by operation of this Part, the funds deposited by each\ncontestant shall be a separate trust and the SPE of the operator or registrant\nshall be the trustee of each such trust, commencing with deposits on or after\nthe effective date of this section, and shall continue with respect to every\nasset of the trust until every trust claim arising at any time has been paid or\ndischarged for the purposes of the trust and the trust has been terminated\n(e.g., by the closing of the contestant account by the contestant) and the\ntrust assets distributed pursuant to this section. Such trust relationship is\ncreated by virtue of this section and shall apply regardless of the type of\nbank account that the SPE uses to hold the funds pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. (3)\n\nEach SPE of\nan operator or registrant shall deposit and maintain all of the funds held in\ntrust in an account in a branch of a national or State chartered banking\ninstitution. (4)\n\nFunds held in\ntrust shall not be commingled with other funds. The SPE shall not be required\nto keep in separate bank accounts or deposits the funds of the separate trusts\nof which such SPE shall be trustee pursuant to this section, so long as the\nbooks of account of such SPE for the operator or registrant shall show clearly\nthe allocation to each trust of the deposits in and withdrawals from such\naccount holding the funds held in trust. (5)\n\nThe books or records with respect to each\ntrust shall contain entries of trust assets receivable, trust accounts payable, trust funds received and trust payments made with trust assets including\nwithout limitation the entry fees paid and prizes or awards won by a contestant\nin a contest. Such entries shall be sufficient to identify the party, amount, date, bank or depository and other pertinent information for each account\nentry. (6)\n\nFailure of the SPE, as\ntrustee, to keep the books or records required by this subdivision shall be\npresumptive evidence that the SPE, as trustee, has applied or consented to the\napplication of funds actually received in trust by the SPE as money or an\ninstrument for the payment of money for purposes other than a purpose of the\ntrust as specified in this section. The SPE may be assisted by the operator or\nregistrant to maintain such records. (b) Trust claims. Such trust\nassets shall be held and applied by the SPE, as trustee, for the payment of\ntrust claims. Trust claims means the following claims for payment for which the\nSPE, as trustee pursuant to the trust relationship and obligations created by\noperation of this Part, is authorized to use, in this order, the funds held in\ntrust: (1)\nA claim by a person to withdraw\nfrom such person's contestant account any funds that are not designated as an\nentry fee in an ongoing contest. (2)\nA claim by a contestant for the prizes or\nawards won in a contest offered by the operator or registrant upon the\ncompletion of the contest. Such claims shall be paid by crediting the winnings\nand debiting the entry fees, and recording such credits and debits in the books\nand records of the SPE, with respect to the contestant account of each\ncontestant. (3)\nA claim by the\noperator or registrant for funds held in trust that were designated as entry\nfees in a contest by a contestant, after paying the claims to the contestants\nfor the prizes or awards won by the contestants, upon the completion of such\ncontest. The SPE of the operator or registrant may delay the payment of all or\npart of this trust claim for the purpose of orderly bookkeeping, including to\nimplement a standard reconciliation of funds request submitted from the\noperator or registrant to initiate the payment of such claims by the SPE, and\nensuring the payment of superior trust claims. (c) Payments to contestants. An SPE, as trustee, is not authorized to determine the order of payment of\ntrust claims of the contestants. An SPE, as trustee, shall apply assets held in\ntrust in the order in which the contestants request a distribution or\nwithdrawal of each such person's contestant account funds. (d) Termination of accounts. The beneficial interest in the remaining assets in each person's contestant\naccount, upon the termination of the trust by such person having elected to\nclose any contestant account and by payment or discharge of all the trust\nclaims, shall vest in such person, and the SPE, as trustee, shall distribute\nsame to such person within five business days, unless the completion of\nfraud-prevention procedures necessitates a delay, in which case the operator\nshall so notify such person of the delay and the time in which the payment is\nanticipated to be made. (e) Diversion of trust assets. Any transaction by which any\ncontestant funds held in trust by operation of this Part are paid, transferred\nor applied for any purpose other than a purpose of the trust as stated in this\nsection, before payment or discharge in order of all trust claims and the\ntermination of the trust, is a diversion of trust assets, whether or not there\nare trust claims in existence at the time of the transaction. If the diversion\noccurs by the voluntary act of the SPE, as trustee, or operator or registrant\nor by the consent of the SPE, as trustee, or operator or registrant, then such\nact or consent is a breach of trust. (f) Embezzlement referrals. The commission shall report to the gaming inspector general and to appropriate\nlaw enforcement officials, for possible action in regard to the embezzlement of\nsuch funds: (1)\nany activity that constitutes\nan application or consent to an application of trust funds received in trust\npursuant to this Part by the SPE, as trustee, as money or an instrument for the\npayment of money for any purpose other than the purposes of that trust; and\n(2)\nany accessorial conduct, facilitation, solicitation, conspiracy or attempt by an operator or registrant\nto cause or benefit from a misapplication of such trust funds. (g) Disclosure of terms\nand conditions of trust accounts. Each operator or registrant shall\ndisplay prominently on such operator or registrant's platform a complete and\nunambiguous description that contestant deposits are held in trust and of the\nobligations of the SPE, as trustee, established by this section. (h) Unrelated services and\nproducts. This section shall not apply to the purchase by a person\nfrom an interactive fantasy sports operator or registrant of any service or\nproduct that is unrelated to interactive fantasy sports or whose purchase is\nindependent from entering any such contest.
