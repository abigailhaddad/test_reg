This provision shall not apply to matters governed by\n\nRule 1.12(a). (b) When a lawyer is disqualified from\nrepresentation under paragraph (a), no lawyer in a firm with which that lawyer\nis associated may knowingly undertake or continue representation in such a\nmatter unless: (1)\nthe firm\nacts promptly and reasonably to: (i) notify, as appropriate, lawyers and\nnonlawyer personnel within the firm that the personally disqualified lawyer is\nprohibited from participating in the representation of the current\nclient; (ii)\nimplement effective screening procedures to prevent the flow of information\nabout the matter between the personally disqualified lawyer and the others in\nthe firm; (iii)\nensure that the disqualified lawyer is apportioned no part of the fee\ntherefrom; and\n(iv)\ngive written notice to the appropriate government agency to enable it to\nascertain compliance with the provisions of this Rule; and\n(2)\nthere are no other\ncircumstances in the particular representation that create an appearance of\nimpropriety. (c) Except as law may otherwise\nexpressly provide, a lawyer having information that the lawyer knows is\nconfidential government information about a person, acquired when the lawyer\nwas a public officer or employee, may not represent a private client whose\ninterests are adverse to that person in a matter in which the information could\nbe used to the material disadvantage of that person. As used in this Rule, the\nterm \"confidential government information\" means information that has been\nobtained under governmental authority and that, at the time this Rule is\napplied, the government is prohibited by law from disclosing to the public or\nhas a legal privilege not to disclose, and that is not otherwise available to\nthe public. A firm with which that lawyer is associated may undertake or\ncontinue representation in the matter only if the disqualified lawyer is timely\nand effectively screened from any participation in the matter in accordance\nwith the provisions of paragraph (b).

(e) As used in this\n\nRule, the term \"matter\" as defined in Rule 1.0(l) does not include or apply to\nagency rulemaking functions. (f) A lawyer who holds public office\nshall not: (1)\nuse the public\nposition to obtain, or attempt to obtain, a special advantage in legislative\nmatters for the lawyer or for a client under circumstances where the lawyer\nknows or it is obvious that such action is not in the public\ninterest; (2)\nuse\nthe public position to influence, or attempt to influence, a tribunal to act in\nfavor of the lawyer or of a client; or\n(3)\naccept anything of value from any\nperson when the lawyer knows or it is obvious that the offer is for the purpose\nof influencing the lawyer's action as a public official.
