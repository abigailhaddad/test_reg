Tit. 16 § 255.717 - Transmission lines: permanent field repair of leaks\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach permanent field repair of a leak on a transmission\nline, or distribution main operating at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more in a Class 3\nor 4 location, must be made according to the following requirements: (a) If feasible, the segment must be taken\nout of service and repaired by cutting out a cylindrical piece of pipe and\nreplacing it with pipe of similar or greater design strength. (b) If it is not feasible to take the segment\nout of service, repairs must be made by one of the following methods: (1)\ninstall a full encirclement welded split\nsleeve of appropriate design; (2)\nif the leak is due to a corrosion pit, the repair may be made by installing a\nproperly designed bolt-on-leak clamp; (3)\nif the leak is due to a corrosion pit and\nis on pipe with a SMYS of not more than 40,000 psi 267 MPa), the repair may be\nmade by fillet welding a steel plate patch with rounded corners, of the same or\ngreater thickness than the pipe, and not more than one-half of the diameter of\nthe pipe in size; (4)\napply a\nmethod that reliable engineering tests and analyses show can permanently\nrestore the serviceability of the pipe.
