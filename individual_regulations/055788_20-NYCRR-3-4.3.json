  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-4.3 - Investment capital identification procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(5)(a)(v))\n(a) Identification requirement. To qualify as\ninvestment capital, an investment in stock must be clearly identified in the\ncorporation's records as stock held for investment in the same manner as\nrequired under IRC section 1236(a)(1) for the stock of a dealer in securities\n(whether or not the corporation is a dealer in securities). The identification\nrequirements described in this section do not apply to constitutionally\nprotected investment capital. (b) Dealers in Securities. In the case of a corporation that is a dealer in\nsecurities subject to IRC section 1236, the identification requirement in\nsubparagraph (v) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of section\n3-4.1\nof this Subpart will be\nsatisfied only if the stocks are clearly identified in the corporation's\nrecords as stock held for investment under IRC section 1236(a)(1). However, any\nstock purchased by a corporation that is a dealer in securities pursuant to an\noption will meet the identification requirement only if the option also is\nclearly identified in the corporation's records as held for investment under\nIRC section 1236(a)(1). Identification under any other IRC section, including\nIRC section 475, or under any section of New York law or regulation, will not\nsatisfy the identification requirement. (c) All corporations other than dealers in\nsecurities. In the case of corporations that are not dealers in securities\nsubject to IRC section 1236, the identification requirement in subparagraph (v)\nof paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of section\n3-4.1\nof this Subpart will be\nsatisfied only if the stocks are recorded in an account that: (1)\nis maintained specifically for purposes\nof identifying such stocks as held for investment for investment capital\npurposes; (2)\nis separate from any\naccount maintained for stock held for sale to customers; and\n(3)\nis maintained in a separate account in\nthe corporation's books of account for recordkeeping purposes; or in a separate\ndepository account maintained by a clearing company as nominee for the\ncorporation; and\n(4)\ndiscloses: (i) the name of the stock; (ii)\nthe identifying number of the stock\naccording to either the Committee on Uniform Securities Identification\n\nProcedures (CUSIP) or the CUSIP International Numbering System (CINS), as\nappropriate; and\n(iii)\nif the stock\nis sold, the date of the sale, the number of shares sold in the sale, and the\nprice at which the stock or the option, respectively, is sold; and\n(5)\nis established in such a\nmanner as to readily identify the length of time that the stock is\nowned. (d) (1)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in this\nsubdivision, for corporations other than dealers in securities, the stocks must\nbe identified in the manner described in subdivision (c) of this section\nbefore: (i) October 1, 2015, for stocks\nacquired prior to October 1, 2015; or\n(ii)\nthe close of the day on which the stock\nwas acquired for stock acquired on or after October 1, 2015. (2)\n\nUnder the circumstances\ndescribed in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph that occur on or\nafter October 1, 2015, the corporation must identify such stocks by the\nadditional identification period end date, which is the\n90\nth\nday after the measurement date specified in\nsuch subparagraphs. Only stocks owned by the corporation on the additional\nidentification period end date will be eligible for identification under this\nclause. (i) In the case of a corporation that\nfirst becomes subject to tax under article 9-A on or after October 1, 2015, the\nmeasurement date is the date that the corporation begins doing business, employing capital, owning or leasing property or maintaining an office in New\n\nYork State. However, in the case of a corporation that becomes subject to tax\nsolely because it is deriving receipts from activity in New York State, the\nmeasurement date is the date on which the corporation first has receipts within\n\nNew York State of $1 million or more. In the case of a unitary group that\nbecomes subject to tax solely because it is deriving receipts from activity in\n\nNew York State, the measurement date for every corporation included in the\nunitary group as of the additional identification period end date is the date\non which the unitary group in the aggregate first has receipts within New York\n\nState of $1 million or more. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a corporation that is not a taxpayer in New York State, has not\nbeen included in a combined report previously, and first meets the capital\nstock requirement to be included in a combined report with a taxpayer under\nsection 210-C(2)(a) on or after October 1, 2015, the measurement date for that\ncorporation is the day that corporation first meets the capital stock\nrequirement to be included in a combined report. (e) For stocks purchased pursuant\nto an option, the identification requirements and procedures specified in this\nsection should be read as if the requirements and procedures referenced the\noption in addition to the stock. (f) In the case of a combined report, each\nmember of the combined group must follow the identification requirements and\nprocedures specified in this section for investments in stock owned by that\ncorporation. (g) If a corporation\nis a partner in a partnership and the corporation is using the aggregate method\nto compute its tax, the partnership must follow the identification requirements\nand procedures specified in this section for investments in stock owned by the\npartnership to qualify as investment capital of the corporate partner. If, on\nor after October 1, 2015, a corporation becomes a partner in a partnership that\nis not a dealer for purposes of IRC section 1236, and the partnership, prior to\nthe date the corporation becomes a partner, had not identified any stock as\ninvestment capital using the requirements and procedures specified in this\nsection, only stock acquired by the partnership on or after the date the\ncorporation becomes a partner may potentially qualify as investment\ncapital.
