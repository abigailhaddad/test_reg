  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1950.6 - Service branches\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Property owners desiring water service branches laid to their premises shall\nmake written application for such branches at the water board. Such application\nwhen fully executed constitutes an agreement that the property to be supplied\nis to be held liable for all charges for water consumed and any other\nindebtedness. (b) Applications for\nservice branches shall be made by a plumber licensed by the city or by the\nowner of the premises. In the latter case, the name of the licensed plumber who\nwill do the work must be specified. All applications for new service shall be\naccompanied by the payment in full of all service line material to be furnished\nby the water board. (c) Service\nbranches less than two inches in size shall be attached to the water mains by\nmeans of a corporation cock(s) and tailpiece(s) supplied by the water board to\nthe person making the application. (d) The main water supply or water service\nfrom the water board water main to a point inside of the street curb shall be\nof type \"K\" annealed copper tubing. (e) Service connections to the water board's\nwater main are normally to be tapped on the top of the main and an arm running\nparallel with the main installed and blocked up with brick or stone. The copper\nservice must be placed in a deep shelf on the side of the trench so that the\ncopper pipe can be covered with at least six inches of earth. The copper\nservice from the main to the curb cock is to be made with a minimum number of\nflared connections, except the 11/2\" and 2\" sizes may have one 90-degree elbow\nand one coupling with soldered joints. (f) All service branches larger than two\ninches shall be of cast or ductile iron. (g) Every service branch must be provided\nwith a curb cock or valve protected by a curb box or valve box set just inside\nthe curb line for the purpose of turning water either on or off. (h) Whenever possible, service branches shall\nbe laid in a direct line from the street main to the curb box and at right\nangles to the curb. They shall be laid at a minimum depth of four feet. Any\nexception must be approved by the director. (i) Service branches may be laid in the same\ntrench as the sewer lateral, provided they are placed upon a trench shelf and\nabove the sewer line. (j) All\nservice branches from the main to the building must be laid by a licensed\nplumber or a competent employee under the supervision of a licensed plumber. The water board shall do no work except insertion of a corporation cock or the\ninstallation of a tapping sleeve and valve with the necessary valve\nbox. (k) All water service pipes are\nconsidered the property of the property owner and as such, said owner shall be\nresponsible for any leakage which may occur between the curb cock and the\nbuilding supplied, and it shall be the responsibility of such property owner to\nmaintain such service pipe in a non-leaking condition at all times and at his\nown expense. (l) The water board, at\nits own expense, shall repair, replace and otherwise maintain, except for\nthawing, that part of the water service pipe located between the water main in\nthe street and the curb cock, otherwise known as the curb stop, including such\ncurb cock and the protecting curb box whenever, in its judgment, such repair, replacement or other maintenance is necessary, provided that such service pipe\nis not more than two inches in diameter and that the property supplied is\nsituated within the corporate limits of the city. (m) The thawing of all frozen water services\nis the responsibility of the property owner. (n) When a leak is discovered in a service\nbranch between the curb box and the building supplied, a written notice shall\nbe mailed or delivered to the property owner informing him or her of the\nexistence of such leak. Failure of the property owner to repair such leak\nwithin five days of the date that such notice is mailed, shall be deemed\nsufficient cause for the water board to discontinue the supply of water through\nsuch service until such leak is repaired. Services temporarily discontinued in\nthis manner shall not be restored until the leak is repaired and a reactivation\nfee as identified in the board schedule of rates is paid to the water\nboard. (o) The cost of removal and\ncapping at the corporation cock when discontinuing service shall be paid for by\nthe owner, whether done at his request or by order of the director, at real\ncost. (p) Any service line where\nwater service has been terminated at the request of the owner shall be\nconsidered inactive if service is not restored within two years from the\nremoval of the water meter. After two years, the service line shall be deemed\nabandoned and the director may require replacement of the service line to\nre-establish water service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
