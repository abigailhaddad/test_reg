  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.42 - Executive order no. 42: establishing the new york voluntary enterprise commission\n\nState Regulations\n\nOur State has been fortunate over the past half century to\nhave developed a working partnership with a wide array of voluntary\norganizations which have become part of the State's heritage and tradition of\nproviding for the less fortunate. The wellspring of this tradition has always\nbeen, and continues to be, the idealism, compassion and generosity of the\ncitizens of New York. An enduring partnership between the public, private and\nvoluntary sectors, on behalf of the State and its communities, can insure that\ngovernment is responsive to real needs and can draw on the best resources of\nthe community. Moreover, coordination of these efforts with governmental\nprograms leverages essential additional financial assistance for those in need\nin these times of fiscal constraint. It is, therefore, important that the relationship between\nthe State and the voluntary sector be promoted by the establishment of New York\n\nVoluntary Enterprise Commission, composed of citizens, representing various\nsectors of our society, with a keen interest in and commitment to community\nservice. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. The New York Voluntary Enterprise\n\nCommission\n\nThere is hereby created within the Executive Chamber the\n\nNew York Voluntary Enterprise Commission. The members of the commission shall\nbe appointed by the Governor, two of whom shall be designated cochairpersons. The membership shall not exceed 20 persons. The members shall serve for a term\nof one year and may be reappointed. The members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred in\nconnection with the performance of their duties. II. Powers and Responsibilities of the\n\nCommission\n\nThe commission shall advise and assist the Governor in the\ndevelopment and implementation of policies designed to promote voluntarism and\nrealize the fullest potential of the voluntary sector. Specifically, the\ncommission shall: (1)\n\nReview the\nexperiences of Federal programs such as the Peace Corps and VISTA, and programs\nin other states, to determine whether New York should create a voluntary\nservice corps. (2)\n\nEstablish a\nseries of joint enterprise programs, in a limited number of areas of State\nconcern that are deemed priorities by the Governor, that would join public and\nprivate resources to those of community-based voluntary organizations that have\ndemonstrated a high degree of creativity, effectiveness and understanding in\nresponding to community needs. (3)\n\nAddress and attempt to resolve concerns or problems involving the relationship\nbetween the State and the voluntary sector. (4)\n\nGive recognition to excellence and\ncreativity in the voluntary sector through an annual awards program, to be\nknown as the Eleanor Roosevelt Awards for Community Service. (5)\n\nEngage in such other studies or\nactivities that are deemed by the Governor to be in the best interest of the\n\nState and the voluntary sector. III. Procedures of the Commission\n\nThe commission shall establish procedures to govern the\nmethod and manner of its operations and the submission of matters for its\nconsideration. The commission may employ such staff as may be deemed\nnecessary by the cochairpersons at compensation to be fixed by them subject to\nthe approval of the Governor and the Budget Director. In carrying out its\nfunctions, powers and duties, the commission shall, wherever possible, make use\nof the staff resources of the Executive Chamber and of State agencies, as well\nas those of the private sector. All departments, divisions, boards, offices and public\ncorporations of the State are directed to cooperate with the commission and to\nprovide such assistance as the commission may request to fulfill its purposes. Such assistance may include, but need not be limited to, the provision of\nstatistical and policy data in such form as is determined by the commission, and consultation with such agency staff as the commission identifies. IV. Advisory Board\n\nThere is hereby created an Advisory Board on Voluntary\n\nEnterprise (the \"Board\"), of no more than 50 persons, whose members, designated\nby the Governor, shall consist of leaders of the voluntary sector in the State\nand persons from the private and independent sectors who have made significant\ncontributions to public policy. The board shall advise and assist the members\nand staff of the commission on all matters pertaining to the powers and\nresponsibilities of the commission. V. Office of Citizen Participation\n\nThe Governor, in his discretion, and contingent upon the\nreceipt of funds from private and public sources, including the Federal\ngovernment, may create within the Executive Chamber an Office of Citizen\n\nParticipation.
