  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 861.13 - Allocation of capacity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Basinwide. Where necessary to maintain stream quality objectives or\nprotect water uses in a given zone, the waste assimilative capacity of the\nreceiving waters shall be allocated by the commission among individual\ndischargers in accordance with the doctrine of equitable apportionment. (1)\n\nCommission procedure. (i) Whenever the commission determines that\nallocations of a stream's waste assimilative capacity are necessary in a zone, the executive director shall find and determine an allocation for each waste\ndischarge in that zone. (ii)\n\nSuch\ndetermination shall be governed by the\n\nCommission's Rules of Practice\nand Procedure\nrelating to review, hearing and decision of objections\nthereto. (2)\n\nAllocations\nnot a property right. Allocations are not transferable except upon consent of\nthe commission. (3)\n\nLimitations. (i) No allocation will exceed the residual\nafter treatment as required in accordance with section\n861.9\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nNo allocation will exceed the residual\nafter treatment necessary to meet any other requirements. (4)\n\nReserve. In each zone, as part of the initial allocation, and each\nsubsequent reallocation, a reserve may be set aside by the commission. (i) The reserve in each zone shall be\nutilized to accommodate new discharges or major revisions to an allocation, or\nany reallocation, when appropriate in the judgment of the commission. (ii)\n\nIndividual allocations or portions\nthereof which are no longer needed because use of the facilities to which they\nare assigned is discontinued or substantially decreased shall be returned to\nthe reserve. (iii)\n\nWhere improved\nwaste management practice results in a reduction of the load discharged to less\nthan the allocation, the unused portion of the allocation shall not revert to\nthe reserve. (5)\n\nReallocations. (i) Carbonaceous oxygen demand. (a) All allocations shall be subject to\nreview by the commission and, after such review, the commission may make such\nreallocation as it deems necessary. (b) If any factors upon which an individual\nallocation is based change significantly, application shall be made to the\nexecutive director for a revised allocation. (c) Whenever the reserve in a zone approaches\ndepletion, or when the full use of the assimilative capacity is approached, or\nwhen in the judgment of the commission, the allocations existing at that time\nare no longer equitable, the capacity in the zone, minus a reserve, will be\nreallocated among the waste dischargers in that zone. (ii)\n\nToxic Pollutants\n(a) All allocations shall be subject to\nreview by the commission and, after such review, the commission may make such\nreallocation as it deems necessary. (b) If any factors upon which an individual\nallocation is based change significantly, application shall be made to the\nexecutive director for a revised allocation. The executive director shall\nprovide notice to interested and affected parties prior to establishing the\nrevised allocation. (c) Allocations\nshall, as a minimum, be reviewed and, if required, revised every five years, or\nas directed by the commission. (6)\n\nRegionalization. Whenever two or more waste dischargers with separate\nallocations formulate a regional plan for water quality control, allocations\nmay be revised by the commission. (7)\n\nDesign streamflow. For the purpose of determining the waste assimilative\ncapacity of a stream, the following design minimum streamflows will be\nused: (i) Unregulated streams. Where\nstreams are unregulated, a minimum consecutive seven-day (average) flow with a\n10-year recurrence interval shall be the design flow. (ii)\n\nRegulated streams. Where the pattern of\nregulation is such as to result in weekly, daily, or hourly variations in flow\nsignificantly different from the natural pattern of variation, the above design\nflow may reflect the effects of these variations. (iii)\n\nLakes and reservoirs. Wherever waste\ndischarges may affect the protected uses of lakes and reservoirs, the\ncommission, after consultation with the appropriate states, will determine the\ncharacteristics upon which to base effluent quality requirements in relation to\nthe special characteristics of the receiving body of water. (iv)\n\nTidal waters. Wherever waste discharges\nmay affect the protected uses or the water quality criteria of tidal waters, the commission, after consultation with the appropriate states, will determine\nthe characteristics upon which to base effluent quality requirements in\nrelation to the special characteristics of the receiving body of\nwater. (8)\n\nDesign\neffluent flow. For the purpose of determining the waste assimilative\ncapacity of a stream and the wasteload allocations for discharges of toxic\npollutants, the following design effluent flows will be used: (i) For industrial wastewater treatment plant\ndischarges covered by Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) promulgated by the\nU.S. EPA, the effluent design flow shall be the average daily flow associated\nwith: (a) the month having the highest monthly\nproduction rate of the previous 12 months or, if greater; (b) the year having the highest annual\nproduction rate of the previous five years. (ii)\n\nIf the discharge from an industrial\nwastewater treatment plant is not covered by Effluent Limitations Guidelines\n(ELG) promulgated by the U.S. EPA, is mixed with stormwater or cooling water or\nproduction data are not available, the effluent design flow shall be the\naverage daily flow associated with: (a) the\nmonth with the highest monthly flow rate of the previous 12 months, or if\ngreater; (b) the year having the\nhighest annual flow rate of the previous five years. (iii)\n\nFor municipal wastewater treatment\nplant discharges, the effluent design flow shall be the higher of: (a) the average daily flow of the plant for\nthe previous three years including a growth factor based upon a five-year\nprojection, if available; or\n(b) the capacity of the plant that was used to establish effluent limitations for\nthe NPDES permit expressed as the annual average flow. (b) Delaware River\n\nEstuary. (1)\n\nCarbonaceous oxygen\ndemand. Pursuant to the provisions of section\n860.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, the commission determines that the 1964 carbonaceous oxygen demand of\nthe effluent load to zones 2, 3, 4 and 5 exceeded the waste assimilative\ncapacity of those zones to meet the stream quality objectives. Accordingly, the\ntotal carbonaceous oxygen demand exerted by the sum of all waste discharges to\neach of these zones shall be reduced to the following: Zone 2\n18,600 pounds per day\n\nZone 3\n144,800 pounds per day\n\nZone 4\n91,000 pounds per day\n\nZone 5\n67,600 pounds per day\n(i) Reserve. In zones 2, 3, 4 and 5, as a part of the initial allocation, and each\nsubsequent reallocation, a reserve of about 10 percent of the total permissible\nload to the zone may be set aside by the commission. (ii)\n\nAllocation to individual dischargers. (a) Within zones 2, 3, 4 and 5, the pounds of\ncarbonaceous oxygen demand prescribed above, minus the reserve, will be\nallocated among individual dischargers. (b) Allocations will be based upon the\nconcept of uniform reduction of raw waste in a zone. (c) Upon application, in special cases, for\ndilute industrial process wastewater, an allocation may be assigned consistent\nwith section\n861.9\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part. (iii)\n\nAllowable variations. (a) The number of pounds\nin the discharge permitted by the allocation will be determined by an average\nof samples taken over each period of 30 consecutive days of the year. (b) It is recognized that optimum efficiency\nmay not be achieved with certain secondary treatment facilities during the\ncolder months. A discharge exceeding the allocation may be permitted by the\ncommission when it results from reduced plant efficiency caused by temperatures\nbelow 59°F (15°C), provided that the pounds discharged by any individual\ndischarger shall not exceed its allocation by more than an average of\ntwo-thirds over any consecutive 10 days. (iv)\n\nAllocations from the reserve. Allocations from the reserve will be made upon the same principles as provided\nin subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, based upon the concept of uniform raw\nwaste reduction in a zone at the time the allocation is made. (v) Reallocations. Reallocations will be made\nupon the same principles as provided by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, provided that where the waste reduction by any discharger results in lower\npoundage input than it has been allocated such poundage differential will not\nbe returned to the reserve in the absence of conditions requiring a\nreallocation for the zone. (vi)\n\nTidal tributaries. (a) Wastes discharged to\nthe portions of tributaries of the Delaware River Estuary affected by tidal\naction are included in the total permissible load in each zone, and poundage\nallocations will be assigned to these dischargers on the same basis as\neffluents discharged directly to the estuary. (b) However, additional requirements may be\nimposed if any one or group of waste dischargers complying with estuary load\nallocations exceeds the waste assimilative capacity of the tidal\ntributary. (2)\n\nToxic pollutants. Pursuant to section\n860.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle and section\n861.13\n(a) of this\n\nPart, the commission shall establish wasteload allocations and other effluent\nrequirements that may be necessary to meet the stream quality objectives for\ntoxic pollutants contained in section\n860.26\n-860.31 of this\n\nTitle. (i) Reserve. A reserve\nallocation of five percent of the total maximum daily load (TMDL) shall be\nestablished as a part of an allocation or reallocation, by increasing the\neffluent design flow by five percent. (ii)\n\nMargin of safety. As part of an\nallocation or reallocation, a proportion of the total maximum daily load shall\nbe established as a margin of safety. The proportion established shall reflect\nthe degree of uncertainty in the data and resulting water quality-based\ncontrols. (iii)\n\nAllocation to\ndischarges. (a) Wasteload allocations shall be\nestablished for Phase 1 continuous point source discharges to address acute\naquatic life protection, chronic aquatic life protection and both carcinogenic\nand systemic toxicants. (1)\n\nThe water quality\nobjective for the establishment of any allocation or reallocation shall be the\nstream quality objectives contained in section\n860.26\n-860.31 of this Title. If\nthe background concentration of a toxic pollutant at the appropriate criteria\nduration exceeds the stream quality objective as a result of loadings from\nsources not subject to control, then the water quality objective shall be the\nbackground concentration of the pollutant. (2)\n\nThe minimum flows for aquatic life\nprotection and to protect the taste and odor of ingested water and fish are\nbased on a minimum consecutive 7-day flow with a 10-year recurrence interval\nfor all tributaries; and for the Delaware River, a flow of 2500 cfs at Trenton. For the protection of human health, the harmonic mean flow shall be used for\ncarcinogens, and the minimum consecutive 30-day flow with a 5-year recurrence\ninterval shall be used for systemic toxicants. (b) Allocations shall be determined by the\nexecutive director using the procedure described in clause (\nd\n)\nof this subparagraph or alternative procedures that are consistent with the\ndoctrine of equitable apportionment, and achieve the following: (1)\nassure compliance with applicable stream\nquality objectives; (2)\nprovide\nmaximum equity among competing discharges; and\n(3)\nminimize the overall cost of\ncompliance. (c) The\nloadings of toxic pollutants identified in this subparagraph shall be allocated\namong individual phase 1 continuous point source discharges which meet any of\nthe following criteria: (1)\nthe discharge has\nan existing permit limit for the parameter; (2)\neffluent data indicates the presence of\nthe parameter; or\n(3)\nthe\nreasonable potential exists for the parameter to occur in the\ndischarge. (d) Allocations for phase 1 continuous point source discharges will be based upon\nthe equal marginal percent reduction procedure which has been determined to be\nconsistent with the requirements of clause (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph. This procedure requires all dischargers, whether they are part of\na multiple discharge wasteload allocation scenario or not, to provide treatment\nof their wastewater to achieve the applicable water quality standard; and in\naddition, requires some dischargers to provide additional treatment due to the\ncumulative impact of all discharges. (1)\n\nAlternative wasteload allocation procedures may be considered by the Commission\nif they provide timely compliance with clause (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph and include the consent of all dischargers affected by the\nalternative procedure. (2)\n\nDischarges meeting any of the requirements of clause (\nc\n) of\nthis subparagraph will be assigned an initial loading based upon the following\ninformation in order of preference: (i) the\naverage monthly limit obtained from effluent guideline limitations promulgated\nby the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for the point source category\napplicable to the discharge; (ii)\nany average monthly limitation for the parameter in the current discharge\npermit; (iii)\nmonitoring data of\nsufficient quantity and quality, as determined by the executive director, to\ncharacterize the concentration of the parameter in the discharge; or\n(iv)\nminimum performance standards\nestablished by the executive director for industrial and municipal wastewater\ntreatment plants discharging to the tidal Delaware River. In assigning the initial loading, the average loading at\nthe appropriate criteria duration will be calculated using the coefficient of\nvariation (CV) calculated from monitoring data or a default value of 0.6 in the\nabsence of data of sufficient quantity and quality, as determined by the\nexecutive director. (3)\n\nDischarges contributing to an exceedance\nof a stream quality objective due to the cumulative effect of all discharges\nmay not be required to provide additional treatment or loading reduction if the\ndischarge does not represent a significant proportion of the marginal\nloading. (e) Allocations\nestablished by the executive director and reallocations required under clause\n(a)(5)(ii)(\nb\n) of this section shall be published in a document\ncontaining the specific procedures, tools and assumptions used to derive the\nallocations. (f) Wasteload\nallocations established under subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph shall be\nreferred to the appropriate agency of the signatory parties, respectively, for\nuse, as appropriate, in developing effluent limitations, schedules of\ncompliance, and other requirements in permits. (iv)\n\nAdjustment for pollutants in intake\nwater. Wasteload allocations established for an industrial discharge may be\nadjusted by the executive director, in consultation with the appropriate agency\nof the signatory parties, to account for pollutants present in water withdrawn\nfor use by the facility from the receiving water provided that the following\nconditions are met: (a) in the absence of\npollutants in the water withdrawn, there would be no exceedance of the stream\nquality objectives for toxic pollutants; (b) pollutants in the discharge resulting\nfrom any other activity, operation or materials used or produced at the\nfacility do not significantly contribute to an exceedance of the stream quality\nobjectives for toxic pollutants contained in sections\n860.26\n-860.31 of this\n\nTitle; (c) no statistically\nsignificant difference can be detected between the intake and effluent\nconcentrations and loadings of a toxic pollutant based upon a rigorous analysis\nof data representative of operating and ambient conditions at the facility; and\n(d) no practicable alternative\nsource of intake water is available. (c) Definitions. (1)\n\nWasteload allocation. The portion of the total maximum daily load of a body of water or section\nthereof that is allocated to an existing or future point source of pollution. Or, any limitation on the loading and/or concentration of a pollutant\ndischarged from a point source required to ensure that stream quality\nobjectives are not exceeded.
