(b) During normal hydrologic conditions, the\ncity shall, in addition to the releases required by subdivision (a) of this\nsection, make the releases specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision in conformance with a request by the department as provided in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nWhen\nthe department determines that releases in addition to those required under the\nother provisions of this section are required in a river flowing below the\n\nCannonsville, Pepacton or Neversink reservoir during the period of May 1 to\n\nOctober 31, inclusive, in order to adequately protect the fishery or other\nnatural resources in the designated downstream areas of such river during\nthermal stress periods, the city shall make releases from each such reservoir\nas are directed by the department pursuant to paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. Provided, no release shall be required under this paragraph from\n\nCannonsville, Papacton and Neversink reservoirs which exceeds an accumulated\ntotal volume of 6000 cfs days (3878 million gallons) released collectively from\nsaid reservoirs pursuant to this paragraph between May 1 and October 31, inclusive. Releases under this paragraph shall be directed by the department in\na manner so as to prevent to the maximum extent possible any instant water\ntemperature higher than 75 degrees Fahrenheit or any daily average water\ntemperature higher than 72 degrees Fahrenheit in the designated downstream\nareas as determined from measurements at the Callicoon, Harvard, Woodbourne and\n\nHale Eddy gaging stations. In order to allow travel time for water released\nfrom a reservoir to reach the applicable gaging station, the department may\ndirect releases under this paragraph 24 hours prior to the anticipated\noccurrence of a temperature higher than the 75-degree and 72-degree\nparameters. (2)\n\nWhenever the\n\nCannonsville, Pepacton or Neversink reservoir is spilling, the city shall, in\norder to improve fishery habitat in the river flowing below such reservoir, release water from such reservoir up to a maximum amount which equals the\namount of water which would otherwise be spilling from such reservoir, or the\ncapacity of the valves, whichever is lesser.
