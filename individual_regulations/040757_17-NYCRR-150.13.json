  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 150.13 - On-premises sign criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nprovisions of this section are intended to establish the criteria for\ndetermining whether a sign is an on-premises sign for the purpose of the\noutdoor advertising control statutes. An on-premises sign is permitted to exist\nand is not regulated under the provisions of section\n88\nof the Highway\n\nLaw, as amended. However, an on-premises sign is subject to regulation in\ncertain locations under section\n86\nof the Highway\n\nLaw and as set forth in subdivision (c) of this section\n(b) A sign will be considered to be an\non-premises sign if it meets the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe sign must be located on the same\npremises as the activity or property advertised. (2)\n\nThe sign must have as its purpose the\nidentification of the activity or its products or services, or the sale or\nlease of the property on which the sign is located, rather than the purpose of\ngeneral advertising. (3)\n\nIn order\nto be classified as an on-premises sign, such sign must meet the following\npremises test: (i) The premises on which an\nactivity is conducted is determined by physical facts rather than property\nlines. Generally, it is defined as the land occupied by the buildings or other\nphysical uses that are necessary or customarily incident to the activity, including such open spaces as are arranged and designed to be used in\nconnection with such buildings or uses. (ii)\n\nThe following will not be considered to\nbe a part of the premises on which the activity is conducted, and any signs\nlocated on such land will be considered \"off-premises\" advertising: (a) Any land which is not used as an integral\npart of the principal activity. This would include, but is not limited to, land\nwhich is separated from the activity by a roadway, highway or other\nobstruction, and not used by the activity, and extensive undeveloped highway\nfrontage contiguous to the land actually used by a commercial facility, even\nthough it might be under the same ownership. (b) Any land which is used for, or devoted\nto, a separate purpose unrelated to the advertised activity. For example, land\nadjacent to or adjoining a service station, but devoted to raising of crops, residence or farmstead uses or other commercial or industrial uses having no\nrelationship to the service station activity, would not be part of the premises\nof the service station, even though under the same ownership. (c) Any land which is at some distance from\nthe principal activity; and in closer proximity to the highway than the\nprincipal activity; and developed or used only in the area of the sign site, or\nbetween the sign site and the principal activity; and occupied solely by\nstructures or uses which are only incidental to the principal activity, and\nwhich serve no reasonable or integrated purpose related to the activity other\nthan to attempt to qualify the land for signing purposes. Generally, these will\nbe inexpensive facilities, such as picnic, playground or camping areas, dog\nkennels, golf driving ranges, skeet ranges, common or private roadways or\neasements, walking paths, fences, and sign maintenance sheds. (iii)\n\nWhere the sign site is\nlocated at or near the end of a narrow strip contiguous to the advertised\nactivity, the sign site shall not be considered part of the premises on which\nthe activity being advertised is conducted. A narrow strip shall include any\nconfiguration of land which is such that it cannot be put to any reasonable use\nrelated to the activity other than for signing purposes. In no event shall a\nsign site be considered part of the premises on which the advertised activity\nis conducted if it is located upon a narrow strip of land: (a) which is nonbuildable land, such as too\nnarrow of a strip or a swampland, marshland or other wetland; or\n(b) which is a common or private roadway; or\n(c) held by easement or other\nlesser interest than the premises where the advertised activity is\nlocated. (4)\n\nIn order to be classified as an on-premises sign, such sign must meet the\nfollowing purpose test: (i) Such sign must\nhave as its purpose the identification of the activity located on the premises, or its products or services, or the sale or lease of the property on which the\nsign is located, rather than the business of outdoor advertising. (ii)\n\nAny sign which consists solely of the\nname of the establishment is an on-premises sign. (iii)\nA sign which identifies the\nestablishment's principal or accessory products or services offered on the\npremises is an on-premises sign. An example of an accessory product would be a\nbrand of tires offered for sale at a service station. (iv)\n\nWhen a sign (a) brings rental income to\nthe property owner, (b) consists principally of brand name or trade name\nadvertising, and (c) the product or service advertised is only incidental to\nthe principal activity, it shall be considered the business of outdoor\nadvertising and not an on-premises sign. An example would be a typical\nbillboard located on top of a service station building advertising a brand of\ncigarettes or chewing gum which is incidentally sold in a vending machine on\nthe property. (v) A sign which\nadvertises activities conducted on the premises, but which also advertises, in\na prominent manner, activities not conducted on the premises, is not an\non-premises sign. An example would be a sign advertising a motel or restaurant\nnot located on the premises with a notation or attachment stating \"Skeet Range\n\nHere\" or \"Dog Kennels Here\". The on-premises activity would only be the skeet\nrange or the dog kennels. (vi)\nA\nsale or lease sign which also advertises any product or service not located\nupon, and unrelated to, the business of selling or leasing the land on which\nthe sign is located is not an on-premises sign. An example would be a typical\nbillboard which states \"This Property for Sale--Apply Smith's Motel; 500 Rooms, Air-Conditioned, Turn Right 3 Blocks at Main Street\". (c) Under section\n86\nof the Highway\n\nLaw, on-premises signs located within a protected area must also meet the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\n\nIf the sign is\nlocated more than 50 feet from the advertised activity, such sign shall be\nregistered in accordance with section\n150.15\nof this Part, notwithstanding the provision of that section exempting on-premises signs from\nregistration. Such sign shall not exceed 20 feet in length, width or height, or\n150 square feet in total area, including border and trim but excluding\nsupports. Not more than one such sign advertising the sale or lease of the same\nproperty may be permitted in such a manner as to be visible to traffic\nproceeding in any one direction on any interstate highway. Not more than one\nsuch sign, visible to traffic proceeding in any one direction on any interstate\nhighway and advertising activities being conducted upon the real property where\nthe sign is located, shall be permitted more than 50 feet from the advertised\nactivity. For the purposes of this section, the 50-foot distance shall be\nmeasured as follows: (i) When the advertised\nactivity is a business, commercial or industrial land use, the distance shall\nbe measured from the regularly used buildings, parking lots, storage or\nprocessing area, or other structures which are essential and customary to the\nconduct of the business. Such distance shall not be measured from driveways, fences or similar appurtenances. (ii)\n\nWhen the advertising activity is a\nnoncommercial or nonindustrial land use, such as a residence, farm or orchard, the distance shall be measured from the major structures on the\nproperty. (2)\n\nExcept for\nsigns which are closer than 50 feet distant from the advertised activity, no\nsuch sign shall be permitted which: (i) contains, includes, or is illuminated by, any flashing, intermittent or moving\nlight or lights; (ii)\nis lighted so\nas to impair the vision of the driver of any motor vehicle; (iii)\nmoves or has any animated or moving\nparts.
