  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 535.1 - Statement of purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following rules are adopted in compliance with\nsection\n6450\nof the\n\nEducation Law and shall be filed with the Commissioner of Education and the\n\nBoard of Regents on or before July 20, 1969, as required by that section. Said\nrules shall be subject to amendment or revision and any amendments or revisions\nthereof shall be filed with the Commissioner of Education and Board of Regents\nwithin 10 days after adoption. Nothing herein is intended, nor shall it be\nconstrued, to limit or restrict the freedom of speech or peaceful assembly. Free inquiry and free expression are indispensable to the objectives of a\nhigher educational institution. Similarly, experience has demonstrated that the\ntraditional autonomy of the educational institution (and the accompanying\ninstitutional responsibility for the maintenance or order) is best suited to\nachieve these objectives. These rules shall not be construed to prevent or\nlimit communication between and among faculty, students and administration, or\nto relieve the institution of its special responsibility for self-regulation in\nthe preservation of public order. Their purpose is not to prevent or restrain\ncontroversy and dissent but to prevent abuse of the rights of others and to\nmaintain that public order appropriate to a college or university campus\nwithout which there can be no intellectual freedom and they shall be\ninterpreted and applied to that end. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n535.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
