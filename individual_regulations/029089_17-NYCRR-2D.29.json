  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2D.29 - Route Sign Assemblies\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Guidance: 05A When a highway carries two or more routes, the route\nsign combinations in the assemblies should be arranged to present a symmetrical\nand balanced appearance to enable motorists to readily identify the route they\ndesire to follow. Each combination should stand out as a separate unit. 05B Route sign combinations in Junction, Advance Route\n\nTurn, and Directional assemblies should preferably be mounted side by side\nrather than one above the other. However, there should generally be no more\nthan three route sign combinations in the same horizontal row. Confirming and\n\nReassurance assemblies should preferably display route sign combinations one\nabove the other rather than side by side. Option: 08A Junction, Advance Route Turn and Directional assemblies\nmay be installed overhead on the approaches to intersections (see Section 2A.17\n). Support: 09A Figure 2D-101 shows typical types of Route Sign\nassemblies. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2D.29\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
