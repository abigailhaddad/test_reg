Procedures and standards are the same as for bagged\nseed.

(c) If the bin or bins are\nportable, such as pallet boxes, the lot number may be for the boxes in the sale\nup to the total amount described in the lot and may be covered by one bulk sale\ncertificate per sale. (d) Bulk\nhandled seed, in addition to being properly identified by stencil label, or\ntag, when sold, must be accompanied by a bulk sale certification in lieu of an\nofficial tag. Such certificate shall be issued by the certifying agency on\ncompletion of all requirements for certification. Such sale is restricted to\nthat of sale by producer grower to grower. (e) If certification is not completed by the\nproducer grower and such seed is sold in bulk to another producer grower, a\nbulk transfer certificate may be issued to the seller and a copy to accompany\nthe shipment to the buyer with the producer's field inspection\nreport. (f) If bulk-handled seed\nmeeting all conditions for certification is sold to anyone other than a grower, such seed, when sold, shall be accompanied by a bulk transfer certificate.
