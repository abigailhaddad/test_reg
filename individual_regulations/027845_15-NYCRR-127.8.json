  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 127.8 - Failure to appear; waiver\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept as provided in section\n127.9\nof this Part, in any case\nwhere no adjournment is requested or, if requested, is not granted, the\nrespondent's failure to appear shall be deemed to be a waiver of hearing. Any\nperson who is deemed to have waived a hearing under these circumstances may\nrequest a rehearing within a reasonable time, which shall, if such request is\ngranted, be held as soon as is practicable. However, any action taken at the\noriginal hearing, or in effect at that time, may be continued pending such\nrescheduled hearing. No rehearing will be scheduled as a substitute for an\nappeal pursuant to section\n127.12\nof this Part. Upon a\nrespondent's failure to appear, the referee may receive the testimony of\navailable witnesses and enter evidence into the record. A respondent who has\nwaived a hearing by failing to appear may be suspended pending attendance at an\nadjourned hearing or a final determination; provided, however, when a\nrespondent is suspended pending hearing pursuant to section\n398-f\n(1)(b)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, such\nsuspension shall be terminated upon the respondent's attendance at such\nhearing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n127.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
