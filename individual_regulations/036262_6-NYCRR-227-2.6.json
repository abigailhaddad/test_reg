  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-2.6 - Testing, monitoring, and reporting requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For emission\nsources that do not utilize a CEM for compliance monitoring, compliance with\nthe emission limits of section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart must be\ndetermined with a one-hour average except for simple cycle combustion turbines\nutilized during the non-ozone season. Simple cycle combustion turbines utilized\nduring the non-ozone season may use a 30-day average to determine compliance\nwith the emission limits of section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart. The owner\nor operator of each emission source must verify NO\nx\nemissions by performing the applicable testing or monitoring procedure detailed\nbelow: (1)\n\nFor any very large boiler, NO\nx\nemissions must be measured with a CEMS as described\nin subdivision (b) of this section or with an equivalent monitoring system\napproved by the department. (2)\n\nFor\nany large boiler, NO\nx\nemissions must be: (i) measured in accordance with emission test\nrequirements described in subdivision (c) of this section; or\n(ii)\nmonitored with a CEMS as described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section or with an equivalent monitoring system\napproved by the department. (3)\n\nFor any mid-size boiler, NO\nx\nemissions must be: (i) measured in accordance with the emission\ntest requirements described in subdivision (c) of this section; or\n(ii)\nmonitored with a CEMS as described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section or with an equivalent monitoring system\napproved by the department. (4)\n\nFor any combined cycle combustion turbine\nhaving a maximum heat input rate greater than 250 million Btu per hour, NO\nx\nemissions must be measured with a CEMS as described\nin subdivision (b) of this section. (5)\n\nFor any simple cycle, regenerative\ncombustion turbine and any combined cycle combustion turbine having a maximum\nheat input rate of 250 million Btu per hour or less, NO\nx\nemissions must be: (i) measured in accordance\nwith the emission test requirements described in subdivision (c) of this\nsection; or\n(ii)\nmonitored with a\nCEMS as described in subdivision (b) of this section or with an equivalent\nmonitoring system approved by the department. (6)\n\nFor any stationary internal combustion\nengine, NO\nx\nemissions must be: (i) measured in accordance with the emission\ntest requirements as described in subdivision (c) of this section; or\n(ii)\nmonitored with a CEMS as described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section or with an equivalent monitoring system\napproved by the department. (7)\n\nFor any emission source subject to\nsection\n227-2.4\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart, NO\nx\nemissions must be measured pursuant to a\ntesting, monitoring, and reporting protocol that the department has determined\nis consistent with the applicable requirements for emission sources regulated\nunder this Subpart that have comparable heat input ratings. (b) CEMS requirements. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of an emission\nsource that monitors NO\nx\nemissions with a CEMS or\nequivalent monitoring system must submit for department approval: (i) a CEMS plan as part of its application\nfor a permit; (ii)\nat least 180\ndays prior to equipment installation. The department will notify the owner or\noperator of the acceptability of the plan, at least 60 days prior to equipment\ninstallation if it is not covered under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or\n(iii)\na proposed plan for a\nmonitoring system that is equivalent to a CEMS. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of an emission\nsource that monitors NO\nx\nemissions with a CEMS must\nsubmit for department approval a CEMS certification protocol at least 60 days\nprior to compliance testing. The certification protocol must include the\nlocation of and specifications for each instrument or device, as well as\nprocedures for calibration, operation, data evaluation, and data\nreporting. (3)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of an emission source that monitors NO\nx\nemissions with a CEMS must install, calibrate, maintain, and operate a CEMS for\nmeasuring NO\nx\nat locations approved in the CEMS\ncertification protocol under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and must record\nthe output of each such system. The following procedures and test methods must\nbe used for determining compliance with the relevant NO\nx\nemission limit under section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart: (i) With the exception of emission sources\nsubject to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, the owner or operator of an\nemission source must: (a) calculate all\n24-hour daily heat input-weighted average NO\nx\nemission\nrates from block hourly arithmetic emission rate averages calculated by the\nCEMS and expressed in terms of pounds of NO\nx\nper million\n\nBtu; (b) demonstrate compliance\nwith the appropriate emission limit under section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart by using a\nCEMS for measuring NO\nx\nand calculating a 24-hour daily\nheat input-weighted average NO\nx\nemission rate. Facilities that are subject to 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) will calculate\ntheir NO\nx\nemission rate using part 75 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) monitoring\nrequirements. Facilities that are not subject to 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) may calculate\ntheir NO\nx\nemission rate using either 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A, method 19 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) or 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). A 30-day\nrolling heat input-weighted average emission rate may be used to demonstrate\ncompliance with the appropriate emission limit under section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart from\n\nOctober 1st to April 30th for emission sources other than combustion turbines; and\n(c) determine the 24-hour daily\nheat input-weighted average NO\nx\nemission rate based on\nthe heat input-weighted average of the block hourly arithmetic average emission\nrates during each 24-hour daily period from 12:00 AM to 12:00 AM the following\nday using CEMS data. The block hourly heat input-weighted average emission rate\nmust be calculated for each one-hour period starting with the period 12:00 AM\nto 1:00 AM and continuing through until the last period 11:00 PM to 12:00 AM; or, starting with the period 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and continuing through the\nlast period 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM. The 30-day rolling heat input-weighted\naverage must be the average of the 24-hour daily heat input-weighted\nNO\nx\nemission rate. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator of an emission\nsource subject to paragraph (a)(4) of this section must calculate: (a) block hourly arithmetic average emission\nrates using data points generated by CEMS and expressed in terms of parts per\nmillion on a dry volume basis, corrected to 15 percent oxygen; and\n(b) block hourly arithmetic average emission\nrates for the periods starting 12:00 AM to 1:00 AM, 1:00 AM to 2:00 AM, and so\non. (iii)\n\nAt a minimum, valid CEMS data must be obtained for 90 percent of the operating hours in each\ncalendar quarter that the subject facility is operating. (iv)\n\nAll valid CEMS data must be used in\ncalculating emission rates even if the minimum data requirements of\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph are not met. (v) The procedures under 40 CFR part\n60, appendix B, Performance Specification 2 (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); and any\nadditional criteria specified by the department must be followed for the\ninstallation, evaluation, and operation of the CEMS. (vi)\n\nAlong with any specific additional data\nrequirements mandated by the department for an emission source, annual\nrecertifications, quarterly accuracy, and daily calibration drift tests must be\nperformed in accordance with either 40 CFR part\n60, appendix F (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) or 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), as\napplicable. (vii)\n\nWhen\nNO\nx\nemissions data are not obtained because of CEMS\ndowntime, emission data shall be obtained by using the 90th percentile value of\nall CEMS NO\nx\nemission data collected over the last 180\ndays. Alternatively, the owner or operator of a facility subject to part 75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) may use 40 CFR\npart\n75\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) data\nsubstitution procedures for periods when no valid CEMS data is\navailable. (4)\nCEMS\nrecordkeeping and reporting requirements. (i) The owner or operator of an emission source must notify the department of the\nplanned initial start-up date of any new CEMS. (ii)\n\nProtocols, reports, summaries, schedules, and any other information required to be submitted to the department\nunder provisions of this Subpart must be sent (in either hardcopy or\nelectronically) as follows: (a) one copy to\nthe Division of Air Resources, New York State Department of Environmental\n\nConservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233; and\n(b) one copy to the regional air pollution\ncontrol engineer at the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment. (iii)\n\nEmissions, monitoring, and operating parameter records or measurements required\nby this Subpart, quarterly and annual summaries, and any additional parameters\nrequired by the department must be maintained for at least five years and made\navailable to the department upon request. (iv)\n\nFollowing each calendar quarter, the\nowner or operator must tabulate and summarize applicable emissions, monitoring, and operating parameter measurements recorded during the preceding three months\n(including but not limited to type and amount of fuel burned on a daily basis, heat content of the fuel, total heating value of the fuel consumed on a daily\nbasis, the actual NO\nx\nemission rate, the allowable\nNO\nx\nemission rate, and the summation of the emission\nsources included in a system averaging plan). These records must be submitted\nto the department within 30 days following the end of each calendar quarter in\na format acceptable to the department and must include: (a) the average NO\nx\nemission rates as specified under paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (With the\nexception of emission sources subject to paragraph (a)(4) of this section, emission sources are to record and tabulate block hourly average emission\nrates, but do not need to included the block hourly average emission rates in\nthe quarterly summaries); (b) identification of the operating hours when NO\nx\nemissions\ndata are not included in the calculation of the average emission rate and the\nreasons for not including that data; and\n(c) the results of accuracy assessments as\nrequired by 40 CFR part\n60, appendix F (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) and any\nadditional data quality information required by the\ndepartment. (v) The owner\nor operator of an emission source must submit the initial compliance test data, the performance evaluation of the CEMS found in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix B (see\n\nTable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), and the\nmaximum heat input capacity. (c) Emission test requirements. The owner or operator of an emission source required to\nconduct an emission test under subdivision (a) of this section must: (1)\nsubmit a compliance test protocol to the\ndepartment for approval at least 30 days prior to emission testing. The\nconditions of the testing and the locations of the sampling devices must be\nacceptable to the department; and\n(2)\nfollow the procedures set forth in Part\n202 of this Title and use the following procedures set forth in 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), or any other\nmethod acceptable to the department and the administrator for determining\ncompliance with the appropriate NO\nx\nlimit in section\n227-2.4\nof this Subpart: (i) for large and mid-size boilers, use\nmethod 7, 7E, or 19 from 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); (ii)\nfor simple cycle combustion turbines or\nregenerative combustion turbines, use method 20 from 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); (iii)\nfor combined cycle combustion turbines, use method 7, 7E, 19 or 20 from 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title); (iv)\nfor stationary internal combustion\nengines, use method 7, 7E, or 19 from 40 CFR part\n60, appendix A (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this\n\nTitle); (3)\nsubmit a\ncompliance test report containing the results of the emission test to the\ndepartment for approval no later than 60 days after completion of the emission\ntest.
