  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.3 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following examples illustrate the application of the\nrules and limitations as set forth in section 208(9)(f) and section 1453(k-1)\nand Subpart 3-8 of this Part, as such provisions were in effect on December 31, 2014, as well as the application of the rules and limitations in section\n3-8.2\nof this Subpart, in\ncomputing the eligible Federal and New York State (NYS) NOL carryover amounts\nand the amount of the UNOL for a corporation or combined group. Numbers in the\nexamples have been rounded. To the extent the examples reference an \"as if\"\nFederal NOL, it either means that the corporation was included in a Federal\nconsolidated return and, in order to compute its UNOL, computes its income and\nloss amounts \"as if\" it filed separately for Federal purposes or the\ncomposition of the Federal consolidated return and the New York combined group\nare different and in order to compute the UNOL of the combined group, the group\ncomputes its income and loss amounts \"as if\" the New York combined group was\nthe Federal consolidated group. Example 1: ABC Company, a calendar-year taxpayer, began business in\n2009 and became taxable in NYS in 2011. ABC Company's base year is calendar\nyear 2014. ABC Company had Federal/NYS income and losses, and applied its NOLs\nfor tax years beginning before 1/1/2015, as follows: ABC Company\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\nEligible NOL carryover amount 12/31/2014\n\"As if\" Federal\n\nFederal Taxable Income (FTI)\n($1,500)\n($800)\n($500)\n($400)\n$300\n$600\nNOL Carried Forward from 2009 to 2013\n$300\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n($300)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2009 to 2014\n$600\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n($600)\n\nBalance\n($600)\n($800)\n($500)\n($400)\n$0\n$0\n($900)\nNY\nEntire Net income (ENI)\n($600)\n($500)\n$250\n$400\n\nBalance\n($600)\n($500)\n$250\n$400\n($1,100)\n\nComputation of ABC Company's eligible NOL carryover\namounts and UNOL. A Federal NOL sustained in a tax year that ABC Company\nwas not subject to tax in New York State (i.e. the NOLs incurred in 2009 and\n2010) cannot be included in ABC Company's eligible Federal NOL carryover\namount. Therefore, ABC Company's eligible Federal NOL carryover amount is\n($900). ABC Company's eligible NYS NOL carryover amount is ($1,100). ABC\nCompany's UNOL is ($900), which is the lesser of its eligible Federal NOL\ncarryover amount and its eligible NYS NOL carryover amount. Example 2: XYZ Company, a calendar-year NYS taxpayer, began business\nin 2009 and became taxable in NYS in 2009. XYZ Company's base year is calendar\nyear 2014. XYZ Company had Federal/NYS income and losses, and applied its NOLs\nfor tax years beginning before 1/1/2015, as follows: XYZ Company\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\nEligible NOL carryover amount 12/31/2014\n\"As if\" Federal\nFTI\n($1,000)\n($1,200)\n$600\n($400)\n$300\n($700)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2009 to 2011\n$600\n------------>\n($600)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2009 to 2013\n$300\n------------>\n------------>\n------------>\n($300)\n\nBalance\n($100)\n($1,200)\n$0\n($400)\n$0\n($700)\n($2,300)\nNY\nENI\n$200\n($1,000)\n($300)\n($100)\n$400\n($500)\n\nBalance\n$200\n($1,000)\n($300)\n($100)\n$400\n($500)\n($1,600)\n\nComputation of XYZ Company's eligible NOL carryover\namounts and UNOL. XYZ Company's Federal and NYS NOLs available for\ncarryover are only included in the eligible Federal and NYS NOL carryover\namount, respectively, when there is both a Federal and New York State NOL\nsustained in the same taxable year and available for carryover as of the last\nday of the corporation's base year. Thus, only the Federal NOLs sustained in\n2010, 2012, and 2014 and available for carryover as of the last day of its base\nyear are included in the eligible Federal NOL carryover amount. The Federal NOL\nsustained in 2009 is not included in the eligible Federal NOL carryover amount\nas there was no corresponding NYS NOL sustained in that year and available for\ncarryover. The NYS NOL sustained in 2011 is not included in the eligible NYS\nNOL carryover amount as there was no corresponding Federal NOL sustained in\nthat year and available for carryover. ABC Company's UNOL is ($1,600), which is\nthe lesser of its eligible Federal NOL carryover amount and its eligible NYS\nNOL carryover amount. Example 3: Corporations L, M, N, and O are calendar-year taxpayers\nthat began doing business in 2011 and properly filed as members of a combined\ngroup in NYS for 2011 through 2014. The combined group's base year is calendar\nyear 2014. The combined group had Federal/NYS losses for tax years beginning\nbefore 1/1/2015, as follows: Federal\n2011 FTI\n2012 FTI\n2013 FTI\n2014 FTI\nFederal \"as if\" group's eligible NOL carryover\namount 12/31/2014\nL\n($400)\n$100\n($200)\n($920)\nM\n$980\n($3,000)\n($500)\n($2,300)\nN\n($600)\n$1,900\n($1,400)\n$140\nO\n($900)\n($1,100)\n$700\n($1,500)\n\nTotals\n($920)\n($2,100)\n($1,400)\n($4,580)\n($9,000)\nNYS Combined Group\n2011 ENI\n2012 ENI\n2013 ENI\n2014 ENI\nCombined group's eligible NYS NOL carryover\namount 12/31/2014\nL\n($500)\n$500\n($300)\n($750)\nM\n$850\n($2,000)\n($600)\n($2,000)\nN\n($600)\n$2,000\n($1,500)\n$250\nO\n($1,000)\n($1,000)\n$500\n($1,000)\n\nTotals\n($1,250)\n($500)\n($1,900)\n($3,500)\n($7,150)\n\nComputation of base year combined group's eligible NOL\ncarryover amounts and UNOL and Corporation L's, M's, N's and O's UNOL. The base year combined group's Federal and NYS NOLs\nsustained in 2011 through 2014 and available for carryover as of the last day\nof its base year are included in its eligible Federal and NYS NOL carryover\namount, respectively, since there were both Federal and NYS NOLs sustained in\neach of these taxable years and available for carryover as of the last day of\nits base year. The resulting base year combined group's eligible Federal NOL\ncarryover amount is ($9,000) and its eligible NYS NOL carryover amount is\n($7,150). The base year combined group's UNOL is ($7,150), which is the lesser\nof its eligible Federal NOL carryover amount and its eligible NYS NOL carryover\namount. Each member of the base year combined group must then compute its own\nUNOL, by multiplying the base year combined group's UNOL amount of ($7,150) by\na percentage that represents each member's contribution of losses to the\ncombined group's UNOL and as illustrated below: NYS Combined Group\n2011 ENI\n2012 ENI\n2013 ENI\n2014 ENI\nLosses by Member\n\nMember's losses as a % of total losses of all\nmembers with losses\n\nMember's UNOL\nL\n($500)\n$500\n($300)\n($750)\n($1,550)\n13.77%\n($984)\nM\n$850\n($2,000)\n($600)\n($2,000)\n($4,600)\n40.89%\n($2,924)\nN\n($600)\n$2,000\n($1,500)\n$250\n($2,100)\n18.67%\n($1,335)\nO\n($1,000)\n($1,000)\n$500\n($1,000)\n($3,000)\n26.67%\n($1,907)\n\nTotals\n($1,250)\n($500)\n($1,900)\n($3,500)\n($11,250)\n100.00%\n($7,150)\n\nExample 4: Corporations E and F are calendar-year taxpayers that\nbegan doing business in 2011 and properly filed as members of a combined group\nin NYS for 2011 through 2014. The combined group's base year is calendar year\n2014. The combined group had Federal/NYS income and losses, and applied its\nNOLs for tax years beginning before 1/1/2015, as follows: Combined Group: 2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\nEligible NOL carryover amount 12/31/2014\n\"As if\" Federal\nFTI\nCombined Group: Corporation E\n($10,000)\n($7,000)\n$2,000\n$3,000\n\nCorporation F\n($6,000)\n$650\n$150\n$1,000\n\nTotal for Federal \"as if\" group\n($16,000)\n($6,350)\n$2,150\n$4,000\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2013\n$2,150\n-------------->\n($2,150)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2014\n$4,000\n-------------->\n-------------->\n($4,000)\n\nBalance\n($9,850)\n($6,350)\n$0\n$0\n($16,200)\nNY\nENI\nCombined Group: Corporation E\n($11,000)\n($7,700)\n$2,500\n$4,000\n\nCorporation F\n($4,000)\n$100\n($200)\n$800\n\nTotal for combined group\n($15,000)\n($7,600)\n$2,300\n$4,800\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2013\n$2,150\n-------------->\n($2,150)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2014\n$4,000\n-------------->\n-------------->\n($4,000)\n\nBalance\n($8,850)\n($7,600)\n$150\n$800\n($16,450)\n\nComputation of the base year combined group's eligible\nNOL carryover amounts and UNOL and Corporation E's and F's UNOL. The NYS NOLs\ncarried forward from 2011 and deductible in 2013 and 2014 are limited to the\namount of the \"as if\" Federal NOLs carried forward from 2011 to those years. Therefore, the Federal deduction limitation would limit the group's NYS NOL\ndeduction in 2013 and 2014 to $2,150 and $4,000 respectively. The base year\ncombined group's Federal and NYS NOLs sustained in 2011 and 2012 and available\nfor carryover as of the last day of its base year are included in its eligible\n\nFederal and NYS NOL carryover amount, respectively, since there were both\n\nFederal and NY State NOLs sustained in each of these taxable years and\navailable for carryover as of the last day of the combined group's base year. The base year combined group's UNOL is ($16,200), which is the lesser of its\neligible Federal NOL carryover amount and its eligible NYS NOL carryover\namount. Each member of the base year combined group must then compute its own\nUNOL, by multiplying the base year combined group's UNOL amount of ($16,200) by\na percentage that represents each member's contribution of losses to the\ncombined group's UNOL and as illustrated below. Since 2013 is a net income year\nfor the combined group, Corporation F's loss of ($200) in 2013 is not included\nin the losses by member amounts below.

In 2012, Corporation\nT began filing combined in NYS as a member of Group P, which consisted of\n\nCorporations Q and R, in addition to Corporation T. Group P had no Federal or\nNYS NOLs prior to 2012; Corporation T had no Federal or NYS NOLs prior to 2011. Group P's base year is calendar year 2014. Corporation T had an NOL for both\n\nFederal and NYS purposes in 2011, which is a Separate Return Limitation Year\n('SRLY\"); the SRLY NOL was not subject to IRC section 382 limitations. Corporation T and Combined Group P had Federal/NYS income and losses, and\napplied the NOLs for tax years beginning before 1/1/2015, as follows: Corporation T\n2011\n\nFederal\nFTI\n($250)\nSRLY NOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2012 (to\n\nGroup P)\n$100\n\nBalance\n($150)\nNY\nENI\n($300)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 to 2012 (to Group\nP)\n$100\n\nBalance\n($200)\n\nGroup P\nT's SRLY NOL available after carryforward\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\nGroup P's Eligible NOL carryover amounts\n12/31/2014\n\"As if\" Federal\nFTI\nGroup P: Corporation Q\n$50\n($150)\n$100\n\nCorporation R\n$50\n$50\n$150\n\nPrior Combined Group Q and R gain/loss\n$100\n($100)\n$250\n\nCorporation T\n$100\n($200)\n($250)\n\nTotal for Federal \"as if\" group\n$200\n($300)\n$0\nSRLY NOL Carried Forward from 2011 (from Corp\nT) to 2012\n($100)\n\nBalance\n($150)\n$100\n($300)\n$0\n($450)\nENI\nGroup P: Corporation Q\n($200)\n($100)\n$50\n\nCorporation R\n$50\n$50\n$50\n\nPrior Combined Group Q and R gain/loss\n($150)\n($50)\n$100\n\nCorporation T\n$300\n($150)\n($150)\n\nTotal for Combined Group P\n$150\n($200)\n($50)\nNOL Carried Forward from 2011 (from Corp T) to\n2012\n($100)\n\nBalance\n($150)\n$50\n($200)\n$0\n($350)\n\nComputation of base year Group P's eligible NOL carryover\namounts and UNOL and Corporation Q's, R's, and T's UNOL. The amount of\n\nCorporation T's SRLY NOL from 2011 that can be carried forward to Group P is\n($250), which is the lesser of the Federal or State NOL available and is the\nlimitation for a loss sustained in an individual tax period being carried to a\ncombined period. The deduction by Group P in 2012 is limited to $100, the\namount of Corporation T's FTI for 2012. The NOLs remaining in 2011 and 2013 are\nincluded in Group P's eligible NYS carryover amount since there were both\n\nFederal and State NOL's sustained in each of those taxable years and available\nfor carryover as of the last day of Group P's base year. Group P's NYS NOL\nsustained in 2014 ($50) is not included in the eligible carryover amount as\nthere was no corresponding Federal NOL by Group P in that taxable year and\navailable for carryover. Group P's UNOL is ($350) and includes the remaining\nloss available from the 2011 taxable period of ($150) along with ($200) from\nthe 2013 tax period, being the lesser of the Federal or State NOL available. Each member of the base year combined Group P must then compute its own UNOL. Corporation T will have the ($150) remaining from the 2011 taxable year and its\nportion of the combined loss from the 2013 taxable year as determined by\nmultiplying Group P's combined loss of ($200) by a percentage that represents\neach member's contribution of losses to the combined group's loss. Corporation\nQ will have its portion of the combined loss from the 2013 taxable year once\nagain determined by multiplying Group P's combined loss of ($200) by a\npercentage that represents each member's contribution of losses to the combined\ngroup's loss and as illustrated below. Member\n2011 NYS NOL after carryforward\n2012 NYS NOL\n2013 NYS NOL\n2014 NYS NOL\nLosses by Member\n\nMember's % of total combined losses of all\nmembers\n\nMember's Share of Combined 2013 Loss\n\nMember's Total UNOL\nQ\n$0\n($100)\n$0\n($100)\n40%\n($80)\n($80)\nR\n$0\n$50\n$0\n$0\n0%\n$0\n$0\nT\n($150)\n$0\n($150)\n$0\n($150)\n60%\n($120)\n($270)\n\nTotals\n($150)\n$0\n($200)\n$0\n($250)\n100%\n($200)\n($350)\n\nCorporation T's NYS loss of $150 in 2014 is not included\nin the losses by member amounts above. This is because the NYS NOL sustained in\nthat year by the combined group that included Corporation T (i.e. Group P's\n2014 combined ENI of ($50)) was not included in the determination of Group P's\nUNOL (since, as explained above, there was no corresponding Federal NOL\nsustained by Group P in that taxable year and available for carryover). Example 6: Acme Company, a calendar-year taxpayer, began business in\n2009 and became taxable in NYS in 2009. Acme Company's base year is calendar\nyear 2014. Acme Company had a change in ownership effective January 1, 2013, subjecting its Federal losses sustained in 2009 through 2012 to IRC section 382\nlimitations. The ACME Company's annual section 382 limitation amount is $2,500. After the change in ownership Acme Company continued to file on a separate\nbasis for NYS purposes. Acme Company had Federal/NYS losses for tax years\nbeginning before 1/1/2015, as follows: Federal NOLs subject to IRC section 382\n\nFederal NOLs not subject to IRC section\n382\n\nEligible NOL carryover amounts\n12/31/2014\n\nAcme Company\n2009\n2010\n2011\n2012\n2013\n2014\n\nArising from NOLs subject to IRC section\n382\n\nArising from NOLs not subject to IRC section\n382\n(2009-2012)\n(2013-2014)\n\"As if\" Federal\nFTI\n($15,000)\n($10,000)\n($12,000)\n($20,000)\n($8,000)\n($5,000)\n\nBalance\n($15,000)\n($10,000)\n($12,000)\n($20,000)\n($8,000)\n($5,000)\n($50,000)\n($13,000)\nNY\nENI\n($20,000)\n($12,000)\n($10,000)\n($18,000)\n($5,000)\n($4,000)\n\nBalance\n($20,000)\n($12,000)\n($10,000)\n($18,000)\n($5,000)\n($4,000)\n($60,000)\n($9,000)\n\nComputation of Acme Company's eligible NOL carryover\namounts and UNOL. Since Acme Company has both Federal NOLs available for\ncarryover that are subject to IRC section 382 limitations (from 2009 through\n2012) and Federal NOLs available for carryover that are not subject to IRC\nsection 382 limitations (from 2013 and 2014), Acme Company must separately\ncompute its eligible Federal NOL carryover amount for each, and also must\nseparately compute its corresponding eligible NYS NOL carryover amount for\neach. Acme Company's Federal NOLs available for carryover from 2009 through\n2012 total ($57,000). However, due to the IRC section 382 limitation, the\nmaximum amount of such NOLs available for carryover that can be included in its\neligible Federal NOL carryover amount arising from Federal NOLs subject to IRC\nsection 382 limitations is limited to ($50,000) which is the annual section 382\nlimitation amount of ($2,500) multiplied by 20, less the amount of any such\nNOLs actually deducted (zero in this example as 2013 and 2014 are loss years). Acme Company's Federal NOLs available for carryover from 2013 and 2014, totaling ($13,000), are not subject to section 382 limitations and are included\nin its eligible Federal NOL carryover amount arising from Federal NOLs not\nsubject to IRC section 382 limitations. Acme Company's UNOL is ($59,000), which\nis the sum of the following amounts: (i) the lesser of the eligible Federal or NYS\nNOL carryover amounts arising from Federal NOLs subject to IRC section 382\nlimitations; and\n(ii)\nthe lesser\nof the eligible Federal or NYS NOL carryover amounts arising from Federal NOLs\nnot subject to IRC section 382 limitations.
