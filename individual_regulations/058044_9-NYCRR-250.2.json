  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 250.2 - General provisions for purchasing commodities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) State agency\nprocurement practices for commodities shall incorporate the following: (1)\n\nThe purchase of commodities by State\nagencies, including the Office of General Services, shall be conducted in a\nmanner which accords first priority to preferred sources in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part, second priority to centralized contracts, third\npriority to agency or multi-agency established contracts and fourth priority to\nother means of contracting. (2)\n\nCommodities contracts shall be awarded on the basis of lowest price to a\nresponsive and responsible offeror, or, in the case of multiple awards, in\naccordance with section\n250.10\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (b) A centralized\ncontract shall be established for those commodities required by State agencies\nin a manner which maximizes the purchasing value of public funds. Centralized\ncontracts, including multiple contracts, shall be established from time to time\nin such number and scope as will ensure the sufficient and uninterrupted\navailability of commodities for State agency use. Such contracts shall be\nestablished in cooperation with the State Procurement Council and State\nagencies, to reflect the identity, form, function and utility required by State\nagencies and to include specifications that conform, wherever possible, to\nindustry standards. Factors to be considered in the determination whether to\nestablish such contracts may include, without limitation, the availability of a\nvolume discount, prior use of the commodity among State agencies, the relative\ncost of establishing the contract, its anticipated use and expected actual\nsavings for the State. The commissioner may act as a broker for State agencies\nto procure commodities. (c) The\ncommissioner shall maintain lists of firms which produce, manufacture or offer\nfor sale commodities in the form, function and utility required by State\nagencies and shall ensure such lists are updated regularly and reflect New\n\nYork's small businesses, those certified pursuant to article 15-A of the\n\nExecutive Law, and shall facilitate access by businesses to procurement\nopportunities. (d) All\nsolicitations for the purchase of food products shall include a list developed\nby the commissioner of agriculture and markets of food products that are grown, produced or harvested in New York State or that were processed in facilities\nlocated in New York State. All solicitations shall also include a notice about\nwhether such New York State food products are available in sufficient\nquantities for competitive purchasing. Guidelines for assisting in increasing\nagencies' use and purchase of New York food products and established by the\ncommissioner and commis- sioner of agriculture and markets shall be located on\nthe Office of Gen- eral Services' website. (e) Consistent with guidelines issued by the\n\nState Procurement Council, State agencies may competitively purchase\ncommodities procured in accordance with this Part in lieu of using centralized\ncontracts when the resultant price is less than the centralized contract\nprice. (f) When justified by price, State agencies shall be eligible to make purchases pursuant to guidelines\nissued by the Procurement Council from a consortium or comparable entity in\nlieu of using centralized contracts for commodities. (g) When commodities are not available in the\nform, function and utility required by State agencies through preferred sources\nor centralized contracts, a State agency may, independently or in conjunction\nwith other State agencies, procure commodities in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part. State agencies may maintain listings of firms, including those certified pursuant to article 15-A of the Executive Law, or may\nuse the commissioner's listing of firms. It shall be the responsibility of\n\nState agencies to periodically identify those agency procured commodities\nwhich, due to the frequency of purchase or related factors, should be made\navailable through centralized contracts. (h) Multiple purchases by a State agency of\nsimilar commodities or services within any 60-day period shall be considered a\nsingle purchase for the purpose of this Part. Agencies should consider, when\npractical and appropriate, the anticipated annual expenditures for a commodity\nor service in determining which procurement methodology to use. If an agency\ncan reasonably anticipate that repeat purchases of an otherwise low dollar\nvalue item will be necessary, the agency should elect the appropriate\nprocurement process to cover such aggregate needs. (i) A State agency may purchase within a\n15-day period without formal competitive bidding up to $10,000 each of fresh\neggs, fruits and vegetables from a New York State grower, producer or\nassociation of growers and producers (separately by basic category). Agencies\nmust determine the price is reasonable and comparable relative to the current\nmarket price. (j) Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if a State agency delegates purchasing responsibilities to\nregional offices, upon application by the State agency to and approval by the\ncommissioner, each regional office may, with respect to its own purchases for\nits regional requirements, be considered a separated \"agency\" for purposes of\nthe limitation set forth in this Part. (k) Officers of any body or agency of the\n\nState or of a political subdivision or a district therein, or fire company or\nvolunteer ambulance service as such are defined in section\n100\nof\nthe General Municipal Law, are authorized to make purchases of commodities\nthrough the Office of General Services' centralized contracts, pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n104\nof\nthe General Municipal Law. Public authorities and public benefit corporations\nof the State, including the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the\n\nInterstate Environmental Commission shall be eligible to make purchases from\n\nOffice of General Services' centralized contracts for commodities. Any\nqualified non-profit-making agency for the blind approved by the Commissioner\nof Children and Family Services and any qualified non-profit-making agency for\nthe severely disabled approved by the Commissioner of Education shall be\neligible to make purchases from Office of General Services' centralized\ncontracts for commodities. Any county extension service association as\nauthorized under subdivision eight of section\n224\nof the County\n\nLaw, or any association or other entity as specified in and in accordance with\nsection\n109-a\nof the General Municipal Law, or any other association or entity as specified\nin State law, are authorized to make purchases of commodities through the\n\nOffice of General Services' centralized contracts. Any public library, association library, library system, cooperative library system, the New York\n\nLibrary Association and the New York State Association of Library Boards or any\nother library except those operated by for profit entities may make purchases\nthrough centralized contracts for commodities. The authority granted such\nentities to purchase from Office of General Services' centralized contracts\nshall be subject to the following conditions: (1)\n\nParticipation in certain centralized\ncontracts by political subdivisions and other authorized purchasers may be\nconditioned upon the filing of requirements for specific commodities through\nthe use of forms issued by the commissioner. (2)\n\nWhen requirements have been submitted to\nthe commissioner by a political subdivision, or other authorized purchasers, such political subdivision or authorized purchaser shall agree that no separate\nbids for the same requirements shall be sought nor purchases thereof shall be\nmade by such entity. (3)\n\nPolitical\nsubdivisions, and other authorized purchasers, may not withdraw requirements\nfiled without obtaining the commissioner's prior written approval. Such\napproval shall not be withheld unless the commissioner determines that the\nwithdrawal of the requirement filed will jeopardize the validity of an existing\ncontract or pending contract award. (4)\n\nPolitical subdivisions, and other\nauthorized purchasers, purchasing under a State contract shall, when requested, send a copy of the purchase order to the commissioner upon issuance to the\ncontractor. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding\nanything in this section to the contrary, the commissioner by reason of the\nnature of the materials, equipment or supplies to be contracted for, existing\nmarket conditions, past performance on State contracts, financial disability or\nfor other good and sufficient cause deemed necessary in order to protect the\n\nState's own purchasing interest, reserves the right with respect to any\ncontract to be let by the commissioner to eliminate, restrict, limit or reduce\nparticipation by all or particular political subdivisions and other authorized\npurchasers by law where the commissioner so indicates in the contract\ndocuments. The commissioner further reserves the right during the course or\nterm of a contract to limit participating political subdivisions and other\nauthorized purchasers to either their historical quantity purchases, as shall\nbe determined by the commissioner, or their filed requirements. (6)\n\nPolitical subdivisions and other\nauthorized purchasers shall accept sole responsibility for payments due\ncontractor for purchases made under a State contract and upon request, and if\neligible, must furnish contractor with proper evidence of tax\nexemption. (7)\n\nPolitical\nsubdivisions or other authorized purchasers shall have primary responsibility\nfor audit and inspection of contract purchases. All commodities delivered under\ncontracts should be inspected immediately for compliance with contract\nspecifications. Contractors should be notified at once, with written\nconfirmation, if commodities deviate from the specifications. If the purchaser\nexperiences problems with contractors in correcting deviations, then the\ncommissioner should be so notified in writing. (8)\n\nThe commissioner may, upon the failure of\na political subdivision or other authorized purchaser to promptly and properly\nadhere to all contract terms and conditions, statutes, applicable rules and\nregulations, reasonable directions of the commissioner and good business\npractices, including prompt payment for materials, equipment or supplies\nreceived, suspend such entities' privilege of purchasing through centralized\ncontracts or may take such other action as the commissioner deems appropriate\nincluding, but not limited to, the imposition of special conditions and\nrestrictions with regard to future purchases by such entity.
