(b) For the purpose of this\n\nPart, the following definitions will also apply: (1)\n\nAluminum equivalent. The amount of\naluminum which can be produced from the amount of anodes produced by an anode\nbake plant. This is assumed to equal two tons of aluminum per ton of anodes\nunless the owner or operator can establish a different number by submitting\nproduction records of the amount of aluminum produced and the concurrent amount\nof anode consumed by potrooms. (2)\n\nAnode bake plant. A facility which produces carbon anodes for use in a primary\naluminum reduction plant. (3)\n\nPotroom. A building unit at a primary aluminum reduction plant which houses a\ngroup of electrolytic cells in which aluminum is produced. A potroom group\nconsists of an uncontrolled potroom, a potroom which is controlled individually\nor a group of potrooms or potroom segments ducted to a common control\nsystem. (4)\n\nPrebake plant. A\nprimary aluminum reduction plant where anode baking is performed by heating\nunbaked anode material in a furnace or kiln which is separate from the\nelectrolytic reduction cell. (5)\n\nPrimary aluminum reduction plant. A facility where aluminum is produced by\nelectrolytic reduction. (6)\n\nSoderberg plant. A primary aluminum reduction plant where anode baking is\nperformed by heating unbaked anode material within the same casing which\ncontains the working anode while it is immersed in the electrolytic\ncell. (7)\n\nTotal fluorides. Elemental fluorine and all fluoride compounds as measured by methods specified\nin Appendix A of 40 CFR\n60\n(see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), or, if the\napplication for the permit to construct for the source was received by the\ncommissioner before October 24, 1974, as measured by alternative methods\napproved by the commissioner.
