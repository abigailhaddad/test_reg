  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 5.3 - Resignation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Resignation in\nwriting. Except as otherwise provided herein, every resignation shall be in\nwriting. (b) Effective date. If no\neffective date is specified in a resignation, it shall take effect upon\ndelivery to or filing in the office of the appointing authority. If an\neffective date is specified in a resignation, it shall take effect on such\nspecified date. However, if a resignation is submitted while the employee is on\nleave of absence without pay, such resignation, for the purpose of determining\neligibility for reinstatement, shall be deemed to be effective as of the date\nof the commencement of such absence. Notwithstanding the provisions of this\nsubdivision, when charges of incompetency or misconduct have been or are about\nto be filed against an employee, the appointing authority may elect to\ndisregard a resignation filed by such employee and to prosecute such charges\nand, in the event that such employee is found guilty of such charges and\ndismissed from the service, his termination shall be recorded as a dismissal\nrather than as a resignation. (c) Withdrawal or amendment. A resignation may not be withdrawn, cancelled or\namended after it is delivered to the appointing authority, without the consent\nof the appointing authority. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4\n§\n5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
