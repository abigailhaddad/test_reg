Tit. 21 § 890.11 - Coordinated operation of lower basin and hydroelectric reservoirs during a basinwide drought\n\nState Regulations\n\nDuring \"drought\" conditions as defined in Figure 1\n(section\n890.9\nof this Part), the Francis\nE. Walter, Prompton, Beltzville, Blue Marsh, Nockamixon, Lake Wallenpaupack and\n\nMongaup hydroelectric reservoirs, will be utilized to complement the drought\nmanagement operations of the New York City reservoirs. The priority of lower\nbasin reservoir use to meet Trenton flow objectives is set forth in Table 1 of\nthis section.

Lake Wallenpaupack and the Mongaup reservoirs would be\ncalled upon to provide releases to assist in meeting the Montague flow\nobjective in the summer and fall periods whenever reservoir releases would have\nto be directed by the River Master. These releases would be independent of\nlower basin release requirements needed to maintain flows at Trenton. After\nissuance of a Conservation Order by the commission, the power companies, as\nagreed upon, shall make power generation releases from storage only in\naccordance with commission direction. For Lake Wallenpaupack, the schedule is\nset forth in Table 2 of this section. While the Lake Wallenpaupack schedule is\ndesigned to meet drought management requirements, the lake levels have been\nestablished to preserve the recreation value of the lake during the summer\nmonths.

For the Mongaup reservoirs, a drought operation rule\ncurve will be followed. The rule curve will be based on maximum available\nstorage of 15.38 billion gallons for the total system and will provide for\nrefilling the system during the worst hydrologic year of record and for\nmaintaining a minimum release. Daily average discharge for the period\n\nJune-November inclusive generally will be on the order of 100-150 cfs/24-hours\nand for the period December-May inclusive generally will be on the order of\n20-30 cfs/24-hours. Temporary storage in Prompton reservoir would be used to\nhelp meet the Trenton objective; however, depending on upper and lower basin\nconditions, Prompton releases could also be used for a Montague objective if\nthere was a critical need to conserve storage in the New York City Delaware\n\nBasin reservoirs and the combined storage in the Beltzville and Blue Marsh\nreservoirs was above 70% of capacity. Francis E. Walter reservoir will be called upon to meet\nthe Trenton flow objective only after any storage in Prompton is depleted. It\nis understood, however, that until this dam is modified to retain water supply\nstorage, its function is flood control. It will not likely be available for\nflow maintenance during the first year of a drought if such drought is declared\nsubsequent to June 1, or the end of the heavy spring runoff period. Water could\nbe stored temporarily in flood control storage upon issuance of requests for\nstorage and releases after issuance of a conservation order by the commission. In the event of a threatening major storm, temporarily stored water may have to\nbe released in order to restore the necessary flood protection capacity of the\ndam. Water may also have to be released in order to draw down to the winter\ndrought pool level at elevation 1,370 (see Table 3 of this section). If\nreleases to meet winter drought pool requirements or to prepare for a storm\noccur when releases are not required for the Trenton flow objective, then the\n\nMontague requirement would be adjusted in order to save equivalent water in the\n\nNew York City Delaware Basin reservoirs. In so doing, the storage saved in the\n\nNew York City reservoirs would be available for use later should the drought\npersist, or be available, if conditions improve, to return to a normal\ncondition at an earlier date, at which time restrictions could be\nlifted.

While it is clearly understood that the water supply\nstorage at Beltzville and Blue Marsh reservoirs is to be used for water supply\nand to control salinity intrusion into the Delaware estuary during low flow\nperiods, it is also recognized that extensive recreational development is\nestablished on these lakes, which should be protected to the extend possible. Accordingly, the operation plans for both of these reservoirs, as well as\n\nNockamixon, in drought emergencies have recognized these multiple uses, with\nwater supply having precedence. After Francis E. Walter, then Beltzville, Blue Marsh, and\n\nNockamixon reservoirs are used in that order down to the elevations indicated\nin Table 1 of this section for priorities 3 and 4, at which elevations\nrecreation will become affected. Recreation will then be eliminated at\n\nBeltzville and Blue Marsh while retaining fish life, as those two reservoirs\nare drawn down to the elevations indicated as priorities 5 and 6. Finally, all\nremaining usable storage would be utilized as indicated by priorities 7 and\n8. When only conservation releases are being made from the\nlower basin reservoirs, they will be modified according to Table 4 of this\nsection, beginning with \"drought warning\" conditions, as defined by Figure 1 in\nsection\n890.9\nof this Part. Drought\nconservation releases will terminate and return to normal at the same time as\naugmented conservation releases are restored at the New York City Delaware\nreservoirs.
