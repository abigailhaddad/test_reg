Tit. 16 § 463.13 - Transfers of property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When steam\nplant consisting of one or more retirement units is transferred from one\naccount for steam plant to another, from one utility department to another, such as from steam to electric, from one cost area to another, between accounts\n101, Steam Plant in Service, 102, Steam Plant Leased to Others, 104, Steam\n\nPlant Held for Future Use, or between corresponding accounts for common utility\nplant, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the book cost thereof\nfrom one account, department, or cost area to the other. In the case of all\ntransfers between accounts 101, 102 and 104, and corresponding accounts for\ncommon utility plant and from one utility department to another, and in case of\ntransfers of substantial amounts in any year from one primary account for steam\nor common plant to another, or from one accounting division to another, any\nrelated amounts carried in the depreciation reserves shall, not later than the\nend of the year, be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such\nreserves. When property (except customers' meters) in connection with which\ninstallation costs have been incurred is physically transferred, it shall be\naccounted for as provided in steam plant instruction section\n463.11. (b) When property is transferred from the\nsteam plant accounts to account 110, Other Physical Property, the transfer\nshall be accomplished by crediting the steam plant accounts and charging the\ndepreciation reserve with the book cost of the item transferred; the\ndepreciation reserve shall then be credited, as the estimated salvage, and\naccount 110, Other Physical Property, concurrently charged with the market\nvalue of the property transferred. If the property is sold within a relatively\nshort time, a debit or credit shall be made to the depreciation reserve to\nadjust the estimated salvage to the amount actually realized. Notes\nN.Y.
