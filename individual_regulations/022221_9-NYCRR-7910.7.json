  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7910.7 - Energy audits and technical feasibility studies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Age of audit and technical feasibility\nstudies. An energy audit or technical feasibility study must have been\nperformed or updated within one year of the date of submission of a program\napplication to the Energy Office. Updates need address only energy conservation\nimprovements for which a interest subsidy is being requested. Updates must\ninclude a recalculation of the paybacks of the original energy audit's or\ntechnical feasibility study's proposed energy conservation improvements, based\non current fuel costs. (b) Acceptable energy audits. Energy audits which will be accepted by the Energy\n\nOffice include Energy Office-sponsored audits, apartment building conservation\nservice audits, other government-sponsored and utility company energy audits as\napproved by the Energy Office, and private audits stamped with the seal and\nsignature of a registered architect or professional engineer. (c) Acceptable technical feasibility studies. Technical feasibility studies must be prepared under the supervision of and\nstamped with the seal and signature of a registered architect or professional\nengineer in order to be accepted by the Energy Office. (d) Information on energy conservation\nimprovements. An energy audit or technical feasibility study must contain the\nfollowing information regarding each energy conservation improvement for which\nan interest subsidy is being requested: (1)\na\ndetailed description of the improvement to be implemented, including any\nnecessary sketches or diagrams; (2)\nall calculations, including units of measurement and formulae, of annual fuel\nuse, and annual Btu and energy cost savings, with all assumptions and\nparameters clearly presented. The annual Btu and energy cost savings shall be\nbased on actual building consumption records for the building for the prior 12-\nmonth period, if the building was occupied during such period, and shall not\ninclude savings from taxes, dollar savings due to switching to lower cost\nfuels, and other savings which may be deemed inappropriate by the Energy\n\nOffice. All formulae and calculations shall be based on generally accepted\nengineering standards and practices, and shall be reviewed for completeness and\nreasonableness by the Energy Office; and\n(3)\nthe results of a combustion efficiency\ntest, if furnace or boiler modifications or replacements are being\nimplemented. (e) Conflict of interest prohibited. (1)\nA person\nperforming an energy audit or technical feasibility study, or a person acting\nas an agent on behalf of an applicant, is permitted to provide construction\nmanagement services to an approved applicant. However, except as noted in\nparagraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, such person may not participate\ndirectly or indirectly in the sale or installation of an energy conservation\nimprovement to be implemented by the applicant with the proceeds of a program\nloan. (2)\n\nFor energy conservation\nimprovements, such as cogeneration projects, which are determined by the Energy\n\nOffice to require a vendor's special expertise, a person performing an energy\naudit or technical feasibility study may be involved in the sale or\ninstallation of an energy conservation improvement being implemented by the\napplicant with the proceeds of a program loan. (3)\n\nFor energy conservation improvement\nprojects which receive financial assistance through the Federal Weatherization\n\nAssistance for Low-Income Persons Program, a subgrantee performing an energy\naudit or technical feasibility study may be involved in the installation of the\nenergy conservation improvement project being implemented with the proceeds of\na program loan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7910.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
