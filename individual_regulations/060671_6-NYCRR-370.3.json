  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 370.3 - Variances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nAny person may\npetition the commissioner to use an equivalent testing or analytical method, to\nexclude a waste produced at a particular facility from the requirements of\n\nParts 370 through 374, and 376 of this Title, to be granted a variance from\nclassification as a solid waste or to be granted a variance to be classified as\na boiler. This subdivision sets forth general requirements which apply to these\npetitions. Subdivision (b) of this section sets forth additional requirements\nfor petitions to use a testing or analytical method that varies from the\nmethods specified in Part 371 and Subparts 373-2 and 373-3 of this Title. Subdivision (c) of this section sets forth additional requirements for\npetitions to exclude a waste at a particular facility from sections\n371.1\n(d) and\n371.4\nof this Title. Subdivisions\n(d) and (e) of this section set forth additional requirements for petitions to\nbe granted a variance from classification as a solid waste under section\n371.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. Subdivision (f) of this section sets forth additional requirements for\npetitions to be granted a variance to be classified as a boiler. (2)\n\nEach petition must be submitted to the\ncommissioner and must include: (i) the\npetitioner's name and address; (ii)\na statement of the petitioner's interest in the proposed action; (iii)\na description of the proposed\naction; (iv)\na statement of the\nneed and justification of the proposed action, including any supporting tests, studies or other information; and\n(v) the following statement signed by the\npetitioner or an authorized representative: \"I certify under penalty of law that I have personally\nexamined and am familiar with the information submitted in this demonstration\nand all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals\nimmediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the\nsubmitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that\nsubmitting false information is punishable under section 210.45 of the State\n\nPenal Law, including the possibility of fine and\nimprisonment.\"\n(3)\n\nThe commissioner will determine if\nsufficient information has been has been submitted in order to grant or deny a\npetition. (i) If the commissioner determines\nthat sufficient information has been submitted, a tentative decision will be\nmade to grant or deny a petition. A notice of such tentative decision will be\npublished by the department in the Environmental Notice Bulletin for written\npublic comment. In the case of a petition under subdivisions (d) and (f) of\nthis section, notification of this tentative decision will also be provided by\nnewspaper advertisement and radio broadcast in the locality where the\npetitioner's facility is located. The public will be provided with a minimum\ncomment period of 30 days. (ii)\n\nIf\nthe commissioner determines that additional information is needed, the\ncommissioner will notify the petitioner in writing of the needed\ninformation. (4)\n\nUpon\nthe written request of any interested person, the commissioner may then hold a\nlegislative public hearing to consider oral comments on the tentative decision. A person requesting a hearing must state the issues to be raised and explain\nwhy written comments would not suffice to communicate the person's views. The\ncommissioner may in any case decide to initiate a motion to hold a legislative\npublic hearing. (5)\n\nAfter\nevaluating all public comments, the commissioner will make a final decision and\nshall publish notice of the decision in the\n\nEnvironmental Notice\n\nBulletin. (b) Petitions for equivalent testing or analytical methods. (1)\n\nAny person seeking to add a testing or\nanalytical method to Part 371, Subpart 373-2, or Subpart 373-3 of this Title\nmust first petition the EPA administrator for a regulatory amendment under\n40 CFR\n260.21\nand\n40 CFR\n260.20, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart. Upon approval by the EPA administrator, the petitioner must then\ndemonstrate to the commissioner that the proposed method is equal to or\nsuperior to the corresponding method prescribed in Part 371 and Subparts 373-2\nand 373-3 of this Title, in terms of its sensitivity, accuracy and precision\n(\ni.e., reproducibility). (2)\n\nEach petition must include, in addition\nto the information required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section: (i) a full description of the proposed\nmethod, including all steps and equipment used in the method; (ii)\na description of the types of wastes or\nwaste matrices for which the proposed method may be used; (iii)\ncomparative results obtained from using\nthe relevant or corresponding methods prescribed in Part 371 and Subparts 373-2\nand 373-3 of this Title; (iv)\nan\nassessment of any factors which may interfere with or limit the use of the\nproposed method; and\n(v) a\ndescription of the quality control procedures necessary to ensure the\nsensitivity, accuracy and precision of the proposed method. (c) Petitions to\nexclude a waste produced at a particular facility. (1)\n\nAny person seeking to exclude a waste\nfrom the lists in section\n371.4\nof this Title at a particular\ngenerating facility must first petition the EPA administrator for a regulatory\namendment under\n40\nCFR\n260.22\nand\n40 CFR\n260.20, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nPart. Upon approval by the EPA administrator, the petitioner may then seek\nconcurrence from the commissioner under this subdivision and subdivision (a) of\nthis section. To be successful: (i) the\npetitioner must demonstrate to the commissioner that the waste produced by a\nparticular generating facility does not meet any of the criteria under which\nthe waste was listed as a hazardous or an acutely hazardous waste; and\n(ii)\nbased on a complete\npetition, the commissioner must determine, where there is a reasonable basis to\nbelieve that factors (including additional constituents) other than those for\nwhich the waste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that\nsuch factors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. A waste\nwhich is so excluded, however, is a hazardous waste if it fails one of the\ncharacteristic tests of section\n371.3\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe procedures in this\nsubdivision and subdivision (a) of this section may also be used to petition\nthe commissioner for an exclusion from section\n371.1\n(d)(1)(ii)\n(\nb\n) and (d)(3) of this Title, a waste which is described in\nthose sections and is either a waste listed in section\n371.4\nor is derived from a waste\nlisted in section\n371.4. This exclusion may only be\nused for a particular generating, storage, treatment or disposal facility. The\npetitioner must make the same demonstration as required by paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision. Where the waste is a mixture of solid waste and one or more\nlisted hazardous wastes or is derived from one or more hazardous wastes, the\npetitioner's demonstration made with respect to the waste mixture as a whole; analysis must be conducted for not only those constituents for which the waste\ncontained in the mixture was listed as hazardous, but also for factors\n(including additional constituents) that could cause the waste mixture to be a\nhazardous waste. A waste which is so excluded is still a hazardous waste if it\nexhibits any of the characteristics identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title. (3)\n\nIf the waste is listed with codes \"I,\"\n\"C,\" \"R\" or \"E\" in section\n371.4\nof this Title: (i) the petitioner must show that the waste\ndoes not exhibit the relevant characteristic for which the waste was listed as\ndefined in section\n371.3\n(b), (c), (d) or\n(e) of this Title using any applicable\nmethods prescribed therein. The petitioner also must show that the waste does\nnot exhibit any of the other characteristics defined in section\n371.3\n(b), (c), (d) or\n(e) of this Title using any applicable\nmethods prescribed therein; and\n(ii)\nbased on a complete petition, the\ncommissioner must determine, where there is a reasonable basis to believe that\nfactors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the\nwaste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that such\nfactors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste. A waste which\nis so excluded, however, is a hazardous waste if it fails one of the\ncharacteristic tests of section\n371.3\nof this Title. (4)\n\nIf the waste is listed with\ncode \"t\" in section\n371.4\nof this Title: (i) (a) the\npetitioner must demonstrate that the waste does not contain the constituent or\nconstituents (as defined in Appendix 22, infra\n) that caused\nthe commissioner to list the waste; or\n(b) the waste, although containing one or\nmore of the hazardous constituents (as defined in Appendix 22, infra) that\ncaused the commissioner to list the waste, does not meet the criterion of\nsection\n371.2\n(b)(1)(iii)\nof this Title when considering the factors in clauses\n(b)(1)(iii)(\na\n) through (\nk\n) of such section\nunder which the waste was listed as hazardous; and\n(ii)\nthe petitioner must demonstrate that the\nwaste does not exhibit any of the characteristics defined in section\n371.3\n(b)-(e)\nof\nthis Title using any applicable methods prescribed therein; (iii)\nbased on a complete petition, the\ncommissioner must determine, where there is reasonable basis to believe that\nfactors (including additional constituents) other than those for which the\nwaste was listed could cause the waste to be a hazardous waste, that such\nfactors do not warrant retaining the waste as a hazardous waste; and\n(iv)\na waste which is so excluded, however, is a hazardous waste if it fails one of the characteristic tests of section\n371.3\nof this Title. (5)\n\nIf the waste is listed with\nthe code \"h\" in section\n371.4\nof this Title: (i) (a) the\npetitioner must demonstrate that the waste does not meet the criterion for\nlisting acute hazardous wastes of section\n371.2\n(b)(1)(ii)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) the waste does\nnot exhibit any of the characteristics defined in section\n371.3\n(b)-(e)\nof\nthis Title using any applicable methods prescribed therein; (ii)\nbased on a complete petition, the commissioner must determine, where there is reasonable basis to believe, that additional factors (including additional constituents) other than for\nthose which the waste was listed do not warrant retaining the waste as a\nhazardous waste; and\n(iii)\na waste\nwhich so excluded, however, is a hazardous waste if it fails one of the\ncharacteristic tests of section\n371.3\nof this Title. (6)\n\nDemonstration samples must\nconsist of enough representative samples, but in no case less than four\nsamples, taken over a period of time sufficient to represent the variability or\nthe uniformity of the waste. (7)\n\nEach petition must include, in addition to the information required by\nparagraph (a)(2) of this section: (i) the\nname and address of the laboratory facility performing the sampling or tests of\nthe waste; (ii)\nthe names and\nqualifications of the persons sampling and testing the waste; (iii)\nthe dates of sampling and\ntesting; (iv)\nthe location of the\ngenerating facility; (v) a\ndescription of the manufacturing processes or other operations and feed\nmaterials producing the waste and an assessment of whether such processes, operations, or feed materials can or might produce a waste that is not covered\nby the demonstration; (vi)\na\ndescription of the waste and an estimate of the average and maximum monthly and\nannual quantities of waste covered by the demonstration; (vii)\npertinent data on and discussion of the\nfactors delineated in the respective criteria for listing a hazardous waste, where the demonstration is based on the factors in section\n371.2\n(b)(1)(iii)\nof this Title; (viii)\na description\nof the methodologies and equipment used to obtain the representative\nsample; (ix)\na description of the\nsample handling and preparation techniques, including techniques used for\nextraction, containerization and preservation of the samples; (x) a description of the tests performed\n(including results); (xi)\nthe names\nand model numbers of the instruments used in performing the tests; and\n(xii)\nthe following statement\nsigned by the generator of the waste or an authorized representative: \"I certify under penalty of law that I have personally\nexamined and am familiar with the information submitted in this demonstration\nand all attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals\nimmediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the\nsubmitted information is true, accurate and complete. I am aware that\nsubmitting false information under section 210.45 of the State Penal Law, including the possibility of fine and imprisonment.\"\n(8)\n\nAfter receiving a petition for\nan exclusion, the commissioner may request any additional information\nreasonably required to evaluate the petition. (9)\n\nAn exclusion will only apply to the waste\ngenerated by the individual facility covered by the demonstration and will not\napply to waste from any other facility. (10)\n\nThe commissioner may exclude only part\nof the waste for which the demonstration is submitted where there is reason to\nbelieve that variability of the waste justifies a partial exclusion. (d) Variances from\nclassification as a solid waste. (1)\n\nIn accordance with the standards and criteria in subdivision (e) and the\nprocedures in subdivision (a) of this section, the commissioner may determine\non a case-by-case basis that the following recycled materials are not solid\nwastes: (i) materials that are accumulated\nspeculatively without sufficient amounts being recycled (as defined in section\n371.1\n[a][1]\nof\nthis Title); (ii)\nmaterials that\nare reclaimed and then reused by the same person within the original production\nprocess in which they were generated; and\n(iii)\nmaterials that have been reclaimed but\nmust be reclaimed further before the materials are completely\nrecovered. (e) Standards and criteria for\nvariances from classification as a solid waste. (1)\n\nThe commissioner may grant requests for a\nvariance from classifying as a solid waste those materials that are accumulated\nspeculatively without sufficient amounts being recycled if the applicant\ndemonstrates that sufficient amounts of the material will be recycled or\ntransferred for recycling in the following year. If a variance is granted, it\nis valid only for the following year, but can be renewed, on an annual basis, by filing a new application. The commissioner's decision will be based on the\nfollowing criteria: (i) the manner in which\nthe material is expected to be recycled, when the material is expected to be\nrecycled, and whether, because of past practices, market factors, the nature of\nthe material, or contractual arrangements, the recycling is likely to\noccur; (ii)\nthe reason that the\napplicant has accumulated the material for one or more years without recycling\nat least 75 percent of the volume accumulated at the beginning of the\nyear; (iii)\nthe quantity of\nmaterial already accumulated and the quantity expected to be generated and\naccumulated before the material is recycled; (iv)\nthe extent to which the material is\nhandled to minimize loss; and\n(v) other relevant factors. (2)\n\nThe department may grant requests for a\nvariance from classifying as a solid waste those materials that are reclaimed\nand then reused as feedstock within the original production process in which\nthe materials were generated if the reclamation operation is an essential part\nof the production process. This determination will be based on the following\ncriteria: (i) how economically viable the\nproduction process would be if it were to use virgin materials, rather than\nreclaimed materials; (ii)\nthe\nextent to which the material is handled before reclamation to minimize\nloss; (iii)\nthe time periods\nbetween generating the material and its reclamation, and between reclamation\nand return to the original primary production process; (iv)\nthe location of the reclamation\noperation in relation to the production process; (v) whether the reclaimed material is used\nfor the purpose for which it was originally produced when it is returned to the\noriginal process, and whether it is returned to the process in substantially\nits original form; (vi)\nwhether the\nperson who generates the material also reclaims it; and\n(vii)\nother relevant factors. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may grant\nrequests for a variance from classifying as a solid waste those materials that\nhave been reclaimed but must be reclaimed further before recovery is completed\nif, after initial reclamation, the resulting material is commodity-like (even\nthough it is not yet a commercial product, and has to be reclaimed further). This determination will be based on the following factors: (i) the degree of processing the material has\nundergone and the degree of further processing that is required; (ii)\nthe value of the material after it has\nbeen reclaimed; (iii)\nthe degree to\nwhich the reclaimed material is like an analogous raw material; (iv)\nthe extent to which an end market for\nthe reclaimed material is guaranteed; (v) the extent to which the reclaimed\nmaterial is handled to minimize loss; and\n(vi)\nother relevant factors. (f) Variance to\nbe classified as a boiler. (1)\n\nIn\naccordance with the standards and criteria in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart (definition of boiler), and the procedures in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the commissioner may determine on a case-by-case basis that certain\nenclosed devices using controlled flame combustion are boilers, even though\nthey do not otherwise meet the definition of boiler contained in section\n370.2\n(b), after\nconsidering the following criteria: (i) the\nextent to which the unit has provisions for recovering and exporting thermal\nenergy in the form of steam, heated fluids or heated gases; (ii)\nthe extent to which the combustion\nchamber and energy recovery equipment are of integral design; (iii)\nthe efficiency of energy recovery, calculated in terms of the recovered energy compared with the thermal value of\nthe fuel; (iv)\nthe extent to which\nexported energy is utilized; (v) the extent to which the device is in common and customary use as a boiler\nfunctioning primarily to produce steam, heated fluids or heated gases; and\n(vi)\nother relevant\nfactors.
