  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 171.10 - Extension of withholding of New York State personal income tax to annuity payments if requested by payee\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 671(b)(2)(C)\n(a) Determining New York State personal\nincome tax to be withheld. In addition to the wages subject to withholding of New\n\nYork State personal income tax under this Part, any payment of an annuity made\nby a payer maintaining an office or transacting business in New York State to\nan individual, to the extent includible in such individual's New York adjusted\ngross income, must be treated as if it were a payment of wages by an employer\nto an employee for a payroll period if, at the time the payment is made, a\nrequest that such annuity be subject to withholding of New York State personal\nincome tax under this Part is in effect. (b) To qualify for withholding of New York\n\nState personal income tax under this Part, the annuity payment must be income\nto the recipient that would be includible in such recipient's New York adjusted\ngross income. Such annuity payment must also be payable over a period of longer\nthan one year. All requirements contained in Article 5 of this Subchapter with\nrespect to filing New York State employer returns, furnishing information and\npayment of New York State personal income tax withheld, apply equally to the\nwithholding of New York State personal income tax on annuity payments under\nthis section, except that wherever form IT-2102 is referred to, Statement for Recipients of Annuities, Pensions, Retired Pay, or IRA\nPayments\n(form IT-2102P) is to be substituted therefor, and wherever\nform IT-2104 is referred to, Annuitant's Request for Income Tax\n\nWithholding\n(form IT-2104P) is to be substituted therefor. (c) Manner of making request. A request to deduct and withhold New York State personal\nincome tax on annuity payments should be made by the payee by completing form\nIT-2104P, Annuitant's Request for Income Tax Withholding, in\naccordance with instructions applicable thereto. In lieu of form IT-2104P, payers may prepare and use a form, the provisions of which are identical to\nform IT-2104P. The request to deduct and withhold New York State personal\nincome tax is to be made in a specific dollar amount which must be at least $5\nper month and may not reduce the net amount of any annuity payment received by\nthe payee below $10. (d) When request takes effect. Upon receipt of a request under this section to withhold\n\nNew York State personal income tax on annuity payments, the payer of such\nannuity payments must deduct and withhold the amount specified in such request\n(see subdivision [c] of this section for restrictions relating to the amount of\n\nNew York State personal income tax which may be deducted and withheld from\nannuity payments) from such annuity payments commencing with the first annuity\npayment made on or after the date which occurs: (1)\nin a case in which no previous request is\nin effect, three calendar months after the date on which such request is\nfurnished to such payer; or\n(2)\nin\na case in which a previous request is in effect, the first status determination\ndate (January 1st, May 1st, July 1st and October 1st of each year) which occurs\nat least 30 days after the date on which such request is so furnished. However, the payer may elect to begin to deduct and withhold such specified amount with\nrespect to an annuity payment from an earlier payment. (e) Duration and termination of\nrequest. A request under this section will remain in effect until\nterminated by the payee. The payee may terminate the request by furnishing the\npayer a signed written notice of termination. Such notice of termination, except as hereinafter provided, is effective with respect to the first payment\nof an annuity made on or after the first status determination date (January\n1st, May 1st, July 1st and October 1st of each year) which occurs at least 30\ndays after the date on which such notice of termination is furnished. However, the payer may elect to terminate withholding of New York State personal income\ntax with an annuity payment made on or after the date the termination notice is\nfurnished and before the status determination date.
