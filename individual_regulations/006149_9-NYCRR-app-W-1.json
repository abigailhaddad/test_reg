ADDITIONAL FILES, RECORDS, PAPERS OR DOCUMENTS (by subject)\nGUIDELINES FOR DISCLOSURE OF OTHER RECORDS\nIn general the Council will strive to permit disclosure of as\nmuch of its records as possible, consistent with State interest. The Freedom of\n\nInfor-mation Act provides for non-disclosure of records under stated\ncircumstances. Most of the activities of the Council are presently concerned\nwith the funding of arts and cultural institutions throughout New York State in\naccordance with the Council's legislative mandate. Consistent with the Freedom\nof Information Law, the Council will make available all objective criteria\nconsidered by it in connection with its arts and cultural funding process. In\norder to promote an open, frank and full consideration of app-licants for\nfunding, the Council has adopted a policy not to release matters relating to\nopinions, options and recommendations made by staff and consul-tants prior to\nadoptions of final funding positions and decisions on matters requiring Council\naction. Under the above policy, the Council will make available\napplications for funding submitted by applicants and contracts with grantees. After annual funding is completed the identity of panel members who make\nrecommendations to the staff and the Council may be released to the public. Beyond releasing this information the Council will not make available the\nfollowing: a. Information solicited in\nconfidence regarding personnel of an applicant; b. General correspondence and internal memos\nwhich have no direct effect on members of the public; c. Audits conducted by other agencies of the\n\nState, whether of the Council as a State agency, or of grant applicants or\ngrant recipients; d. Reports by\nobservers and investigators which relate to consideration of a grant\napplication. In general, audits conducted by the Council and reports on the\nactivities of grant applicants following the award of a Council grant, primarily made for the purpose of determining whether a grant recipient has\ncomplied with the terms of the grant, will be made available to the public\nunless solicited in confidence. In summary, it is the Council's policy to release as much\ninformation as possible. In individual instances, however, where, in addition\nto the above, it is felt that the release of information will constitue an\nunwarranted invasion of personal privacy, the public access officer is given\ndiscretion to delete items of information from documents\nrequested. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 9, Appendices, app\nW-1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
