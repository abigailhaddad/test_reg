  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 6-4.1 - Time for filing reports\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 211(1))\n(a) Reports must be filed at the times set\nforth in this section. (1)\n\nEvery calendar-year\ntaxpayer, except a taxable DISC and a New York S corporation, must file its\nannual report on or before the 15\nth\nday of April\nfollowing the close of its calendar year. (2)\n\nEvery fiscal-year taxpayer, except a\ntaxable DISC, must file its annual report on or before the 15\nth\nday of the fourth month following the close of its fiscal\nyear. (3)\n\nEvery taxpayer, except a\ntaxable DISC, using a 52-53 week accounting period must file its report on or\nbefore the 15th day of the fourth month following the date on which its fiscal\nyear is deemed to have ended. A 52-53 week accounting period that ends within\nseven days from the last day of any calendar month will be deemed to have ended\non the last day of that month. (4)\n(i) Where a corporation that is not part of a\n\nFederal consolidated group becomes part of such a group on a day other than the\nfirst day of its Federal taxable year (determined without reference to its\nmembership in the group), such taxpayer is required to file a Federal short\nperiod return for the period from the first day of its taxable year through the\nend of the day on which it becomes such a member. (26 CFR\n1.1502-76(b)\n\nSection\n6-1.2\n(b)(1) of this Part requires, in such an\ninstance, that the taxpayer file a short period report for purposes of article\n9-A covering the period covered by the Federal short period return (to the\nextent that it is subject to article 9-A during that period). Where the due\ndate for the Federal short period return is established pursuant to\n26 CFR\n1.1502-76(c)(1), or where\nthe Federal short period return is required pursuant to\n26 CFR\n1.1502-76(c)(2)\nto be filed\non or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of what would\nhave been the taxpayer's Federal taxable year, determined without regard to\nsuch membership, then the due date for the article 9-A short period report\nshall be the due date for the Federal short period return. This provision does\nnot apply in the case of Federal amended short period returns described in\n26 CFR\n1.1502-76(c)(2). The due\ndate for the article 9-A amended report, for the same short period covered by\nsuch Federal amended return (to the extent that it is subject to article 9-A\nduring such period), is prescribed by section\n6-1.4\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nWhere a taxpayer ceases to be part of a\n\nFederal consolidated group, including the case where it leaves one Federal\nconsolidated group to join another, an article 9-A short period report is\nrequired to be filed, covering the period from the beginning of its taxable\nyear for article 9-A purposes up to the date it leaves the group. Such report\nshall be filed on or before the 15th day of the fourth month following the\nclose of its taxable year under article 9-A determined without regard to its\ncessation of membership in such Federal consolidated group. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions in\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, no short period report is\nrequired to be filed if the corporation remains in the same New York State\ncombined group before and after the changes mentioned in such\nsubparagraphs. (5)\n\nIn\nthe case of an election made pursuant to IRC section 338, the old target\n(within the meaning of 26\nCFR\n1.338-10\n) may be required to file a final\nreport that is a short period report. In such event, the corporation, if a\ntaxpayer, must file a short period report for purposes of article 9-A covering\nthe same period as the Federal short period return (to the extent that it is\nsubject to article 9-A during such period). Such report shall be filed by the\ndue date for the Federal short period return as prescribed by\n26 CFR\n1.338-10, except that this provision shall\nnot apply to an amended return described in\n26 CFR\n1.338-10\nas a deemed sale return. The due\ndate for the article 9-A amended report, for the same short period covered by\nsuch Federal amended return (to the extent that it is subject to article 9-A\nduring such period), is prescribed by section\n6-1.4\nof this Part. (6)\n\nIn the case of an S corporation\ntermination year, the S short year and the C short year are treated as short\ntaxable years but the due date of the report for the S short year is the same\nas the due date of the report for the C short year.
