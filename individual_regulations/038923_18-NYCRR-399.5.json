  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 399.5 - Intentional program violation (acts occurring on or after August 1, 1983)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon discovery\nthat an overpayment in food stamps has occurred based upon the act or omission\nto act of a recipient or former recipient which occurred on or after August 1, 1983, the local social services district shall document the determination in\norder to reach a conclusion as to whether the overpayment was caused by an\ninadvertent household error or an intentional program violation. (b) In all instances of an overpayment in\nfood stamps based upon the act or omission to act of a recipient or former\nrecipient in the absence of the written authorization set forth in section\n399.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the local social services district shall treat the overpayment initially\nas a inadvertent household error and shall send a demand letter for repayment, approved by the department, to the household which identifies the overpayment\nas an inadvertent household error. Such letter shall provide, among other\nthings, the right to a fair hearing should the household disagree with the\ndetermination of the local district. (c) Should the local social services district\nfurther conclude that the overpayment was occasioned by an intentional program\nviolation and that referral to the local district attorney (or other local\nequivalent) pursuant to section\n399.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart is either not warranted or not possible due to the amount in issue, then\nthe local district may process the case for an administrative disqualification\nhearing. Such action should be taken either simultaneously with, or subsequent\nto, the acts required by subdivision (b) of this section. (d) Should the local social services district\nrefer an overpayment to the local district attorney (or other local equivalent)\npursuant to section\n399.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart, and should that local official decline prosecution or fail to take action\non the referral within a reasonable period of time, and the local district then\nelects to initiate procedures for an administrative disqualification hearing\npursuant to section\n399.7\nof this Part, the local\ndistrict must formally withdraw the referral in writing to the local official\nbefore referring the case to the department. Failure to present evidence of\nsuch a formal written withdrawal either in its evidentiary transmittal to the\ndepartment or at the hearing may result in an administrative disqualification\nhearing decision adverse to the district. (e) The evidentiary packet forwarded by the\nlocal district to the department accompanying the local social services\ndistrict's request for an administrative disqualification hearing shall have\nconsecutively numbered pages, shall be submitted in three copies and shall\ninclude but not be limited to the items particularly set forth in section\n399.3\n(i)(1)-(9)\nof this Part. (f) All evidentiary\npackets shall be submitted to the office accompanied by a request for an\nadministrative disqualification hearing and shall be mailed to the Office of\n\nAdministrative Hearings, New York State Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance.
