  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 354.6 - Calculation of benefits for restored members\n\nState Regulations\n\nUpon retirement of a restored member, benefits shall be\npayable as follows: (a) If the member\nhas not earned at least two years of member service credit subsequent to\nrestoration of membership, there shall not be a recalculation of benefits. Rather, the original retirement allowance under the option previously\nestablished shall be reinstated, and member contributions made since such\nrestoration shall be refunded to the member by the Retirement System. The\noriginal retirement date shall remain applicable for the purposes of\ndetermining eligibility for post-retirement death benefits. (b) If the member has earned at least two\nyears of member service credit after restoration, such member shall, at his or\nher option, be eligible to retire with either of the following benefit\ncalculations: (1)\n\nThe member shall be\ncredited with all member service earned subsequent to restoration to\nmembership, and receive a retirement allowance which shall consist of the\nactuarial equivalent of the pension which the member was receiving immediately\nprior to the last restoration to membership, plus a pension based upon the\nmember service credit earned subsequent to restoration to membership. Such\nlatter pension shall be computed as if he or she were a new member when he or\nshe last became a member. (2)\n\nThe\ntotal service credited at the time of the earlier retirement may, at the\nmember's option, again be credited, in addition to all member service earned\nsubsequent to restoration to membership, if the member returns to the\n\nRetirement System the actuarial equivalent of the amount of retirement benefits\nreceived, plus interest at the rate of five percent per annum. In the event\nsuch amount is not so repaid, such actuarial equivalent shall be deducted from\nthe subsequent retirement allowance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n354.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
