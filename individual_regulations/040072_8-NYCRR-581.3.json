  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 581.3 - Special regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Restricted areas\n(1)\n\nLoading zones -\ndeliveries. Each building on the campus and each dining hall is provided with a\nloading zone adjacent to the building. No parking is permitted in these loading\nzones except as specifically marked for State vehicles and for persons with\nspecial needs. \"Standing\" is permitted in loading zones while a delivery or\npick-up is being made. Such \"standing\" is presumed to be short in duration and\nis not to exceed the period during which the vehicle is required to complete\nloading or unloading. After 15 minutes, all vehicles used for pick-up or\ndelivery must be attended. An attended vehicle is defined as one with the\ndriver helper, or a member of the college staff able to move the vehicle and in\nthe immediate vicinity of the vehicle. (2)\n\nFire zones and fire lanes\n(i) Each loading zone is by definition a fire\nzone. Additional fire zones adjacent to a building may be established from time\nto time by the Chief of University Police. Fire zones are areas, paved or\nunpaved, that permit firefighting equipment to come as close to the building as\npossible. They are also areas within 15 feet around a fire hydrant or a stand\npipe connection. No parking is allowed in a fire zone at any time except as\ndefined above. Any vehicle parked in a fire zone id subject to towing at any\ntime. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of traffic\ncontrol, roadways on the campus are divided into two classifications: peripheral or arterial roads and access roads. An example of the former is the\n\nRing Road around the college campus, in addition to Apple, Birch and Cherry\n\nRoads, hereinafter referred to as \"A,\" \"B,\" and \"C\" Gate Roads. An example of\nthe latter is the narrow road leading to Empire State College, parking lot\nroadways and entrances to and exits from parking bays. All access roads are by\ndefinition fire lanes. Neither parking nor standing is permitted in a fire\nlane. While in general the college will attempt to mark all fire lanes and all\nfire zones, lack of such marking will not relieve a violator of responsibility\nfor obeying this Part. All walkways on campus are by definition fire lanes and\nsimilar restrictions apply. (3)\n\nWalkways. Any paved way on the campus\nthat is not defined as a roadway is by definition a walkway. No driving is\npermitted on any walk-way except under emergency circumstances. Emergencies are\npresumed to refer to the need to bring fire, rescue, ambulance or police\nvehicles close to a building in order to safeguard lives or property. The use\nof walkways by vendors, any State service vehicle, and contractor personnel is\nexplicitly forbidden. Where exceptional circumstances require vehicle access to\na walkway, permission must be obtained in advance from the Chief of University\n\nPolice on a case by case basis. Permission in one instance is not a precedent\nand does not carry over to like circumstances in the future. (4)\n\nDedicated spaces\n(i) From time to time various units of the\ncollege establish temporary dedicated parking spaces. These spaces are not\nconsidered official when they apply to individuals, whether identified by name\nor by title. The only dedicated spaces that have official sanction either\ntemporarily or on a permanent basis, are those established by the Chief of\n\nUniversity Police. (ii)\n\nAll\nvisitors to campus shall first stop at the University Police Department to\nobtain a temporary parking pass. (b) Special vehicles\n(1)\n\nService vehicles (general) The university\nenters into a number of service contracts. Contractors include those that\nservice signal systems, computer companies that service data processing\nequipment; various elevator companies, the telephone company, and the like. Vehicles belonging to such contractors may be considered authorized State\nvehicles for the purposes of special parking needs. All contractors must make\napplication to the Chief of University Police for special permits. In general, such permits will be issued only for a car that is\n(i) clearly the property of the contractor, and\n(ii)\nappropriately so marked on\nthe outside of the vehicle. Such permits will be valid only for that period\nthat the service person is on call and on duty in a given building. Under no\ncircumstances are these to be considered parking permits. Proof of ownership by\nthe corporation and proof of on-call status may be required by police officers\ncharged with enforcing the traffic regulations. Requests for such permits must\nbe submitted in writing on the company letterhead and signed by a responsible\nofficer of the contractor. They should contain an adequate description of the\nvehicle (s) and the names of those individuals who may be driving the. Such\nrequests should be submitted for validation to the college office responsible\nfor monitoring the activity of the contractor. For instance, fire alarm and\nother signal systems should be validated by the University Police Department. Other contractors should obtain validation from the department that is the\ndirect beneficiary of their services. If there is any uncertainty about the\nbeneficiary, the Chief of University Police is empowered to make a\ndetermination and request such validation from the appropriate unit. (2)\n\nService vehicles (Vendors)\n\nVendors that regularly provide direct services to the campus and use their own\nvehicles may also apply for special permits. Examples of these are vending\nmachine contractors, laundry equipment contractors and the like. They must make\napplication in each case in writing. If in the performance of the work, these\ncontractors require access to a building through other than service areas, they\nmust seek approval of the Chief of University Police and conform to the special\nconditions which will be indicated on the face of the permit. (3)\n\nSalespeople. All salespeople who come to\nthe campus on legitimate business may be given visitors' parking permits. Such\npermits will be in general valid for the day of issuance. Salespeople with\nspecial requirements, as for instance, heavy sample cases and the like, must\nrequest special permission from the Chief of University Police if they wish to\npark close to a building. (4)\n\nRegulations governing the sale of food on campus by mobile vendors\n(i) No person may sell or distribute food or\nfood stuffs on campus from any mobile vehicle, temporary stand, push cart, r\nother similar item without written authorization of the vice president for\nbusiness & finance, or his or her designee. This shall not apply to\nindividuals or companies contracting with the college or authorized agents on\nthe campus, nor shall it apply to sales of food conducted over the telephone\nand completed by delivery on the campus. (ii)\n\nFood vendors must obey all traffic\nregulations while on campus, and authorization for the use of the campus may be\nrevoked for failure to comply with those regulations\n(iii)\n\nUpon applying for authorization any\nvendor must show that it is in compliance with all appropriate New York\nstatutes governing the vending of food. The vendor must remain in compliance\nwith those requirements whenever conducting business on campus. (iv)\nA vendor must retain authorization from\nthe vice president of business & finance at all times while on campus for\nthe purpose of selling food. If convenient, the authorization should be\ndisplayed, but must be shown upon the request of any University Police officer\nor other college official. (v) A\nvendor may be required by the college to leave a specific area or to leave\ncampus at any time for good reason, and any area of the campus or the entire\ncampus may be closed to vendors for good reason. (vi)\n\nWritten authorization shall be valid\nfrom the date of approval until June 30 next, except that the college may\nrevoke that authorization at any time for failure to comply with college\nregulations. No authorization shall be valid for more than one year. Motor\nvehicle registration may be obtained upon presentation of the valid\nauthorization and completion of other parking or traffic\nrequirements. (vii)\n\nThe college\nreserves the right at any time to require vendors or any individual vendor to\nsubmit to a medical or health examination, either in compliance with State or\nlocal requirements. Refusal to submit to such an examination shall be grounds\nfor revocation of any authorization or for not granting\nauthorization. (viii)\n\nNo vendor may\ndiscriminate against any person on the basis of race, color, creed, religion, gender, gender identification, sexual orientation or appearance either in\nemployment or in the conduct of its business.

All cars operated in connection\nwith a construction project on the campus and belonging to contractor personnel\nare required to observe campus traffic regulations. Such cars still need to\nregister with the University Police Department, and to the extent possible, should park in an area physically separated from other campus parking\nareas. (ii)\n\nOperations. Vehicles\nmaking deliveries to a contractor site may not park in roadways for loading or\nunloading or for the operation of special equipment without prior written\napproval of the Chief of University Police. Such written approval will have\nstated the special conditions under which such vehicles may park or stand in\nroadways. The approval must be in the vehicle at all times, available to\ninspection by University Police officers. Failure to present such a permit on\ndemand will subject the driver to the appropriate citation. Contractor vehicles\nmay not drive on walkways except under the conditions outlined elsewhere in\nthis Part. (6)\n\nMotorcycles.
