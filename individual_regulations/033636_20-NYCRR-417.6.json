Tit. 20 § 417.6 - Cancellation or suspension of a license as an importing transporter\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283-a(4), (5)\n(a) The license of any importing transporter, in the circumstances described herein, may be cancelled or suspended by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance pursuant to the provisions of this section. A determination as to whether a license should be cancelled or suspended and\nthe duration of suspension will be made by the department on the basis of the\ncircumstances in each case. The department may, in its discretion, continue\nsuch license upon such terms and conditions as it may deem necessary in\nprotection of the revenues under articles 12-A, 28 and 29 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (b) (1)\n\nGenerally, a license will not be\ncancelled nor suspended unless the licensee has had an opportunity for a\nhearing. (See subdivision [c] of this section for exceptions.) A license as an\nimporting transporter may be cancelled or suspended upon a licensee's: (i) failure to file a bond or deposit\nacceptable security (or increase the amounts thereof) as required by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; (ii)\nfailure to comply with any of the\nprovisions of article 12-A of the Tax Law or article 28 of such law with\nrespect to motor fuel, or any rule or regulation pursuant to article 12-A of\nthe Tax Law or article 28 of such law in respect to motor fuel; or\n(iii)\nupon a licensee's knowingly aiding and\nabetting another person in violating any of the provisions of such articles or\nof such rules or regulations in respect to motor fuel. (2)\n(i) A\nlicense as an importing transporter may also be cancelled or suspended if it is\ndetermined that the licensee or an officer, director, shareholder, employee or\npartner of the licensee who as such is under a duty to act for such licensee: (a) commits fraud or deceit in operating as\nan importing transporter or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring a\nlicense as an importing transporter; (b) has been convicted in a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, either within or without the State of New York, of a\nfelony, bearing on such transporter's duties and obligations under any article\nof the Tax Law; (c) has knowingly\naided and abetted a person, who is not registered as a distributor, in the\nimportation, production, refining, manufacturing or compounding of motor fuel\ninto or within New York State; or\n(d) has knowingly aided and abetted the\ndistribution of motor fuel imported or caused to be imported into or produced, refined, manufactured or compounded within New York State by a person who is\nnot registered as a distributor of motor fuel pursuant to article 12-A of the\n\nTax Law. (ii)\n(a) A felony for purposes of clause\n(i)(\nb\n) of this paragraph includes the conviction of a felony\nby any court in this State, the United States or any other state of the United\n\nStates. Provided, however, if a crime of which a person is convicted by any\nsuch court, other than a court in this State, is a felony in such jurisdiction\nof conviction but is not a felony in the State of New York, the conviction is\nnot deemed a conviction of a felony for purposes of article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw. Conversely, in the event that a crime of which a person is convicted by\nany such court, other than a court in this State, is not a felony in such\njurisdiction of conviction but is a felony in New York State, the conviction is\ndeemed a conviction of a felony for purposes of article 12-A. (b) If a conviction of a felony is\nsubsequently set aside or reversed upon appeal and the accused is acquitted or\ndischarged, any license as an importing transporter which was cancelled or\nsuspended based on such conviction may be restored upon application to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. In addition, if a person is convicted of a\ncrime, hereby deemed to be a felony, and such person is subsequently pardoned\nby the governor of the state of conviction or by the President of the United\n\nStates, or if such person receives a certificate of good conduct granted by the\n\nBoard of Parole pursuant to the provisions of the Executive Law for purpose of\nremoving the disability because of such conviction, the department may, in its\ndiscretion, on application and submission of satisfactory evidence of good\nmoral character and suitability relicense the person as an importing\ntransporter. (c) (1)\nA license as an importing transporter may\nbe cancelled or suspended without a prior hearing for failure to file, within\n10 days after the date prescribed for filing, a return or report under article\n12-A of the Tax Law, or for nonpayment of any sums due pursuant to article 12-A\nand articles 28 and 29 with respect to motor fuel, if such returns or reports\nhave not been filed and/or such taxes paid 10 days after the date a demand\ntherefor is sent by registered or certified mail to the importing transporter\nat the address given in such transporter's application for license (as same may\nhave been amended in accordance with section\n417.5\n[a]\nof this Part). (2)\nA license as an\nimporting transporter may be cancelled or suspended prior to a hearing for\nfailure to continue to maintain in full force and effect at all times the bond\nor other security required to be filed with the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. If, however, a surety bond is cancelled prior to its expiration, the\ndepartment, after considering all relevant circumstances, may make such other\narrangements and require the filing of such other bond or acceptable security\nas it deems appropriate. (3)\nA\nlicense as an importing transporter may also be cancelled or suspended prior to\na hearing if such license is transferred without written approval of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance.
