Such information must be documented with the personnel's pre-employment screening information and, if hired, retained in the personnel file; provided, however, that nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require an adult care facility to make any hiring determination based upon the prospective personnel's COVID-19 vaccination status, history, or interest in COVID-19 vaccination; and\n(ii)\nwithin seven days of hiring new personnel, the facility shall make diligent efforts to schedule all consenting and eligible new personnel for the COVID-19 vaccination.

(c) The facility shall further provide all current and new personnel and residents who decline to be vaccinated a written affirmation for their signature, which indicates that they were offered the opportunity for the facility to arrange for a COVID-19 vaccination, but declined. Such affirmation must state that the signatory is aware that, if they later decide to be vaccinated for COVID-19, it is their responsibility to request the facility arrange for their vaccination. The facility shall maintain signed affirmations on file at the facility and make such forms available at the request of the Department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
