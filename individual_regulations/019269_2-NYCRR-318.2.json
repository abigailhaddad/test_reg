  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 318.2 - Establishing eligibility for retirement benefits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A member of the New York State and Local\n\nEmployees' Retirement System or New York State and Local Police and Fire\n\nRetirement System will be considered to have been engaged in \"continuous\nservice\", as that term is used in section\n441\n(c) of the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, or to have rendered creditable service \"during which employment\" he became\na member, as that term is used in sections 446-(c), 513(b) and 609(b) of such\nlaw, only for the purpose of establishing eligibility for a retirement benefit, if, during the period in question, he was eligible to receive service credit, and he met any of the following requirements: (1)\n\nHe received compensation for each day in\nthe period. (2)\n\nHe worked a minimum\nof 1,000 hours per year, or a minimum of 700 hours per year with respect to\nindividuals who are statutorily entitled to receive one year of actual service\ncredit for rendering either 180 or 200 days of service in a year. For the\npurpose of this requirement a person shall be deemed to have received\ncompensation for each day of a calendar month if he shall have earned at least\n20 hours of salary during such a month. This 1,000-hour minimum will be based\nupon the State fiscal year, but will be prorated for less than a full State\nfiscal year in the case of the first and last year of employment. If a\nparticipating employer has not certified to the retirement system the number of\nhours worked by a member, the total hours worked during the State fiscal year\nwill be determined by dividing the gross salary received in the State fiscal\nyear by the member's hourly rate of pay, if known, or by the State's minimum\nwage during such period, if the member's hourly rate of pay is not\nknown. (b) In addition\nto meeting one of the requirements set forth in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, a member who derives his eligibility to retire from the provisions of\nsection 441(c) of such law, as interpreted by this section, must have rendered\na minimum of five years of \"service\", as that term is defined in section\n441(c). (c) The first 24 months (or\nlast, as appropriate) during which the member was on authorized medical leave\nor on authorized leave status and receiving workers' compensation benefits\nshall not be considered in determining breaks in continuous service.
