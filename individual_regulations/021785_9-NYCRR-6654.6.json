Tit. 9 § 6654.6 - EISEP cost-sharing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) EISEP clients shall pay cost-sharing for\nin-home, ancillary, and noninstitutional respite services received under the\nclient's care plan according to a sliding scale, subject to adjustments\npursuant to this section, reflecting the cost of such services and client\nincome so that: (1)\nno cost-sharing will be\ncharged clients whose income is at or below 150 percent of poverty levels\nspecified by the office (unless they are eligible for Medicaid); (2)\nthe full cost of services will be charged\nclients whose income is at or above 250 percent of poverty levels specified by\nthe office and clients who are eligible for Medicaid; (3)\npartial cost-sharing will be charged\nclients whose income is between 150 percent and 250 percent of poverty levels\nspecified by the office; and\n(4)\nno\ncost-sharing will be charged clients for durable items provided on a loan basis\nas an ancillary service. (b) Adjusted monthly income: (1)\nincludes, to the extent available, income\nof the client's spouse if the client is living with his or her spouse; and\n(2)\nequals monthly income minus\nthe threshold and the housing adjustment; (i) monthly income is the clients's income during the month in which the client's\ncare plan is prepared, including a proportionate share of annual income\nreceived less frequently than monthly: (a) consisting of money regularly received, after the payment of Federal, State, and local personal income taxes, from: (1)\nwages or salary; (2)\nnet income\n(gross income minus expenses incurred in generating the income up to the amount\nof gross income) from: (i) farm and nonfarm\nself-employment; (ii)\nbuying and\nselling real or personal property on a regular basis; (iii)\nroomers or boarders and rental of\nproperty; (3)\nsocial\nsecurity old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits; (4)\npensions and annuities; and\n(5)\ninterest and dividends; (b) excluding: (1)\nincome from participation in the Senior\n\nCommunity Services Employment Program under title V of the Older Americans Act, Job Training Partnership Act, Foster Grandparent Program, or other programs\nestablished to foster employment of lower income elderly or to support\nvolunteer efforts by the elderly; (2)\nunearned income from one-time lump sum\npayments such as insurance benefits, irregular gifts or contributions, the Real\n\nProperty Tax Credit, and the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance\n\nProgram; (3)\nsums which the client\nis obligated to repay, such as proceeds from reverse mortgages and other home\nequity conversion plans; and\n(4)\ngoods, services, or benefits received in kind, such as food stamp coupon\nallotments; (ii)\nthe threshold is the amount of monthly\nincome to be exempt from cost-sharing for all clients as specified by the\noffice. (At the time these regulations were originally promulgated, the\nthreshold was $905 for clients living with spouses whose income is available to\nmeet their needs and $670 for all other clients.) Thresholds are adjusted\nregularly by the office to reflect changes in the consumer price index for all\nitems, between the third quarters of the preceding two calendar\nyears; (iii)\nthe housing adjustment\nis the amount by which the client's average monthly housing expenses exceed 40\npercent of the threshold, except that the housing adjustment shall not exceed\n40 percent of the threshold; (a) housing\nexpenses are costs incurred against the client's income for renting or owning\nthe housing unit in which the client lives, including rent, property taxes, mortgage payments, heating, telephone installation and local service, and other\nutilities; (b) average monthly\nhousing expenses are housing expenses payable from the client's income during\nthe month in which the client's care plan is prepared, including a\nproportionate share of annual heating and other costs which occur less\nfrequently than monthly or are subject to seasonal variation. (c) Cost-sharing charged a client equals the adjusted cost of in-home, ancillary, and noninstitutional respite services received by the client under the care\nplan, multiplied by the percentage of cost to be charged given the client's\nadjusted monthly income as specified in the current cost-share schedule\nspecified by the office, except that total cost sharing charged a client living\nwith a spouse who is also a client receiving in-home, ancillary, or\nnoninstitutional respite services under a care plan shall not exceed one half\nthe adjusted monthly income, and total cost-sharing charged any other client\nshall not exceed the client's adjusted monthly income. (1)\n\nThe adjusted cost of an in-home, ancillary, or noninstitutional respite service equals the number of units\nreceived by the client under the care plan multiplied by the unit cost for the\nservice under the county's approved county home care plan for functionally\nimpaired elderly (or, if no such cost is stated in the plan, the actual cost\nincurred in providing or purchasing the service for the client) or, for clients\nrequired to pay less than the full cost of the service, by the lesser of the\nunit cost specified in such approved plan (or, if none, the actual cost\nincurred) or the statewide average unit cost of the service, if any, as\nspecified by the office. (2)\n\nThe\npercentage of cost to be charged a client shall be determined according to the\nclient's adjusted monthly income in accordance with the current cost-share\nschedule specified by the office. The cost-share schedule is adjusted regularly\nby the office to reflect changes in the consumer price index for all items, between the third quarters of the preceding two calendar years.
