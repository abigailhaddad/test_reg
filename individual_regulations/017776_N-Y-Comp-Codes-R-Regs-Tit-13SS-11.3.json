(ii)\n\nTo request a temporary hardship exemption, the investment adviser must: (a) file form ADV-H (Application for Temporary or Continuing Hardship Exemption) (17-CFR 279.3) in paper format with the Department of Law, no later than\none business day after the filing (that is the subject of the form ADV-H) was due; and\n(b) submit the\nfiling that is subject of the form ADV-H in electronic format to IARD no later than seven business days after the filing was due. (iii)\n\nEffective date-upon filing. The temporary hardship exemption will be deemed effective upon receipt\nby the Department of Law of the complete form ADV-H. Multiple temporary hardship exemption requests within the same calendar year may be disallowed\nby the Department of Law. (2)\n\nContinuing hardship exemption. (i) Criteria for exemption. A continuing hardship exemption will be granted only if the investment adviser is able\nto demonstrate that the electronic filing requirements of this rule are prohibitively burdensome. (ii)\n\nTo\napply for a continuing hardship exemption, the investment adviser must: (a) File form ADV-H (17 CFR\n279.3\n) in paper format with the Department of Law at least 20 business days before a filing is due.
