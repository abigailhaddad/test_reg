Should the chairperson authorize\nelectronic filing of such charge, the filing of a signed paper original\nconsistent with this section and electronic filing and service of a copy shall\nconstitute compliance with the filing and service requirements herein\ncontained. (2)\n\nIf the facts\nconstituting the alleged improper practice are also alleged to support a claim\nby an employee organization that a public employer or its representatives\nengaged in such acts of extreme provocation as to detract from the\nresponsibility of the employee organization for a strike, then the charge may\nnot be filed after the date on which the employee organization is required to\nfile its answer to the strike charge pursuant to section\n206.5\nof this Chapter. (3)\n\nThe charge shall be in writing on a form\nprescribed by the board and shall be signed and sworn to before any person\nauthorized to administer oaths. (b) Contents of charge. The charge shall include the following: (1)\nthe name, address and affiliation, if\nany, of the charging party, and the title of any representative filing the\ncharge; (2)\nthe name and address of\nthe respondent or respondents and any other party named therein; (3)\na clear and concise statement, preferably\nin numbered or lettered paragraphs, of the facts constituting the alleged\nimproper practice, including the names, and, where known or relevant, the\ntitles and work locations of the individuals involved in the alleged improper\npractice; the date and the place of the occurrence of each particular act\nalleged; and the subsections of section 209-a of the act alleged to have been\nviolated. Evidentiary exhibits may be attached but will not relieve the\ncharging party of the requirement to provide sufficient factual particulars as\nset forth herein; (4)\nif the charge\nalleges a violation of section 209-a.1(d) or section 209-a.2(b) of the act, whether the charging party has notified the board in writing of the existence\nof an impasse pursuant to section\n205.1\nof this Chapter; and\n(5)\na statement that the\ncharging party is available to participate in the prehearing conference and the\nformal hearing immediately. (c) Scope of negotiations cases. Where the primary basis of the dispute between the parties is\nalleged to be a disagreement as to the scope of negotiations under the act, either party may request of the director or an assigned administrative law\njudge that the matter be accorded expedited treatment. (d) Amendments. The director or administrative law judge designated by the\ndirector may permit a charging party to amend the charge upon good cause shown\nbefore, during or after the conclusion of the hearing upon such terms as may be\ndeemed just and consistent with due process. (e) Withdrawals. A charge may be withdrawn by the charging party before\nissuance of a decision and recommended order based thereon upon approval by the\ndirector. Thereafter, a charge may be withdrawn only with the approval of the\nboard. Requests to the director to withdraw a charge or to the board to\nwithdraw a charge will be approved unless to do so would be inconsistent with\nthe purposes and policies of the act or due process of law. Whenever the\ndirector approves the withdrawal of a charge, or the board approves the\nwithdrawal of the charge, the case will be closed without consideration or\nreview of any of the issues raised by the charge.
