  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.8 - Determination to conduct a public comment hearing or adjudicatory proceeding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After a permit\napplication for a major project is complete (see provisions of sections\n621.3, 621.4\nand\n621.6\nof this Part), and notice in\naccordance with section\n621.7\nof this Part has been\nprovided, the department must evaluate the application and any comments\nreceived to determine whether a public comment hearing will be held, whether\nthe department will refer the matter to OHMS for adjudicatory proceedings\npursuant to Part 624 of this Title, or that neither is necessary. This must be\ndone within 60 days of the date the application is complete. The department\nmust notify, by mail, the applicant and persons who have filed comments on the\napplication of the department's determination to hold a public comment hearing\nor refer the matter to OHMS for adjudicatory proceedings. A hearing may either\nbe a public comment hearing pursuant to this Part or an adjudicatory proceeding\npursuant to Part 624 of this Title. The Uniform Procedures time frames are\nsuspended as of the date the department notifies the applicant of its decision\nto hold either a public comment hearing pursuant to this Part or an\nadjudicatory proceeding pursuant to Part 624 of this Title. In the case of a\ndecision to hold an adjudicatory proceeding, the time frames of Part 624 of\nthis Title apply. Where timeframes under this Part are suspended for a public\ncomment hearing held pursuant to this Part, the uniform procedures time frames\nto determine if the department will refer the matter to OHMS for adjudicatory\nproceedings and for final decision shall resume upon staff's receipt of the\ncomplete public hearing record. (b) The determination to refer a matter to OHMS for adjudicatory proceedings\npursuant to Part 624 of this Title shall be based on whether the department's\nreview of the application materials or comments identifies substantive and\nsignificant issues relating to any findings or determinations the department is\nrequired to make pursuant to the Environmental Conservation Law. This includes\nthe reasonable likelihood that the permit application will be denied or can be\ngranted only if significant changes are made to the project because the\nproject, as proposed, fails to meet statutory or regulatory criteria or\nstandards. In addition, where any comments received from members of the public\nor other interested parties raise substantive and significant issues relating\nto the application, and resolution of any such issue may result in denial of\nthe permit application, or the imposition of significant conditions thereon, the department must refer the matter to OHMS for an adjudicatory proceeding on\nthe application. (c) When there is\nno referral to OHMS for an adjudicatory proceeding, the department has the\ndiscretion to hold a public comment hearing based on the following: (1)\nif a significant degree of public\ninterest exists, as determined by the department; (2)\nto fulfill the requirements of Section\n617.9\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Title; or\n(3)\nfor HWMF permits\nor RAPs, if notification of opposition to a draft permit or RAP, and a request\nfor a hearing is received during the public comment period. (d) Mere expressions of general\nopposition to a project are insufficient grounds for holding a public comment\nhearing or for referring a project to OHMS for an adjudicatory proceeding on a\npermit application. In order to raise substantive and significant issues, written comments expressing objection or opposition to an application must\nexplain the basis of that opposition and identify the specific grounds which\ncould lead the department to deny or impose significant conditions on the\npermit. (e) The department normally\ndoes not require public hearings in connection with applications for minor\nprojects, as identified in sections\n621.3\nand\n621.4\nof this Part. If a public\nhearing is required for a minor project, the application shall be treated as a\nmajor project for purposes of this Part. (f) If a public comment hearing on an\napplication is required to be held, it must commence on or before 90 days after\nthe date the application is complete. (g) Public comment hearings pursuant to this\n\nPart may be conducted by electronic means or in-person events at the discretion\nof the department. (h) When public\nnotice under this section also includes modification to a permit for any of the\nreasons set forth in 621.13(a)(1)-(6) of this Part, the permittee may submit a\nwritten statement to the Regional Permit Administrator or Chief Permit\n\nAdministrator, as directed by the notice, commenting on proposed modifications\nor giving reasons why the permit should not be modified. The permittee must\nsubmit the statement by the deadline for receipt of comments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
