  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 705.6 - Interview Protocols\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Determinations regarding appropriateness of conducting an interview. (1)\n\nPrior to commencing an interview, an\ninvestigator must determine if the interview can be conducted in a safe, sensitive and timely manner. To make this determination, an investigator may\nconsider any relevant facts or circumstances, including: the setting where and\ncircumstances under which the interview is to be conducted; the opinion of a\nservice recipient's personal representative; the service recipient's diagnosis; any information received after consulting with the service recipient's licensed\nhealth professionals; information in the service recipient's files; observations of the service recipient's behavior; information obtained from\nservice provider employees; the service recipient's capability to provide\ninformation to assist the investigation; and information obtained from engaging\nin preliminary inquiries with service recipients to establish that proceeding\nwith an interview would be appropriate. (2)\nA formal clinical assessment is not\nrequired prior to interviewing a service recipient. (3)\n\nIf conducting an interview of the service\nrecipient would be clinically contraindicated, despite the provision of\nappropriate accommodations, the interview shall not take place, except where\ncircumstances exist which support a determination that there exists an\noverriding health and safety need to proceed with the interview. Such\ncircumstances may include but not be limited to: an investigator reasonably\nbelieves that a service recipient has information relevant to maintaining or\nsecuring the safety of service recipients and is capable of reliably\ncommunicating that information; an investigator reasonably believes that\nfailure to interview a service recipient may allow for the destruction of\nevidence or for a subject to evade law enforcement; or a delay in interviewing\na service recipient may allow a subject to evade law enforcement. Prior to\nproceeding with the interview, the investigator shall consult with and obtain\napproval of their supervisor. Further, such investigator shall document in the\ninvestigative record the reason why it was appropriate to proceed with the\ninterview and include the steps taken to protect the service recipient's\nhealth, safety, and wellbeing during the interview. (b) Information from a service provider. (1)\n\nAn investigator must notify a service\nprovider if they will need specific information from a service provider to\ndetermine whether to proceed with an interview, including the identity of any\nadditional service recipient witnesses for whom the service provider did not\nmake the required notification as set forth in section\n705.5\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nThe service provider\nshall supply the Justice Center or the delegate investigatory entity with the\nrequested information within 72 hours of receiving such notification from an\ninvestigator. (3)\n\nThe requested\ninformation may be conveyed verbally or in writing. (c) Communication. If an investigator\ndetermines that a service recipient may have difficulty comprehending questions\ndue to linguistic or other barriers, such investigator shall work with a\nservice provider to provide the service recipient with the means to communicate\nwith the investigator. (d) Personal\n\nRepresentative Presence at an Interview. (1)\nA\npersonal representative may be permitted to accompany a service recipient who\nis an alleged victim or a potential witness during an interview, except when: (i) the service recipient objects to the\npersonal representative being present during the interview; or\n(ii)\nthe investigator believes the presence\nof the personal representative would impede the investigation. Objections by a\nservice recipient to a personal representative being present during an\ninterview should be reviewed on an individual basis consistent with the\nexisting standards that the re levant state oversight agency requires to be\nused to determine the ability of a service recipient to consent to services, programs and treatment. (2)\n\nWhen a service recipient is being\ninterviewed as a potential witness, the investigator should be especially\nsensitive to the presence a personal representative if the service recipient\nwitness will be questioned about injuries or other confidential information\nrelating to the alleged victim of abuse or neglect. In any instance in which\nconfidential information will be discussed, the investigator may require that: (i) the personal representative leave the\ninterview during the time in which confidential information is discussed; or\n(ii)\nthe personal representative\nbe present outside the interview room or available by telephone, to provide any\nneeded support to the service recipient during the interview process. (3)\n\nIf a personal representative\nis allowed to be present during an interview, the personal representative may\nnot interfere with the interview. If an investigator believes that the personal\nrepresentative is interfering with the interview, the investigator may take\nappropriate actions to prevent such interference, including speaking with the\npersonal representative or stopping the interview. If an investigator\ndetermines that a personal representative should not be present or should leave\nan interview once it is underway, the investigator must document the rationale\nfor such decision in the investigative record. (4)\n\nIf a personal representative cannot\nattend an interview in a timely manner, the service provider may provide\nappropriate technology to allow the personal representative to participate in\nthe interview. This may entail the use of a conference call line or a video\nconference, if available. An investigator shall not be required to unreasonably\ndelay an interview to allow for a personal representative to\nparticipate. (e) Information for service recipients. Prior to beginning an interview with a\nservice recipient, the investigator shall advise service recipients and/or\ntheir personal representatives about what to expect in an interview. The\ninvestigator shall explain that participation in an interview is voluntary. In\naddition, and as applicable, the investigator shall advise the service\nrecipient and/or their personal representative about searches of the service\nrecipient's personal property and searches of the service recipient's person\nfor the purposes of non-criminal investigations.
