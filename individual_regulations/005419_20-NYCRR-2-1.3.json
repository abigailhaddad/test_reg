  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 2-1.3 - Fiscal-year taxpayers\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(10))\n(a) A taxpayer that reports on the basis of a\nfiscal year for Federal income tax purposes must report on the same basis for\npurposes of article 9-A. A fiscal year is a period not longer than 12 calendar\nmonths, or any shorter period beginning on the date the taxpayer becomes\nsubject to tax and ending on the last day of any month other than December. A\nfiscal year also includes, in the case of a taxpayer that changes the period on\nthe basis of which it keeps its books from a calendar year to a fiscal year, or\nfrom one fiscal year to another fiscal year, the period from the close of its\nlast calendar or fiscal year up to the date designated as the close of its new\nfiscal year. A fiscal year also includes a 52-53 week accounting period if the\ntaxpayer has elected such period for Federal income tax purposes. (b) A taxpayer reporting on a fiscal-year\nbasis must keep its books on such basis. (c) Examples. Example 1: A domestic corporation is incorporated in New\n\nYork State on November 19, 2021. The corporation selects the fiscal-year basis\nof reporting and uses the date November 30th as the last day of its fiscal\nyear. The corporation is subject to tax for the period November 19, 2021, to\n\nNovember 30, 2021, and must file a report for that period. The report must be\nfiled on or before March 15, 2022. Example 2: A foreign corporation, which reports for\n\nFederal income tax purposes on a fiscal-year basis, uses September 30th as the\nlast day of its fiscal year. The corporation leases a store in New York City on\n\nMarch 1, 2021. The corporation continues to do business throughout the year\n2021. Since the taxpayer reports for Federal income tax purposes on a\nfiscal-year basis, its first taxable year for purposes of article 9-A begins\n\nMarch 1, 2021, and its tax is computed on the basis of an accounting period\nthat begins October 1, 2020, and ends September 30, 2021. The report must be\nfiled on or before January 15, 2022. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n2-1.3\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
