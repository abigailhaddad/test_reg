  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.203 - Instrument, control and sampling piping and components\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to the design of\ninstrument, control, and sampling piping and components. It does not apply to\npermanently closed systems, such as fluid-filled temperature-responsive\ndevices. (b) All materials employed\nfor pipe and components must be designed to meet the particular conditions of\nservice and the following paragraphs: (1)\n\nEach\ntakeoff connection and attaching boss, fitting, or adapter must be made of\nmaterial suitable to withstand the maximum service pressure and temperature of\nthe pipe or equipment to which it is attached, and be designed to\nsatisfactorily withstand all stresses without failure by fatigue. (2)\n\nExcept for takeoff lines that can be\nisolated from sources of pressure by other valving, a shut-off valve must be\ninstalled in each takeoff line as near as practicable to the point of takeoff. Blow-down valves must be installed where necessary. (3)\n\nBrass or copper material may not be used\nfor metal temperatures greater than 400° F (204° C). (4)\n\nPipe or components that may contain\nliquids must be protected by heating or other means from damage due to\nfreezing. (5)\n\nPipe or components in\nwhich liquids may accumulate must have drains or drips. (6)\n\nPipe or components subject to clogging\nfrom solids or deposits must have suitable connections for cleaning. (7)\n\nThe arrangement of pipe, components, and\nsupports must provide safety under anticipated operating stresses. (8)\n\nEach joint between sections of pipe, and\nbetween pipe and valves or fittings, must be made in a manner suitable for the\nanticipated pressure and temperature condition. Slip type expansion joints may\nnot be used. Expansion must be allowed for by providing flexibility within the\nsystem itself. (9)\n\nEach control\nline must be protected from anticipated causes of damage and must be designed\nand installed to prevent damage to any one control line from making both the\nregulator and the over-pressure protective device inoperative. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.203\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
