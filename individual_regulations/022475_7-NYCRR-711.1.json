  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 711.1 - Policy\n\nState Regulations\nA major departmental objective is to foster ties to the\ncommunity that will help create stability in the inmate's personal life. The\ndepartment recognizes that a marriage can assist in creating that personal\nstability. Accordingly, the department will provide appropriate assistance to\ninmates who wish to become married. The department also recognizes that a\nperson's confinement will in itself present impediments and difficulties to the\ncontracting of a marriage during that period of confinement. The purpose of\nthis directive is to outline the responsibilities of the inmate and the\nintended spouse and the obligations of the department to ensure that an\nintended marriage is legally acceptable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n711.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
