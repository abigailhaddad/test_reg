Every applicant for\nadmission to practice, other than applicants for admission without examination\npursuant to section\n520.10\nof this Part, or applicants\nwho qualify for the bar examination under section 520.4 or\n520.5\nof this Part, shall\ndemonstrate that the applicant possesses the skills and values necessary to\nprovide effective, ethical and responsible legal services in this State. An\napplicant may satisfy this requirement by submitting proof of compliance with\none of the following five subdivisions. (1)\n\nLaw school certification of\ncompetence in skills and professional values\n(i) An applicant may submit from an\n\nAmerican Bar Association-approved law school a certification confirming that: (a) the law school has\ndeveloped a plan identifying and incorporating into its curriculum the skills\nand professional values that, in the school's judgment, are required for its\ngraduates' basic competence and ethical participation in the legal profession, as required by American Bar Association Standards and Rules of Procedure for\nthe Approval of Law Schools Standard 302(b), (c) and (d), and has made this\nplan publicly available on the law school's website; and\n(b) the applicant has acquired\nsufficient competency in those skills and sufficient familiarity with those\nvalues. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, a\nschool may certify that an applicant has attained the required skill level if\nthe graduate received a grade that the school considers sufficient to\ndemonstrate competence in courses the school has designated as teaching the\nskills and professional values needed for basic competence and ethical\nparticipation in the legal profession. (iii)\nA law school may adopt such other\nmeans of assessing its students' achievement of the required skills for\npurposes of this subdivision, provided the school receives the prior approval\nof the Court of Appeals. (2)\n\nLaw school certification of credit\nacquisition. An applicant may submit a certification from the applicant's\napproved law school confirming that the applicant enrolled in and successfully\ncompleted 15 credit hours, as defined by American Bar Association Standards for\nthe Approval of Law Schools, of practice-based experiential course- work\ndesigned to foster the development of professional competencies. The 15 credits\nmay be earned in whole or half credits. (i) For purposes of this subdivision, practice-based experiential coursework is\ncoursework that: (a) develops the concepts\nunderlying the practice competencies being taught; (b) provides opportunities for performance by\nthe student other than traditional classroom discussion; (c) provides for regular individualized\nstudent feedback from a faculty member; and\n(d) provides opportunities for student\nself-reflection. (ii)\n\nPractice-based, experiential coursework includes, but is not limited to, those\ncourses designated by a school as ''experiential courses'' under American Bar\n\nAssociation Standards for the Approval of Law Schools. (iii)\nA law school may not count toward this\nrequirement the first four credits earned in an introductory first-year legal\nresearch and writing class, first-year moot court class, or any combination\nthereof. (iv)\nA student may earn up\nto six of the fifteen required credits through law school certified non-credit\nbearing summer employment supervised by an attorney in good standing in any\nstate or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia. The\nsupervising attorney must certify to the law school the beginning and ending\ndates of the employment, that the student satisfactorily completed the\nemployment, and that the work experience: provided the student with an initial\norientation session; implemented a system for assignments that assured that the\nstudent was actually engaged in the performance of legal work, including a\ndiversity of tasks, as part of the ongoing practical work of the law office\nduring normal business hours and throughout the required period; provided the\nstudent with experience and guidance in the skills and values required for\nbasic competence and ethical participation in the legal profession; gave the\nstudent timely oral and written feedback; and engaged the student in reflection\non his/her ex- periences and learning during the employment. At least 50 hours\nof full-time employment is required for each substituted credit under this\nsubdivision. (v) Alternative method\nof compliance. If the law school does not submit the certification as required\nin paragraph (2), the applicant may submit evidence to the Court of Appeals\nthat the requirements of this subdivision have been met by providing a list of\nthe practice-based experiential courses taken by the applicant, the credits\nawarded, and the course descriptions and/or other information demonstrating\nthat each course meets the requirements of this subdivision. Upon concluding\nthat the applicant has submitted sufficient proof of compliance with this\nsubdivision, the Court shall issue a determination to that effect. (3)\n\nPro Bono\n\nScholars Program. An applicant who has successfully completed the Pro Bono\n\nScholars Program as prescribed in section\n520.17\nof this Part shall be\ndeemed to have met the skills competency requirement. (4)\n\nApprenticeship. An\napplicant may complete a six-month fulltime paid or unpaid apprenticeship in a\nlaw office in the United States, under the supervision of one or more attorneys\nwho have, for at least two years, been admitted to practice and in good\nstanding in the jurisdiction where the apprenticeship occurs. For an applicant\nwho is unable to secure an apprenticeship in the United States, the applicant\nmay complete the apprenticeship in a law office in another country, territory\nor commonwealth outside the continental United States, under the supervision of\none or more attorneys who have, for at least two years, been in good standing\nand authorized to practice law in that country, territory or commonwealth. In\ncountries, territories or commonwealths that permit the practice of law without\nformal admission, supervision by a law graduate who has not been formally\nadmitted to the bar may suffice as long as the supervisor is authorized to\nengage in the relevant practice under the jurisdiction's rules, is in full\ncompliance with the jurisdiction's rules, and has had at least two years of\nexperience in the relevant practice. (i) Timing. The apprenticeship shall be\ncontinuous for the six month period, and shall commence after the conclusion of\nthe applicant's law studies, except that an applicant who is required to\ncomplete an LL.M. program at an approved law school pursuant to section\n520.6\n(b) of this\n\nPart may complete the apprenticeship before commencing the LL.M. program. The\napprenticeship must be completed in its totality before the three-year\napplication filing deadline provided in section\n520.12\n(d) of this\n\nPart has elapsed. (ii)\n\nSupervisor responsibilities. Apprenticeship supervisors are responsible for\n(1)\ncertifying the beginning and ending\ndates of the apprenticeship; (2)\nproviding the applicant with an\ninitial orientation session; (3)\nimplementing a system for assignment\nthat assures that the applicant is actually engaged in the performance of legal\nwork, including a diversity of tasks, as part of the ongoing practical work of\nthe law office during normal business hours and throughout the required\nperiod; (4)\nproviding\nthe applicant with experience and guidance in the skills and values required\nfor basic competence and ethical participation in the legal\nprofession; (5)\ngiving timely oral and written feedback to the applicant; (6)\nengaging the applicant in\nreflection on his/her experiences and learning during the apprenticeship; and\n(7)\ncertifying\nthat the preceding elements have been complied with, and that the applicant has\nsatisfactorily completed the apprenticeship. (iii)\n\nAny apprenticeship\ncompleted under this paragraph shall be conducted in compliance with all\napplicable federal, state and local laws and regulations. (5)\n\nPractice in another\njurisdiction. An applicant who has been authorized to practice law in another\n\nUnited States jurisdiction or any other country, territory or commonwealth\noutside the continental United States may satisfy the skills competency\nrequirement by establishing and submitting proof that the applicant has been in\ngood standing and practiced law in that jurisdiction full-time for at least one\nyear or half-time for two years following the applicant's authorization to\npractice. Prior legal practice may qualify even if it occurred without formal\nadmission to the bar if the applicant engaged in lawful practice in a country, territory or commonwealth that permits legal practice without formal admission\nto the bar, and if the prior practice was for at least one year or half-time\nfor two years, in full compliance with the jurisdiction's rules. For an\napplicant who qualifies for the bar exam after completion of an LL.M. degree\npursuant to section\n520.6\nof this Part, the\napplicant's practice may occur before or after commencement of the LL.M. program. (b) Proof required. An applicant shall\nsubmit to the appropriate Appellate Division department of Supreme Court an\n\nAffidavit of Compliance with the Skills Competency Requirement.

For\napplicants who qualify for the bar examination under section\n520.3\nof this Part, and for\napplicants who qualify for the bar examination under section\n520.6\nof this Part on the basis of\ntheir foreign legal education alone, the requirements of this section shall\nfirst apply to those commencing their law study after August 1, 2016. For\napplicants who qualify for the bar examination under section\n520.6\nof this Part after the\ncompletion of a qualifying LL.M. program, the requirements of this section\nshall first apply to those commencing their LL.M. program after August 1, 2018.
