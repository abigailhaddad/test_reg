  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following terms used in this Part have the meaning\nindicated, unless the context clearly requires otherwise: (a) Act means the Coastal Erosion Hazard\n\nAreas Act [FN*] which has been codified as article 34 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, as amended. (b) Appurtenance means a minor or accessory structure attached to or placed near a\nprincipal structure. (c) Beach\nmeans the zone of unconsolidated earth that extends landward, from the mean\nlow-water line, to the seaward toe of a dune or bluff, whichever is most\nseaward. Where no dune or bluff exists landward of a beach, the landward limit\nof a beach is 100 feet landward from the place where there is a marked change\nin material or physiographic form or from the line of permanent vegetation, whichever is most seaward. Shorelands subject to seasonal or more frequent\noverwash or inundation are considered to be beaches. (d) Bluff means any bank or cliff with a\nprecipitous or steeply sloped face adjoining a beach or a body of water. The\nseaward limit of a bluff is the landward limit of its seaward natural\nprotective feature. Where no beach is present the seaward limit of a bluff is\nmean low water. The landward limit is 25 feet landward of the bluff's receding\nedge, or in those cases where there is no discernible line of active erosion to\nidentify the receding edge, 25 feet landward of the point of inflection on the\ntop of the bluff. (The point of inflection is that point along the top of the\nbluff where the trend of the land slope changes to begin its descent to the\nshoreline.)\n(e) Coastal erosion\nhazard area map means the final map issued by the commissioner which delineates\nthe boundaries of erosion hazard areas subject to regulation under this\n\nPart. (f) Coastal erosion\nmanagement permit means the written approval required by this Part for the\nundertaking of any regulated activity within erosion hazard areas as shown on\ncoastal erosion hazard area maps. (g) Coastal waters means Lakes Erie and\n\nOntario, the St. Lawrence and Niagara Rivers, the Hudson River south of the\n\nFederal Dam at Troy, the East River, the Harlem River, the Kill van Kull and\n\nArthur Kill, Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean, their connecting water\nbodies, bays, harbors, shallows and wetlands. (h) Coastline means the lands adjacent to the\n\nState's coastal waters. (i) Commissioner means the Commissioner of Environmental Conservation or his duly\nauthorized representative. (j) Debris line means a linear accumulation of waterborne debris deposited by high\nwaters on a beach. (k) Department\nmeans the Department of Environmental Conservation. (l) Dune means a ridge or hill of loose, windblown, or artificially placed earth, the principal component of which is\nsand. (m) Emergency means a natural\nor an accidental human-made event which presents an immediate threat to life, health, safety, property or the environment. (n) Erosion means the loss or displacement of\nland along the coastline due to the action of waves, currents, tides, wind-driven water, waterborne ice, or other impacts of storms. It also means\nthe loss or displacement of land due to the action of wind, runoff of surface\nwaters, or groundwater seepage. (o) Erosion hazard area means an area of the coastline which is: (1)\na structural hazard area; or\n(2)\na natural protective feature\narea. (p) Erosion\nprotection structure means a structure specifically designed to reduce or\nprevent erosion, such as a groin, jetty, seawall, revetment, bulkhead, breakwater, or artificial beach nourishment project. (q) Existing structure means: (1)\nfor State agency-owned structures and\nappurtenances, a structure in existence, or one whose construction had\ncommenced, within an erosion hazard area on the date coastal erosion hazard\narea maps are filed for a local government; or\n(2)\nfor structures and appurtenances owned by\nall other persons, a structure in existence, or one whose construction had\ncommenced, within an erosion hazard area on the effective date of an erosion\nhazard area local law or ordinance which has been certified by the commissioner\npursuant to the act, or on the date the department assumes regulatory\nresponsibility after all appropriate levels of local government have had an\nopportunity to assume such jurisdiction, whichever is earlier. Existing structure also includes any structure or\nappurtenance which was initially constructed outside an erosion hazard area, but as a result of amendments to coastal erosion hazard area maps is located in\nan erosion hazard area. (r) Grading means a redistribution of sand or\nother unconsolidated earth to effect a change in profile. (s) Local government means a village, town, city or county. (t) Local program\nmeans a coastal erosion management ordinance or local law, or any other\nordinance, local law, zoning regulation, subdivision regulation, site plan\napproval regulation, or other application of police power a local government\nmay use in carrying out the purposes and policies of the act and meeting the\nminimum standards of section\n505.17\nof this Part. (u) Major addition means an addition which\nresults in a 25-percent or greater increase in the ground area coverage of a\nstructure, other than an erosion protection structure, pier, dock or wharf. The\nincrease will be calculated as the ground area coverage to be added, including\nany additions previously constructed under a coastal erosion management permit, divided by the ground area coverage of existing structures as defined in\nsubdivision (q) of this section. (v) Mean low water means the approximate\naverage low-water level for a given body of water at a given location, determined by reference to hydrological information concerning water levels or\nother appropriate test. (w) Modification means a change in size, design or function. (x) Movable structure means a structure\ndesigned and constructed to be readily relocated with minimum disruption of\nintended use. Mobile homes and structures built on skids or piles and not\nhaving a permanent foundation are examples of movable structures. (y) Natural protective feature means a\nnearshore area, beach, bluff, primary dune, secondary dune, or wetland, and the\nvegetation thereon. (z) Natural\nprotective feature area means a land and/or water area containing natural\nprotective features, the alteration of which might reduce or destroy the\nprotection afforded other lands against erosion or high water, or lower the\nreserves of sand or other natural materials available to replenish storm losses\nthrough natural processes. All natural protective feature areas are delineated\nas such on coastal erosion hazard area maps. (aa)\n\nNearshore area means those lands under\nwater beginning at the mean low-water line and extending in a direction\nperpendicular to the shoreline to a point where mean low-water depth is 15\nfeet, or to a horizontal distance of 1,000 feet from the mean low-water line, whichever is greater. (bb)\n\nNormal\nmaintenance means periodic replacement or repair of same-kind structural\nelements or protective coatings which do not change the size, design or\nfunction of a functioning structure. A functioning structure is one which is\nfully performing as originally designed at the time that normal maintenance is\nscheduled to begin. Normal maintenance of a structure does not require a\ncoastal erosion management permit. (cc)\n\nPerson means any individual, public or\nprivate corporation, political subdivision, government agency, public\nimprovement district, partnership, association, firm, trust, estate, or any\nother legal entity whatsoever. (dd)\n\nPrimary dune means the most seaward major dune where there are two or more\nparallel dune lines within a coastal area. Where there is only one dune\npresent, it is the primary dune. Occasionally one or more relatively small dune\nforms exist seaward of the primary dune. For the purposes of this Part, such\nforms will be considered to be part of the primary dune. The seaward limit of a\nprimary dune is the landward limit of its fronting beach. The landward limit of\na primary dune is 25 feet landward of its landward toe. (ee)\n\nReceding edge means the most landward\nline of active erosion, or in cases where there is no discernable line of\nactive erosion, it is the most seaward line of permanent vegetation. (ff)\n\nRecession rate means the rate, expressed\nin feet per year, at which an eroding shoreline moves landward. (gg)\n\nRegional permit administrator means the\nperson designated to process permits in each regional office of the department. The names and addresses of all regional permit administrators are listed in\n\nAppendix 1 of Volume A of this Title. (hh)\n\nRegulated activity means the\nconstruction, modification, restoration or placement of a structure, or major\naddition to a structure, or any action or use of land which materially alters\nthe condition of land, including grading, excavating, dumping, mining, dredging, filling, or other disturbance of soil. Regulated activity does not\ninclude routine agricultural operations involving cultivation and harvesting, and the implementation of practices recommended in a soil and water\nconservation plan as defined in section\n3\n(12)\nof the Soil and Water Conservation\n\nDistricts Law; provided, however, that agricultural operations and\nimplementation of practices will not be construed to include any activity that\ninvolves the construction or placement of a structure. The terms development\nand activity, when used in this Part, have the same meaning as regulated\nactivity. (ii)\n\nRegulatory agency\nmeans the department, another State agency, or a local government having permit\nor other approval authority over a project. (jj)\n\nRestoration means the reconstruction\nwithout modification of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50\npercent of the estimated full replacement cost of the structure at the time of\nrestoration. Modifications, however, may be allowed if they do not exceed\npreexisting size limits and are intended to mitigate impacts to natural\nprotective features and other natural resources. (kk)\n\nSecondary dune means the major dune\nimmediately landward of the primary dune. The seaward limit of a secondary dune\nis the landward limit of its fronting primary dune. The landward limit of a\nsecondary dune is 25 feet landward of its landward toe. (ll)\n\nSignificant fish and wildlife habitat\nmeans those habitats which: (1)\nare essential\nto the survival of a large portion of a particular fish or wildlife\npopulation; (2)\nsupport rare or\nendangered species; (3)\nare found\nat a very low frequency within a geographic area; (4)\nsupport fish or wildlife populations\nhaving significant commercial or recreational value; or\n(5)\nwould be difficult or impossible to\nreplace. (mm)\n\nState\nagency means any department, division, bureau, commission, board, public\nauthority, or other agency of the State. Any public benefit corporation, any\nmember of which is appointed by the Governor, is a State agency. (nn)\n\nStructural hazard area means those\nshorelands, located landward of natural protective features, and having\nshorelines receding at a long-term average annual recession rate of one foot or\nmore per year. The inland boundary of a structural hazard area is calculated by\nstarting at the landward limit of the fronting natural protective feature and\nmeasuring along a line which is perpendicular to the shoreline a horizontal\ndistance landward which is 40 times the long-term average annual recession\nrate. (oo)\n\nStructure means any\nobject constructed, installed or placed in, on or under land or water, including but not limited to a building; permanent shed; deck; in-ground and\naboveground pool; garage; mobile home; road; public service distribution, transmission, or collection system; tank; pier; dock; wharf; groin; jetty; seawall; revetment; bulkhead; or breakwater; or any addition to or alteration\nof the same. (pp)\n\nToe means the\nlowest point on a slope of a dune or bluff. [FN*] Chapter 841 of the Laws of 1981, which enacted ECL\narticle 34, gave it the statutory short title: \"The Shoreowner's Protection\n\nAct.\"--ED. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
