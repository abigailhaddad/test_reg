  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-5.5 - Limitations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A segment\nspecial equalization rate shall not be established for the purposes of this\n\nSubpart if there would not be at least a 10 percent change in the share of the\nlevy of at least one segment of the taxing jurisdiction as the result of the\nuse of the segment special equalization rate in place of the equalization rate\nwhich would otherwise be used for purposes of apportionment. The change in\nshares will be determined by comparing the shares computed using the State\nequalization rates against the shares computed by substituting the segment\nspecial equalization rate. Provided, however, this limitation shall not apply\nwhere a special equalization rate is determined for another segment within the\nsame assessing unit or taxing jurisdiction pursuant to this Subpart or where a\nspecial equalization rate was established for that segment in the prior year\nand a change of five percent would occur for any segment in the taxing\njurisdiction. (b) No segment\nspecial equalization rate shall be certified later than the last date set by\nlaw for the levy of taxes on the assessment roll for which such segment special\nequalization rate is certified except that, in the case of a segment special\nequalization rate for a special district, such segment special equalization\nrate shall not be certified later than 15 days prior to the last date allowed\nby law for the levy of taxes. (c) No segment special equalization rate shall be certified unless all affected\nmunicipal corporations can be notified at least 15 days prior to its\nestablishment. (d) Prior to the\nlast date set by law for the levy of taxes on the assessment roll for which\nsuch segment special equalization rate would be certified, any segment special\nequalization rate may be rescinded where the segment special equalization rate\nis discovered to be incorrect. (e) Where a material change in level of assessment is determined after the\nestablishment of such segment special equalization rate, the segment special\nequalization rate may be adjusted for such change in level, provided it is\nadjusted prior to the levy of taxes for the taxing jurisdiction.
