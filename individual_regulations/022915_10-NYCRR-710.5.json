The amended application shall be\nreferred to the health systems agency having jurisdiction and the Public Health\nand Health Planning Council for their reevaluation and recommendations. The\napproval of the commissioner shall be obtained for any such amended\napplication. (b) Any of the\nfollowing shall constitute an amendment: (1)\na change in the number and/or types of beds and/or services, other than a\nreduction of service which would be subject to administrative review; (2)\na change in the location of the site of\nthe construction if outside the facility's planning area as identified in Part\n709. If the change in site, within the facility's planning area, impacts\ngeographic accessibility in such planning area, the commissioner may before\nmaking any finding that such change is in the best interest of the planning\narea seek the recommendation of the Public Health and Health Planning Council\nand the health systems agency having geographical jurisdiction. In addition, for applications to establish diagnostic and treatment centers which were not\nreviewed competitively within a batch, a change of site within a planning area\nshall not constitute an amendment pursuant to the provisions of this section\nand shall require only the prior approval of the commissioner; or\n(3)\nany change in the applicant. (c) (1)\n\nIf the commissioner determines that\nincreases in total project costs or total basic costs of construction are due\nto factors of an emergency nature such as labor strikes, fires, floods or other\nnatural disasters, or factors beyond the control of the applicant, or\nmodifications to the architectural aspects of the application which are made on\nthe recommendation of the department, the commissioner may permit review of the\napplication to proceed without the need for the application to be referred back\nto the health systems agency and the council pursuant to this Part. However, failure of the applicant to obtain financing or appropriate environmental and\nzoning permits or approvals shall not be deemed to be beyond the control of the\napplicant. (2)\n\nIf the applicant can\ndocument by evidence acceptable to the commissioner that increases in total\nproject costs or total basic costs of construction were caused by delays in\nobtaining zoning or planning approvals which were beyond its control, the\ncommissioner may permit review of the application to proceed without the need\nfor the application to be referred back to the health systems agency and the\ncouncil pursuant to this part. The evidence should clearly demonstrate that the\napplicant had timely pursued the zoning or planning permits and in addition\nthat the applicant has now obtained all such required permits and approvals and\nis prepared to proceed with the project. (3)\n\nIf the applicant can document, by\nevidence acceptable to the commissioner, that increases in the total basic cost\nof construction were caused by inflation in excess of that estimated and\napproved in the application and that such inflation has affected the total\nbasic cost of construction as a result of delays which were beyond the\napplicant's control, the commissioner may permit review of the application to\nproceed without the need for the application to be referred back to the health\nsystems agency and the Public Health and Health Planning Council pursuant to\nthis Part. The evidence shall demonstrate clearly that the increase in\ninflation exceeds that estimated and approved in the application, and that any\ndelays resulting in such inflationary cost increases were beyond the\napplicant's control. (d) The applicant must obtain the prior approval of the commissioner for any change\nrelating to the program scope or functional space concept of the project, total\nproject costs or increase in total basic costs of construction, a change in the\nownership interest in the land, building or equipment relating to the proposal, a change in the location of the site of the construction, or interest rates\nrelating to the financing of any aspect of the project, regardless of whether\nsuch change constitutes an amendment under this section.
