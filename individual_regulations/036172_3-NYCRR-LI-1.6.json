  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.6 - Trust company-imposition of service charges on unclaimed dividends\n\nState Regulations\nA trust company inquired whether it was permissible to impose\nservice charges on dividends declared on its own capital stock but not claimed\nby stockholders. The department responded that it found no statutory provision\nallowing this practice. Moreover, a declared dividend is a debt owed by the\ntrust company to its stockholders and, absent specific contractual\nauthorization to reduce the debt by imposing charges, the trust company may not\ndo so. Characterizing the trust company, once it segregates the dividend\nmonies, as a trustee for the benefit of its stockholders does not alter the\nconclusion that the practice is impermissible. The department was not asked to, and did not, express any\nopinion as to the legality of charges, by-law or other provision of prospective\napplication attempting to exact such charges on unclaimed dividends. DATED: August 24, 1973\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 1.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
