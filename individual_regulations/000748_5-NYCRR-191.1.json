Tit. 5 § 191.1 - Application and review process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\napplicant must submit a complete application as prescribed by the\ncommissioner. (b) As part of such\napplication, an applicant must: (1)\nagree to\nallow the Department of Taxation and Finance to share its tax information with\nthe department. Note that the form created by the department to effectuate this\ninformation transfer may only be executed by a person with authority to act on\nthe business entity's behalf in this regard. However, any information shared as\na result of this agreement shall not be available for disclosure or inspection\nunder the State Freedom of Information Law; and\n(2)\nagree to allow the Department of Labor to\nshare its tax and employer information with the department. Note that the form\ncreated by the department to effectuate this information transfer may only be\nexecuted by a person with authority to act on the business entity's behalf in\nthis regard. However, any information shared as a result of this agreement\nshall not be available for disclosure or inspection under the State Freedom of\n\nInformation Law; and\n(3)\nallow the\ndepartment and its agents access to any and all books and records deemed\nrelevant by the department to monitor compliance with the provisions of article\n17 of the Economic Development Law; and\n(4)\nagree to be permanently disqualified for\nempire zone benefits at any location or locations that qualify for Excelsior\n\nJobs Program benefits if admitted into the Excelsior Jobs Program for such\nlocation or locations; and\n(5)\nprovide, upon request by the department, all of the following information: (i) a plan outlining the schedule for meeting\nthe job and investment requirements (such plan must include details on job\ntitles and expected salaries); (ii)\nthe prior three years of Federal and State income or franchise tax returns, unemployment insurance quarterly returns, real property tax bills and audited\nfinancial statements; (iii)\nthe\namount and description of projected qualified investments for which it plans to\nclaim the Excelsior Investment Tax Credit; (iv)\nan estimate of the portion of any\n\nFederal research and development tax credits, attributable to research and\ndevelopment activities conducted in New York State, that it anticipates\nclaiming for the years it expects to claim the Excelsior Research and\n\nDevelopment Credit; (v) the\nemployer identification or social security numbers for all related persons to\nthe applicant, including those of any members of a limited liability company or\npartners in a partnership; and\n(6)\nprovide a clear and detailed presentation\nof all related persons to the applicant to assure the department that jobs are\nnot being shifted within the State; and\n(7)\ncertify, under penalty of perjury, that\nit is in substantial compliance with all environmental, worker protection, and\nlocal, State, and Federal tax laws; and\n(8)\nfor Green CHIPS projects, submit a Green\nCHIPS sustainability plan and a Green CHIPS community plan. (c) The commissioner, upon receipt\nof a complete application from an applicant, shall determine whether the\napplicant meets the eligibility criteria set forth in section\n191.2\nof this Part. An applicant\nthat does not meet the eligibility criteria set forth in section\n191.2\nof this Part shall not be\naccepted into the program. (d) Having determined that an application is complete and that the applicant meets\nthe eligibility criteria set forth in section\n191.2\nof this Part and, if a Green\nCHIPS project, also meets the eligibility provisions of section\n190.2\n(r) of the\n\nTitle, the Department may admit the applicant and issue a certificate of\neligibility as defined in section\n190.2\n(g) of this\n\nTitle and a preliminary schedule of benefits that indicates the annual amount\nof each component of the credit an applicant may be entitled to in each of its\nten or twenty years of eligibility as applicable. The Commissioner may amend a\npreliminary schedule of benefits provided that the Commissioner complies with\nthe credit caps in section\n359\nof\nthe Economic Development Law. (e) With respect only to participant's engaging in a Green CHIPS project as defined\nherein, such participants may provide a range of estimated net new jobs to the\n\nDepartment that consists of a lower-bound \"estimated number of net new jobs\"\nand an upper-bound \"maximum number of net new jobs.\" For the purposes of\ncalculating whether a participant has met its minimum number of net new jobs to\nbe subject to the pro-ration or loss of all other tax benefits as further\narticulated in section\n192.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, the lower-bound estimated number of net new jobs shall be used. For\npurposes of calculating the jobs tax credit that may be available to a Green\nCHIPS participant in any given year, the upper-bound maximum number of net new\njobs shall be used. In order for a participant to receive its maximum jobs tax\ncredit, it must create the maximum number of net new jobs listed in its\nschedule of benefits. In presenting its net new jobs schedules to the\n\nDepartment, the estimated and maximum number of net new jobs shall be the same\nin year 10 of each project phase. In addition, the estimated and maximum number\nof net new jobs schedules must be reasonably justified by the Green CHIPS\nparticipant and approved by Department. The Department may adopt standards to\nestablish a reasonable relationship between the two schedules and shall approve\nor reject such schedules in their sole discretion. (f) With respect to investment, each Green\nCHIPS participant will have a cap on the annual amount of investment tax\ncredits it can be issued, provided that: 1)\nif a participant initially falls short on its investment goal pursuant to the\nschedule of benefits, it may amend its schedule commensurate with the shortfall\nto allow for increased investment in future schedule years and/or phases; and\n2)\nif a participant exceeds its\ninvestment goal, the excess investment shall carry forward as counting toward\nfuture year investment goals. However, if a participant fails to meet its\nestimated lower bound net new jobs commitment as outlined above in any given\nyear, then it shall face a pro-rated or complete loss of investment tax credit\ncomponent and research and development tax credit\ncomponents. (g) With\nrespect to participants engaging in Green CHIPS projects, any investment and\nnet new jobs made or created subsequent to the eligibility date established by\nthe certificate of eligibility but prior to year one of phase one shall count\ntowards the tax credit. A participant who is awarded and accepts a phase two\nschedule and elects to postpone the commencement of phase two after completing\nphase one, shall be required to submit a \"request for temporary extension\" to\nthe Department for each year in which it requests the postponement. Such\nrequest for temporary extension shall include, to the satisfaction of the\n\nDepartment, the reasons for the requested postponement (e.g., industry demand\nslowdown, industry oversupply conditions, etc.). Provided that each request for\ntemporary extension is granted by the Department at its sole discretion and the\nparticipant is awarded and accepts a phase two schedule, upon commencing its\nphase two schedule of benefits, the value of investments not counted in phase\none and made prior to the start of phase two shall be counted as progress\ntoward its investment goals, as shall any excess investment made during phase\none. Provided further that each request for temporary extension is granted by\nthe Department in its sole discretion and if the participant is awarded and\naccepts a phase two schedule, upon commencing its phase two schedule of\nbenefits, any net new jobs not counted in phase one and created prior to the\nstart of phase two shall be counted as progress toward its net new job goals, as shall any excess net new jobs created during phase one provided such net new\njobs are maintained continuously during phase two. Any excess investments made\nor net new jobs created prior to the award and acceptance of a phase two\nschedule by a participant shall not be counted as progress towards its phase\ntwo investment or net new job goals. (h) Notwithstanding subdivision (ai) of\nsection\n190.2\nof this Title, the Department\nis hereby authorized to allow a Green CHIPS participant in good standing with\nphase one of a Green CHIPS project to enter into phase two of a Green CHIPS\nproject with a new and separate schedule of benefits which may overlap with\nphase one of a Green CHIPS project schedule of benefits from a timing\nperspective, for a new ten-year benefit term. Notwithstanding subdivision (d)\nof section\n191.1\nof this Part, such phase two\nof a Green CHIPS project shall be admitted into the program. Provided however, for such phase two of a Green CHIPS project, the new benefit term shall\nexclusively be provided for net new investments, new research and development\nexpenditures, and net new job creation above the commitments outlined in the\nschedule of benefits for a participant's phase one of a Green CHIPS project\nwith the Department. Assuming the requirements of this Part have been met, a\nparticipant in both a Green CHIPS project and any phase two of such project\nshall be eligible for benefits under section\n193.1\nof this\n\nTitle.
