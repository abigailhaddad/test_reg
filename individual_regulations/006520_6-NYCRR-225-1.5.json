  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 225-1.5 - Emissions and fuel monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncontinuous monitoring provisions of this section apply to owners of stationary\ncombustion installations: (1)\nwith a total\nheat input greater than 250 million Btu per hour. If two or more emission\nsources are exhausted through a common emission point, the total heat input for\nsuch an emission point is either the sum of the maximum operating heat inputs\nof all emission sources that are operated simultaneously and exhausted through\nthe common emission point, or the maximum operating heat input of any\nindividual emission source operated independently and connected to the common\nemission point, whichever is greater; (2)\nthat are equipped with approved sulfur\ndioxide control equipment; or\n(3)\nthat are subject to a sulfur dioxide equivalent emissions rate for a fuel\nmixture pursuant to Subdivision\n225-1.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (b) Continuous\nemission monitors (CEM) for sulfur compound emissions (expressed as sulfur\ndioxide) must be installed and operated at all times that the stationary\ncombustion installation is in service. Such instruments must be operated in\naccordance with manufacturer's instructions, must satisfy the criteria in\n\"performance specification 2\", appendix B, part\n60\nof title 40 of the Code of\n\nFederal Regulations (see Table 1, Section\n200.9\nof this Title), and must be\nacceptable to the department. Exceptions to these requirements are: (1)\nstationary combustion installations where\ngaseous fuel is the only fuel fired; or\n(2)\nstationary combustion installations, not\nincluding any equipped with sulfur dioxide control equipment, whose fuel\n(including waste oil) is subjected to representative sampling and sulfur\nanalysis conducted in a manner approved by the department; or\n(3)\nstationary combustion installations\nrequired to use the continuous monitoring specifications under 40 CFR part\n75\n(see Table 1, Section\n200.9\nof this Title). (c) Measurements must be made daily\nof the rate of each fuel, including waste oil, fired. The gross heat content\nand ash content of each fuel, including waste oil, fired must be determined at\nleast once each week. In the case of stationary combustion installations\nproducing electricity for sale, the average electrical output and the hourly\ngeneration rate must also be measured. (d) Owners and operators not required to\ninstall a CEM may demonstrate compliance with the sulfur-in-fuel limitations of\nthis Subpart through the retention of fuel distributor receipts. The fuel\ndistributor receipts must contain the amount of fuel and/or waste oil delivered\nand the certified sulfur content of the fuel and/or waste\noil. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
