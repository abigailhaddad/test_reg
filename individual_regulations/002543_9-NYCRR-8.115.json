CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section\n925-a\nof the Real Property Tax Law, do hereby retroactively extend the period for\npaying without interest or penalty the property taxes that are due on or about\nthe Applicable Property Tax Due Date in the Flooding Impacted Counties for\ntwenty-one days from the final date such taxes are currently due.
