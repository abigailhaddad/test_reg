  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.13 - Fees and costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When an action subject to this Part involves an applicant, the lead agency may\ncharge a fee to the applicant in order to recover the actual costs of either\npreparing or reviewing the draft or final EIS. The fee may include a chargeback\nto recover a proportion of the lead agency's actual costs expended for the\npreparation of a generic EIS prepared pursuant to section\n617.10\nof this Part for the geographic area where the applicant's project is located. The chargeback may be based on the percentage of the remaining developable land\nor the percentage of road frontage to be used by the project, or any other\nreasonable methods. The fee must not exceed the amounts allowed under\nsubdivisions (b) through (d) of this section. If the lead agency charges for\npreparation of a draft or final EIS, it may not also charge for review of the\ndraft or final EIS; if it charges for review of a draft or final EIS, it may\nnot also charge for preparation of the EISs. Scoping will be considered part of\nthe draft EIS for purposes of determining a SEQR fee; no fee may be charged for\npreparation of an EAF or determination of significance. (b) For residential projects, the total\nproject value will be calculated on the actual purchase price of the land or\nthe fair market value of the land (determined by assessed valuation divided by\nequalization rate) whichever is higher, plus the cost of all required site\nimprovements, not including the cost of buildings and structures, as determined\nwith reference to a current cost data publication in common use. In the case of\nsuch projects, the fee charged by an agency may not exceed two percent of the\ntotal project value. (c) For\nnonresidential construction projects, the total project value will be\ncalculated on the actual purchase price of the land or the fair market value of\nthe land (determined by the assessed valuation divided by equalization rate)\nwhichever is higher, plus the cost of supplying utility service to the project, the cost of site preparation and the cost of labor and material as determined\nwith reference to a current cost data publication in common use. In the case of\nsuch projects the fee charged may not exceed one half of one percent of the\ntotal project value. (d) For\nprojects involving the extraction of minerals, the total project value will be\ncalculated on the cost of site preparation for mining. Site preparation cost\nmeans the cost of clearing and grubbing and removal of over-burden for the\nentire area to be mined plus the cost of utility services and construction of\naccess roads. Such costs are determined with reference to a current cost data\npublication in common use. The fee charged by the agency may not exceed one\nhalf of one percent of the total project value. For those costs to be incurred\nfor phases occurring three or more years after issuance of a permit, the total\nproject value will be determined using a present value calculation. (e) The lead agency will provide the\napplicant, upon request, with an estimate of the costs for preparing or\nreviewing the draft EIS calculated on the total value of the project for which\nfunding or approval is sought. The applicant is also entitled to, upon request, copies of invoices or statements for work prepared by a consultant that are\nsubmitted to the lead agency in connection with any services rendered in\npreparing or reviewing an EIS. (f) Appeals procedure. When a dispute arises concerning fees charged to an\napplicant by a lead agency, the applicant may make a written request to the\nagency setting forth reasons why it is felt that such fees are inequitable. Upon receipt of a request, the chief fiscal officer of the agency or his\ndesignee will examine the agency record and prepare a written response to the\napplicant setting forth reasons why the applicant's claims are valid or\ninvalid. Such appeal procedure must not interfere with or cause delay in the\nEIS process or prohibit an action from being undertaken. (g) The technical services of the department\nmay be made available to other agencies on a fee basis, reflecting the costs\nthereof, and the fee charged to any applicant pursuant to this section may\nreflect such costs.
