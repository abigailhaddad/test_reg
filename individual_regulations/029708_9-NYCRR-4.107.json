[DAGGER][DOUBLE DAGGER]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, A series of coastal storms has exacerbated the\nnatural erosion process and created the imminent threat of a breach of the Long\n\nIsland barrier island system in the vicinity of Gilgo Beach, in the Town of\n\nBabylon, Suffolk County; and\nWHEREAS, A breach of the barrier system at that point would\nlead to the following severe impacts: -loss of an important regional transportation\ncorridor; -degradation of emergency services response times and\nhurricane evacuation capability; -increased threat of storm-related flooding; -potential loss of navigational capability and seaborne\ncommerce through Fire Island Inlet; -massive loss of material for the natural sand transport\nsystem that feeds the barrier island shoreline, which is projected to greatly\nincrease erosion of downdrift areas. This may lead to potential loss of the\nsouthwest sewer district ocean outfall; -loss of access to extensive State public recreational\nfacilities; and\n-potential highway repair and reconstruction costs to the\n\nState of millions of dollars: NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution, the Laws\nof the State of New York and section 28 of article 2-B of the Executive Law, do\nhereby declare a State disaster emergency, effective January 29, 1988, for the\naffected area of Suffolk County.
