  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 535.5 - Review of assessment issued by the Division of Taxation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1138(a)(4), 1140\n(a) General. (1)\n\nAny tax assessed under a notice of\ndetermination described in section\n535.2\nor\n535.4\nof\nthis Part may be protested by filing a petition for a hearing with the Division\nof Tax Appeals within 90 days of the date of the mailing of the assessment by\nthe Division of Taxation. These tax assessments may also be protested by filing\na request for a conciliation conference with the Bureau of Conciliation and\n\nMediation Services of the Division of Taxation within 90 days of the date of\nthe mailing of the assessment by the Division of Taxation. Timely filing of the\nrequest for a conciliation conference suspends the running of the 90-day time\nlimitation for filing a petition for a hearing in the Division of Tax\n\nAppeals. (2)\n\nFollowing is a brief\ndescription of the avenues available for the review of tax assessments issued\nby the Division of Taxation. For a detailed discussion of the tax assessment\nreview process in the Division of Tax Appeals and the Bureau of Conciliation\nand Mediation Services see Parts 3000 and 4000 respectively of this Title. (i) Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation\n\nServices. (a) A conciliation conference is\nintended to provide taxpayers with a rapid, inexpensive and informal means for\nresolving the disputed tax assessment. (b) A conciliation order issued by a\nconciliation conferee is generally binding on the Division of Taxation and the\nrequester. However, a conciliation order will not be binding on the requester\nif such person files a petition for a hearing with the Division of Tax Appeals\nwithin 90 days after the conciliation order is issued. (ii)\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals. A hearing in\nthe Division of Tax Appeals is held before an administrative law judge or, under certain circumstances, before a presiding officer in the Small Claims\n\nUnit. (a) Small claims matter. (1)\n\nIf the petitioner so elects, and the\namount in controversy meets the criteria set forth in section\n3000.9\n(b) of this Title, the hearing may be held in the Small Claims Unit. (2)\n\nFollowing a hearing in the Small Claims\n\nUnit the presiding officer will issue a determination. A final determination\nissued by the presiding officer is conclusive on all parties to the controversy\nand is not subject to review by any other unit of the Division of Tax Appeals\nor the Tax Appeals Tribunal. (b) Administrative law judge determinations\nand review by the Tax Appeals Tribunal. (1)\nA\ndetermination issued by an administrative law judge finally decides the matter\nin dispute unless the taxpayer or the Division of Taxation files an exception\nto this determination with the Tax Appeals Tribunal within 30 days after the\ngiving of notice of such determination. If such an exception is filed, the\n\nTribunal will issue a decision affirming, reversing or modifying the\nadministrative law judge's determination or refer the matter back to the\nadministrative law judge for further hearing. (2)\nA decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal\nthat is not subject to any further review finally decides the matter in dispute\nunless the taxpayer initiates a proceeding under article 78 of the Civil\n\nPractice Law and Rules within four months after issuance of the Tribunal's\ndecision and giving of notice to the parties. (b) Exclusiveness\nof remedy. An assessment may be challenged only by applying to the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals for a hearing or to the Bureau of Conciliation and\n\nMediation Services for a conciliation conference as provided in subdivision (c)\nof sections\n535.2\nand\n535.4\nof\nthis Part. The review of a decision of the Tax Appeals Tribunal referred to in\nsubdivision (a) of this section is the exclusive remedy available for the\njudicial determination of a tax liability under article 28 of the Tax Law and\nlocal laws administered by the Department of Taxation and Finance pursuant to\narticle 29 of the Tax Law. (c) Deposit of amount due and filing of\nundertaking. (1)\nA proceeding under\narticle 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules may not be instituted unless: (i) the amount of any tax sought to be\nreviewed, together with penalties and interest thereon, if any, is first\ndeposited with the department; (ii)\nan undertaking, issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in\nthis State and approved by the Superintendent of Insurance of New York as to\nsolvency and responsibility, is first filed with the department in such amount\nas a justice of the Supreme Court approves to the effect that if the proceeding\nbe dismissed or the tax confirmed the petitioner will pay all costs and charges\nwhich may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; or in lieu of\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph; and\n(iii)\nat the option of the applicant for an\narticle 78 proceeding, the undertaking filed with the department may be in a\nsum sufficient to cover the taxes and penalties and interest thereon stated in\nthe notice of determination issued by the Division of Taxation plus the costs\nand charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the proceeding; in which\nevent the applicant is not required to deposit such taxes, penalties and\ninterest as a condition precedent to the application. (2)\n\nIf an applicant for an article 78\nproceeding has previously filed a bond pursuant to subdivision (e) of section\n535.3\nof\nthis Part to stay collection proceedings under a jeopardy assessment, or has\npreviously paid to the Department of Taxation and Finance the taxes, penalties\nand interest assessed, such applicant need not deposit the taxes, penalties and\ninterest assessed in order to commence an article 78 proceeding. Such an\napplicant must, however, file an undertaking to cover all costs and charges as\ndescribed in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
