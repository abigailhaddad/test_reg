  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 884.1 - Hydroelectric power plant water use charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annual base charges. Owners of\nconventional run-of-river hydroelectric power plants that benefit from water\nstorage facilities owned or partially owned by the commission shall pay an\nannual base charge to the commission. The amount of the base annual charge\nshall be $1 per kilowatt of installed capacity. (b) Annual variable charges. In addition to\nthe base charge established in subdivision (a) of this section, annual charges\nbased on power generated at each facility will be assessed as follows: (1)\n\nOwners of hydroelectric power plants that\nbenefit from increased hydraulic head available to the hydroelectric project as\na result of investments by the commission shall be charged one mill per\nkilowatt-hour of energy produced. (2)\n\nOwners of hydroelectric power plants that\nderive additional benefits from increased flows available to the hydroelectric\nproject that would not have been available without the commission-sponsored\nproject shall be charged one-half mill per kilowatt-hour of energy produced. No\ncharges for increased flows will be required when charges for increased\nhydraulic head are in effect. (3)\n\nCharges for the use of any facilities such as pipe conduits, outlet works, and\nso on, installed in, on or near a commission-sponsored project that benefit the\nhydroelectric project in any way will be determined on a case-by-case basis as\napproved by the commission. (c) Credits. The owner of any hydroelectric\ngenerating facility shall receive a credit against the current year water use\nfee otherwise payable to the commission for any amount which the commission\nreceives from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers or from the Federal Energy\n\nRegulatory Commission for each calendar year. (d) Exemptions. No payment will be required\nwhen hydroelectric power facility water use charges would amount to less than\n$25 per year. Retroactive charges will not be assessed for facilities which\nhave already obtained commission approval pursuant to section\n3.8\nof the Delaware River Basin\n\nCompact. All hydroelectric generating projects that do not benefit from storage\nowned or partially owned by the commission are exempt from these commission\nwater charges. (e) Payment of bills. The amount due each year shall bear interest at the rate of one percent per\nmonth for each day it is unpaid beginning 30 days after the due date. Payments\nare due within 30 days of the end of each calendar year. Annual base charges\nwill be prorated for periods less than a year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
