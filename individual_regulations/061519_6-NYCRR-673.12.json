Tit. 6 § 673.12 - Safety inspections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nowner of a dam that has been assigned a hazard classification of class B or C\nshall undertake safety inspections on a regular basis, as shall be identified\nin the inspection and maintenance plan. (b) The owner of a dam that has been assigned\na condition rating of \"unsafe\" or \"unsound\" shall undertake safety inspections\non a regular basis, as shall be identified in an inspection and maintenance\nplan, and upon the request of the department, in its discretion, based on its\nconsideration of public safety and the specific characteristics of the dam and\nits location. (c) Safety\ninspections shall be performed on behalf of the owner by an engineer, who shall\ndocument the results of each inspection in a safety inspection report, which\nshall be signed and sealed by the engineer. (d) A safety inspection report shall include, but need not be limited to: (1)\ndocument\nreview. A review of all relevant documents, studies, plans, hazard\nclassifications, photos, or any other information related to the dam and its\nappurtenant works, including the inspection and maintenance plan, safety\ninspection reports or other inspection reports generated since the last safety\ninspection, and the emergency action plan; (2)\nvisual inspection. The narrative results\nof a visual inspection of the dam, including the embankment, spillway, outlet, closure dikes and other appurtenant structures, focusing on initial and/or\nprogressive signs of the manifestation of potential failure modes. Specific\nnote shall be made as to whether any deficiencies reported in previous reports, and any corrective action required by the department, have been fully resolved\nand/or implemented. The report should include dated photographs of the specific\nobservations made and any deficiencies or potential deficiencies identified\nduring the visual inspection; (3)\nreview of data. A review and evaluation of any instrumentation data generated\nsince the completion of the last safety inspection, and any recommendations for\naddressing gaps or other deficiencies or potential deficiencies in monitoring; and\n(4)\ncorrective action. Identification of deficiencies or potential deficiencies along with\nrecommendations and a schedule for any corrective actions necessary to fully\nresolve the deficiencies or potential deficiencies, which recommendations may\ninclude additional investigations, such as revised hydrologic and hydraulic\nanalyses, stability analyses, or underwater inspections. (e) Safety inspection reports shall be\nretained by the dam owner and kept in good order. (f) The department may require any dam owner\nto furnish, upon reasonable notice and at the owner's sole expense, a copy of\nany or all safety inspection reports. (g) The department may review any safety\ninspection report at any time to protect life, property or natural resources, may require additional information or clarification thereto, and/or may provide\ncomments to be addressed in a revised safety inspection report upon a finding\nthat the safety inspection, particularly the review of data, deficiency\nidentification, and the recommendation(s) and schedule for corrective action\ntherein, was not performed in compliance with this Part and/or generally\naccepted engineering practice in the field of dam design and safety. The owner\nshall revise the safety inspection report to fully incorporate and/or resolve\nthe department's comments and resubmit it to the department within 60 days of\nthe owner's receipt of the department's comments, unless another time frame is\neither requested by the owner and agreed to by the department, or imposed by\nthe department in the interests of public safety for a dam that has a condition\nrating of \"unsafe\" or \"unsound\".
