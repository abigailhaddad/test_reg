(vi)\n\nDomestic violence - a\nclaimant who is a victim of domestic violence or abuse may limit their work\nsearch if performing a work search would place the claimant in a position where\nthe claimant could be harmed in any way. (vii)\n\nAny other reasonable circumstance or\ncause as determined by the Department of Labor. (3)\n\nIt is not good cause for a claimant to\nlimit work search to a specific position or type of work when suitable work is\navailable to the claimant.
