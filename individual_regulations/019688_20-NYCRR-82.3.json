Tit. 20 § 82.3 - Unlawful acts of a CMSA wholesale dealer\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 483, 484(a) and 485(c)\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw and except as specifically provided for in subdivision (c) of this section\nwith respect to sales of cigarettes to other CMSA wholesale dealers, it shall\nbe unlawful and a violation of article 20-A of the Tax Law for any CMSA\nwholesale dealer: (1)\nto induce or attempt to\ninduce or to procure or attempt to procure the purchase of cigarettes at a\nprice which is less than the cost of the agent with respect to sales to CMSA\nwholesale dealers (see section\n82.2\nof\nthis Part); (2)\nto induce or\nattempt to induce or to procure or attempt to procure any rebate or concession\nof any kind or nature whatsoever in connection with the purchase of cigarettes\n(see Part 84 of this Title for rebates and concessions); or\n(3)\nwith the intent to injure competitors or\nto destroy or substantially lessen competition, or with the intent to avoid the\ncollection or paying over of any taxes as may be required by law, to advertise, offer to sell or sell cigarettes in New York State at less than the cost of the\nCMSA wholesale dealer (see Part 83 of this Title relating to prima facie\nevidence of such intentions). (b) (1)\n\nCost of the CMSA wholesale dealer. The term\ncost of the CMSA wholesale\ndealer\nmeans the basic cost of cigarettes (as defined in section\n80.2\nof\nthis Title) plus the cost of doing business by the agent with respect to sales\nof cigarettes to CMSA wholesale dealers plus the cost of doing business by the\nCMSA wholesale dealer. There shall be determined a separate cost of the CMSA\nwholesale dealer: (i) for sales of cigarettes\nby the CMSA wholesale dealer to chain stores; and\n(ii)\nfor sales of cigarettes by the CMSA\nwholesale dealer to CMSA retail dealers. In the case of sales of cigarettes at retail by a CMSA\nwholesale dealer, the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer shall be the same as\nthe cost of the CMSA retail dealer, as such a wholesale dealer is considered to\nbe a CMSA retail dealer for purposes of its sales of cigarettes to consumers\n(see section\n82.5\nof this Part). (2)\n(i) The\ncost of doing business by the CMSA wholesale dealer\nas used in\nthis subdivision shall mean the CMSA wholesale dealer's cost of doing business\nas evidenced by the accounting standards and methods regularly employed by the\nCMSA wholesale dealer in determining costs for purposes of Federal income tax\nreporting for the total operation of the dealer's establishment. The cost of\ndoing business must include, without limitation, labor (including salaries of\nexecutives and officers), rent, depreciation, selling costs, maintenance of\nequipment, delivery costs, interest payable, all types of licenses, taxes, insurance and advertising, and must be expressed as a percentage and applied to\nthe basic cost of cigarettes. A CMSA wholesale dealer who wishes to use the\nactual cost of doing business by the CMSA wholesale dealer pursuant to this\nsubparagraph in determining the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer, rather than\nusing the presumptive cost of doing business by the CMSA wholesale dealer\npursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, must first establish such\nactual cost of doing business to the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation\nand Finance. (ii)\n\"CMSA wholesale\ndealer's presumptive minimum markups\". In the absence of filing with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance satisfactory proof of a lesser cost of doing\nbusiness of the CMSA wholesale dealer making the sale, the cost of doing\nbusiness by the CMSA wholesale dealer shall be presumed to be: (a) 5/8 percent (.625%) of the basic cost of\ncigarettes with respect to sales to chain stores; and\n(b) 3 percent (3%) of the basic cost of\ncigarettes with respect to sales to CMSA retail dealers. (3)\n\nAny fractional part of a cent\nin the cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer per carton of cigarettes must be\nrounded off to the next higher cent. (4)\n\nIn accord with section\n80.2\n(a)(3)\nof this Title, the Department of Taxation and Finance will periodically publish\na separate cost of the CMSA wholesale dealer for sales to chain stores and to\nCMSA retail dealers based on the presumed costs of doing business by the CMSA\nwholesale dealer.

(c) When a CMSA wholesale dealer sells\ncigarettes to another CMSA wholesale dealer, the dealer making such sale shall\nnot be required to include in the selling price, the cost of the CMSA wholesale\ndealer as defined herein. However, no such sale shall be made at a price which\nis less than the cost of the agent with respect to sales to CMSA wholesale\ndealers. Upon resale of cigarettes to any CMSA retail dealer, the CMSA\nwholesale dealer who purchased the cigarettes for resale shall be deemed to be\nthe CMSA wholesale dealer governed by this section.

Just as the supplier must have knowledge of its purchaser, so too must\na purchasing CMSA wholesale dealer have knowledge of its supplier. A CMSA\nwholesale dealer must be capable of demonstrating to the satisfaction of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance that it purchased cigarettes at a price\nwhich was not less than the cost of the agent with respect to sales to CMSA\nwholesale dealers. In doing so, such dealer may ultimately need to call upon\nits supplier to help establish such cost.

The certificates must be\nretained by the dealer and all applicable subsequent transactions must be\nassociated with such certificates. A certificate is accepted in good faith when\nthe CMSA wholesale dealer has no knowledge or reason to believe that the\ncertificate given by the purchaser is false or fraudulently presented. Additionally, in the case of sales to other CMSA wholesale dealers and chain\nstores, the dealer making the sale must, at the time of each sale, verify that\nthe name of the purchaser appears on the applicable current listing of CMSA\nwholesale dealers or chain stores, as periodically published by the Department\nof Taxation and Finance.
