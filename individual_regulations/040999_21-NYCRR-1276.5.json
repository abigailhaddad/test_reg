  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1276.5 - Tank vehicle and refueling service vehicle equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tires. All tank vehicles shall be\nequipped with pneumatic tires. (b) Trailer mounting. Semi-trailers shall be mounted by means of a fifth-wheel\nconnection, the lower half of which shall be securely fastened to the tractor\nframe, and the upper half securely fastened to the semi-trailer. A locking\nmechanism shall be provided so the upper and lower halves may not be separated\nexcept by manual release and a safety bolt or wire seizing shall be applied to\nretain the manual release. (c) Wiring and lighting. Ignition wiring, both primary and secondary, shall be\nfully insulated, adequately supported and protected against chaffing. Terminals\nshall be firmly attached and spark plug attachments shall be further protected\nby and insulating tight fitting shroud of the molded boot type. Tank or\nrefueling service vehicles shall not be equipped with any artificial lighting\nother than electric lighting. Lighting circuits shall have over current\nprotection by means of fuses or circuit breakers. Over current protection\ndevices shall not be rated more than 115 percent of the allowable ampacity of\nthe conductor. Where circuits feed motor loads, the over current protection\ndevices shall be capable of carrying the starting current of the motor, but\nshall not exceed 250 percent of the motor full load current. Wiring of light\ncircuits other than standard factory wiring serving the vehicle engine and\nfront lights shall have sufficient carrying capacity to prevent dangerous\nheating and sufficient mechanical strength being flame retardant, moisture-heat\nand oil-resistant type MTW (Underwriters' Laboratories approved) and construed\nfor service conditions, and shall be secured, insulated and protected against\nphysical damage by encasing in metallic tubing with all connections made at\nstandard metal outlet boxes or at standard fixtures. (d) Fuel system for propulsion of tank\nvehicles. (1)\n\nFuel tanks. The fuel tank used\nin the system for propulsion of the vehicle shall have a maximum capacity of 45\ngallons of fuel, and shall be installed within the frame of the vehicle or\notherwise protected against mechanical injury. The tank shall be arranged to\nvent during filling operations and permit draining without removal from the\nmountings. Tanks installed within the cab of a vehicle shall be filled and\nvented from outside of the cab. (2)\n\nFeed system. The fuel for propulsion of the vehicle shall be delivered to the\nengine by a mechanical or electrical pump. No readily combustible material\nshall be used in the engine exhaust system. The fuel feed lines shall be\nimpervious to corrosive action of the fuel used, and shall be so arranged that\nthe suction shall be taken from the top of the tank; such feed lines shall have\nadequate strength for their purpose and shall be well secured against chafing\nand vibration. The carburetor shall be equipped with a standard air\ncleaner-backflash arrestor; direct drainage of overflow gasoline shall be\nprovided for. No glass bowls, glass gauges or readily breakable parts are to be\nused in any part of the fuel feed system, except that a glass bowl may be used\non a fuel pump provided it is so constructed and installed that if it breaks, the engine will automatically stop. (3)\n\nWhen refueling vehicles are without\nmotive power and are equipped with draw handles, the draw handles shall be\nhinged and held in the vertical position when not in use by a suitable holding\ndevice. The maximum height of the draw handle in the vertical position shall\nnot exceed six feet from the ground level to the highest point. (e) Engine and exhaust system. The\nvehicle propulsion and product pumping engine shall be installed under or\nforward of the cab portion of single units, on the tractor of semi-trailer\nunits or otherwise located in a separate compartment independent of the cargo\ntank and not subject to flooding or leakage of product from the cargo tank, any\npumps or product handling components. The engine compartment must be\nindependent of the cargo tank, fully ventilated and accessible for fire\nfighting. Engine exhaust systems, including the muffler and the exhaust line\nshall be separated by at least three inches from the engine fuel system, from\nall combustible material, and shall not be exposed to accumulations or leakage\nof grease, oil, gasoline or the product carried. An approved muffler shall be\ninstalled and no muffler cutout shall be used. The muffler tail pipe shall be\nturned down and terminate not less than three feet horizontally from the cargo\ntank, and from the fuel handling equipment. (f) Brakes. Every tank vehicle shall be\nequipped with manually controlled holding or parking brakes. All such brakes\nshall be controlled by the driver of the vehicle and set during fuel transfer\nor parking. Every tank semi-trailer shall be equipped with brakes of such a\ncharacter as to be automatically applied upon break-away from the towing\nvehicle and shall be designed to stop and hold such vehicles for 15 minutes. In\nany tank semi-trailer the brakes shall be of such design that the brakes on the\ntrailer may be applied almost simultaneously or prior to the brakes on the\ntractor. Vehicles equipped with air brake interlocks between brakes and power\ntake-off units shall be fitted with a properly marked emergency brake release\nlocated at the front bumper of the vehicle to permit brake release and towing\nthe vehicle in event of an emergency. Vehicles equipped with air brakes shall\nbe fitted with a low pressure alarm buzzer audible under all conditions of\noperation, located in the driver's cab. Vehicles arranged for bottom loading\nshall have the brake's system interlocked with the bottom loading valve housing\ncover so the vehicle brakes are set and the vehicle could not be moved until\nthe bottom loading hose lines are disconnected and the housing cover is latched\nclose. (g) Limitations. Tank\nvehicles operated on air terminal highways shall conform with all applicable\nportions of the State motor vehicle rules and regulations, provided that tank\nvehicles restricted to operation on terminal building aprons, hangar aprons, cargo building operating aprons, or special service roads not authorized for\ngeneral public use, shall not exceed 102 inches maximum over-all width, and 35\nfeet maximum over-all length for a single unit or 50 feet maximum over-all\nlength for a semi-trailer unit without special written permission of the\nairport operator.
