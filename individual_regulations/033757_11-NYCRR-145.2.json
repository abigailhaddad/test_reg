  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 145.2 - Implementation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each insurer and statistical agent shall monitor private passenger automobile statistical data in accordance with the provisions of the SDMS as required by the Insurance Department. However, the superintendent may waive or modify any SDMS requirement(s) for an individual insurer or statistical agent where the implementation of the requirement(s) would be impractical or unreasonable because of the small volume of private passenger automobile insurance premiums written by the insurer or in such other instances where the superintendent deems that such implementation would place an unreasonable burden on the insurer or statistical agent. (b) The superintendent shall provide a copy of the SDMS manuals to each insurer and statistical agent. (c) The superintendent shall maintain copies of the SDMS for public perusal at the offices of the Insurance Department in New York City and in Albany and at other locations within this State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n145.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
