  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.32 - Surface Condition Signs (W8-5, W8-7, W8-8, W8-11, W8-13, and W8-14)\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Guidance: 01A The Slippery When Wet (W8-5) sign without a\nsupplemental plaque or with the WHEN WET (W8-5P) plaque should be used only\nwhere skid resistance is significantly below that normally associated with the\nparticular type of pavement, or where there is evidence of unusual wet pavement\nskidding. 01B The ICE (W8-5aP) plaque should be used only where it\nhas been determined that recurrent pavement icing in an isolated section of\notherwise clear roadway constitutes an unusual hazard. The ICE (W8-5aP) plaque\nis not intended for use in conjunction with normal wintertime storm-related\nsnow or ice conditions. 01C Where used, the ICE (W8-5aP) plaque and BRIDGE ICES\nBEFORE ROAD (W8-13) sign should be displayed only during periods when icing is\nlikely to occur. Variable message or part-time signs should be considered for\nlocations subject to periodic posting. Guidance: 07A Where a surface condition exists for a distance of 1000\nfeet or longer, the W8-5, W8-7, W8-8, W8-11, and W8-14 signs should be\nsupplemented with a Distance plaque (see Section\n2C.55\n). Where additional signs are\nplaced within 1000 feet of the end of the surface condition, the Distance\nplaque should be omitted. 07B Surface Condition signs should be removed when the\ncondition no longer exists. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.32\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
