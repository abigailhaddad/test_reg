  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-7.6 - Size, placement, number and height limitations of permitted signs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Size and\nplacement. No sign shall exceed 48 square feet in area. A permit for a 48\nsquare foot sign is granted only when the sign is placed at least 10 feet back\nfrom the highway right-of-way. The part of the sign closest to the right-of-way\nis the point at which the measurement is taken. In general, the size of the\nsign is governed by its proximity to the highway right-of-way; i.e., the closer\nto the road the less area required to get the message across. All signs must be\nplaced 10 feet from the highway right-of-way unless special circumstances\nrequire that they be placed closer. Special circumstances are: alignment of\nhighway, terrain, existing trees or other natural features, or structure\nlocated on other parcels of real property, which might block or impair the view\nof the sign. Before a permit for a sign is granted, its location in relation to\nthe blocking of visual access to existing signs is also considered. In\ncircumstances in which a permit is granted for a sign closer than 10 feet to\nthe right-of-way the square footage of the sign is reduced to the amounts\nstated in the following schedule: On edge of right-of-way--32 square feet\n1 foot from right-of-way--33 square feet\n2 feet from right-of-way--34 square feet\n3 feet from right-of-way--35 square feet\n4 feet from right-of-way--36 square feet\n5 feet from right-of-way--37 square feet\n6 feet from right-of-way--38 square feet\n7 feet from right-of-way--39 square feet\n8 feet from right-of-way--40 square feet\n9 feet from right-of-way--41 square feet\n(b) Number. No more than two\nadvertising signs are permitted on one parcel of property, except as provided\nin subdivision (d) of this section. Businesses located on a parcel of property\nhaving 100 feet or less of road frontage will be granted a permit for one\nfree-standing sign and one wall sign providing that such wall sign does not\nexceed 32 square feet in area. Businesses located on a parcel of property\nhaving in excess 100 feet of road frontage will be granted a permit for two\nfree-standing signs provided that the distance between the two free-standing\nsigns shall be at least 50 feet, or one free-standing sign and one wall sign, providing that such wall sign does not exceed 32 square feet in area. In\naddition to the above, a permit will be granted for an identification sign on\nthe lakeshore providing that such sign does not exceed 15 square feet in area. Also, the commission may grant permits for the erection of directional signs\nprovided that the individual signs do not exceed two square feet in area, and\nare limited to the text \"Office\", \"Entrance\", or \"Exit\". Permits will be\ngranted only if the applicant can show that the directional sign or signs are\nnecessary because of unusual access to the commercial business\nestablishment. (c) Height. The top\nof the sign, advertising structure or device shall not exceed 20 feet above the\nground level where the sign is located. This height is permitted only when\nspecial circumstances make it necessary. (d) (1)\n\nPermits may be granted for more than two advertising signs in the event more\nthan one business is operated on a single parcel of real property. In this\nevent, permits may be granted for the following signs: (i) one sign, 48 square feet in area, 10 feet\nback from the highway right-of-way, or one sign closer to the highway\nright-of-way as provided in subdivision (a) of this section; and\n(ii)\none wall sign for each business operated\non the parcel of real property, provided that the areas of all of the signs\nerected under this subparagraph does not exceed 48 square feet, and further\nprovided that the wall sign is maintained on the building in which the business\nadvertised is located. (2)\n\nEach business owned by an individual or\ncorporation shall be considered a separate business, provided the individuals\nor stockholders are not related as spouses or parents and decedents. (3)\n\nIn the event a parcel of real property is\nused by one owner to operate more than one business, the number of businesses\nshall be determined in accordance with the following: (i) In towns which have a town ordinance\nrequiring the licensing of businesses, the number of businesses shall be\ndetermined by the number of businesses registered under its town\nordinance. (ii)\n\nIn towns which do\nnot have a town ordinance requiring the licensing of businesses the number of\nbusinesses shall be determined by the Lake George Park Commission based upon\nthe following criteria: (a) the sale of\nproducts and services which are not normally associated with one\nbusiness; (b) the location and\nconstruction of the buildings in which the businesses are located; (c) the management and accounting systems\nused by the businesses; and\n(d) uses which are considered accessory uses to the main business shall not be\nconsidered as a separate business.
