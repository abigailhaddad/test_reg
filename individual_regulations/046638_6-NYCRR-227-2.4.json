  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-2.4 - Control requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Very\nlarge boilers. The owner or operator of a very large boiler must comply\nwith either the relevant presumptive RACT emission limit of paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision or a case-by-case RACT determination made pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, as applicable. (1)\n\nEmission limits (pounds\nNO\nx\nper million Btu): Tangential\n\nWall\n\nCyclone\n\nFluidized\n\nBed\n\nFuel Type\n\nGas\n\nOnly\n0.08\n0.08\nna\nna\n\nGas/Oil\n0.15\n0.15\n0.20\nna\n\nCoal Wet\n\nBottom\n0.12\n0.12\n0.20\nna\n\nCoal Dry\n\nBottom\n0.12\n0.12\nna\n0.08\n(2)\n\nFor very large boilers having\nconfigurations other than those listed above or which are fired primarily with\nfuels not listed above, the owner or operator must submit a case-by-case RACT\nanalysis. (b) Large\nboilers. The owner or operator of a large boiler must comply with\neither the relevant presumptive RACT emission limit of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision or a case-by-case RACT determination made pursuant to paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, as applicable. (1)\n\nEmission limits (pounds\nNO\nx\nper million Btu): Fuel\n\nType\n\nEmission Limit\n\nGas Only\n0.06\n\nGas/Oil\n0.15\n\nPulverized Coal\n0.20\n\nCoal\n0.08\n1\n1 This emission limit also applies to fluidized bed\nboilers that combust other solid fuels (for example, tire-derived fuel, waste\nwood) that constitute no more than 30 percent of the total fuel content on a\n\nBtu basis. (2)\n\nFor large\nboilers fired primarily with fuels not listed above, the owner or operator must\nsubmit a case-by-case RACT analysis. (c) Mid-size boilers. The owner or operator of a mid-size boiler must comply\nwith the relevant presumptive RACT emission limit of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision or a case-by-case RACT determination pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, as applicable. (1)\n\nEmission limits (pounds NO\nx\nper million Btu): Fuel\n\nType\n\nEmission Limit\n\nGas Only\n0.05\n\nDistillate Oil/Gas\n0.08\n\nResidual Oil/Gas\n0.20\n(2)\n\nFor mid-size boilers fired primarily with\nfuels not listed above, the owner or operator must submit a case-by-case RACT\nanalysis. (d) Small\nboilers, small combustion turbines, and small stationary internal combustion\nengines. The owner or operator of a small boiler, small combustion\nturbine, or small stationary internal combustion engine must annually perform a\ntune-up and maintain, in a permanently bound log book, or other format approved\nin writing by the department, the following information: (1)\nthe date of the last tune-up; (2)\nthe name, title, and affiliation of the\nperson who made the adjustments; and\n(3)\nany other information that the department\nmay require. (e) Combustion turbines. The owner or operator of a combustion turbine with a\nmaximum heat input rate of 10 million Btu per hour or greater must comply with\neither the relevant presumptive RACT emission limit in paragraph (1) or (2) of\nthis subdivision, as applicable: (1)\n\nFor simple cycle and regenerative combustion turbines: (i) 50 parts per million on a dry volume\nbasis (ppmvd), corrected to 15 percent oxygen, for sources designed to burn\ngaseous fuels (gaseous fuels include, but are not limited to, natural gas, landfill gas, and digester gas) only; and\n(ii)\n100 ppmvd, corrected to 15 percent\noxygen, for sources designed to burn distillate oil alone or in combination\nwith other fuels (gaseous or liquid). (2)\n\nFor combined cycle combustion turbines, the owner or operator must submit a case-by-case RACT analysis upon the\nsubmission of either a new or renewal application for a title V permit. For facilities that have a duct burner, compliance will\nbe based on the combination of the turbine and the duct burner when both fire, and the turbine alone when not duct-firing. (f) Stationary internal combustion\nengines. The owner or operator of a stationary internal combustion\nengine either having a maximum mechanical output rating equal to or greater\nthan 200 brake horsepower in a severe ozone nonattainment area or having a\nmaximum mechanical output rating equal to or greater than 400 brake horsepower\noutside a severe ozone nonattainment area must comply with one of the emission\nlimits in paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subdivision or a case-by-case RACT\ndetermination made pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision, as\napplicable: (1)\n\nFor internal\ncombustion engines fired solely with natural gas: 1.5 grams per brake\nhorsepower-hour. (2)\n\nFor internal\ncombustion engines fired with landfill gas or digester gas (solely or in\ncombination with natural gas): 2.0 grams per brake horsepower-hour. (3)\n\nFor internal combustion engine fired with\ndistillate oil (solely or in combination with other fuels): 2.3 grams per brake\nhorsepower-hour. (4)\n\nFor stationary\ninternal combustion engines fired primarily with fuels not listed above, the\nowner or operator must submit a case-by-case RACT analysis. (5)\n\nAny stationary internal combustion engine\nmay rely on an emission limit that reflects a 90 percent or greater\nNO\nx\nreduction from the engine's actual 1990 baseline\nemissions, if such emissions baseline exists. (6)\n\nEmergency power generating stationary\ninternal combustion engines, and engine test cells at engine manufacturing\nfacilities that are used for either research and development purposes, reliability testing, or quality assurance performance testing are exempt from\nthe requirements of this subdivision. (g) Other combustion\ninstallations. The owner or operator of a major facility of\nNO\nx\nthat contains an emission source that is not\nspecifically addressed in this Subpart and is of an emission source type not\nregulated under Part 212, 214, 216, 219, 220, or 224 of this Title and which\nhas an emission rate potential of at least 3 pounds per hour and actual\nemissions in the absence of control equipment of at least 15 pounds per day\nmust comply with the case-by-case RACT determination made pursuant to this\nsubdivision. The owner or operator must submit a case-by-case RACT\nanalysis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
