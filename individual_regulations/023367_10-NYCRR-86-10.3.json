(ii)\n\nThe product shall then be added to the product of the applicable regional average clinical hourly wage, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (1)(xvii) of this subdivision and the applicable regional average clinical hours, which shall mean the quotient of salaried and contracted clinical hours for the base year for each provider in a DOH region, aggregated for all such providers in such region, divided by the rate sheet capacities for the base year, pro-rated for partial year sites for each provider in a DOH region, aggregated for all such providers in such region divided by 12. Such sum shall be multiplied by the statewide budget neutrality adjustment factor for operating dollars, as determined pursuant to subparagraph (1)(xxviii) of this subdivision to determine the final regional monthly operating rate. (iii)\n\nProvider Operating Revenue is calculated as follows: Add applicable Reimbursement from Regional Direct Care Hourly Rate, as computed in subparagraph (e)(2)(i), and applicable Reimbursement from Regional Clinical Hourly Wage, as computed in subparagraph (e)(2)(ii). (iv)\n\nTotal Provider Operating Revenue - Adjusted is calculated as follows: Multiply applicable Provider Operating Revenue, as computed in subdivision (c) of this section, by applicable Budget Neutrality Adjustment xxviii.
