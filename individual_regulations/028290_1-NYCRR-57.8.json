The bag\nshall be marked with the house identification, and the location of the bank and\nrow from which the sample was taken. If egg collection is nonautomated, an\nadditional manure sample from each bank, collected as described in clause\n(2)(i)(b) of this subdivision, shall be substituted as the second sample\nrequired from each bank. (c) Selection of birds for organ culture. Sixty birds shall be selected for organ culture in a random pattern throughout\nthe house, with the exception that birds reacting to the blood test shall be\ncultured. Sample birds shall be sent to the diagnostic laboratory within two\nweeks after blood testing. A Salmonella-free environment shall be provided if\nthe birds are held in cages overnight. All birds shall be identified by\nleg-band numbers. Birds from different houses shall be kept separated. The cage\nlocation from which birds originated shall be recorded. Organs shall be\ncultured according to the procedures outlined in section\n57.9\n(b) of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
