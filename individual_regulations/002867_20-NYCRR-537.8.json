  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.8 - Purchaser's, transferee's or assignee's rights to hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The liability of the purchaser, transferee or assignee shall be finally and irrevocably fixed unless the\npurchaser, within 90 days after the date of the mailing of the notice (the\n90-day notice) by the Division of Taxation to him of the total amount of any\ntax or taxes which the State claims to be due from the seller, transferrer or\nassignor, applies to the Division of Tax Appeals for a hearing or to the Bureau\nof Conciliation and Mediation Services of the Division of Taxation for a\nconference. (b) The rules of\npractice and procedure contained in Parts 2394 and 3000 of this Title apply to\nthe assessment of liability against the purchaser. (c) The purchaser, transferee or assignee has\nthe burden of proof to establish that the assessment issued against him is not\ncorrect. (d) The purchaser, in his\npetition, may challenge the assessment on any grounds that establish that the\nassessment is incorrect, including: (1)\nthat\nthe transfer is not a bulk sale as defined in section\n537.1\nof\nthis Part; (2)\nthat the purchaser's\nnotice was proper and timely in accordance with the provisions of section\n537.2\nof this Part; (3)\nthat the amount\nof funds withheld by the purchaser from the seller was sufficient and in\naccordance with the requirements of section\n537.3\nof this Part; (4)\nthat the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance has failed to meet its obligations provided\nfor in section\n537.6\nof this Part; (5)\nthat the amount\nof the liability exceeds the purchase price or the fair market value of the\nitems purchased; or\n(6)\nany\ncombination of the foregoing paragraphs (1) through (5). (e) The purchaser may also challenge the\nassessment on the grounds that the amount determined by the Division of\n\nTaxation to be due from the seller is erroneous or excessive, whether or not\nsuch amount had been finally and irrevocably fixed against the seller. Example 1:On April 15, 1975, a determination was issued\nagainst a corporation assessing unpaid sales taxes in the amount of $5,000, plus penalty and interest. The corporation failed to apply for a hearing to\nreview the determination and the assessment had become finally and irrevocably\nfixed against the corporation. Four years later, on April 15, 1979, the\ncorporation sold its business assets in bulk to a purchaser for $100,000. The\npurchaser failed to give notice to the Department of Taxation and Finance or\nwithhold the funds from the seller. Furthermore, the purchaser did not pay $500\nsales tax imposed on the sale of tangible personal property which was included\nin the business assets sold to him. From information received from the seller, the Division of Taxation ascertained that a bulk sale had taken place and that\nsubsequent to the date of the assessment, but prior to the date of sale of the\nassets, the seller-corporation had failed to collect $6,000 in sales taxes from\nits customers which the State claims should have been collected. One year later\non April 15, 1980, an additional assessment was issued against the\nseller-corporation for $6,500, which amount included both the $6,000 the seller\nfailed to collect from his customers prior to the bulk sale and the $500 sales\ntax on the taxable tangible personal property included in the assets sold in\nbulk, plus appropriate penalty and interest. On that date, the Division of\n\nTaxation mailed a notice to the purchaser of the $11,500 claimed to be due from\nthe seller ($5,000 plus $6,500). On May 15, 1980, the purchaser filed his\napplication for a hearing. The seller did not file. The purchaser may challenge\nthe $11,500 liability asserted against him on the grounds that both the $5,000\nand the $6,500 assessment issued against the seller were excessive. (f) The purchaser is entitled to\nexamine the returns of the seller and any other information in the possession\nof the department with respect to any sales taxes due from the seller, but only\nthose portions of such returns or other information which are pertinent to the\nissue of the purchaser's liability. (g) A purchaser is entitled to a hearing with\nthe Division of Tax Appeals or a conference with the Bureau of Conciliation and\n\nMediation Services of the Division of Taxation to review a denial of his\napplication for refund of tax determined to be due from the seller, whether or\nnot the seller's liability has been finally and irrevocably fixed, where the\npurchaser has paid the tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance and has\napplied for said hearing or conference within 90 days from the date of denial\nof his application for a refund; provided, however, that the purchaser has\nfiled his application for a refund within two years after the giving of notice\nby the Division of Taxation to such purchaser of the total amount of the tax\nwhich the State claims to be due from the seller.
