  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.115 - UNDERPASS Sign (NYW7-9)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The UNDERPASS (NYW7-9) sign (see Sign Drawing SD-W22)\nmay be used, as necessary, to warn of underpasses which are not adequately\nvisible to approaching traffic for sufficient distances and which, upon coming\ninto view, may cause indecision regarding vertical or lateral clearance. Guidance: 02 The UNDERPASS sign should not be used where: A. A ONE LANE BRIDGE, ONE LANE ROAD, or\nadvance clearance sign (see Sections 2C.21, 2C.101, and\n2C.27\n) is used in advance of the\nunderpass; or\nB. The underpass, upon coming into view, obviously has clearances in excess of critical\nvalues. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.115\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
