(1)\n\nClaims for State (and Federal) aid in\nbehalf of expenditures for medical care shall be prepared and submitted in\naccordance with departmental regulations with respect thereto. (2)\n\nThe internal controls established by the\npublic welfare official for the examination and verification prior to payment\nof bills for medical services rendered shall identify and isolate any payments\nor portions of payments that exceed limits stipulated by State regulations and\nthe claims for State (and Federal) aid prepared and submitted by the agency\nshall exclude from calculations of such aid any such amounts, as require by\ndepartmental regulations governing the preparation and submission of claims. Other elements requiring case expenditure analysis entering into the\ndevelopment of proper claims, such as program and residence status, shall also\nbe provided for in the internal analysis and processing of medical services\npayments. (3)\n\nWhere claims and\nrolls for State aid purposes must be supported by vouchers or statements of\nservices paid for medical care, the public welfare agency must ensure, in its\noperating procedures, that sufficient copies of the appropiate documents are\ndeveloped to meet both its internal needs and the roll and claim\nrequirements.
