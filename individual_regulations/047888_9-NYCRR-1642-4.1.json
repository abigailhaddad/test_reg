  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The aim of the\ndetailed procedures, instructions, and specimen forms provided herein is to\nassist local agencies in properly recording and controlling all charges and\ncredits to tenants and in accounting for project revenue arising therefrom. The\nsystem is designed for a situation in which the rent, schedule contains a\nconstant element, hereinafter referred to as the basic rent, which does not\nchange from month to month, and of variable elements consisting of surcharges\nand retroactive surcharges, which may vary from month to month with changes of\ntenancy or of tenants' incomes. Suitable modifications may be made to provide\nfor a possible, third variable element, namely excess utility charges, if any, or if the need for the surcharge or retroactive surcharge classifications\npasses or is not present. The system may further be expanded to record and\ncontrol rents and other charges to commercial tenants, charges for the use of\nnon-dwelling facilities, etc. (b) The system is designed for hand posting and should be used for tenant\naccounting in connection with the operation of offsite property or of the site\nprior to demolition, etc., as well as with the operation of the project proper. Variations from the system described herein which do not destroy or weaken the\ncontrol over tenant's charges and credits, rent roll, vacancy losses, and cash\nreceipts, are permitted. Local agencies engaged in operating more than one\nproject should strive to achieve uniformity as to system procedures and use of\ndocuments. The following specimen forms will be found in Appendix S-8: Tenants Ledger\n\nExhibit 20\n\nTenants Receipt\n\nExhibit 21\n\nMiscellaneous Charge and Credit Ticket\n\nExhibit 22\n\nDaily Statement of Operations\n\nExhibits 23 and 24\n\nTenants Charge and Credit Book\n\nExhibit 25\n\nRent Roll and Vacancy Loss Control Book\n\nExhibit 26\n(c) Where machine posting is used, the\nspecimen forms must, of course, be adapted to meet the requirements of the\nparticular machine. (d) In addition\nto the exhibited specimen accounting forms listed above, the tenant accounting\nsystem requires the following management forms prepared and approved by the\nproject manager: (1)\n\nMove-in and collect\nnotice. This form should be completed prior to the time the\ntenant moves into the apartment. See specimen form illustrated as Exhibit 32 of\n\nAppendix S-8. (2)\n\nMove-out\nnotice. This form, Notice of Apartment to be Vacated, shall be\nprepared as soon as the tenant notifies the project office that he is ready to\nmove. See specimen form illustrated as Exhibit 33 of Appendix S-8 and refer to\nsubdivision (g) of section\n1642-4.3. The move-in and move-out\nnotices are also employed in intra and interproject transfers. (3)\n\nRent change authorization. This form is illustrated on page 24 of the\n\nGuide to Annual Income Verification and Quarterly Income Review for\n\nTenants in State-aided Public Housing Projects\nissued by the division, dated November 1, 1955. Also see subdivision (h) of section\n1642-4.3. (4)\n\nTenant refund request. This form should be prepared by the project bookkeeper\nafter the tenant has moved and the move-out notice has been processed. See\n\nExhibit 34 of Appendix S-8 for a specimen form. (5)\n\nSpace inventory record. (i) Prior to renting, a space inventory\nrecord card should be prepared for each apartment. When assignment is made, the\nname of the tenant is entered. Move-in date is filled in either at the same\ntime or later, if the move-in date is unknown at time of assignment. This file\nremains as a permanent record. As move-ins, move-outs, and transfers occur, the\nappropriate entries are made on the cards. It is essential that these cards are\nalways kept up to date. (ii)\n\nNo\nerasures or deletions are permitted on these cards. Corrections should be\ncancelled by explanation notices. The move-in date must correspond with the\ndate that establishes the pro rata charges on the ledger cards. See Exhibit 9\nof Appendix S-8 for a specimen form. (6)\n\nWork orders. A work order should be prepared for each job done in a\ntenant's apartment. These sheets are prenumbered and prepared in duplicate, and\nboth copies are sent to the superintendent's office for action. The duplicate\nis held by the superintendent and the original is given to the maintenance man, who is to make the repair. After the job has been completed and the tenant has\nsigned the original, the original work order is returned to the\nsuperintendent's office, where it is matched with the duplicate. After the\namount of the charge is indicated on the work order (if there is no charge, the\nwork order should be marked accordingly) the original and duplicate is sent to\nthe project bookkeeper. The project bookkeeper will enter the charge, if any, on the tenant's card from the original. The bookkeeper will also maintain the\noriginal copies of the work orders in numerical sequence (whether or not the\ntenant was charged). The duplicate copy is filed in the tenant' s folder. See\n\nExhibit 35 of Appendix S-8 for a specimen form of a work\norder. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-4.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
