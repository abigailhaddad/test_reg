(f) Non-Compliance with Staffing Standards. (1)\n\nCompliance with the minimum nursing staff\nrequirements set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this Section\nshall be determined on a quarterly basis, as determined by the Department, by\ncomparing the daily average of the number of hours provided per resident, per\nday, using the most recent data available from the federal Centers for Medicare\nand Medicaid Services payroll based journal and the facility's average daily\ncensus on a daily basis. (i) The Department\nshall initially determine whether a facility is compliant or non-compliant with\nthe minimum nursing staff requirements by conducting the following three\nassessments: (a) Assessing whether the total\ndaily staffing hours provided per resident by nurse aides (only from January\nfirst, two thousand twenty-two through December thirty-first, two thousand\ntwenty-two), certified nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, or registered\nnurses fell below 3.5 hours of care per resident on average over the course of\nthe quarter; and\n(b) Assessing\nwhether at least 2.2 hours of care per resident per day was provided by a\ncertified nurse aide or a nurse aide (only from January first, two thousand\ntwenty-two through December thirty-first, two thousand twenty-two) on average\nover the course of the quarter; and\n(c) Assessing whether at least 1.1 hours of\ncare per resident per day was provided by a registered professional nurse or\nlicensed practical nurse on average over the course of the\nquarter. (ii)\nA facility\nthat, on average over the course of the quarter, fell below the hourly\nrequirements set forth in clauses (a) through (c) of subparagraph (i) will be\nconsidered non-compliant for the purposes of this Section. Any facility that\nthe Department finds non-compliant shall have progressive penalties assessed\nbased upon the number of days per quarter in which the daily staffing hours\nprovided per resident fell below the minimum hourly requirements set forth in\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this Section. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of determining\ncompliance, an individual shall not be counted while performing administrative\nservices, as defined in the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services payroll\nbased journal for long-term care facilities. Further, individuals who are\nattending training, either onsite or offsite, and are not available to perform\ntheir primary job duties shall not be counted for purposes of determining\ncompliance with the minimum daily staffing hours. (2)\n\nPenalties. (i) The Department shall impose a penalty of\nup to two thousand (2,000) dollars per day for each day in a quarter that a\nfacility fails to comply with the minimum nursing staff requirements set forth\nin paragraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this Section, unless mitigating or\naggravating factors exist. (ii)\n\nMitigating Factors. The Department may reduce penalties in a quarter that a\nfacility is non-compliant, if the Department determines, in its sole\ndiscretion, that any of the following mitigating circumstances existed during\nthe period of non-compliance: (a) Extraordinary circumstances faced the facility. For the purposes of this\nclause, extraordinary circumstances shall mean that the facility experienced a\nnatural disaster; a national emergency affecting the facility has been\nofficially declared; a State or municipal emergency affecting the facility has\nbeen declared pursuant to Article 2-B of the Executive Law; or the facility\nexperienced a catastrophic event that caused physical damage to the facility or\nimpaired the ability of facility personnel to access the facility. Provided, however, that the facility must first demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the\n\nDepartment, that such extraordinary circumstances could not have been prevented\nor mitigated through effective implementation of the facility's pandemic\nemergency plan, prepared pursuant to Section\n2803\n(12)\nof the Public Health Law, and that the\nfacility complied with the disaster and emergency preparedness requirements set\nforth in Section\n415.26\n(f) of this\n\nPart; or\n(b) An acute labor supply\nshortage of nurse aides, certified nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, or\nregistered nurses exists in the Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area in which\nthe facility is located, as such areas are defined by the federal Bureau of\n\nLabor Statistics. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of\ndetermining whether a facility was located in an area experiencing an acute\nlabor supply shortage during the period of noncompliance, the Commissioner\nshall issue a determination on a quarterly basis as to whether an acute labor\nsupply shortage of nurse aides, certified nurse aides, licensed practical\nnurses, or registered nurses exists in any Metropolitan or Nonmetropolitan Area\nof New York State. Such determination shall be made in consultation with the\n\nNew York State Department of Labor and shall take into account job availability\nmetrics developed by the New York State Department of Labor, which may include\nbut is not limited to the list of job openings in New York State. (2)\n\nThe fact that the facility is located in\nan area experiencing an acute labor supply shortage pursuant to this clause\nshall not serve as a mitigating factor unless the facility has demonstrated, to\nthe satisfaction of the Department, reasonable attempts to procure sufficient\nstaffing during the period of non-compliance, notwithstanding the acute labor\nsupply shortage. Reasonable attempts may include, but not be limited to, incentivizing new personnel through increased wage and benefit offers and\nsearching for personnel outside of the Metropolitan and Nonmetropolitan Area in\nwhich the facility is located; (3)\n\nThe fact that the facility is located in an area experiencing an acute labor\nsupply shortage pursuant to this clause shall not serve as a mitigating factor\nunless the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Department, that it has taken steps over the course of the quarter to ensure resident\nhealth and safety notwithstanding any labor supply shortage, including but not\nlimited to discontinuing admissions or transferring residents to another\nappropriate facility; or\n(c) A verifiable union dispute exists between\nthe facility and nurse aides, certified nurse aides, licensed practical nurses, or registered nurses employed or contracted by such facility, resulting in a\nlabor shortage at the facility. (g) Eligibility for Funding to Comply with\n\nMinimum Nursing Staff Requirements. The Department shall determine which\nnursing homes are anticipated to be in compliance with Section\n2828\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law based on the most current, available Residential Health Care\n\nFacility cost report data, or such other source of cost information as the\n\nDepartment shall identify. Pursuant to methodology set forth in the current\n\nMedicaid State Plan Amendment, the Department shall determine whether such\nnursing homes must expend additional funds to comply with this Section, beyond\nany costs necessary to comply with Section\n2828\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law. Any such nursing home that the Department finds will be\nrequired to expend additional funds to comply with this Section shall be\neligible to receive from the Department additional funds, subject to\navailability from the New York State Division of the Budget, to hire nursing\nstaff necessary to achieve the minimum nursing staff requirements set forth in\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this Section.
