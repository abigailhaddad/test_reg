  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-2.5 - Premium on temporary loan notes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Premiums received from purchasers of temporary loan notes issued by the local\nagency in amounts of less than $100 will be credited directly to the\nappropriate interest cost or expense account, the date of issue of the\ntemporary loan notes being the determining factor as to whether the credit will\nbe to development or operations. Thus, if the date of issue of the temporary\nloan notes is prior to the date of substantial completion, the premium thereon, if under $100, is credited, through the cash receipts register, directly to\naccount 1420.1, Interest. Similarly, if the date of issue of the temporary loan\nnotes is subsequent to the date of substantial completion, the premium thereon, if under $100, is credited, through the cash receipts register, directly to\naccount 4716, Interest on Indebtedness. (b) Where the premium received is in the\namount of $100 or more, the premium should be set up as a deferred credit and\namortized pro rata over the life of the temporary loan note to the appropriate\ninterest cost or expense account. The write-offs should be made by journal\nvoucher at the end of each calendar quarter. The entries should be recorded, as\nfollows: (1)\n\nPremium deposited in project's\nbank account. The accounting entries are as follows: Entry (1): Through cash receipts register at time cash\nis received: Dr. Account 1111--Development Fund or\n\nDr. Account 1112--Administration Fund\n\nCr. Account 2230--Premium on Temporary Loan\n\nNotes\n\nNote:Entry (1) records the receipt of the premium in\ncash. Entry (2): Through journal voucher for the quarterly\npro rata write-off: Dr. Account 2230--Premium on Temporary Loan\n\nNotes\n\nCr. Account 1420.1--Interest or\n\nCr. Account 4716--Interest on Indebtedness\n\nNote:Entry (2) credits the appropriate interest cost or\nexpense account with a pro rata portion of the premium applicable to the\nperiod. (2)\n\nPremium\nretained by the escrow agent. The accounting entries are as follows: Entry (1): Through the journal voucher at the time the\nfunds are re-\nceived by the escrow agent, who retains the premium and\ninvests the funds so that they are available to pay interest at the date of\nmaturity of the temporary loan notes: Dr. Account 1115--Special Deposits\n\nCr. Account 2230--Premium on Temporary Loan\n\nNotes\n\nEntry (2): Through journal voucher for the quarterly\npro rata write-off: Dr. Account 2230--Premium on Temporary Loan\n\nNotes\n\nCr. Account 1420.1--Interest or\n\nCr. Account 4716--Interest on\n\nIndebtedness\n(3)\n\nWhere the\npremium on temporary loan notes is in the amount of $100 or more, the\nallocation of the write-off credits, and the cutoff dates, to the project\nproper and the related programs shall follow the same rules applicable to the\ninterest charge. The effect will be that the appropriate interest cost or\nexpense accounts will reflect the net interest charge for the period, after\ncredit for the premium. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
