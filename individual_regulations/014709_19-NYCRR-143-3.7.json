  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 §§ 143-3.7 - Limitations applicable to XML documents and XML transmissions\n\nState Regulations\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this Part to the\ncontrary, XML documents and XML transmissions shall be subject to the\nlimitations and restrictions set forth in this section. (a) The central filing office will not accept\nany UCC search request or UCC copy request submitted by XML transmission. In\nparticular, but not by way of limitation, an initial financing statement\nsubmitted to the central filing office by XML transmission may not contain a\nrequest for search report(s) on any debtor(s) named in such initial financing\nstatement. If an initial financing statement submitted to the central filing\noffice by XML transmission contains any such search request, the search request\nwill not be processed even if the initial financing statement is accepted for\nfiling. (b) The central filing\noffice will not accept any correction statement (UCC-5) submitted by XML\ntransmission. (c) The central\nfiling office will not accept a combination filing (as described in section\n143-1.3\n[c]\nof\nthis Part) submitted by XML transmission. An amendment submitted to the central\nfiling office by XML transmission can be filed as one, but only one, of the\nfollowing: a termination statement, a continuation statement, a full\nassignment, a party information amendment (i.e., an amendment that changes, deletes, or adds a debtor or a secured party), or a collateral information\namendment (i.e., an amendment that deletes collateral, adds collateral, or\nrestates the description of collateral). In particular, but not by way of\nlimitation: (1)\na single amendment submitted\nby XML transmission cannot be filed as both a party information amendment and a\ncollateral information amendment; (2)\nin the case of a party information\namendment, only one debtor or one secured party may be changed, deleted, or\nadded; and\n(3)\na partial assignment\naffecting only some (but not all) of the collateral covered by the identified\nfinancing statement (see clause \"iii\" in instruction number 4 on the reverse of\nthe amendment form promulgated under section\n143-1.3\n[a][4]\nof\nthis Part) is considered to be two actions, as it involves both an assignment\nand a collateral information amendment; therefore, such a partial assignment\ncannot be accomplished by a single amendment submitted to the central filing\noffice by XML transmission. (d) All information in a document submitted\nto the central filing office by XML transmission must be included within the\navailable fields of the XML document. A document submitted to the central\nfiling office by XML transmission cannot include any exhibits, schedules or\nother attachments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§§\n143-3.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
