  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.10 - Apprehension of persons\n\nState Regulations\n\nSee section\n516.3\nof this Title for more detailed procedures). (a) Apprehension in AWOL cases. (1)\n\nThe apprehension of persons AWOL is\nexplicitly authorized by New York State Military Law, section\n130.7: (i) Apprehension is the taking into custody\nof a person. (ii)\n\nAny person\nauthorized under regulations issued pursuant to this Part (see Rule 302, N.Y.R.C.M.) to apprehend persons subject to this code, any marshal of a\ncourt-martial appointed pursuant to the provisions of this Part and any peace\nofficer acting pursuant to his special duties or police officer may apprehend\npersons subject to this code upon reasonable belief that an offense has been\ncommitted and that the person apprehended committed it. (2)\n\nApprehension in the New York Military Law\nis the equivalent of \"arrest\" in civilian terminology, and there must be\ngrounds for ordering a person to be apprehended. The person must be subject to\nthe jurisdiction of the New York Military Law; i.e., presently a member of the\norganized militia and there must be probable cause to apprehend the person. Probable cause to apprehend exists when there are reasonable grounds to believe\nthat an offense (AWOL) has been or is being committed and the person to be\napprehended committed or is committing it. Reasonable grounds means that there\nmust be the kind of reliable information that a reasonably prudent person would\nrely on which makes it more likely than not that something is true. The person\nwho determines probable cause may rely on the reports of others. (3)\n\nThe person authorizing or ordering\napprehension shall be the immediate commander of the person about whom a report\nof an AWOL offense was received. The commander, in conjunction with authorizing\nor ordering an apprehension; shall cause to be prepared DMNA form 1057, Non-Judicial Punishment, or DMNA form 1050, a courts-martial Charge Sheet\nsetting forth the charges and specifications of the alleged offense. A copy of\nDMNA form 1057 or DMNA form 1050 shall be attached to a written Order or\n\nAuthorization for Apprehension, DMNA form 1062. (See Appendix L-2 [A24]). The\nDMNA form 1062 and supporting papers will be reviewed by a judge advocate who\nshall initial under the authorizing signature, and the order of apprehension\nshall be delivered to the person who or agency which shall execute the\napprehension. (4)\n\nThe person making\nthe apprehension must be one authorized to do so by Rule 302(b) N.Y.R.C.M. An\napprehension for an AWOL offense shall be made by military law enforcement\nofficials, civilian law enforcement officials, or, commissioned, warrant, petty\nand noncommissioned officers (E-8 or above) on either an IDT, AT or state\nactive duty status. Whenever possible, apprehension should be carried out by or\nin conjunction with state, city or local policy or local sheriffs' departments. Where no state, city or local police or sheriffs' department personnel are\navailable, apprehension may be executed by unit personnel without law\nenforcement assistance, only if the use of force is not required or utilized. Under no circumstances are unit personnel to use handcuffs or other restraining\ndevices. (5)\n\nApprehension, as used\nin the context of AWOL recovery, is not meant to be a form of restraint, and\nmust not be construed or treated as a form of punishment, detention or\nconfinement. Discipline or punishment of AWOL cases can only be administered\nthrough the article 15 or court-martial process. (6)\n\nApprehension herein is utilized only to\nsecure the delivery of a person to his unit while in a drill or AT status for\npurposes of disciplining the individual. The use of physical force, restraint\nor coercion by unit members is not authorized. NOTE: Paragraphs (7) and (8) of\nthis subdivision are not applicable if apprehension is being effected by a\npeace officer, i.e., State Police, Sheriff's Office personnel or local police\nofficers. (7)\n\nApprehension is made\nby clearly notifying the person to be apprehended that he is in custody. Such\nnotification should be in substantially the following format: Are you (name and rank of AWOL service member)?\nPursuant to the order of ________ Commander of ________ and\na warrant for apprehension dated (hand copy of warrant and charge sheet to\nperson being detained) you are being taken into custody for violation of the\n\nState Code of Military Justice, New York State Military Law, section 130.82 for\nbeing absent without leave. You are directed to accompany me to the armory\npursuant to the aforesaid warrant. This notice must be given orally or in writing by the\nperson making the apprehension, and force or restraint to effect custody must\nnot be used, if performed by unit personnel. Any person or persons making an\napprehension should maintain custody of the person apprehended and deliver to\nand inform as promptly as possible the immediate commander of the person\napprehended or any official higher in the chain of command of the person\napprehended if it is impractical to inform the immediate commander. (8)\n\nIn the event the person being\ntaken into custody refuses to accompany the apprehending official back to the\narmory, such person should be given a notice in substantially the following\nformat: Your refusal to accompany me pursuant to an order of your\ncommander and the warrant for apprehension is a further violation of the State\n\nCode of Military Justice and may result in further charges, and additional\njudicial proceedings pursuant to the State Code of Military Justice. Such\nproceedings could result in a less-than-honorable discharge and/or confinement\nin a civilian jail. (9)\n\nThe\nfailure or refusal of the person apprehended to cooperate or to remain at drill\nor AT may result in a further violation of the New York Military Law, but such\naction on the part of the person apprehended is not a reason or cause for any\nperson, other than a peace officer, to use physical force, restraint or\ndetention to prevent the person apprehended from leaving. (10)\n\nAn apprehension by unit personnel may be\nmade at any time or any place except by means of entering a private dwelling\nwhere the person to be apprehended resides. In other words apprehensions at\npersonal residences are only permissible to the extent of being \"pursuant to\nat-the-door\" contact with the individual to be apprehended. Of course, law\nenforcement personnel may enter if they so choose, to carry out our\nwarrants. (11)\nA person who is not\na resident of a private dwelling entered may not challenge the legality of an\napprehension made without a search or arrest warrant, but the persons making an\napprehension do not have authority to execute civilian arrest or search\nwarrants. (12)\nA complete written\nreport of the apprehension, including date, time and location thereof shall be\nfiled with the immediate commander of the person apprehended as soon as\nreasonably practicable after the apprehension is made. (13)\n\nIn the case of apprehensions made\npursuant to courts-martial charges, unit personnel should attempt to serve a\ncopy of the charge sheet on the accused prior to the issuance of a warrant for\napprehension. (See sections\n516.3\n[h], 516.6\n[b]\nand\n516.8\n[d]\nof this Title). This is well advised because if the individual has been\nnotified of the charges by service of the charge sheet (so as to satisfy the\nrule requirements of having the opportunity to prepare a defense) then the\ncourt-martial may proceed upon the individual being brought before the\ncourt-martial by execution of the warrant for apprehension. If not, then all\nthat can be accomplished when the individual is first brought in is service of\nthe charge sheet and arraignment (reading of the charges and taking of a\nplea). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n515.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
