  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.465 - External corrosion control: monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pipe-to-soil electrical potential tests\nor other acceptable electrical tests shall be conducted over each pipeline 100\nfeet (30.5 meters), or longer that is under cathodic protection at least once\neach calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 15 months, to determine\nwhether the cathodic protection meets the requirements of section\n255.463\nof this Part. These should\nalso be conducted for pipelines shorter than 100 feet (30.5 meters). However, if tests at those intervals are impractical for separately protected short\nsections of mains or transmission lines, not in excess of 100 feet (30.5\nmeters), or separately protected service lines, these pipelines may be surveyed\non a sampling basis. At least 10 percent of these protected structures, distributed over the entire system must be surveyed each calendar year, with a\ndifferent 10 percent checked each subsequent year, so that the entire system is\ntested in each 10-year period. (b) Cathodic protection rectifier or other impressed current power source must be\nperiodically inspected as follow: (1)\n\nEach\ncathodic protection rectifier or impressed current power source must be\ninspected six times each calendar year, but with intervals not exceeding 2-1/2\nmonths between inspections, to ensure adequate amperage and voltage levels\nneeded to provide cathodic protection are maintained. This may be done either\nthrough remote measurement or through an onsite inspection of the\nrectifier. (2)\n\nAfter January 1, 2022, each remotely inspected rectifier must be physically inspected for\ncontinued safe and reliable operation at least once each calendar year, but\nwith intervals not exceeding 15 months. (c) Each reverse current switch, each diode, and each interference bond whose failure would jeopardize structure protection\nmust be electrically checked for proper performance six times each calendar\nyear, but at intervals not exceeding 21/2 months. Each other interference bond\nmust be checked at least once each calendar year, but at intervals not\nexceeding 15 months. (d) Each\noperator shall take prompt remedial action to correct any deficiencies\nindicated by the monitoring. (e) After the initial evaluation required by sections\n255.455\n(b)-(c)\nand\n255.457\n(b) of\nthis Part, each operator must, not less than every three years, at intervals\nnot exceeding 39 months, reevaluate its unprotected pipelines and cathodically\nprotect them in accordance with this Part in areas in which active corrosion is\nfound. The operator must determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical\nsurvey. However, on distribution lines and where an electrical survey is\nimpractical on transmission lines, areas of active corrosion may be determined\nby other means that include review and analysis of leak repair and inspection\nrecords, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection records, and the\npipeline environment. (f) The\noperator shall determine the areas of active corrosion by electrical survey, or\nwhere electrical survey is impractical, by using the required leakage survey\n(see section\n255.723\n[b]\nof\nthis Part) in conjunction with an analysis of the corrosion and leak history\nrecords, or by other approved means.
