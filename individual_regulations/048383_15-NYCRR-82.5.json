Tit. 15 § 82.5 - Obligations of the repair shop\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe repair shop shall: (a) upon the request of any customer, make an\nestimate in writing of the parts and labor necessary for each specific repair\nor service offered and shall not charge for work done or parts supplied in\nexcess of the estimate without the consent of such customer. The repair shop\nmay charge a reasonable fee for making an estimate. The estimate shall contain\nthe following: the customer's name, the name and facility number of the repair\nshop, the date of the estimate, a list of parts necessary for each specific\nrepair together with the costs for each part, indicating any parts which are\nnot new parts of at least original equipment quality, the labor charge for each\nrepair together with the costs of each labor charge, year and make of vehicle, registration plate number or vehicle identification number, a description of\nthe problem reported by the customer, and a statement informing the customer of\nhis right to receive replaced parts if the customer makes a written request for\nsuch return. In addition, for body parts, the repair shop must indicate if the\npart is a new original equipment manufacturer part, a new after market\nequipment manufacturer part or a used part. A statement on an estimate that all\nbody parts are in one of the three classes except as otherwise indicated\ncomplies with this last requirement. All information on an estimate must be\nlegible; (b) not perform any\nservices not authorized by the customer by a work order. If a repair shop\nprepares a written work order, a copy shall be given to the customer. If a\nwritten work order is prepared by the customer, such work order shall be\nattached to the invoice. If the customer gives an oral work order, the oral\nwork order shall be noted on the invoice and shall include the date, time and\nmanner of authorization and by whom such authorization was given; (c) provide the customer with an invoice. An\ninvoice shall contain the following information: the name, address and facility\nnumber of the repair shop, the date of the invoice, the date the vehicle was\npresented to the repair shop for repair or services, a list of all parts\nsupplied and labor performed, including the cost for each such part and labor, a notation indicating the status of any part used which is not new and of at\nleast original quality (i.e., used, rebuilt, etc.), the odometer reading at the\ntime the invoice was prepared, a promised date of delivery, if any such date\nwas given, the name of the customer, year, make, and plate number and/or\nvehicle identification number of the vehicle, the terms and time limit of any\nguarantee for the repair work performed, a description of the problem reported\nby the customer, and the repair shop registration number. If the inflatable\nrestraint system is replaced, the invoice shall indicate the name and tax\nidentification number from whom the inflatable restraint was purchased. If such\nsystem is a salvage unit, the invoice must also state the dismantler's\nregistration number, the vehicle identification number of the vehicle from\nwhich the unit came and the part number from the salvage inflatable restraint\nsystem. The invoice must indicate \"salvage inflatable restraint system\" if a\nsalvage unit was used. The insurer and consumer shall receive a copy of the\npurchase invoice for the replacement inflatable restraint system. A repair\nperformed under warranty requires an invoice which complies with this\nsubdivision. In addition, if body parts were used in the repair, the invoice\nmust indicate if each such part is a new original equipment manufacturer part, a new after-market equipment manufacturer part or a used part. A statement on\nan invoice that all body parts are in one of the three classes except as\notherwise indicated complies with this last requirement. All information on an\ninvoice must be legible; (d) return\nreplaced parts if a timely written demand is made by the customer. If work is\nauthorized over the telephone, it shall be presumed that the customer wants his\nparts returned and the repair shop shall keep such parts until the customer or\nhis agent appears to retrieve the motor vehicle at which time the replaced\nparts shall be given to the customer if he so directs. Customers may not waive\ntheir rights to replaced parts over the telephone. This subdivision does not\napply to parts, components or equipment normally sold on an exchange basis or\nsubject to a manufacturer's warranty; (e) operate the vehicle while in its\npossession only in accordance with the directions of the customer or as is\nnecessary to repair or road-test the vehicle; (f) make repairs covered by\nguarantee; (g) provide quality\nrepairs; (h) not commit a fraud or\na deceptive practice; (i) not\ngrossly overcharge; (j) upon\nrequest of the customer, return the registration number plates to the customer, or, within 24 hours of the request, personally deliver or mail by special\ndelivery first-class mail to the nearest motor vehicle office the registration\nnumber plates and a notice that the vehicle is being held to satisfy a lien for\nstorage or repairs; (k) [Reserved]\n(l) complete repairs in\na prompt and timely fashion unless needed parts are unavailable or\nextraordinary circumstances prevent it; (m) not service an air conditioning system\nunless it uses approved motor vehicle refrigerant recycling equipment; and\n(n) an activated/deployed, or\nstolen inflatable restraint may only be replaced with a unit newly manufactured\nfor first-time use. However, a salvaged undeployed inflatable restraint system\nmay be used as a replacement only if the consumer specifically requests a\nsalvaged unit and proper documentation procedures are followed. However, nothing shall require a repair shop to install a salvaged inflatable restraint. In addition, on and after March 1, 1998, only a new inflatable restraint system\nor a salvage unit certified according to standards established by a nationally\nrecognized testing, engineering and research body may be used for an inflatable\nrestraint repair or replacement.
