So that each face, with indications visible from any location, shall be spaced\nlaterally at least 8 feet from the next adjacent face with indications visible\nfrom the same location; D. So that\nwhen a primary signal face controls left turn movements associated with the\nsame intersection approach, they shall not be to the left of that primary face\nunless they display the same indications; and\nE. So that when a primary signal face\ncontrols right turn movements associated with the same intersection approach, they shall not be to the right of that primary face unless they display the\nsame indications.
