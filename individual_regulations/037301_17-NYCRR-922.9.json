  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 922.9 - Testing boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Time of\ntesting. Every boiler or steam reservoir before being put into service and at\nleast once every 12 months thereafter, shall be subjected to hydrostatic\npressure 25 per cent above the working steam pressure. (b) Removal of dome cap. The dome cap and\nthrottle stand pipe must be removed immediately after the application of the\nhydrostatic pressure, and the interior surface and connections of the boiler or\nsteam reservoir examined as thoroughly as conditions will permit. In case the\nboiler or steam reservoir can be entered and thoroughly inspected without\nremoving the throttle stand pipe, the inspector may make the inspection by\nremoving the dome cap only, but any variation from the rule must be noted in\nthe certificate of inspection. (c) Witness of test. When the test is being made by the operator's inspector, an\nauthorized representative of the operator thoroughly familiar with boiler\nconstruction must personally witness the test and thoroughly examine the boiler\nor steam reservoir while under hydrostatic pressure. (d) Repairs and steam test. When all\nnecessary repairs have been completed, the boiler shall be fired up or the\nsteam reservoir shall be charged and the steam pressure raised to not less than\nthe allowable working pressure, and the boiler or reservoir and appurtenances\nshall be carefully examined. All cocks, valves, seams, bolts, and rivets must\nbe tight under this pressure, and all defects disclosed must be\nrepaired. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n922.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
