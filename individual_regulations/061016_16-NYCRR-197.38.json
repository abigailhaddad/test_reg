  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.38 - Work order system required (class a and class b utilities only)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Class A and\n\nClass B utilities shall record all changes in operating property used wholly or\npartly in electric operations by means of a work order or job order system. Such work orders and supporting records shall be permanently preserved. The\nwork order system shall include a work order estimate and a work in progress\nrecord, and shall contain the particulars described below. (b) All installations, additions, retirements, or replacements shall be covered by a work order estimate and a\nwork in progress record. Standing work orders may be used for projects of less\nthan $1,000 by Class A utilities and for projects of less than $500 by Class B\nutilities. These limits may be modified by special order of the commission when\nwarranted by particular circumstances. (c) The work order estimate shall include the\nfollowing particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter and the signature of the officer or employee who authorized\nthe work or purchase. If authorization is by a board of the operating or lessor\nmunicipality or other body, the proper officer shall so state over his\nsignature. (2)\nA description and\nthe location of the work to be done (or the purchase to be made), the dates\nbetween which such work (or purchase) is to be accomplished, the date when the\nwork was begun, and the date when finished. (3)\n\nDetailed estimates of the cost of the\nproject, together with maps, plans, diagrams, specifications, etc., applicable. (4)\n\nThe account or\naccounts to which the cost of the project is chargeable and the amount\nchargeable to each account. (5)\n\nAny\nvariations between estimates and actual costs of the project. (6)\n\nWhen a retirement, replacement, betterment, or rearrangement of property is involved, the work order estimate\nshall show or refer to other records which cover the book cost (estimated if\nnot known, and the basis of the estimate to be stated) and the date of\ninstallation of the property withdrawn, enlarged, rearranged, improved, or\nreplaced, and the name and page of the accounting and engineering books and\nrecords covering such installation and the cost thereof. If a work order system\nwas in use at the time such property was installed, reference thereto shall be\nmade by number or other designation. (d) The work in progress record shall contain\nthe following particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter which shall correspond to the number or letter on the work\norder estimate covering the same project. When more than one such work in\nprogress record covers the work on a work order estimate, each shall be\nnumbered or lettered in such manner as to be readily identifiable with the work\norder estimate for the same project. (2)\n\nThe accumulated charges applicable to\neach particular job or project separately for each of the items set forth in\nsubdivision (e) of section\n197.21, and the total cost of the\ncompleted project. The cost of dismantling and the salvage realized shall also\nbe shown. When any project involves charges to more than one operating property\naccount, a separate work in progress record shall be kept for the work\nchargeable to each account. Every charge or credit on work in progress records\nshall refer to the voucher, journal, or other source from which the entry\ntherein was made. (3)\n\nFull details\nat any time of the amount carried in account 110, Construction Work in\n\nProgress. The cost of completed projects shall be promptly transferred from\nthat account to the accounts to which chargeable. Upon coming into service, completed portions involving additions to operating property accounts shall be\ntransferred to the appropriate accounts although other portions of the work\ncovered by the same work order are not yet completed and the work order has not\nbeen closed. Credits for such transfers shall be made in separate columns. A:Requirement of the use of the work order system here\noutlined may be suspended by order of the commission in the case of a utility\nwhich satisfies the commission that the system which it has in use for\nrecording changes in operating property accounts gives the equivalent detail by\naccounts in substantially the same form. The identification of expenditures\nwith property must be complete and clear, and the detail of the cost of each\nproject or job (see §\n197.21\n[e]\n[1-10])\nmust be readily available. The total of the uncompleted projects must also be\nin agreement with account 110, Construction Work in Progress. B:The work order system is required to record changes in\n\nOperating Property-- Electric and Operating Property--General. Its use is\nrecommended, however, for recording other expenditures, such as for operating\nproperty in other departments, repairs, etc. When used for repairs, balances\napplicable thereto shall be cleared monthly to the appropriate\naccounts.
