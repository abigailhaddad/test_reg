  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7920.5 - Eligible energy conservation measures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An energy conservation measure\nmust: (1)\nexcept as provided in subdivision\n(b) of this section, be clearly identified and recommended in a focused energy\nanalysis which meets the requirements of section\n7920.8\nof this Part; (2)\nresult in reduced energy\nconsumption; (3)\nhave a simple\npayback of not less than two years nor more than 10 years; and\n(4)\ninvolve a facility located within the\n\nState which is occupied at the time of submission of an application for a\nprogram rebate to the Energy Office. (b) Energy conservation measure list. (1)\n\nThe Energy Office shall prepare and make\navailable to the public a list of energy conservation measures which, on the\nbasis of prior energy programs, audits and analyses, have been determined by\nthe commissioner to commonly result in reduced energy consumption and to have\nsimple payback periods of not less than two years nor more than 10 years. The\nlist may reflect the minimum efficiency requirements needed to achieve\nconsistency with utility financial incentive programs, and with other State and\n\nFederal programs that promote energy efficiency, as necessary and appropriate\nto accomplish the objectives of the program. The list may be revised from time\nto time, as deemed appropriate by the commissioner. (2)\n\nApplicants who propose to implement\nenergy conservation measures which are identified on such list, and who provide\nany additional data which may be requested by the Energy Office, shall be\ndeemed to have satisfied the requirements of paragraph (a)(1) of this\nsection. (c) Special\nprovisions. In addition to meeting the requirements of subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the following special provisions shall apply. (1)\n\nFuel conversion projects. (i) Fuel conversion projects, other than\nconversions from renewable energy resources to fossil fuels, are eligible\nenergy conservation improvements which will be evaluated on their potential for\nsaving Btu's. (ii)\n\nSimple payback\ncalculations for such projects shall be based on the cost of the existing\nfuel. (iii)\n\nFor projects which\ninvolve the conversion to a renewable energy resource simple payback\ncalculations shall be based on the quantity and the cost of the fuels to be\ndisplaced, utilizing their current energy prices. (2)\n\nThe projected annual energy cost savings\nmay include electric demand savings, to be determined based upon the previous\n12 months of electric usage. (d) Ineligible energy conservation measures. The following energy conservation measures and activities are not eligible for\nrebates: (1)\nany project the cost of which is\nless than $1,000; (2)\nany energy\nconservation measure for which the simple payback exceeds the estimated life of\nthe measure; (3)\noperation and\nmaintenance activities; and\n(4)\nany\nenergy conservation measure commenced prior to the date of submission of a\nprogram application to the Energy Office. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7920.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
