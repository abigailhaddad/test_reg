(b) The\nevacuating hospital's director or designee may select any involuntary, emergency or consenting voluntary or informal patient for interim\naccommodation. A voluntary patient who is offered but who refuses to accept\ninterim accommodation may be: (1)\nretained at\nthe evacuating hospital; (2)\ndischarged, if appropriate, in accordance with a service plan prepared for the\npatient pursuant to section\n29.15\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law; or\n(3)\nconverted to involuntary status and thereafter given interim accommodation, if\nthe patient meets the criteria for involuntary retention. (c) When a patient is provided with interim\naccommodation pursuant to this section: (1)\n\nThe evacuating hospital shall, no later than three days following commencement\nof such accommodation, give written notice thereof to the following parties: (i) the nearest relative of the\npatient; (ii)\nadditional\nsignificant others who the patient has indicated should receive notice of the\npatient's hospitalization and status; (iii)\nthe patient's guardian, if any, if such\nguardian is not included under subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph; and\n(iv)\nthe Mental Hygiene Legal\n\nService.

In such case, the\ndirectors of the evacuating hospital and of the hospital which provided interim\naccommodation shall cooperate in effecting the patient's formal admission to\nthe latter hospital. (e) Where\ninconsistent with foregoing provisions of this Part, this section shall\ncontrol. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
