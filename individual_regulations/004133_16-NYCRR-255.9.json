  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.9 - Gathering lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nspecified in subdivision (b) of this section, each gathering line shall be\ndesigned, constructed, tested, operated and maintained as specified in\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (b) Gathering lines or any portion thereof\nlocated within the following areas shall be designed, constructed, tested, operated and maintained in accordance with the provisions of this Part\napplicable to steel transmission lines: (1)\nwithin 150 feet (45.72 meters) of an existing residence or place of public\nassembly; (2)\nwithin the limits of\nany city, or incorporated village; or\n(3)\nwithin a designated residential or\ncommercial area such as a subdivision, business or shopping center, or\ncommunity development. (c) Prior to the start of construction of any\ngathering line, notification in compliance with the following paragraphs shall\nbe filed: (1)\n\nAt least 30 days prior to the\nstart of construction for any gathering line intended to operate at a pressure\nof 125 psig (862 kPa) or more, the notice must be a letter of intent and a\nreport of specifications similar in format to Appendix 7-G of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nAt least 48 hours prior\nto the start of construction for any gathering line intended to operate at a\npressure of less than 125 psig (862 kPa), the notice is to be a letter of\nintent giving the company name, address, and specific location of the intended\nconstruction. (3)\n\nAny person\nintending to construct a gathering line in an area used for commercial farm\npurposes in at least two of the last five years regardless of the proposed\noperating pressure of the line, must complete the information requested in\n\nAppendices 7-G and 7-G(a) of this Title and provide one copy each of Appendices\n7-G and 7-G(a) of this Title to the affected farmland operator and the local\ncounty soil and water conservation district at least 48 hours in advance of the\nstart of construction. The person shall retain a copy of Appendices 7-G and\n7-G(a) of this Title for review by any interested party in the\nfuture. (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, where natural gas is\ngathered from production facilities, transported off the property on which the\nproduction facilities are located, and sold directly to an end user, the\nfollowing shall apply: (1)\n\nThe portion of the\npipeline that is downstream of the point at which no additional gas enters the\npipeline from a production facility or, in cases involving a single production\nfacility, that is downstream of the point at which the pipeline enters a public\nright-of-way, or adjacent private right-of-way, is a transmission line if it\noperates at a hoop stress of 20 percent or more of SMYS or, otherwise, a\ndistribution line. Such transmission or distribution lines shall fully comply\nwith the applicable requirements contained in this Part for such\nlines. (2)\n\nIn cases where gas is\ntransported directly from production facilities and sold to a single end-user, that portion of the pipeline which is downstream of the end-user's property\nline is a service line and shall comply with the applicable requirements\ncontained in this Part. (3)\n\nAny\nperson who intends to transport and sell gas from a production facility\ndirectly to an end-user shall report such intent as part of the notification\nrequired by subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Any person operating a gathering line\n(regardless of the pipeline material) which was originally constructed to\noperate at a pressure of less than 125 psig (862 kPa) who proposes to increase\nthe operating pressure of such line to 125 psig (862 kPa) or more shall comply\nwith the requirements of sections\n255.552, 255.553\nand\n255.555\nof this Part. (f) Any gathering line, except as specified\nin subdivision (b) of this section, shall be designed, constructed, tested, operated and maintained in conformance with sound engineering practices, including the following criteria: (1)\n\nAll\njoints shall be visually inspected for defects and shall have a neat\nworkmanlike appearance. Qualified welders and plastic joiners shall be\nemployed. (2)\n\nExcept as provided in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, all pipe shall be installed with a minimum\nof 24 inches (610 millimeters) of cover. Where solid rock is encountered, the\nminimum cover may be reduced to 12 inches (305 millimeters). In areas subject\nto erosion or in locations where future grading is likely, such as at road, highway, railroad and ditch crossings, additional protection shall be\nprovided. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, in areas actively cultivated for commercial\nfarm purposes in at least two out of the last five years, as identified by the\nfarmland operator, all pipe shall be installed with a minimum 40 inches (1,016\nmillimeters) of cover. The farmland operator can also designate such support\nland areas, not under active cultivation but subject to land management\npractices such as, but not limited to, drainage and soil erosion control\nsystems. The farmland operator may allow less than 40 inches (1,016\nmillimeters) of cover if less conforms with normal agricultural practices, including land fitting (e.g., plowing, subsoiling, disking, etc.) and\nprospective agricultural engineering projects taking into account and the\nrecommended practices and standards of the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture, Soil Conservation Service,[FN1] contained in its National Handbook\nof Conservation Practices and its National Engineering Manual. The farmland\noperator may require a depth-of-cover greater than 40 inches (1,016\nmillimeters) as a condition of permitting a right-of-way across his or her land\nwhere necessary to safely accommodate such practices and projects. (4)\n\nEach gathering line must be protected\nfrom washouts, floods, unstable soil, landslides or other hazards that may\ncause the pipeline to be exposed, to move, or to sustain abnormal\nloads. (5)\nA suitable conductive\nwire shall be installed with plastic pipe to facilitate locating it with an\nelectronic pipe locator. Other approved suitable material or means may be\nemployed for accomplishing this purpose. (6)\n\nThe maximum allowable operating pressure\nfor plastic pipelines is to be determined in accordance with either of the\nformulas in section\n255.121\nof this Part, subject to\nthe limitations of sections\n255.123\n(b) through\n(d) of this Part. (7)\n\nAll deleterious defects, gouges, dents\nand grooves shall be eliminated prior to testing. (8)\n\nThe pipeline shall be subjected to a\nminimum pressure test of 100 psig (689 kPa) or 11/2 MAOP, whichever is greater, for two hours. However, the maximum test pressure for plastic pipe may not be\nmore than three times the design pressure of the pipe. Where reservoir pressure\nof the field is less than these pressures, the reservoir pressure may be the\ntest pressure. (9)\n\nTest medium\nshall be air, inert gas or water. Other approved media may be used. (10)\n\nRegardless of installation date, pipeline markers complying with the requirements of section\n255.707\n(d)-(e)\nof\nthis Part shall be installed at each crossing of a public road, railroad, navigable waterway, and wherever else it is necessary to identify the location\nof the gathering line to reduce the possibility of damage or interference. In\nareas used for commercial farm purposes in at least two of the last five years, pipeline markers shall be installed at points which adequately identify the\nlocation and direction of the pipeline. Such location points shall be\ndetermined in consultation with the farmland operator. (11)\n\nMaps shall be prepared documenting the\nlocation of the line and critical valves. (12)\n\nThe pipelines shall be patrolled a\nminimum of every two years for washouts and other hazardous conditions, including a check for area population development change. (13)\n\nThe line shall be surveyed for leakage\nat least once every five years. (14)\n\nThe adequacy of overpressure protection\ndevices shall be verified annually to ensure safe operation of the\nline. (15)\n\nTo abandon the gathering\nsystem in place, all sources of gas must be disconnected from the system, the\nsystem shall be purged with air or inert gas and the ends sealed. (16)\n\nSufficient documentation shall be\nmaintained to demonstrate compliance with these regulations. [FN1] Information about soft types and applicable\nagricultural engineering standards and practices may be obtained from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service office, located in the\ncounty in which the gathering line is to be installed.
