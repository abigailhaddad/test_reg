These standards have been established by the\n\nCommissioner of Mental Hygiene as required by the Act. They constitute minimum\nrequirements for construction and equipment, and shall apply to all projects\nfor which State aid is requested under the Act. The commissioner may approve\nplans and specifications which contain deviations from the requirements\nprescribed if he is satisfied that the purposes of such requirements have been\nfulfilled. In addition to these requirements, it is recognized that the project\nwill have to meet the requirements of local codes and ordinances relating to\nconstruction. Flexibility. All project facilities shall be designed and\nconstructed so as to permit maximum flexibility in the proposed uses of those\nfacilities. Provision shall be made, wherever possible, for future expansion of\nthe floor areas and the relocation of interior partitions. Architectural. (1)\n\nFacilities shall be fire safe, structurally safe, and so planned as to carry\nout effectively the proposed program. The following requirements have been\nestablished to assure an orderly development of the project and to provide a\nuniform method for the preparation and review of drawings, specifications, and\nestimates. The submission of drawings, construction outlines, and\nestimates shall be in three stages as follows: (Such material is in addition to\nprogram and financial information in connection with such applications as may\nbe required by the commissioner.)\n\nFirst stage: Schematic plans [FN1]\nOutline specifications\n\nSite survey\n\nEstimated construction costs\n\nSecond stage: Preliminary plans\n\nOutline specifications\n\nRevised cost estimates\n\nThird stage: Working drawings\n\nSpecifications\n\nFinal cost estimates\n\nConstruction. (1)\n\nOne-story buildings shall be constructed of noncombustible materials of not\nless than one hour fire-resistive construction throughout except as follows: Boiler rooms and rooms used for the storage of combustible\nmaterials shall be of two-hour fire-resistive noncombustible\nconstruction. Interior nonload-bearing partitions, other than those enclosing\ncorridors and vertical shafts, may be of noncombustible construction without a\nfire-resistive rating. Buildings more than one story in height shall be constructed of\nnoncombustible materials, using a structural framework of reinforced concrete\nor structural steel except that load-bearing masonry walls and piers may be\nutilized for buildings up to and including three stories in height. The\nfire-resistive requirements of the various building elements shall be of not\nless than the following hourly ratings: Hours\n\nColumns, girders, trusses............ 11/2\n\nFloor construction including beams............ 11/2\n\nRoof construction including beams............ 1\n\nBeams supporting masonry; individually protected............ 2\n\nBearing walls............ 2\n\nCorridor partitions............ 1\n\nWalls enclosing stairways, elevator shafts, chutes and other\nvertical shafts, boiler rooms and rooms used for storage of combustible\nmaterials............ 2\n\nSubject to prior approval by the commissioner, these\nrequirements may be varied for free-standing facilities containing only\noutpatient, educational, recreational, or workshop functions utilized by\nambulant groups. Interior finish walls and ceilings of all exitways, storage\nrooms, laboratories, and areas of unusual fire hazard shall have a flamespread\nrating of less than 20. Flamespread ratings shall be on the basis of tests\nconducted in accordance with American Society for Testing Materials, Publication No. E84.
