This includes proof that all requirements of\nlocal law have been met by the applicant. Such proof includes, but is not\nlimited to, copies of resolutions, ordinances, determinations or\ncertifications. For a privately owned public water supply system, project\nauthorization shall include but not be limited to adequate proof of its\nformation of a water-works corporation pursuant to article 4 of the\n\nTransportation Corporations Law. (b) General map. For all water withdrawal\nsystems, the map shall show in sufficient detail the location or position of\nthe various lands, structures, and works associated with the existing and/or\nproposed water withdrawal system, the location of lands to be acquired, and all\ndams, reservoirs, well sites, ponds, wetlands, weirs, diversion structures or\nother known withdrawals in the vicinity.

(c) Watershed maps. Watershed maps shall be USGS topographic maps, or the equivalent, and must\nindicate the location of the withdrawal and the location of any return flow, including any existing or proposed interbasin diversions. For surface water\nwithdrawals, the map shall include the line of divide surrounding the tributary\nwatershed. (d) Contract plans. Include the contract plans for the water withdrawal system. However, for public\nwater supply systems, contract plans and specifications for treatment and\ndistribution aspects of the system shall be provided directly to the Department\nof Health for review and approval. (e) Engineer's report. The engineer's report\nshall be from the professional engineer, licensed by the State, who made the\nrecommendations and/or designed the proposed water withdrawal system. The\nreport shall contain the following minimum information: (1)\na general description of the project and\nthe engineering features of the existing or proposed water withdrawal\nsystem; (2)\na listing of all\nexisting sources of water supply, including wells, surface withdrawals, and any\npurchases, sales or transfers of water; (3)\nan evaluation of all practicable\nalternatives to the proposed source, which shall include an analysis of\nincreased water conservation measures as a means to reduce or eliminate the\nneed for the proposed source; (4)\nfor public water supply systems, the present and projected population of the\nwater service area and the present and projected consumption rate; (5)\nfor public water supply systems, the\nradius of land owned or controlled for wellhead protection surrounding any\nproposed groundwater withdrawal, or the water quality classification and a copy\nof any Department of Health Watershed Rules and Regulations for any proposed\nsurface withdrawal; (6)\nthe general\ncharacter and extent and essential design features of proposed controlling, diverting or regulatory works; (7)\nthe proposed instantaneous and maximum daily rates of withdrawal; the existing\nand projected daily average, daily maximum, and 30-day maximum water demands of\nthe water withdrawal system; (8)\nwhen applicable, any fire suppression flows which can be supplied, including\nthe duration for which such flows can be maintained; (9)\nfor public water supply systems, the\nlocation, extent and character of proposed treatment facilities; (10)\nfor groundwater sources, well drilling\nlogs, monitoring well locations and pump test data and analyses of results; and\n(11)\nfor surface water sources, information on rainfall, stream flows and classifications, contributing\nwatershed size, location of the nearby USGS stream gages, other upstream water\nwithdrawals, safe yield analyses or pass by flow calculations and proposed\nwithdrawal methods including intake structure design and screening. (f) Water conservation program. A\ncompleted form as made available by the department or, if acceptable to the\ndepartment, a detailed plan, that demonstrates the applicant's water\nconservation and efficiency measures that are environmentally sound and\neconomically feasible and that minimize inefficiencies and water losses. Such\nmeasures must include but are not limited to: source and customer metering; frequent system water auditing; system leak detection and repair; recycling and\nreuse; and ability to enforce water restrictions during drought. (g) Annual reporting form for existing\nwithdrawals. A copy of the latest annual report submitted pursuant to section\n601.5\nof this Part. (h) Acquisition maps. Land acquisition maps\nshowing: (1)\nthe lands proposed to be\nacquired, taken, condemned, or leased; and\n(2)\nif the land is for a reservoir, indicate\nground surface contours in detail sufficient to permit an accurate\ndetermination of the proposed storage capacity of the reservoir; (i) Water analyses. For public\nwater supply systems, chemical and bacteriological analyses of the water from\nthe proposed source shall be provided directly to the Department of Health for\nreview. (j) Treatment methods. For\npublic water supply systems, proposed methods of treatment of the water supply\nto insure its quality and the ability to meet applicable Department of Health\nstandards for drinking water. (k) Project justification. A summary statement in justification of the proposed\nproject using facts and information contained in the applicant's exhibits with\nspecific references thereto, which shows: (1)\nwhy the proposed project was selected from the evaluated\nalternatives; (2)\nwhy increased\nwater conservation or efficiency measures cannot negate or reduce the need for\nthe proposed water withdrawals; (3)\nwhy the proposed water withdrawal quantity is reasonable for the proposed\nuse; (4)\nwhy the proposed water\nconservation measures are environmentally sound and economically\nfeasible; (5)\nwhether the proposed\nwater supply is adequate; (6)\nwhether the proposed project is just and equitable to other municipalities and\ntheir inhabitants in regards to present and future needs for sources of potable\nwater; (7)\nwhether the proposed\nwithdrawal will result in no significant individual or cumulative adverse\nenvironmental impacts; and\n(8)\nwhether the proposed withdrawal will be consistent with all applicable\nmunicipal, State and Federal laws as well as regional interstate and\ninternational agreements.

Limited exceptions for public water\nsupply systems will only be considered by the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River\n\nBasin water resources council and regional body when in compliance with that\ncompact. In applying to the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin water\nresources council and regional body for any such exception, as applicable, the\napplicant proposing such an exception is responsible for providing the\ndepartment information in a timely manner to respond to requests by the Great\n\nLakes-St. Lawrence River Basin water resources council and regional body. The\napplicant proposing such an exception is also responsible for costs associated\nwith providing any additional information, document copies, internet postings, and public meetings required by the regional notification and application\nreview/approval processes of the Great Lakes-St. Lawrence River Basin water\nresources council and regional body. (o) Permit Renewals. Any permittee who\nintends to continue to operate a water withdrawal system beyond the period of\ntime covered in the applicable water withdrawal permit must apply for a renewal\nof the permit at least 180 days prior to its expiration unless a different\ndeadline is specified as a condition of the permit. Public notification of\nwater withdrawal permit renewal applications and timeframes for issuance shall\nbe in accordance with Part 621 of this title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
