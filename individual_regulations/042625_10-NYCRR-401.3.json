The need for such conversion will be established where it has been determined\nby the commissioner that the residents within the facility who occupy\nhealth-related facility beds actually require a skilled nursing home level of\ncare and there are no skilled nursing home care beds available within the\nfacility to accommodate such residents and the operator is in compliance with\napplicable provisions of this Subchapter. A facility permanently certified only\nfor health-related facility beds shall not apply for temporary conversion or\npermanent conversion of beds to the skilled nursing home level of care except\nin conjunction with an application for prior establishment approval pursuant to\narticle 28 of the Public Health Law and regulations promulgated pursuant\nthereto.

(5)\n\nWith\nrespect to those beds that were temporarily converted because of the need for a\nskilled nursing home level of care by specific residents in the facility, no\nadditional persons may be admitted to the facility to occupy such beds during\nthe temporary conversion period. This provision will not prohibit the facility\nfrom placing in such beds individuals who, at the time of admission to the\nfacility, required only a health-related facility level of care and who were\nadmitted to a health-related facility bed, but whose condition deteriorated so\nas to require a skilled nursing home level of care. (6)\n\nAny application for an extension of the\ntemporary conversion period shall be subject only to the procedures and\nrequirements of Part 710 of this Chapter.
