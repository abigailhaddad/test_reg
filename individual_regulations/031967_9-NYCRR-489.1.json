  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 489.1 - Purpose and scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the\nsuperintendent or his designee determines that a member who has been absent\nfrom duty, because of any injury or disease, has become fit for full and\nstrenuous duty, the superintendent or his designee shall order such member in\nwriting to return to duty. This order shall be personally delivered or sent by\nfirst class mail, return receipt requested, to the member's last known\naddress. (b) If the member wishes\nto contest the superintendent's determination that he is fit for full and\nstrenuous duty, the procedure set forth below shall be followed: (1)\n\nThe member must, on or before the date he\nis scheduled to report for duty, object in writing to the determination and\nrequest a hearing. The request shall be in writing and sent directly to the\nfirst deputy superintendent. In addition, the member shall immediately orally\nnotify his troop or detail commander (or designee) of the intention to contest\nthe determination. Failure to file a timely objection and request for a hearing\nshall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and subject the member to\ndisciplinary action if the member fails to return to duty as ordered. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of a written request for a\nhearing, the member shall be provided copies of any diagnoses, test results, recorded observations, or other records supporting the determination that the\nmember is fit for full and strenuous duty. The member shall be afforded a\nhearing as soon as practicable. At least three days prior to the hearing, the\nmember shall provide division counsel with copies of any diagnoses, test\nresults, recorded observations, or other records supporting his contention that\nhe is not fit for full and strenuous duty. (3)\n\nThe hearing shall be held at division\nheadquarters before a State Police commissioned officer holding the rank of\nstaff inspector or higher who will be chosen by the superintendent or his\ndesignee. In all cases, the hearing officer shall be of higher rank than the\nmember requesting the hearing. The member may be represented at the hearing by\ncounsel of his choice or a representative of a certified or recognized employee\norganization. A reasonable time shall be provided to obtain such\nrepresentation. The member may present medical experts and other witnesses or\nevidence and shall be given an opportunity to cross-examine division witnesses. Witnesses unable to appear in person may testify telephonically. The division\nshall have the burden of proving fitness for duty by substantial evidence. Compliance with technical rules of evidence shall not be required. Testimony at\nthe hearing shall be recorded. A transcript will be prepared only upon a\nmember's written request for the purpose of judicial review of the\nsuperintendent's decision. (4)\n\nThe\nhearing officer shall make a written report of his findings and\nrecommendations, which shall be submitted to the superintendent for final\nreview and decision. (5)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent or his designee shall render a final written determination as\nsoon as practicable after receipt of the hearing officer's report and shall\nprovide the member and his representative, if any, with a copy of the\ndetermination. The superintendent may either uphold the original order to\nreport for duty, rescind the order, or modify it. (c) A member ordered to report for duty shall\nnot be entitled to leave under regulation 5.12 of the New York State Police\n\nRules and Regulations or applicable collective bargaining agreements pending a\nfinal determination, but shall be entitled to draw upon any accumulated annual, personal or sick leave credits. (d) If the superintendent or his designee finally determines that the member is fit\nfor full and strenuous duty, the order to report for duty shall be enforced. If\na member has drawn upon accumulated sick leave during the period from the date\nof the initial order, the member must either charge that time to accumulated\nannual or personal leave or, return any salary compensation received for the\nperiod. A member who refuses to comply with the order shall have his salary\nimmediately suspended, be considered absent from work without authorization, and subject to disciplinary action pursuant to rule 3. (e) If the superintendent or his designee\ndetermines that the member is not fit for full and strenuous duty, the order\nshall be withdrawn. A member entitled to leave under regulation 5.12 of the New\n\nYork State Police Rules and Regulations shall have any sick leave credits or\nsalary actually lost because of the order restored. (f) This rule does not prevent a member from\nreporting for duty while disputing the superintendent's order pursuant to the\nabove procedure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
