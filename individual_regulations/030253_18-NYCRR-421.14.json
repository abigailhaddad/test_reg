Nothing herein requires that the complete approval process otherwise\nrequired by this Part be concluded within the timeframes set forth in paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision.

(i) (1)\n\nWhere a social services district proposes to place a foster child with\nprospective adoptive parent(s) who reside in another social services district, the prospective adoptive parent(s) may apply to the social services district in\nwhich the prospective adoptive parent(s) reside for approval as adoptive\nparent(s) in accordance with this Part. The social services district in which\nthe prospective adoptive parent(s) reside is responsible for processing the\napplication and performing the home study in accordance with sections\n421.15\nand\n421.16\nof this Part.

(3)\nA\nsocial services district or a voluntary authorized agency may not refuse to\nprovide an application or delay or deny a home study to a person seeking\napproval as an adoptive parent on the basis that the child such person is\nseeking to adopt is in the custody of another authorized agency.
