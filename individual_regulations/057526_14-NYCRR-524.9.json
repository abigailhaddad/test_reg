If a patient has been injured, such actions shall include a medical examination\ncommensurate with the acuity of the injury. The name of the examiner, the\nwritten findings of the examiner, and a copy of any other medical record\nassociated with such examination shall be retained by the mental health\nprovider. (3)\n\nIn addition, mental\nhealth providers shall review their activities in response to reportable\nincidents to ensure that corrective actions will be taken as necessary to\naddress systems and personnel issues that may pose a continued risk to\nindividuals in care.
