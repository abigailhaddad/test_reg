  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.39 - Exhibit 39: wastewater interconnection\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe information provided in this exhibit shall be presented\nin a manner that distinguishes between sanitary wastewater, process wastewater, and intermingled sanitary and process wastewater. If a sanitary or process\nwastewater sewer interconnection is proposed for the facility, Exhibit 39 shall\ncontain: (a) A detailed description of\nthe proposed wastewater sewer interconnection, including all interconnecting\nfacilities, line route, size, functions, and operating\ncharacteristics. (b) A separate\nwater balance diagram for hourly and daily peak and hourly and daily average\nwater use operating conditions for the facility that shows in detail all water\nsources, plant water uses, water treatment facilities, wastewater treatment\nfacilities, wastewater discharges and which effluents shall be discharged, and\nwhere, including information on the characteristics (e.g. volume, temperature, constituent concentrations) of each water withdrawal and discharge under all\noperating conditions. (c) An\nidentification and evaluation of reasonable mitigation measures regarding\nwastewater generation and disposal impacts, including the use of on-site\nsubsurface disposal. (d) An\nidentification and description of all reasonable discharge or disposal methods\nfor wastewater generated from the facility, including a review of options for\ndischarging to municipal sewer systems, aquifer recharge areas, in-ground\ndischarges, or other process wastewater disposal, as well as, where applicable, an analysis of the impacts on water quality and quantity in affected\ngroundwater and surface water resources, and an analysis of the impacts of any\nout-of-aquifer transfers. (e) A\ndescription of available capacity and any limitations on wastewater disposal\ncapacity. (f) If a municipal or\nprivate sewage treatment system is proposed to be used, a description of the\nstatus of negotiations, or a copy of agreements that have been executed, with\nmunicipalities, companies or individuals for receiving wastewater from the\nfacility including any restrictions or conditions of approval placed on the\nfacility for wastewater disposal, if any, imposed by the provider, and a\npreliminary description of how the interconnection and any necessary system\nupgrades will be installed, owned, maintained and funded. (g) For each proposed discharge, an\nidentification and description of any facility wastewater treatment facilities\nand discharge structures, including a demonstration that each facility and/or\neffluent discharge will meet all applicable effluent limitations or\npretreatment standards, as well as all applicable New York State water quality\nstandards, during construction and operation. (h) A completed application for the State\npollutant discharge elimination system (SPDES) permit and a demonstration that\nthe discharge complies with all applicable technology-based and/or\nwater-quality based effluent limits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.39\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
