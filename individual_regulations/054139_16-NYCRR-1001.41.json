  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.41 - Exhibit 41: applications to modify or build adjacent\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the applicant is claiming that its application qualifies\nfor treatment pursuant to PSL section 165(4)(b), Exhibit 41 shall\ncontain: (a) A statement whether the\napplication is to: (1)\nmodify by an increase\nof more than 25 MW the nameplate capacity of an existing electric generating\nfacility already having a nameplate generating capacity of 25 MW or more; or\n(2)\nconstruct a new facility\nadjacent or contiguous to an existing facility. (b) A statement that the applicant is the\nowner of the affected existing major electric generating facility. (c) For applications to modify existing\nfacilities, a statement that after the modification the applicant will be the\nowner of the modified existing major electric generating facility. (d) For applications to construct new\nfacilities adjacent or contiguous to an existing facility, a statement that\nafter the new construction the applicant will be the owner of both the existing\nfacility and the new major electric generating facility. (e) For applications to construct new\nfacilities adjacent or contiguous to an existing facility, a map drawn to scale\ndemonstrating that the new facility is proposed to be located on the same\nparcel of real property as the existing facility, on a separate parcel of real\nproperty sharing a common border with the parcel of the existing facility, or\non separate parcels of real property separated by no more than 500 feet from\nthe parcel of the existing facility. (f) For emissions of the following\nsubstances, a table demonstrating a decrease in the rate of emissions with the\nname of the substance in the first column, the current hourly emission rate in\nthe second column, the future hourly emission rate in the third column, and the\npercentage decrease in the rate of emission in the fourth column: (1)\nsulfur dioxide\n(SO\n2\n); (2)\noxides of nitrogen (NO\nx\n); (3)\ncarbon dioxide\n(CO\n2\n); (4)\ncarbon monoxide (CO); (5)\nparticulate matter (PM\n2.5, PM\n10\nand total PM); (6)\nvolatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs); (7)\nelemental\nlead; and\n(8)\nmercury. For facilities that are partially replaced or modified, the\npercentage decrease shall be calculated by comparing the potential to emit of\neach such contaminant of the existing unit that is to be modified or replaced\nas of the date of application to the future potential to emit each such\ncontaminant of the modified or replacement unit as proposed in the application. For facilities that are sited physically adjacent or contiguous to an existing\nfacility, the percentage decrease shall be calculated by comparing the\npotential to emit of each such contaminant of the existing facility as of the\ndate of application to the future potential to emit each such contaminant of\nthe existing and new facility combined as proposed in the application. (g) For emissions of\nthe following substances, a table demonstrating a decrease in the total annual\nemissions on a pounds-per-year basis with the name of the substance in the\nfirst column, the current actual three-year average annual emissions in the\nsecond column, the future annual potential to emit in the third column, and the\npercentage decrease in the annual amount of emissions in the fourth column: (1)\nsulfur dioxide\n(SO\n2\n); (2)\noxides of nitrogen (NO\nx\n); (3)\ncarbon dioxide\n(CO\n2\n); (4)\ncarbon monoxide (CO); (5)\nparticulate matter (PM\n2.5, PM\n10\nand total PM); (6)\nvolatile organic\ncompounds (VOCs); (7)\nelemental\nlead; and\n(8)\nmercury. The percentage reduction shall be calculated by comparing\nthe past actual emissions of each of the relevant contaminants emitted by the\nexisting facility averaged over the three years preceding the date of\napplication, to the annualized potential to emit each such contaminant of the\nmodified facility or of the combined existing and new facility as proposed in\nthe application. (h) Information sufficient to demonstrate the\nintroduction of a new cooling water intake structure where such structure\nwithdraws water at a rate equal to or less than closed-cycle cooling would for\nthe modified or replacement unit, or the existing and new facility combined, whichever is applicable. (i) A\ntable demonstrating a decrease in the heat rate with the current actual heat\nrate of the existing facility in the first column, the future heat rate for the\nmodified or replacement unit, or the existing and new facility combined, whichever is applicable, in the second column, and the percentage decrease in\nthe heat rate in the third column. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.41\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
