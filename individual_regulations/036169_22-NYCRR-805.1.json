(2)\n\nThe petition shall include a detailed\nstatement of the facts with respect to the petitioner's conviction, suspension, dismissal or removal from public office or employment, or dishonorable\ndischarge, as the case may be, and of the petitioner's activities subsequent\nthereto which the petitioner believes bear on character and fitness to practice\nlaw. (3)\n\nThe petitioner shall also\nsubmit a completed and verified questionnaire on the standard form furnished by\nthe clerk of the court and affirmations of good moral character from two\nreputable persons who have known the petitioner for at least one year. In\naddition, the petitioner shall submit a letter from a person in authority at\nthe approved law school in which the petitioner is a matriculated student or to\nwhich the petitioner has applied for admission, stating that such law school\nwould retain or accept the petitioner as a student therein, as the case may be, if the petitioner's conviction, suspension, dismissal or removal from public\noffice or employment or dishonorable discharge, as the case may be, would not\noperate to disqualify the petitioner from being admitted to practice as an\nattorney and counselor-at-law in this State. (4)\n\nThe petition and other papers submitted\nby the petitioner shall be referred to the appropriate committee on character\nand fitness, which shall process and investigate the petition in accordance\nwith the procedures set forth in the preceding sections of this Part. The\ncommittee may recommend that a ruling be made either in favor of or against the\npetitioner, or that no ruling be made, and its recommendation shall be\ntransmitted to the court. (5)\nA\nruling made by the court in favor of the petitioner shall determine that the\npetitioner's prior conviction, suspension, removal or dismissal from public\noffice or employment, or dishonorable discharge, as the case may be, and the\nacts committed by the petitioner which resulted therein, would not operate to\ndisqualify the petitioner, on character grounds, from being admitted to\npractice as an attorney- and counselor-at-law in this State. Such a ruling\nshall have binding force throughout the State with respect to the determination\nthus made by it. In the event that the court should rule against the petitioner\nor should refuse to make a ruling, its determination shall be without prejudice\nto the petitioner's right, after passing the bar examination, to apply for a\nfavorable ruling with respect to character and fitness. (m) Manner of service. Service of any notice or other papers required under\nany of these rules may be made by mail or in the manner provided for service of\na summons. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
