These actions shall complement and be in concert with\nrules and regulations of the Public Service Commission regarding discontinuance\nof utility service. These actions shall be in effect as a mandate during the\nperiod November 1st through April 15th of each year. In addition, from\n\nSeptember 1st through October 31st of each year, utilities must review\nheat-related disconnections since the previous November 1st which are still\ndisconnected (i.e.,dormant accounts) and refer any suspected serious impairment\nsituations to the local social services district.

The local social services\nofficial shall designate a staff member to function as liaison to appropriate\nutility corporation(s) to insure timely and effective implementation of these\nprocedures. Appropriate utilities are those which are regulated by the Public\n\nService Commission. (c) Serious\nimpairment.
