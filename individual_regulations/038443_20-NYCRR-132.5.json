  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.5 - Income from intangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 632(b)(2)\n(a) Items of income, gain, loss and deduction\nattributable to intangible personal property of a nonresident individual, including annuities, dividends, interest, and gains and losses from the\ndisposition of intangible personal property, do not constitute items of income, gain, loss and deduction derived from or connected with New York State sources, except to the extent attributable to property employed in a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in New York State. (See also section 3 of\narticle XVI of the New York State Constitution.)\n\nExample: A, a resident of New Jersey, owns 100 percent of the\nstock of X Corporation, which operates a store in New York State. In 1980, the\ncorporation pays A a salary of $20,000, all of which was earned in New York\n\nState, and a dividend of $2,000. A's income from New York State sources is his\nsalary of $20,000, since the dividend is not income derived from New York State\nsources and thus not taxable for New York State personal income tax\npurposes. (b) Generally, where a nonresident individual sells real or tangible personal property located\nin New York State and, as a result of such sale receives intangible personal\nproperty (\ne.g., a note) which generates interest income, such\ninterest income is not attributable to the sale of the real or tangible\npersonal property but is attributable to the intangible personal property. Therefore, such interest income to a nonresident does not constitute income\nderived from or connected with New York State sources. However, where the\ninstrument used to generate interest income as a result of a sale of real or\ntangible personal property located in New York State is employed in a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on in New York State, such interest\nincome does constitute income derived from or connected with New York State\nsources. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n132.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
