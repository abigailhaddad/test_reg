  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.5 - Reasonable approximation based on customer information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a corporation's books and records\nkept in the ordinary course of business and reasonable inquiries to the\ncustomer when required do not provide adequate information to determine the\ncustomer's primary use location of a digital product or digital service, then\nreasonable approximation based on customer information must be used to\ndetermine primary use location. (b) Definition. Reasonable approximation based on customer information is an\nalternative method used to determine the location or locations at which a\ncustomer primarily uses a digital product or digital service in instances in\nwhich: (1)\n(i) the location or locations where the\ndigital product or digital service is primarily used and/or the percentage of\nuse attributable to each location as a share of the total use cannot be\ndetermined, or\n(ii)\nobtaining the\nprimary use location or locations and/or the percentage of use attributable to\neach location as a share of the total use would require the corporation to\nexpend undue effort and expense beyond the due diligence required by this\n\nSubpart; and\n(2)\nthe\ncorporation has sufficient information to reasonably approximate the primary\nuse location or locations and/or the percentage of use attributable to each\nlocation as a share of the total use. (c) Application of reasonable approximation\nbased on customer information. (1)\nA\ncorporation must use all available information in its books and records, including information obtained upon reasonable inquiries where required, and\ninformation publicly available about the location or locations where its actual\ncustomers primarily use the digital product or service. (2)\n\nWhen a corporation is required under this\nsection to reasonably approximate, the corporation must use a method that is\nintended to approximate where the customer primarily uses the digital product\nor digital service. (3)\n\nSourced\nreceipts method. In any instance where a corporation can ascertain the location\nor locations where a substantial portion of similar receipts are sourced\n('sourced receipts method\"), but not all of such receipts, and the corporation\nreasonably believes, based on all available information, that the geographic\ndistribution of the remainder of such receipts is substantially similar to that\nof the sourced receipts, it may source such receipts in the same proportion as\nits sourced receipts (sourced receipts method). If the corporation reasonably\nbelieves, based on all available information, that the geographic distribution\nof the remainder of such receipts is different from that of the sourced\nreceipts, and the corporation otherwise lacks sufficient information to use\nreasonable approximation either under this section or under section\n4-3.6\nof this Subpart, it must\nnext attempt to source such receipts to where the digital product or service is\nreceived using the where received method (see section\n4-3.7\nof this Subpart). (4)\n\nIn any case in which a corporation uses a\nmethod of approximation to apportion its receipts and the commissioner\ndetermines that the method of approximation employed by the corporation is not\nreasonable, the commissioner may substitute a method of approximation that the\ncommissioner determines is appropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears\nthe burden of demonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (5)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that a corporation's method of approximation\nis reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent manner with\nrespect to similar transactions, the commissioner may require that the\ncorporation apply its method of approximation in a consistent manner. (6)\n\nIn any case in which, after reasonable\ninquiries are made when required, the corporation does not have sufficient\ninformation based on its actual customers to use reasonable approximation, the\ncorporation must next attempt to source such receipts using the rules for\nreasonable approximation based on general information.
