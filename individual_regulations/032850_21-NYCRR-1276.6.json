  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1276.6 - Cargo tank construction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Capacity. Cargo tanks shall not exceed 6,000 gallons capacity. Fuel\ntruck filling racks must be designed for static electricity control. (b) Compartmentation. Every cargo tank shall be divided into compartments and\nprovided with baffles as follows: (1)\n\nEvery tank larger than 1,200 gallons shall be divided into compartments, none\nof which shall have a capacity exceeding 1,200 gallons. (2)\n\nEvery tank and every compartment of a\ntank over 90 inches in length shall be provided with baffles, the number of\nwhich shall be such that the linear distance between any two adjacent baffles, or between any tank head or bulkhead and the baffle nearest it, shall in no\ncase exceed 60 inches. (3)\n\nEach\nbulkhead required herein shall have adequate strength without undue stress or\nany permanent set to withstand a horizontal force equal to the weight of so\nmuch of the contents of the tank as may come between it and any adjacent\nbulkhead or tank head, applied as a uniformly distributed load on the surface\nof the bulkhead or tank head. (4)\n\nEach baffle required herein shall have an area at least equal to 80 percent of\nthe cross-sectional area of the tank. (5)\n\nEach compartment of the completed tank\nshall be hydrostatically tested and proven tight at three pounds minimum\npressure at top of tank, at initial inspection and at such times thereafter as\nmay be designated by the Port Authority. (c) Tolerance. A tolerance of 10 percent shall be allowed for tank or\ncompartment capacity. (d) (1)\n\nDome covers and tank outlets. Each compartment shall be fitted with an approved dome\ncover, securely fastened to the tank, constructed of steel, bronze or malleable\ncast iron. The dome cover shall be hinged toward the front of the vehicle, be\ndesigned to open not more than 91 degrees, drop shut upon forward movement of\nthe truck and be fitted with a self-locking spring latch for secure closing, and a gasket to prevent leakage during overturn in transportation. Tank outlets\nshall be substantially made and attached to the tank in a manner to prevent\nbreakage at outlet point. Sump drains shall be installed in a manner to permit\ncomplete drainage, fitted with an internal valve at the tank or sump and shall\nnot contain any sight glasses or readily breakable parts. (2)\n\nBottom loading flow controls. Cargo tanks arranged for bottom loading shall be fitted\nwith approved hose connecting devices so as to open and permit product flow\ninto the tanks when the companion nozzle is connected and locked in position. The device shall close automatically preventing product discharge when the\ncompanion nozzle is disconnected. Each compartment shall be fitted with an\nautomatically operated vent and product level control device interlocked with\nthe internal valve and designed to shut off the flow of product into the\ncompartment and close the vent when the \"full\" level is reached. A single level\ncontrol is acceptable if such manifold and valves are designed, tested and\nproven to permit uniform filing of all compartments. A manually operated level\ncontrol testing by-pass valve and visual position indicating devices shall be\nprovided for pre-checking the control and the operation of internal\nvalves. (e) Grounding, bonding and securing. Cargo tanks shall be adequately supported and securely\nbolted or clamped to the frame of the vehicles. Such tank or tanks that are an\nintegral part of such vehicles, tanks, chassis, axles and springs shall be\nelectrically bonded to insure a complete grounding of all parts. Shell and head\njoint shall be welded. (f) Vents. Each cargo tank or each compartment shall be provided\nwith normal breather vent a loading and unloading release vent, and emergency\nventing system as indicated herein. (1)\n\nNormal breather vent. The normal breather vent shall provide pressure and\nvacuum release through an area of 0.44 square inches. Pressure vents shall be\nset to open at no more than one psig or a vacuum not more than six ounces. Normal vents shall be designed to prevent loss of liquid in case of overturn, and flame propagation through the opening. (2)\n\nLoading and unloading and emergency\nvents. The loading and unloading venting protection shall be\ndesigned to limit the created vacuum to not exceed one psig or created pressure\nto not exceed three psig based on the maximum product transfer rate and be so\ncertified by the tank vehicle manufacturer. (i) The emergency venting system shall\nprovide vent capacity in cubic feet of free air per hour (14.7 psia at 60\ndegrees Fahrenheit) as indicated in the table below: 20 square feet of exposed area requires\n15,800 cu. ft./hr........ 100 square feet of exposed area requires\n79,100 cu. ft./hr........ 500 square feet of exposed area requires\n300,600 cu. ft./hr........ 800 square feet of exposed area requires\n392,200 cu. ft./hr........ 1000 square feet of exposed area requires\n445,000 cu. ft./hr........ (ii)\n\nPressure actuated devices shall be\ndesigned to prevent leakage of liquids in case of surge, or vehicle\nupset. (iii)\n\nWhen pressure\nactuated, the emergency venting system shall open at not less than three psig\nand close when the pressure drops to three psig or less. (iv)\n\nThe minimum vent capacity shall be 6000\ncubic feet of air per hour at three psig. (v) When fusibly actuated, the emergency\nventing system shall operate at not more than 250 degrees Fahrenheit and shall\nprevent any pressure build-up in excess of three psig at this temperature. Breather vents, loading and unloading vents and emergency\nventing systems shall be fitted with proper backflash screens to control flame\npropagation. Backflash screens shall be securely attached, periodically checked\nand protected from mechanical damage, or snow and ice formation. (g) Overturn protection. All openings for filling, venting or other purposes shall\nbe protected from damage in the event of overturning of the vehicle by being\nenclosed within the body of the tank or within a dome attached thereto, or by\nthe use of metal guards securely attached to the tank or the frame of the\nvehicle. A minimum protecting clearance of one inch shall be provided by\noverturn protecting devices. (h) Specifications. Cargo tanks shall be constructed of either hot rolled\ntank steel or low alloy low carbon (high tensile) steels, and the minimum\nthickness of tank sheets shall be limited by the volume capacity of the tank\nexpressed in terms of gallons per inch of length, and by the distance between\nbulkheads, baffles or other steel stiffeners, as well as by the radius of shell\ncurvature in case of shell sheets, as shown on the following tables.
