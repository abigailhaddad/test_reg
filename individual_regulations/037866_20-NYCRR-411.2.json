  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 411.2 - Distributors' bond requirement\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 283(3)\n(a) Before any person may be registered as a\ndistributor of motor fuel with the Department of Taxation and Finance, and at\nall times after such person is registered as a distributor, such person is\nrequired to file or deposit and maintain with the department: (1)\na bond executed by a surety company which\nis: (i) authorized to transact business in\nthis State; (ii)\nregistered with\nand under the supervision of the Insurance Department of New York State; and\n(iii)\napproved by the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance as to solvency and responsibility; or\n(2)\nsuch other acceptable security\nenumerated in section\n411.3\nof this Part. Such bond or security must be in such amount as the\ndepartment may require to secure the payment of any liability of such\ndistributor under article 12-A of the Tax Law and under articles 28 and 29 of\nthe Tax Law with respect to sales and uses of motor fuel. The amount of such\nbond or security required to be filed or deposited may be increased by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance at any time it deems such necessary in\nprotection of the revenues pursuant to such articles. (b) Determination of the\namount of a bond. (1)\n\nPrior to the\napproval of an application for registration as a distributor of motor fuel and\nduring any subsequent review of a registered distributor, the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance, in determining the amount or sufficiency of a bond, will: (i) determine the estimated or representative\nsix-month maximum potential tax liability of the applicant or of the\ndistributor (see paragraph [2] of this subdivision); (ii)\nanalyze the certified financial\nstatements of the applicant or distributor with particular emphasis on the\nratio of current assets to current liabilities and net worth (total assets less\ntotal liabilities) as determined in accordance with generally accepted\naccounting principles; (iii)\nevaluate any independent information concerning an applicant's or distributor's\nnature of operations, reliability, overall financial status, liquidity, or\nhistory of financial solvency and stability; and\n(iv)\nreview the taxpayer's compliance record\nto determine whether there are or were any delinquencies in filing returns\nand/or payment of any taxes as a distributor of motor fuel or for any other\ntaxes due New York State for which the applicant or distributor may be or may\nhave been responsible. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this section, maximum\npotential tax liability is determined based on an anticipated total number of\ngallons of motor fuel expected to be imported into the State or produced, refined, manufactured, compounded, sold, transferred, used or otherwise\ndistributed within New York State by the applicant or based on a representative\ntotal number of gallons of motor fuel imported into the State or produced, refined, manufactured, compounded, sold, transferred, used or otherwise\ndistributed within New York State by the distributor, without any reductions\nfor those gallons subject to tax-free or exempt sales. Generally, in\ndetermining the amount of such representative or anticipated total gallonage, the department shall, based on a prior consistent business practice of the\napplicant or distributor, consider those gallons of motor fuel purchased and/or\nreasonably expected to be purchased within the State on which the taxes on\nmotor fuel pursuant to articles 12-A, 28 and 29 of the Tax Law have been or\nwill be assumed or paid by another distributor of motor fuel snd included in\nsuch purchase price, as evidenced by certifications of tax payment. (See\nsections\n412.3\nand\n412.4\nof this Title for certifications.) The number of gallons of motor fuel\ndetermined is multiplied by the rate of the motor fuel tax per gallon and by\nthe applicable rate (see section\n561.3\n[b]\nof this Title) of the prepaid sales tax per gallon. The sum of these taxes\nshall then be adjusted where necessary to reflect a six-month tax\nliability. (3)\n\nIn all cases, an\napplicant or a distributor will be required to file and maintain with the\ndepartment a bond adequate to at least meet the requirements of subparagraphs\n(i) through (vii) of this paragraph. Provided further, unless the applicant, distributor or the department can establish otherwise, to negate valuation\nconsiderations (\ne.g., cost-to-market, intangibles, collectibility of receivables, intercompany accounts, etc.) only 80 percent of\nnet worth shall be recognized for purposes of determining the amount of a bond. (i) Generally, if an applicant's or a\ndistributor's ratio of current assets to current liabilities (current ratio) is\nat least one-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth is equal to or greater than\nthe six-month maximum potential tax liability, a bond will be required in the\namount of $50,000. (ii)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a distributor's current ratio is at least one-to-one and\n80 percent of the net worth is less than the six-month maximum potential tax\nliability, a bond will be required for the difference between 80 percent of the\nnet worth and the six-month maximum potential tax liability. (iii)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a\ndistributor's current ratio is less than one-to-one and 80 percent of the net\nworth is equal to or greater than the six-month maximum potential tax\nliability, a bond will be required for one third of the six-month maximum\npotential tax liability. (iv)\n\nGenerally, if an applicant's or a distributor's current ratio is less than\none-to-one and 80 percent of the net worth is less than the six-month maximum\npotential tax liability, a bond will be required for the greater of: (a) the difference between 80 percent of the\nnet worth and the six-month maximum potential tax liability; or\n(b) one third of such six-month maximum\npotential tax liability. (v) (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, generally the amount of a\nbond required to be filed and maintained pursuant to the provisions of this\nsection shall not be less than $50,000. However, in extraordinary circumstances\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance may fix the amount of a bond for less\nthan $50,000. Example: A physically isolated community is serviced by a small\nretail gas station. The station's only feasible source of motor fuel is to\nimport such fuel from outside the State. As the $50,000 minimum bonding far\nexceeds the station's six-month maximum potential tax liability, the department\nmay authorize a bond in a lesser amount. (b) Provided further, generally the amount of\na bond shall not exceed the six-month maximum potential tax liability of the\napplicant or of the distributor except to the extent such six-month maximum\npotential tax liability is less than $50,000. (vi)\n\nAdditionally, where the six-month\nmaximum potential tax liability cannot be determined, for example where the\napplicant or distributor is unable to furnish an average monthly gallonage of\nmotor fuel sold, transferred, used or otherwise distributed within the State, a\nbond of not less than $100,000 will be required if the applicant's or the\ndistributor's current ratio is at least one-to-one and 80 percent of the net\nworth does not equal or exceed $100,000. Should the current ratio be less than\none-to-one and/or 80 percent of the net worth equal to or in excess of\n$100,000, the amount of the bond required to be filed and maintained with the\ndepartment may be fixed by the department on any reasonable basis. (vii)\n\nIn addition to subparagraphs (i)\nthrough (vi) of this paragraph, the amount of a bond may be adjusted where any\ninformation indicates the need for a bond in greater or lesser\namount.
