  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16§ 603.5 - Service interruptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nservice provider shall establish and implement procedures regarding the\nconstruction, operation, and maintenance of its network, which are intended to\nminimize service failures, including but not limited to cable cuts, sudden\nincreases in traffic, employee absences, fires, severe storms, and floods and\nwhich are intended to maintain, to the extent practical and reasonable, continuous operation of its service in the event of commercial power\nloss. (b) In executing subdivision\n(a) of this section, each service provider is expected to: (1)\n\nMaintain emergency contingency plans\ndesigned to assist personnel to prepare for emergencies, perform repairs and\nservice restorals in the aftermath of such events, and assess company\nperformance and identify opportunities for improvement after conditions have\nbeen normalized. An original copy of each service provider's emergency\ncontingency plan and any subsequent updates shall be filed with the commission\non or before January 31st of each year or on such other date as the commission\nmay prescribe. The names and telephone numbers of individuals and any\ninformation which, in the opinion of the service provider, could compromise its\nability to protect the network against vandalism, terrorist acts, or other\npotential threats to the network, may be redacted from the copies of the\nemergency contingency plans and updates filed with the commission pursuant to\nthis section and section 603.6. (2)\n\nReport major service interruptions to commission staff per guidelines issued by\nthe Director of the Office of Telecommunications pursuant to section\n603.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nBe guided by accepted\nindustry guidelines and best practices, such as the findings and\nrecommendations of the Federal Communications Commission's Communications\n\nSecurity, Reliability, and Interoperability Council best practices intended to\nimprove network reliability and the availability and performance of\ncommunications services and emergency alerting during natural or manmade\ndisasters, cyber-security incidents, terrorist attacks, or other events that\nimpact communications infrastructure, and provide for the rapid restoration of\ncommunications services in the event of widespread or major\ndisruptions. (c) In the\nevent that service must be interrupted for purposes of working on the lines or\nequipment, the service provider's work scheduling procedures shall provide that\nan attempt be made to do the work at a time which will cause minimal\ninconvenience to consumers and, where reasonable and practical, to notify\nconsumers in advance of the interruption. The service provider's procedures\nshall make provision for the availability of required emergency services for\nthe duration of the interruption. (d) On lines that have been voluntarily\nsuspended or temporarily suspended for non-payment, access should continue to\nbe provided to emergency services such as 911 or to an operator for emergency\ncalling during the suspension period. (e) Credit for service interruptions. When a service outage affecting 100 or more subscribers\nexists due to a particular service interruption cause, the service provider\nshall issue a credit allowance as follows: (1)\n\nIf a service interruption continues for\n24 hours or more, 1/30th of the monthly rate for all services and facilities\nfurnished and billed by the service provider that are rendered useless or\nsubstantially impaired for each 24 hours (or fraction thereof). (2)\n\nIf a service interruption is for less\nthan 24 hours, and if credit is requested by the subscriber on the grounds that\nservice for the day was substantially impaired by such interruption or\ninterruptions, then, a credit allowance will be issued for that day at 1/30th\nof the monthly rate. (3)\n\nIf the\nservice provider reasonably determines that the interruption was in part caused\nby the loss of commercial power to the service provider's network, the credit\nallowance period will begin 24 hours after commercial power is\nrestored. (4)\n\nThis section shall\nnot apply to commercial customers who receive service pursuant to a negotiated\nagreement that includes a customer credit provision for service\ninterruptions. Notes\nN.Y.
