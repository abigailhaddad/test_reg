  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.16 - Thermal treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nregulations in this section apply to owners and operators of facilities that\nthermally treat hazardous waste in devices other than enclosed devices using\ncontrolled flame combustion, except as provided in section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. Thermal treatment in enclosed devices using controlled flame\ncombustion is subject to the requirements of section\n373-3.15\nof this Subpart if the\nunit is an incinerator, and section\n374-1.8\nof this Title if the unit\nis a boiler or an industrial furnace as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (b) General operating\nrequirements. Before adding hazardous waste, the owner or operator must\nbring the thermal treatment process to steady state (normal) conditions of\noperation-including steady state operating temperature-using auxiliary fuel or\nother means, unless the process is a noncontinuous (batch) thermal treatment\nprocess which requires a complete thermal cycle to treat a discrete quantity of\nhazardous waste. (c) Waste analysis. In addition to the waste analyses required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must sufficiently analyze any waste which has\nnot been previously treated in the thermal process to enable the owner or\noperator to establish steady state (normal) or other appropriate (for a\nnoncontinuous process) operating conditions (including waste and auxiliary fuel\nfeed), and to determine the type of air contaminants which might be emitted. At\na minimum, the analysis must determine: (1)\nheating value of the waste; (2)\nhalogen content and sulfur content in the\nwaste; and\n(3)\nconcentrations in\nthe waste of lead and mercury, unless the owner or operator has written, documented data that show that the element is not present. (d) Monitoring and inspections. (1)\n\nThe owner and operator must conduct, as a\nminimum, the following monitoring and inspections when thermally treating\nhazardous waste: (i) Existing instruments\nwhich relate to temperature and emission control (if an emission control device\nis present) must be monitored at least every 15 minutes. Appropriate\ncorrections to maintain steady state or other appropriate thermal treatment\nconditions must be made immediately either automatically or by the operator. Instruments which relate to temperature and emission control would normally\ninclude those measuring waste feed, auxiliary fuel feed, treatment process\ntemperature, and relevant process flow and level controls. (ii)\n\nThe stack plume (emissions), where\npresent, must be observed visually at least hourly for normal appearance (color\nand opacity). The operator must immediately make any indicated operating\ncorrections necessary to return any visible emissions to their normal\nappearance. (iii)\n\nThe complete\nthermal treatment process and associated equipment (pumps, valves, conveyors, pipes, etc.) must be inspected at least daily for leaks, spills and fugitive\nemissions, and system alarms must be checked to assure proper\noperation. (e) Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all\nhazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including but not limited to ash)\nfrom the thermal treatment process or equipment. (f) Open burning; waste\nexplosives. Open burning of hazardous waste is prohibited except for\nthe open burning and detonation of waste explosives. Waste explosives include\nwaste which has the potential to detonate, and bulk military propellants which\ncannot safely be disposed of through other modes of treatment. Detonation\nis an explosion in which chemical transformation\npasses through the material faster than the speed of sound (0.33\nkilometer/second at sea level). Owners or operators choosing to open-burn or\ndetonate waste explosives must do so in accordance with the following table and\nin a manner that does not threaten human health or the environment. Pounds of waste\nexplosives\n\nMinimum distance from\nopen\nor\npropellants\nburning or detonation to\nthe\nproperty of\nothers\n0 to 100 ______________________\n204\nmeters\n(670 feet)\n100 to 1,000 ______________________\n380\nmeters\n(1,250 feet)\n1,001 to 10,000 ______________________\n530 meters\n(1,730 feet)\n10,001 to 30,000 ______________________\n690 meters\n(2,260 feet)\n(g) Standards for particular hazardous\nwaste. (1)\n\nOwners or operators of\nthermal treatment devices subject to this section may burn EPA hazardous waste\nF020, F021, F022, F023, F026 or F027 if they receive a certification from the\ncommissioner that they can meet the performance standards of section\n373-2.15\nof this Part when they\nburn these wastes. (2)\n\nIn addition\nto the requirements of Part 621 of this Title, the following standards and\nprocedures will be used in determining whether to certify a thermal treatment\nunit: (i) The owner or operator must submit\nan application to the commissioner containing the applicable information in\nsections\n373-1.5\n(f) and\n373-1.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart demonstrating that the thermal treatment unit can meet the performance\nstandards in section\n373-2.15\nof this Part when they\nburn the wastes. (ii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will issue a tentative decision whether the thermal treatment unit\ncan meet the performance standards in section\n373-2.15\nof this Part. Notification\nof the tentative decision will be provided by newspaper advertisement and radio\nbroadcast in the jurisdiction where the thermal treatment device is located. The commissioner will accept comment on the tentative decision for 60 days. The\ncommissioner also may hold a public hearing upon request or at his or her\ndiscretion. (iii)\n\nAfter the close\nof the public comment period, the commissioner will issue a decision whether or\nnot to certify the thermal treatment unit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
