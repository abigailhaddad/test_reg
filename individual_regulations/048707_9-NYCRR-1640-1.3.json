  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-1.3 - Accounting method\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe double-entry system of bookkeeping is prescribed, the accounts being kept on an accrual basis. This Subchapter is written for a\nmanually operated system and the specimen forms are designed for such a system. However, the performance of certain operations by bookkeeping and accounting\nmachines may be found advisable on account of the volume of work or for other\nreasons. In such cases, it will be necessary to modify the prescribed\ninstructions and forms. The books of account, as prescribed, are those\ncustomarily maintained in accounting practice. In order to properly maintain\nthe records, the person designated by the local agency to keep its books should\nbe thoroughly familiar with general accounting practice and should be capable\nof performing the accounting prescribed. For the most part, the instructions\nand procedures incorporate the methods and practices followed by most local\nagencies at the present time. Changes from the existing accounting manual for\npublic housing agencies, issued in 1949, have been made in the interests of\nclarification and simplification, to reflect changing conditions, amendments to\nthe Public Housing Law, and to reduce the accounting burden on those local\nagencies operating under Federal, State and municipal aided\nprograms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
