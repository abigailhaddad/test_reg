  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 319.3 - Admissions and Placement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except\nas set forth in clause (5) of subparagraph (b) of this subpart, the department, in consultation with mental health clinicians, shall divert or remove\nincarcerated individuals with serious mental illness, as defined in Correction\n\nLaw section 137, from segregated confinement or confinement in a residential\nrehabilitation unit or step-down unit, where such confinement could potentially\nbe for a period in excess of 30-days, to a residential mental health treatment\nunit. Nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to prevent the disciplinary\nprocess from proceeding in accordance with department rules and regulations for\ndisciplinary hearings. (b) (1)\n\nUpon placement of an incarcerated\nindividual into segregated confinement, or a residential rehabilitation unit, or step-down unit at a level one or level two facility, a suicide prevention\nscreening instrument shall be administered by staff from the department or the\noffice of mental health who has been trained for that purpose. If such a\nscreening instrument reveals that the incarcerated individual is at risk of\nsuicide, a mental health clinician shall be consulted, and appropriate safety\nprecautions shall be taken. Additionally, within one business day of the\nplacement of such an incarcerated individual into segregated confinement at a\nlevel one or level two facility, the incarcerated individual shall be assessed\nby a mental health clinician. (2)\n\nUpon placement of an incarcerated individual into segregated confinement, or a\nresidential rehabilitation unit, or step-down unit at a level three or level\nfour facility, a suicide prevention screening instrument shall be administered\nby staff from the department or the office of mental health who has been\ntrained for that purpose. If such a screening instrument reveals that the\nincarcerated individual is at risk of suicide, a mental health clinician shall\nbe consulted, and appropriate safety precautions shall be taken. All\nincarcerated individuals placed in segregated confinement or a residential\nrehabilitation unit, or step-down unit at a level three or level four facility\nshall be assessed by a mental health clinician, within seven days of such\nplacement into segregated confinement. (3)\n\nAt the initial assessment, if the mental\nhealth clinician finds that an incarcerated individual suffers from a serious\nmental illness, that person shall be diverted or removed from segregated\nconfinement, or a residential rehabilitation unit, or step-down unit and a\nrecommendation shall be made whether exceptional circumstances, as described in\nclause (5) of this subparagraph, exist. In a facility with a joint case\nmanagement committee, such recommendation shall be made by such committee. In a\nfacility without a joint case management committee, the recommendation shall be\nmade jointly by a committee consisting of the facility's highest-ranking mental\nhealth clinician, the deputy superintendent for security, and the deputy\nsuperintendent for program services, or their equivalents. Any such\nrecommendation shall be reviewed by the joint central office review committee. The administrative process described in this clause shall be completed within\nseven days of the initial assessment, and if the result of such process is that\nthe incarcerated individual should be removed from segregated confinement, or a\nresidential rehabilitation unit, or step-down unit, such removal shall occur as\nsoon as practicable, but in no event more than seventy-two hours from the\ncompletion of the administrative process. Except in exceptional circumstances, nothing in this section shall permit the placement of an incarcerated\nindividual with serious mental illness into segregated confinement at any time, even for the purposes of assessment. For purposes of this clause, exceptional\ncircumstances shall mean the occurrence of an act of serious misconduct by the\nincarcerated individual with serious mental illness, and, in the judgment of\nthe superintendent, or, if unavailable, the highest ranking security individual\nat the facility when the serious misconduct occurred, that there exists an\nimmediate threat to the health and well-being of the incarcerated individual, one or more other incarcerated individuals or staff, such that the incarcerated\nindividual cannot be safely housed in any other immediately available housing\nunit at the facility. Upon a finding of exceptional circumstances, the\nincarcerated individual may be housed in segregated confinement for a period\nnot to exceed 48 hours. As soon as possible during such temporary placement of\nthe incarcerated individual in segregated confinement, however, an assessment\nshall be made by a staff member from the office of mental health, as well as by\na facility health services practitioner, to ascertain the current condition of\nthe incarcerated individual in segregated confinement. If either individual\ndetermines that such temporary placement in segregated confinement poses a\nsignificant risk of harm to the incarcerated individual, then the\nsuperintendent, or highest-ranking security official, at the facility, shall\narrange for the immediate removal of such individual and transfer to a\ndifferent facility where the individual can be safely housed in a setting that\nis not segregated confinement. (4)\n\nIf an incarcerated individual with a serious mental illness is not diverted or\nremoved to a residential mental health treatment unit, such incarcerated\nindividual shall be diverted to a residential rehabilitation unit or step-down\nunit and reassessed by a mental health clinician within 14-days of the initial\nassessment and at least once every 14-days thereafter. After each such\nadditional assessment, a recommendation as to whether such incarcerated\nindividual should be removed from a residential rehabilitation unit or\nstep-down unit shall be made and reviewed according to the process set forth in\nclause (3) of this subpart. (5)\nA\nrecommendation or determination whether to remove an incarcerated individual\nfrom a residential rehabilitation unit or step-down unit shall take into\naccount the assessing mental health clinicians' opinions as to the incarcerated\nindividual's mental condition and treatment needs, and shall also take into\naccount any safety and security concerns that would be posed by the\nincarcerated individual's removal, even if additional restrictions were placed\non the incarcerated individual's access to treatment, property, services or\nprivileges in a residential mental health treatment unit. A recommendation or\ndetermination shall direct the incarcerated individual's removal from a\nresidential rehabilitation unit or step-down unit except in the following\nexceptional circumstances: (1)\nwhen the\nreviewer finds that removal would pose a substantial risk to the safety of the\nincarcerated individual or other persons, or a substantial threat to the\nsecurity of the facility, even if additional restrictions were placed on the\nincarcerated individual's access to treatment, property, services or privileges\nin a residential mental health treatment unit; or\n(2)\nwhen the assessing mental health\nclinician determines that such placement is in the incarcerated individual's\nbest interests based on his or her mental condition and that removing such\nincarcerated individual to a residential mental health treatment unit would be\ndetrimental to his or her mental condition. Any determination not to remove an\nincarcerated individual with serious mental illness from a residential\nrehabilitation unit or step-down unit shall be documented in writing and\ninclude the reasons for the determination. (c) Incarcerated individuals with serious\nmental illness who are not diverted or removed from a residential\nrehabilitation unit or step-down unit shall be offered a heightened level of\nmental health care, involving a minimum of three hours daily of out-of-cell\ntherapeutic treatment and programming. This heightened level of care shall not\nbe offered only in the following circumstances: (1)\n\nThe heightened level of care shall not\napply when an incarcerated individual with serious mental illness does not, in\nthe reasonable judgment of a mental health clinician, require the heightened\nlevel of care. Such determination shall be documented with a written statement\nof the basis of such determination and shall be reviewed by the Central New\n\nYork Psychiatric Center clinical director or his or her designee. Such a\ndetermination is subject to change should the incarcerated individual's\nclinical status change. Such determination shall be reviewed and documented by\na mental health clinician every 30-days, and in consultation with the Central\n\nNew York Psychiatric Center clinical director or his or her designee not less\nthan every 90-days. (2)\n\nThe\nheightened level of care shall not apply in exceptional circumstances when\nproviding such care would create an unacceptable risk to the safety and\nsecurity of incarcerated individuals or staff. Such determination shall be\ndocumented by security personnel together with the basis of such determination\nand shall be reviewed by the facility superintendent, in consultation with a\nmental health clinician, not less than every seven days for as long as the\nincarcerated individual remains in a residential rehabilitation unit or\nstep-down unit. The facility shall attempt to resolve such exceptional\ncircumstances so that the heightened level of care may be provided. If such\nexceptional circumstances remain unresolved for 30-days, the matter shall be\nreferred to the joint central office review committee for review. (d) All incarcerated individuals\nin segregated confinement in a level one or level two facility who are not\nassessed with a serious mental illness at the initial assessment shall be\noffered at least one interview with a mental health clinician within seven days\nof their initial mental health assessment, unless the mental health clinician\nat the most recent interview recommends an earlier interview or assessment. All\nincarcerated individuals in a residential rehabilitation unit or step-down unit\nin a level three or level four facility who are not assessed with a serious\nmental illness at the initial assessment shall be offered at least one\ninterview with a mental health clinician within 30-days of their initial mental\nhealth assessment, and additional interviews at least every 90-days thereafter, unless the mental health clinician at the most recent interview recommends an\nearlier interview or assessment.
