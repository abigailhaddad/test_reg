The sensing element shall be located to measure the air temperature in the unit\nat a location that is representative of the temperature in the unit. The\nthermometer scale shall be located to be easily readable. Recording\nthermometers accurate to plus or minus 3°F (congruent to plus or minus 1°C) may\nbe used in lieu of indicating thermometers where it is impractical to install\nthermometers on equipment such as heat lamps, calrod units or insulated food\ntransport carriers, a food product thermometer shall be available and used to\ncheck internal food temperature.
