  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 84.1 - Explanatory note\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 1 of the Laws of 1983 vested in the Banking Board\nbroad authority to prescribe regulations governing loans secured by real estate\nmade by banks, trust companies, savings banks and savings and loan\nassociations. At the same time, chapter 1 deleted from the Banking Law certain\nrigid technical requirements, principally in the area of maximum\nloan-to-appraised value limitations, which had applied to such loans. This Part\nestablishes certain prudential requirements and applies to all loans secured by\nreal estate or cooperative apartment units, and to which the provisions of\nsections 103(4), 235(5-a), 235(6), 380(1) and 380(3) apply. The provisions of\nthis Part do not apply to any loan with respect to which the Banking Board has\nadopted regulations pursuant to either section\n6-f\nof the Banking\n\nLaw (alternative mortgage instruments) or sections 103(4-a), 235(6-a) and\n380(4-a) of such law (junior mortgage authority). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n84.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
