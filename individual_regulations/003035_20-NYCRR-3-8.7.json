  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.7 - Computation of the PNOLC subtraction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) PNOLC subtraction available for use. (1)\n\nIn the case of a corporation that is not\na member of a combined group, its PNOLC subtraction available for use in its\nfirst 2015 taxable year is equal to its tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment\n(as described in subdivision (b) of this section) for such taxable year. The\namount of PNOLC subtraction available for use in any taxable year following the\ncorporation's first 2015 taxable year is equal to its tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment for the taxable year plus any unused PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforward. (2)\n\nIn the case of a\ncombined group, the PNOLC subtraction available for use in its first 2015\ntaxable year is the sum of the tax period PNOLC subtraction allotments for such\ntaxable year of all members of the combined group. The amount of PNOLC\nsubtraction available for use by a combined group in any taxable year following\nits first 2015 taxable year is the sum of the tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotments for each such taxable year of all members of the combined group plus\nthe sum of any unused PNOLC subtraction carryforwards of all members of the\ncombined group. (b) Tax\nperiod PNOLC subtraction allotment. (1)\nA\ncorporation's tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment is the percentage of its\nPNOLC subtraction pool that may be claimed in a taxable year as provided in\nparagraph (2). If a corporation cannot utilize the entire tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment in a taxable year, the unused portion for that taxable\nyear is considered an unused PNOLC subtraction carryforward. (2)\n\nTax period PNOLC subtraction allotment\nmethods. (i) 100% allotment method for small\nbusiness taxpayers. A small business taxpayer's tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotment for its first 2015 taxable year is equal to 100% of its PNOLC\nsubtraction pool. A small business taxpayer has no tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotment after the first 2015 taxable year, but any unused portion of its 2015\nPNOLC subtraction allotment is considered an unused PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforward, eligible to be utilized without any allotment\nlimitations. (ii)\n10% allotment\nmethod. For any corporation that is not a small business taxpayer or electing\nthe 50% method in section 210(1)(a)(viii)(B)(2)(IV), the tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment is equal to 10% of its PNOLC subtraction pool in each of\nits first ten taxable years after the base year. There is no tax period PNOLC\nsubtraction allotment after the tenth taxable year. Unused portions of each\nallotment are considered PNOLC subtraction carryforwards. Taxpayers with unused\nPNOLC subtraction carryforwards are eligible to use them in future periods\nwithout regard to the 10% allotment limitation. (3)\n\nCombined groups. In the case of a\ncombined group, each member of the group: (i) shall compute its own tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment using the\nallotment method determined by its designated agent in the group's first 2015\ntaxable year if it was included in the combined report in the group's first\n2015 taxable year; or\n(ii)\ncompute\nits own tax period PNOLC subtraction allotment determined by the method used in\nthe member's first 2015 taxable year if the member was not included in a\ncombined report in that year. The combined group's tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotment in a taxable year is the sum of the tax period PNOLC subtraction\nallotments for all members of the combined group for the taxable\nyear. (c) PNOLC subtraction. (1)\n\nFor all corporations\nnot electing the 50% allotment method, the amount of PNOLC subtraction in a\ngiven taxable year is the lesser of: (i) the\napplicable PNOLC subtraction allotment plus available PNOLC subtraction\ncarryforwards (the PNOLC subtraction available for use); or\n(ii)\n\nThe amount required to reduce the tax on\ntotal business income prior to the deduction of a PNOLC subtraction and net\noperating losses to the higher of the tax on the capital base or the fixed\ndollar minimum tax (the maximum amount of PNOLC subtraction to be\ndeducted). (2)\n\nFor\ncorporations not electing the 50% allotment method, a PNOLC subtraction may be\nclaimed for no longer than 20 taxable years or the taxable year beginning on or\nafter January 1, 2035 but before January 1, 2036, whichever comes\nfirst. (d) Maximum\namount of the PNOLC subtraction to be deducted. (1)\n\nIn the case of a corporation that is not\na member of a combined group, the maximum amount of the PNOLC subtraction to be\ndeducted in a taxable year is computed as follows: (i) multiply the business income tax rate for\nthe taxable year by the apportioned business income before the PNOLC\nsubtraction and the net operating loss deduction for the taxable\nyear; (ii)\nsubtract from the amount\ncomputed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the greater of the capital base\ntax or the fixed dollar minimum tax for the taxable year; and\n(iii)\ndivide the result in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph by the taxpayer's business income tax rate for the taxable\nyear. (2)\n\nIn the case of\na combined report, the maximum amount of PNOLC subtraction to be deducted in a\ntaxable year is computed as follows: (i) multiply the business income tax rate for the taxable year by the combined\napportioned business income before the PNOLC subtraction and the net operating\nloss deduction for the taxable year; (ii)\nsubtract from the amount computed in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the greater of the combined capital base\ntax or the fixed dollar minimum tax attributable to the designated agent for\nthe taxable year; and\n(iii)\ndivide\nthe result in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph by the combined group's\nbusiness income tax rate for the taxable year.
