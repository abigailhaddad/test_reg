  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-2.16 - Adjustment of aggregate full values for changes in market conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When ORPTS has\naccepted or determined an aggregate full value estimate of an assessing unit, this estimate may be adjusted, in whole or in part, to another valuation date. This may be done with the use of factors which reflect changes in market\nvalue. (b) Factors which are used\nto adjust aggregate full value estimates will be identified by the type of\nproperty, market area, and time frame for which they apply. (c) Factors developed for this purpose will\nbe determined based upon an analysis of data, and using both ORPTS and local\nofficial knowledge of real estate market conditions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8186-2.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
