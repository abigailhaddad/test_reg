  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 22.7 - Interest payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA not-for-profit organization that\nprovides services to a State agency pursuant to a written directive prior to\nthe date that the contract for such services has been fully executed, shall, once such contract has been approved and become fully executed, be entitled to\ninterest in accordance with, and to the extent authorized by, this section on\nthose moneys that would be due under the terms of a contract or a renewal\ncontract prior to the date on which the contract became fully\nexecuted. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this\nsection, a State agency shall be deemed to have issued a written directive\nwhere: (i) with respect to a renewal contract\nit has provided notice to the not-for-profit organization of its intent to\nrenew the contract which shall include the transmission of a proposed renewal\nagreement to the not-for-profit organization; or\n(ii)\nwith respect to new contracts, it has\nprovided the not-for-profit organization with a proposed contract containing a\nstart date, in which case such start date shall be deemed the date of the\nwritten directive. (b) A not-for-profit organization that has\nborrowed funds to provide services pursuant to a written directive may receive\ninterest under this section where the not-for-profit organization has: (1)\nbeen denied an advance payment pursuant\nto section\n22.6\nof this Part; and\n(2)\ndid not obtain a loan from the\n\nNot-For-Profit Short Term Revolving Loan Fund. (c) A not-for-profit organization may not\nreceive interest payments pursuant to this section where the not-for-profit\norganization received an advance payment pursuant to section\n22.6\nof this Part, provided however\nthat if the contract has not been fully executed at the end of the period\ncovered by such advance payment, the not-for-profit organization shall be\neligible for interest payments pursuant to this section in respect to services\nperformed after such period; or\n(d) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, any not-for-profit organization eligible to receive an\ninterest payment pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall\nreceive such interest payments at a rate equal to the rate set by the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance for corporation taxes pursuant to\nparagraph l of subsection (e) of section\n1096\nof the Tax Law. (2)\nA not-for-profit organization eligible to\nreceive interest pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section shall submit to\nthe State agency the interest rate at which it borrowed funds and such other\ndocumentation as prescribed under subdivision 2 of 179-v of the State Finance\n\nLaw. Such not-for-profit organization shall receive interest pursuant to this\nsection at a rate of interest equal to the rate it is paying on such borrowed\nfunds, provided the State agency has approved of such rate and the comptroller\ndetermines such rate is reasonable. (e) (1)\n\nInterest shall be due a not-for-profit organization for each payment that would\nhave been due if the contract had been fully executed before the scheduled\ncommencement date. Interest shall be calculated for the period commencing 30\ndays after the end of each billing period as specified in the contract and\nending on the date payment is actually made, except where under the terms of\nthe contract the not-for-profit organization is entitled to a payment or\npayments on specified dates without the submission of an invoice or voucher, in\nwhich case interest shall run from each such specified date or dates. Interest\nshall be calculated separately with respect to each payment due under the\ncontract. For purposes of this section, if a contract does not specify billing\nperiods or a payment schedule, it shall be presumed that the not-for-profit is\nauthorized to submit invoices or vouchers at the end of each month for a pro\nrata portion of the total contract amount. The State agency is responsible for\ncalculating interest due and preparing a separate voucher to pay such interest\nconsistent with this section. A State agency may not deny interest to a\nnot-for-profit organization on the basis that it failed to submit invoices or\nvouchers during the period prior to final execution of the contract. However, where the not-for-profit fails to submit an invoice or voucher for such payment\nby the 30th day after the date the contract became fully executed, no\nadditional interest shall accrue after such 30th day. (2)\n\nOnce a late contract is fully executed, interest on any late payments due subsequent to the date the contract is fully\nexecuted shall be made in accordance with the requirements of the article XI-A\nof the State Finance Law which relates to the prompt payment of\ncontracts. (f) Any\ninterest payments made pursuant to subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall\nbe made from appropriations for State operations that are available for the\nadministrative programs for the State agency which contracted with the\nnot-for-profit organization. Interest payments shall not be made from amounts\nappropriated for program purposes. Any interest payments made to a\nnot-for-profit organization shall not reduce the amount of money that otherwise\nwould be payable to the not-for-profit organization under the terms of the\ncontract. (g) No interest shall be\npayable pursuant to the provisions of this section with respect to any contract\nor renewal contract where such contract is required to be approved by the\nattorney general and the comptroller, but is never approved. (h) No interest shall be payable under this\nsection where a State agency and a not-for-profit organization have entered\ninto an agreement under section 179-v subdivision (7) waiving interest, and the\ncomptroller has determined that the waiver of interest is warranted. If the\ncomptroller determines the waiver of interest is unwarranted the State agency\nshall immediately submit for the comptroller's approval a voucher requesting\npayment of interest to such not-for-profit organization. If such voucher is not\nreceived within 30 days after the date of the comptroller's written\ndetermination, the comptroller will calculate the amount of unpaid interest due\nto the not-for-profit organization pursuant to section\n179-v\nof\nthe State Finance Law and this Part, and pay such amount to the not-for-profit\norganization as a charge against the agency's appropriations. (i) (1)\n\nInterest payable pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be suspended\nwhere the State agency has, in accordance with section\n179-w\nof\nthe State Finance Law, determined that significant and substantive differences\nexist between the State agency and the not-for-profit organization in the\nnegotiation of a contract or renewal contract or that the not-for-profit\norganization is not negotiating in good faith; and the State agency has\nprovided written notice of such determination to the not-for-profit\norganization and the comptroller, as required by section 179-w. (2)\n\nInterest shall be suspended only for the\nperiod during which the State agency has determined that the significant and\nsubstantive differences existed or the not-for-profit was not negotiating in\ngood faith. Any State agency that has made a determination under paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision shall, when it submits the contract to the comptroller for\napproval, provide notice to the comptroller and the not-for-profit organization\nof the date on which the conditions that justified the suspension of interest, ceased to exist. (j) A\ndetermination that extenuating circumstances exist pursuant to section 179-w\nshall not suspend the accrual of interest unless the State agency also\ndetermines, and such determination is approved by the comptroller, that the\ncircumstances are unusual which warrant the denial of interest as prescribed by\nsection\n22.4\nof this Part. (k) No State agency shall be liable for\ninterest payments under this section on contracts executed pursuant to\nappropriations made in whole or in part for liabilities incurred in a prior\nfiscal year that were awarded without the use of competitive process.
