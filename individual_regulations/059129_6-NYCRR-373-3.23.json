  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.23 - Drip pads\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraph\n(1)(ii) of this subdivision, the requirements of this section apply to owners\nand operators of facilities that use new or existing drip pads to convey\ntreated wood drippage, precipitation, and/or surface water run-off to an\nassociated collection system. Existing drip pads are those constructed before\n\nDecember 6, 1990 and those for which the owner or operator has a design and has\nentered into binding financial or other agreements for construction prior to\n\nDecember 6, 1990. All other drip pads are new drip pads. The requirement at\nsubparagraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section to install a leak collection system\napplies only to those drip pads that are constructed after December 24, 1992\nfor which the owner or operator has a design and has entered into binding\nfinancial or other agreements for construction prior to December 24, 1992. (ii)\n\nFor F034 and F035 wastes\nas defined in paragraph 371.4(b)(1) of this Title, subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph applies, except that the referenced dates are revised to January 17, 1995. (2)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of any drip pad that is inside or under a structure that provides\nprotection from precipitation so that neither run-off nor run-on is generated\nis not subject to regulation under paragraphs (d)(5) or (6) of this section, as\nappropriate. (3)\n\nThe requirements\nof this section are not applicable to the management of infrequent and\nincidental drippage in storage yards, provided that: (1)\nthe owner or operator maintains and\ncomplies with a written contingency plan that describes how the owner or\noperator will respond immediately to the discharge of such infrequent and\nincidental drippage. At a minimum, the contingency plan must describe how the\nfacility will do the following: (a) clean up\nthe drippage; (b) document the\ncleanup of the drippage; (c) retain\ndocuments regarding cleanup for three years; and\n(d) manage the contaminated media in a manner\nconsistent with State and Federal regulations. (b) Assessment of existing\ndrip pad integrity. (1)\n\nFor each\nexisting drip pad as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, the owner or\noperator must evaluate the drip pad and determine that it meets all of the\nrequirements of this section, except the requirements for liners and leak\ndetection systems of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. No later than the\neffective date of these regulations, the owner or operator must obtain and keep\non file at the facility a written assessment of the drip pad, reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State that attests to the results of the evaluation. The assessment must\nbe reviewed, updated and re-certified annually until all upgrades, repairs, or\nmodifications necessary to achieve compliance with all of the standards of\nsubdivision (d) of this section are complete. The evaluation must document the\nextent to which the drip pad meets each of the design and operating standards\nof subdivision (d) of this section, except the standards for liners and leak\ndetection systems, specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this section. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must develop a\nwritten plan for upgrading, repairing, and modifying the drip pad to meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and submit the plan to the\ncommissioner no later than two years before the date that all repairs, upgrades, and modifications are complete. This written plan must describe all\nchanges to be made to the drip pad in sufficient detail to document compliance\nwith all the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section. The plan must be\nreviewed and certified by an independent qualified professional engineer\nregistered in New York State. (3)\n\nUpon completion of all repairs and modifications, the owner or operator must\nsubmit to the commissioner the as-built drawings for the drip pad, together\nwith a certification by an independent, qualified professional engineer\nregistered in New York State attesting that the drip pad conforms to the\ndrawings. (4)\n\nIf the drip pad is\nfound to be leaking or unfit for use, the owner or operator must comply with\nthe provisions of paragraph (d)(13) of this section or close the drip pad in\naccordance with subdivision (f) of this section. (c) Design and installation of new drip\npads. Owners and operators of new drip pads must ensure that\nthe pads are designed, installed, and operated in accordance with one of the\nfollowing: (1)\nall of the applicable\nrequirements of subdivisions (d) (except subparagraph [d][1][iv]), (e) and (f)\nof this section; or\n(2)\nall of the\napplicable requirements of subdivision (d) (except paragraph [d][2]), (e) and\n(f) of this section. (d) Design and operating requirements. (1)\n\nDrip pads must: (i) be constructed of non-earthen materials, excluding wood and non-structurally supported asphalt; (ii)\nbe sloped to free-drain treated wood\ndrippage, rain and other waters, or solutions of drippage and water or other\nwastes to the associated collection system; (iii)\nhave a curb or berm around the\nperimeter; (iv)\n(a) have a hydraulic conductivity of less\nthan or equal to 1 ×- 10\n-7\ncentimeters per\nsecond, e.g., existing concrete drip pads must be sealed, coated, or covered with a surface material with a hydraulic conductivity of\nless than or equal to 1 ×- 10\n-7\ncentimeters\nper second such that the entire surface where drippage occurs or may run across\nis capable of containing such drippage and mixtures of drippage and\nprecipitation, materials, or other wastes while being routed to an associated\ncollection system. This surface material must be maintained free of cracks and\ngaps that could adversely affect its hydraulic conductivity, and the material\nmust be chemically compatible with the preservatives that contact the drip pad. The requirements of this provision apply only to existing drip pads and those\ndrip pads for which the owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph\n(c)(2) instead of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; (b) the owner or operator must obtain and\nkeep on file at the facility a written assessment of the drip pad, reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State that attests to the results of the evaluation. The assessment must\nbe reviewed, updated and recertified annually. The evaluation must document the\nextent to which the drip pad meets the design and operating standards of this\nsubdivision, except for paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (v) be of sufficient structural strength and\nthickness to prevent failure due to physical contact, climatic conditions, the\nstress of installation, and the stress of daily operations, e.g., variable and moving loads such as vehicle traffic, movement of wood, etc. Note: DEC will generally consider applicable standards\nestablished by professional organizations generally recognized by industry such\nas the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and the American Society of Testing\n\nMaterials (ASTM) in judging the structural integrity requirement of this\nsubparagraph. (2)\n\nIf an owner/operator elects to comply with paragraph (c)(1) instead of\nparagraph (c)(2) of this section, the drip pad must have: (i) a synthetic liner installed below the\ndrip pad that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent leakage from\nthe drip pad into the adjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water\nat any time during the active life (including the closure period) of the drip\npad. The liner must be constructed of materials that will prevent waste from\nbeing absorbed into the liner and prevent releases into the adjacent subsurface\nsoil or ground water or surface water during the active life of the facility. The liner must be: (a) constructed of\nmaterials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and\nthickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head\nand external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or drip pad\nleakage to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of\ninstallation, and the stress of daily operation (including stresses from\nvehicular traffic on the drip pad); (b) placed upon a foundation or base capable\nof providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above\nand below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression or uplift; and\n(c) installed to cover all surrounding earth that could come in contact with the\nwaste or leakage; and\n(ii)\na leakage detection system immediately\nabove the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and operated to\ndetect leakage from the drip pad. The leakage detection system must be: (a) constructed of materials that are: (1)\nchemically resistant to the waste managed\nin the drip pad and the leakage that might be generated; and\n(2)\nof sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlaying materials and by any\nequipment used at the drip pad; and\n(b) designed and operated to function without\nclogging through the scheduled closure of the drip pad; and\n(c) designed so that it will detect the\nfailure of the drip pad or the presence of a release of hazardous waste or\naccumulated liquid at the earliest practicable time; and\n(iii)\na leakage collection system immediately\nabove the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and operated to\ncollect leakage from the drip pad such that it can be removed from below the\ndrip pad. The date, time, and quantity of any leakage collected in this system\nand removed must be documented in the operating log. (3)\n\nDrip pads must be maintained such that\nthey remain free of cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other deterioration that could\ncause hazardous waste to be released from the drip pad. Note: See paragraph (13) of this subdivision for remedial\naction required if deterioration or leakage is detected. (4)\n\nThe drip pad and associated collection\nsystem must be designed and operated to convey, drain, and collect liquid\nresulting from drippage or precipitation in order to prevent run-off. (5)\n\nUnless protected by a structure, as\ndescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndesign, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of\npreventing flow onto the drip pad during peak discharge from at least a\n24-hour, 25-year storm, unless the system has sufficient excess capacity to\ncontain any run-on that might enter the system. (6)\n\nUnless protected by a structure or cover, as described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndesign, construct, operate and maintain a run-off management system to collect\nand control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year\nstorm. (7)\n\nThe drip pad must be\nevaluated to determine that it meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) through\n(6) of this subdivision, and the owner or operator must obtain a statement from\nan independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New York State\ncertifying that the drip pad design meets the requirements of this\nsubdivision. (8)\n\nDrippage and\naccumulated precipitation must be removed from the associated collection system\nas necessary to prevent overflow onto the drip pad. (9)\n\nThe drip pad surface must be cleaned\nthoroughly in a manner and frequency such that accumulated residues of\nhazardous waste or other materials are removed, with residues being properly\nmanaged as hazardous waste, so as to allow weekly inspections of the entire\ndrip pad surface without interference or hindrance from accumulated residues of\nhazardous waste or other materials on the drip pad. The owner or operator must\ndocument the date and time of each cleaning and the cleaning procedure used in\nthe facility's operating log. (10)\n\nDrip pads must be operated and maintained in a manner to minimize tracking of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents off the drip pad as a result of\nactivities by personnel or equipment. (11)\n\nAfter being removed from the treatment\nvessel, treated wood from pressure and non- pressure processes must be held on\nthe drip pad until drippage has ceased. The owner or operator must maintain\nrecords sufficient to document that all treated wood is held on the pad\nfollowing treatment in accordance with this requirement. (12)\n\nCollection and holding units associated\nwith run-on and run-off control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed as\nsoon as possible after storms to maintain design capacity of the\nsystem. (13)\n\nThroughout the active\nlife of the drip pad, if the owner or operator detects a condition that may\nhave caused or has caused a release of hazardous waste, the condition must be\nrepaired within a reasonably prompt period of time following discovery, in\naccordance with the following procedures: (i) Upon detection of a condition that may have caused or has caused a release of\nhazardous waste (\ne.g., upon detection of leakage by the leak\ndetection system), the owner or operator must: (a) enter a record of the discovery in the\nfacility operating log; (b) immediately remove the portion of the drip pad affected by the condition from\nservice; (c) determine what steps\nmust be taken to repair the drip pad, remove any leakage from below the drip\npad, and establish a schedule for accomplishing the clean up and\nrepairs; (d) within 24 hours after\ndiscovery of the condition, notify the commissioner of the condition and, within 10 working days, provide a written notice to the commissioner with a\ndescription of the steps that will be taken to repair the drip pad, and clean\nup any leakage, and the schedule for accomplishing this work. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner will review\nthe information submitted, make a determination regarding whether the pad must\nbe removed from service completely or partially until repairs and clean up are\ncomplete, and notify in writing the owner or operator of the determination and\nthe underlying rationale. (iii)\n\nUpon completing all repairs and clean up, the owner or operator must notify the\ncommissioner in writing and provide a certification, signed by an independent\nqualified, professional engineer registered in New York State, that the repairs\nand clean up have been completed according to the written plan submitted in\naccordance with clause (i)(\nd\n) of this paragraph. (14)\n\nThe owner or operator must\nmaintain, as part of the facility operating log, documentation of past\noperating and waste handling practices. This must include identification of\npreservative formulations used in the past, a description of drippage\nmanagement practices, and a description of treated wood storage and handling\npractices. (e) Inspections. (1)\n\nDuring\nconstruction or installation, liners and cover systems (\ne.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage, and\nimperfections (\ne.g., holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign\nmaterials). Immediately after construction or installation, liners must be\ninspected and certified as meeting the requirements of subdivision (d) of this\nsection by an independent qualified, professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State. The certification must be maintained at the facility as part of the\nfacility operating record. After installation, liners and covers must be\ninspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of tears, punctures, or blisters. (2)\n\nWhile a drip pad\nis in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect\nevidence of any of the following: (i) Deterioration, malfunctions or improper operation of run-on and run-off control\nsystems. (ii)\n\nThe presence of\nleakage in and proper functioning of leakage detection system. (iii)\n\nDeterioration or cracking of the drip\npad surface. Note: See paragraph (d)(13) of this section for remedial action\nrequired if deterioration or leakage is detected. (f) Closure. (1)\n\nAt closure, the owner or operator must\nremove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system\ncomponents (pad, liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and\nequipment contaminated with waste and leakage, and manage them as hazardous\nwaste. (2)\n\nIf, after removing or\ndecontaminating all residues and making all reasonable efforts to effect\nremoval or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the owner or\noperator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can be practically removed or\ndecontaminated, the owner or operator must close the facility and perform\npost-closure care in accordance with closure and post- closure care\nrequirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-3.14\n[d]\nof\nthis Subpart). For permitted units, the requirement to have a permit continues\nthroughout the post-closure period. (3)\n(i) The\nowner or operator of an existing drip pad, as defined in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, that does not comply with the liner requirements of subparagraph\n(d)(2)(i) of this section must: (a) include\nin the closure plan for the drip pad under section\n373-3.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, both a plan for complying with paragraph (1) of this subdivision and a\ncontingent plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in case\nnot all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure; and\n(b) prepare a contingent\npost-closure plan under section\n373-3.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in case not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure. (ii)\n\nThe cost estimates calculated\nunder sections\n373-3.7\n(c) and\n373-3.8\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart for closure and post-closure care of a drip pad subject to this\nparagraph must include the cost of complying with the contingent closure plan\nand the contingent post-closure plan, but are not required to include the cost\nof expected closure under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
