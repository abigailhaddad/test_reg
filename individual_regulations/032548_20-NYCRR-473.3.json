  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 473.3 - Applications for permits by a lessee using a trip-lease permit book\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 501, 502\n(a) If a lessee requires the immediate use of\na motor vehicle in this State, except for an omnibus, for which no permit has\nbeen previously issued, or if such motor vehicle enters the State for the first\ntime on a trip-lease, a permit by a trip-lease permit book may be obtained for\nsuch leased motor vehicle for 20 days, or less, by the lessee (see §§\n473.7\nand\n473.8, infra\n) as follows: (b) An application for a book of 20 permits\nmay be obtained by applying to the State Tax Commission on form TMT-11 in\nduplicate. A fee of $100 must accompany each application for a book of 20\ntrip-lease permits. The fee shall be paid by a check or money order payable to\nthe State Tax Commission. All the required information must be set forth in\neach blank of the application form. Separate application forms must be\nsubmitted for each book of 20 permits. The application and fee shall be mailed\nor delivered to the State Tax Commission, Miscellaneous Tax Bureau. (See §\n470.1\n(a), supra. )\n(c) The\n\nState Tax Commission will approve or reject all applications. If approved, one\ncopy of the application together with the book of 20 trip-lease permits (form\nTMT-10) will be mailed to the applicant at the address shown on the application\nform, unless the applicant furnishes and requests a different mailing\naddress. (d) The trip-lease permits\nforwarded may be used only by the purchaser of such book, and each permit will\nbe valid for a period of 20 days, or less, from the date of issuance entered by\nthe carrier. Before a motor vehicle is moved on a public highway of this State, the carrier or lessee must complete each item on a trip-lease permit in\ntriplicate including the date of issuance. One copy of the trip-lease permit\nmust be carried on the motor vehicle for which the permit is issued. One copy\nmust be mailed immediately to the Miscellaneous Tax Bureau at the above address\n(see §\n470.1\n[a], supra\n) and one copy may be retained by the carrier for tax\nreporting purposes. No permit may be used on a motor vehicle other than the\nmotor vehicle for which it was issued, nor may any incomplete, erased or\ncorrected permit be used. Any such permit is subject to the procedure for\nsuspension or revocation of permits set forth in section\n475.3, infra. Any incomplete, erased or corrected permit, or\notherwise unused permit may be returned together with an application for\nrefund, on a form prescribed by the State Tax Commission, within the two-year\nperiod after the date of purchase. (e) If the motor vehicle is to be operated in\nthis State for more than 20 days, an application for a permit and plate must be\nfiled on forms TMT-1 and TMT-2 within such period. Since a trip-lease permit is\nnot convertible into a permanent permit or plate, such an application should\ninclude the fee for each permit and plate requested. (See §\n473.1, supra. ) Any operation of a motor vehicle (see §§\n470.2\n-470.3, 471.2-471.7, supra\n) without a permit and plate after\nthe expiration of the 20 days is a violation of law.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
