  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1963.2 - Probate\n\nState Regulations\n\nWitnesses\n1. The court requires the personal\nappearance and examination under oath by the clerk of any witness to a will\noffered for probate which was executed within 90 days of the date of the\ndecedent's death. Where all the parties in interest in the proceeding are adult\nand competent and sign an acknowledged waiver, the court will dispense with\nthis requirement. Objections to Probate\n2. The time for filing\nobjections after completion of the examination of subscribing witnesses, if\nrequested pursuant to SCPA section 1404, shall be filed within 30 days, which\nmay be extended by stipulation of counsel. Attorney-Fiduciary\n3. (a) Where the petition for probate\nrequests that letters testamentary issue to a person who is also an attorney, not related by blood or affinity with the decedent, the court requires that the\nattorney-fiduciary submit an affidavit explaining his relationship with the\ndecedent and the circumstances surrounding his nomination as executor. After\nthe required affidavit is filed, the court shall determine whether a hearing is\nnecessary on the issue of the attorney-fiduciary's qualifications and the facts\nsurrounding his or her appointment. (b) If the attorney-fiduciary is found\nto be qualified to act as executor, he or she must comply with Rule 207.60. Preliminary Letters\n4. Any order\ngranting preliminary letters will provide that such letters will expire six\nmonths after the date of issuance. The order will further provide for the\npetitioner to post a bond for the full amount of the estate assets alleged in\nthe petition for probate. 5. A petition requesting leave to\nextend preliminary letters beyond six months must be accompanied by a cash flow\nstatement detailing the assets marshalled and claims paid by the petitioner. Any discrepancy between the value of estate assets set forth in the cash flow\nstatement and the original petition for probate requires the filing of an\naffidavit explaining the discrepancy. If leave for extension is granted, preliminary letters will be extended only for an additional six months. Bequest to Confidant\n6. In addition to the common\npractice of requiring an affidavit and hearing regarding any bequest in the\ndecedent's will to an attorney ( Matter of Putnam, 257 NY 140), the court\nrequires the submission of an affidavit detailing the relationship of the\nlegatee to the testator and the facts surrounding a bequest to any person\nhaving a confidential relationship with the decedent (clergyman, accountant, doctor, nurse, home care attendant, etc.). The required affidavit, together\nwith the petition, is submitted to the court to determine whether a hearing on\nthe bequest is necessary. Wrongful Death\n7. Where a cause of action for\npersonal injury or wrongful death is listed as an asset of the estate and any\nof the parties in interest in the estate, either as legatees or distributees, are under a disability (infancy, incompetency, unknown, etc.), letters\ntestamentary issued by the court will be restricted to provide that the cause\nof action cannot be settled or compromised without further order of the court. Trials\n8. A note of issue and\nstatement of readiness in compliance with Rule 207.29 and statement of issues\nin compliance with Rule 207.30 must be timely served and filed 10 days prior to\nthe trial date set. Once a day certain and time for trial is fixed by the\ncourt, no adjournments will be granted barring extraordinary\ncircumstances. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
