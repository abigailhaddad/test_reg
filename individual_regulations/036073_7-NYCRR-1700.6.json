  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1700.6 - General principles\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following principles must be applied to the claim review\nprocess: (a) Requirements. In order to\napprove payment of a claim for the loss, damage or destruction of an inmate's\npersonal property, the reviewer must determine: (1)\nthat the inmate has made a timely\nclaim; (2)\nthat the inmate has\nsatisfactorily proved ownership or authorized possession of some or all of the\nproperty; (3)\nthat the department\nor its agents have been negligent and that such negligence caused the loss of\nsome or all of the property; (4)\nwhether or not the inmate contributed to the loss of the property; and\n(5)\nwhat is the proper amount\nto be paid. (b) Timeliness issue. Section\n1700.4\nof this Part\nrequires the inmate to report the loss as soon as possible after the discovery\nof the loss and to file the claim within five working days after the discovery\nof the loss. This timeframe should be interpreted with some flexibility. There\nmay be extenuating circumstances that would call for discretion to excuse late\nfiling, including: (1)\ninmate was in transit\nat the time of the loss, in an outside hospital, enroute to a new facility, in\nrestricted housing where access to required proof and forms may have been\nlimited, and so on; (2)\ninmate was\nill or otherwise unable to pursue the claim; (3)\nit was not clear whether or not any loss\nhad taken place, for example, facility staff indicated that they were still\nchecking to find the property in question in the package room, IRC Office, housing unit storage areas, etc.; or\n(4)\nother unusual situations. (c) Ownership or possession. The\ninmate must be able to prove ownership or possession of the items claimed in\nsome reasonable fashion. (1)\n\nIn this regard\ncopies of the following are acceptable: (i) package room receipts; (ii)\nmailroom receipts; (iii)\ncommissary\nreceipts; (iv)\nspecial purchase\ndisbursements; or\n(v) Form #2064, \"Personal Property Transferred,\" and related records. (2)\n\nOther appropriate proof may be accepted\nas long as it adequately describes the item and indicates authorized possession\nby the inmate claimant. The courts sometimes accept oral proof for good\nreasons; the department may do so too. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n1700.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
