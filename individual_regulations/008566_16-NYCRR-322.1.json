  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 322.1 - Gas plant to be recorded at original cost\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All amounts included in subaccounts\n1301-1390 of accounts 1101 to 1104 for gas plant (except as otherwise provided\nin account 1302, Franchises and Consents) shall be the original cost (see\n§\n320.1, subd. [a] [9]) of such gas\nplant. (See also paragraphs B and C of account 1106.)\n(b) When the term cost is used in the\ndetailed gas plant accounts (1301-1390), it shall mean the original cost unless\notherwise specified and shall include not only the materials, supplies, labor, services and other items consumed or employed in the construction and\ninstallation of gas plant, but also the cost of preliminary studies, plans, surveys, engineering, supervision, and general expenses, which contribute\ndirectly and immediately to gas plant without duplication of such\ncosts. (c) When the consideration\ngiven for property is other than cash, the value of such consideration shall be\ndetermined on a cash basis. In the entry recording such transaction the actual\nconsideration shall be described with sufficient particularity to identify it. The utility shall be prepared to furnish the commission the particulars of its\ndetermination of the cash value of the consideration, if other than\ncash. (d) When property is\npurchased under a plan involving deferred payments, no charge shall be made to\nthe gas plant accounts for interest, insurance, or other expenditures\noccasioned solely by such form of payment. (e) Gas plant contributed to the utility or\nconstructed by it from contributions to it of cash or its equivalent shall be\ncharged to the gas plant accounts at cost (see §\n320.1, subd. [a] [6]) to the\nutility (i.e., original cost less the portion thereof contributed by or on\nbehalf of customers). Records shall be kept so that the utility can readily\nfurnish information as to the source, purpose, and amount of each contribution, the property to which each contribution relates, and the conditions, if any, upon which each contribution was made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n322.1\n\nAmounts received for construction which are ultimately\nto be refunded, wholly or in part, shall be credited to account 1241, Customer\n\nAdvances for Construction. When the amount to be refunded has been finally\ndetermined, the balance, if any remaining in account 1241 shall be debited\nthereto and credited to the gas plant accounts to which the cost of the\nproperty was charged. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
