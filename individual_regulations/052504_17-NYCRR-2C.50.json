Guidance: 02A Nonvehicular Warning signs should not be used: in\nadvance of crossings where traffic is controlled by traffic control signals; where traffic on the approach is controlled by a STOP sign, YIELD sign, or\nflashing red signal at the crossing location; or on the same approach with an\n\nIntersection Warning sign (see Section\n2C.46\n). 02B The W11-4, W11-7, W11-17, 11-19, and W11-22 signs\nshould only be used to warn of well-defined crossings where farm or ridden\nanimals regularly cross a highway. 02C The W11-3, W11-16, W11-18, W11-20 and W11-21 signs\nshould be used only after wildlife crossing locations or sections have been\ncarefully determined and there is evidence, such as wildlife accidents or local\nwildlife sightings, that motorist warning is necessary. The regional wildlife\nmanager of the Department of Environmental Conservations should be consulted in\ndetermining locations where wildlife crossing signs would be\nappropriate. Guidance: 04A The diagonal downward pointing arrow (W16-7P) plaque\nshould not be used with W11-16, W11-17, W11-18, W11-19, W11-20, or W11-21\nsigns, or with other signs in this series where road crossing locations are\nunpredictable.
