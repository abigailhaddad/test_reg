(iv)\n\nThe \"Exempt Organization Certification\nfor Hotel or Motel Occupancy by Representatives of Veterans' Organizations\" is\ntimely provided when it, and the required copy of the post's, organization's or\naffiliate's exempt organization certificate, are properly completed and\nreceived by the hotel operator within 90 days of the first period of occupancy, as described in section\n532.4\n(b)(2)(iii)\n(\nb\n)(\n5\n) of this Title. (k) Sales by exempt posts, organizations and affiliates. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in section\n1116\nof the Tax Law or other law, sales of\ntangible personal property and services by exempt posts, organizations and\naffiliates are exempt from the sales and use tax. (i) Retail sales of tangible personal\nproperty made through a shop or store operated by a post, organization or\naffiliate are subject to the sales and use tax. A shop or\nstore\nas used in this section includes any place or establishment\nwhere goods are sold from display with a degree of regularity, frequency and\ncontinuity, as well as any place where sales are made through a temporary shop\nor store located on the same premises as persons required to collect tax. Vending machines alone do not constitute a shop or store. However, where\nvending machines are located in a defined area devoted to selling tangible\npersonal property, then sales from such vending machines constitute sales from\na shop or store. Example 1: An exempt post makes door-to-door sales of patriotic bumper\nstickers. Such sales are not taxable. Example 2: An exempt post operates a gift shop on its premises. Sales\nmade by the gift shop are taxable. Example 3: A display case is placed in an enclosed area in the hall of\na post's premises. From this case articles may be purchased at certain hours\neach day at which times a clerk is present. The display case is in a separate\narea and is used solely to display tangible personal property for sale; therefore, the post is considered to be operating a shop or store. Example 4: An exempt post operates coin-operated vending machines for\nthe sale of candy, gum and other tangible personal property. The vending\nmachines are located in hallways, corridors, recesses or alcoves. These vending\nmachine sales do not constitute sales from a shop or store. Example 5: An exempt post operates one or more coin-operated vending\nmachines for the sale of candy, cigarettes, gum or other tangible personal\nproperty. The vending machines are placed in a room which is only used to make\nsales from these machines. These vending machine sales constitute sales from a\nshop or store. Assume the facts in the immediately preceding paragraph, except that the vending machines are located in a book store and gift shop\noperated by the exempt post. The vending machine sales constitute sales from a\nshop or store and are subject to tax. Example 6: An exempt post operates one or more coin-operated vending\nmachines for the sale of candy, cigarettes, gum or other tangible personal\nproperty. The vending machines are located in a lounge which also contains a\npool table and sofas and chairs. These vending machine sales do not constitute\nsales from a shop or store. (ii)\n\nIf an exempt post, organization, or\naffiliate operates a shop or store and also makes retail sales of similar\n(though not necessarily identical) items of tangible personal property by any\nmeans other than at its shop or store (such as by remote means or at an\nauction), those additional sales are considered to be made from its shop or\nstore. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nother provision of this paragraph and except as provided by law, all of the\nprovisions of section\n529.7\n(i)(2)\nof this Part apply to sales of tangible personal property and services by an\nexempt post, organization, or affiliate. (2)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(3)\n\nSales of food or drink in or by a\nrestaurant, tavern or other establishment operated by a post, organization or\naffiliate, other than the sales exempt under section\n1105 (d)(ii)\nof the Tax Law\ndescribed in subdivision (h) of section\n527.8\nof\nthis Title, are subject to the sales tax unless the purchaser is a person or\norganization exempt under this Part. A restaurant, tavern or other\nestablishment\nas used in this section includes any dining room, bar\nand barroom, and concession stand operated with a degree of regularity, frequency and continuity, as well as any place where sales are made through a\ntemporary restaurant, tavern or other establishment located on the same\npremises as persons required to collect tax. It is immaterial whether or not\nthe restaurant, tavern or other establishment is located on the premises of the\npost or whether or not the use of such facilities is restricted to the members\nof the post. (See section\n527.8\nof\nthis Title for the application of tax on sales of food and drink.) Vending\nmachine sales of food or drink are considered to be in or by a restaurant, tavern or other establishment when the machines are located in a defined area\ndevoted to this purpose, and there are other furnishings or fixtures present\nwhich are commonly associated with a restaurant or similar establishment, like\ntables or chairs. Example 7: An exempt post occasionally holds chicken barbecues on its\ngrounds. The sale of food at the barbecue is not taxable. Example 8: An exempt post operates a dining room from which it sells\nfood and in which it caters private parties. The sale of the food and the\ncharges for catering are taxable. Example 9: An exempt auxiliary unit of a post operates a concession\nstand at a weekly bingo night. Sales made at the stand are taxable. Example 10: An exempt post has several vending machines that dispense\ncoffee, tea, soup and other items. The machines are located in a room which\nalso contains tables and chairs in the area of the machines. The sales through\nthe machines for on-premises consumption constitute taxable sales of food by a\nrestaurant or similar establishment. (4)\n\nSales of the service of providing\nparking, garaging or storing for motor vehicles (other than a garage which is\npart of the premises occupied solely as a private one- or two-family dwelling)\nare subject to the tax when such services are provided by organizations\ndescribed under section\n1116 (a)(5)\nof the Tax Law. (i) If a facility for parking, garaging or\nstoring motor vehicles is operated within the counties of Bronx, Kings, Queens\nor Richmond, the effective rate of tax to be collected on such services is\n101/4 percent. (ii)\n\nIf a facility\nfor parking, garaging or storing motor vehicles is operated within Manhattan\n(New York County), the effective rate of tax to be collected on such services\nis 181/4 percent. (5)\n\nAn\nexempt post organization or affiliate making taxable sales is required to\nregister as a vendor, collect the appropriate tax, and file timely sales tax\nreturns.
