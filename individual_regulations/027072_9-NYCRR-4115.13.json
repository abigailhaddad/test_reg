  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4115.13 - Judges' authority\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a starter, having fined a driver $50, believes that a\ngreater penalty should be imposed, either by additional monetary fine or a\nsuspension, he shall so recommend to the judges who shall review the matter and\ntake such action as they deem appropriate. Nothing herein contained shall be\nconstrued to prevent the imposition by the judges on their own initiative of a\ncensure or penalty for the failure of a driver to obey the rules of the\nstart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4115.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
