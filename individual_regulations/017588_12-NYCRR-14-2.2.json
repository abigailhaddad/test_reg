  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-2.2 - Setting and insulating\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll boilers hereafter installed shall comply with the\nfollowing requirements: (a) Boilers\nwhich require access to permit of proper care and inspection shall have a\nminimum clearance of 24 inches from the building walls or partitions. Exception:Boilers other than horizontal tubular or\nwatertube type or not exceeding 30 inches in diameter may be set with a minimum\nclearance of not less than 16 inches from building walls or partitions in the\nclear. (b) Where more than\none firebox or economic type of boiler are installed, a space of at least 24\ninches shall be provided between the boilers for inspection and\nrepair. (c) Wet-bottom boilers\nshall be set not less than 12 inches above the floor. (d) The setting walls of a water tube boiler\nshall be so constructed that all drum heads will be accessible for external\ninspection. (e) Where it is\nnecessary to go on top of boiler or boilers for maintenance or operating\npurposes, a clearance of at least seven feet shall be maintained from the\nworking platform to the underside of any overhead structure. Exception:Where boilers are to be installed in an\nexisting building where it is necessary to go on top, there shall be a\nclearance of at least three feet. There shall be not less than six inches of\nclearance space above the highest point of any valve or other fitting when such\nvalve or fitting is at maximum opening. (f) The clearance above a vertical boiler\n(except of the water tube type) shall be sufficient to permit of inspection and\nnecessary repairs of the upper tube sheet. (g) When boilers have riveted nozzles\nattached, the flanges of nozzles where attached shall not be covered\npermanently with insulation. Provision shall be made by using removable\nsections of insulating material to expose the flanges for inspection\npurposes. (h) Where boilers are of\nriveted construction and the dimensions of the riveted joint cannot be\ndetermined for computation purposes on the inside of the shell, the insulating\nmaterial covering the exterior of the shell shall be so attached that a\nsufficient amount of same may be readily removed for examination of the joint\nto determine the size and pitch of rivets and such other data as may be\nrequired by the inspector.
