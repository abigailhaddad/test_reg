Tit. 6 § 621.15 - Conceptual review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A project sponsor may\nrequest the regional permit administrator to conduct a conceptual review of the\nsubstantive consistency of the project or any component thereof with current\n\nState environmental policy and standards at the time of submission of an\napplication (which need not be complete) if: (1)\nthe project will involve a major land use\n(e.g., housing subdivision, planned unit development, new community, regional\nshopping center, manufacturing plant, office center, public or private\ninstitution such as schools, hospitals, civic centers, etc.); (2)\nthe expense of preparing detailed plans, specifications, and applications, without conceptual review, will constitute an\nundue burden on the project sponsor, considering the risks involved and the\nalternatives available; or\n(3)\nin\ndetermining whether to grant conceptual review, the department shall give\nspecial consideration to cases involving projects which are likely to require\nmultiple permits from the department, which will take place in phases over a\nperiod of time, or which involve factual determinations of a difficult issue or\nissues. (b) A request\nfor conceptual review must contain the following: (1)\na map of the county, showing the location\nof the proposed project, and a map or maps at a scale of 1\" = 2,000' or larger\nshowing the general layout of the proposed project and giving general depiction\nof existing site topography, water bodies and courses, roads, and character of\nvegetation; (2)\na statement\ngenerally describing the proposed project, including proposed plans for\nbuildings, water and energy supplies, sewage disposal, drainage, solid waste\ndisposal, roads and parking, and any planned alteration of water bodies, watercourses, site vegetation and site topography if known; (3)\na general statement of the applicant's\ntimetable and financial plans for the carrying out of the proposed\nproject; (4)\na general statement of\nany governmental financial aid, facilities, or other assistance which the\npotential applicant expects to be provided for the proposed project; (5)\nan identification of all governmental\nagencies with jurisdiction over the project, and the extent of that\njurisdiction if known; and\n(6)\nwhere applicable, the public necessity to be met by the project. (c) Within 30 days after receipt\nof a request for conceptual review, the department shall notify the applicant\nin writing whether the information furnished is sufficient for the purpose of\ncommencing conceptual review. If additional information must be submitted, its\nsufficiency will be evaluated within a new 30-day period after it is received\nby the department. (d) If the\ndepartment decides that a conceptual review will be conducted, upon receipt of\nany required draft environmental impact statement, the department will publish\na notice of commencement of conceptual review in the next available issue of\nthe Environmental Notice Bulletin and by such other means as it deems\nappropriate. This notice must contain the items enumerated in section\n621.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (e) The department may\nrequire additional necessary information to be submitted at any time during the\ncourse of the conceptual review. (f) Not more than 30 days after publication\nof the notice of commencement of conceptual review, the department will decide\nwhether to hold a public comment hearing in accordance with section\n621.8\nof this Part, and will notify\nthe applicant, in writing, of that decision. (g) If an adjudicatory proceeding is held, it\nshall be governed by Part 624 of this Title. (h) The department shall issue a\npost-conceptual review decision: (1)\nin cases\nwhere no public comment hearing has been held, within 120 days after the notice\nof commencement of conceptual review has been published; or\n(2)\nin cases where a public comment hearing\nhas been held, within 60 days of the closing of the hearing record. (i) The post-conceptual review\ndecision shall contain the following: (1)\nthe\ndepartment's decision whether, on the record compiled, the proposed project or\nthe component or issue reviewed would be consistent with the environmental\npolicy of the State as expressed in the Environmental Conservation Law. This\nshall take into account both the specific standards to be applied under the\ndepartment's various relevant permit requirements, and the requirements of\nSEQR; (2)\na list of all department\npermits which appear to be required for the project, and a statement of the\nsequence in which the potential applicant should submit applications to the\ndepartment for such permits; and\n(3)\na list of standards and conditions to\navoid or mitigate adverse environmental impact, which the department intends to\napply to the proposed project. (j) The post-conceptual review decision is\nnot a permit. It is intended to provide potential applicants with a binding\ndecision from the department as to the general acceptability of a proposed\nproject or any component or issue specified, the standards which will be\napplied to it and desirable design standards. Conceptual review does not\nrelieve an applicant of the requirement of obtaining all permits otherwise\nnecessary, prior to commencing a proposed project. (k) Applications for such permits will be\nprocessed as expeditiously as possible. In cases where a generic environmental\nimpact statement has been prepared on the overall project as part of conceptual\nreview, any supplemental environmental impact statement that may be required\nshall deal only with site-specific issues identified by the department as not\nadequately addressed in the original environmental impact statement. In cases\nwhere a public comment hearing has been conducted as part of conceptual review, a further hearing shall be required only: (1)\nif the department's post-conceptual review decision specified that a hearing\nwould be held on a specific issue; (2)\nif a significant change requiring a\nhearing is proposed in the project which was originally reviewed; (3)\nif relevant significant new information\nbecomes available; (4)\nif\napplicable law or regulations have changed; or\n(5)\nif it becomes apparent that the applicant\nmay be unable to meet the conditions specified in the department's\npost-conceptual review decision or the requirements for a permit pursuant to\nsection\n621.3\nor\n621.4\nof this Part. (l) The post-conceptual review\ndecision shall remain binding on the department and in effect as long as the\nproposed project continues to conform to the descriptions contained in the\nrequest for a conceptual review subject to the limitations in this Part\nconcerning modifications. (m) If, following post-conceptual review decision, the applicant proposes that the\nproject be amended or modified, it shall immediately notify the department. The\ndepartment shall decide whether the proposed changes are significant. If the\nmodification to the project is not significant, an amendment to the\npost-conceptual review decision may be issued. If the proposed changes are\nsignificant, the review process and, if necessary, the hearing process may be\nreopened to review those modifications. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
