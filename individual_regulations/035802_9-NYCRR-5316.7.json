  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5316.7 - Kiosks\n\nState Regulations\n\nKiosks are patron interface units that may be used to\nperform various tasks including, without limitation, the tasks described in\nthis section. (a) Voucher/coupon\nredemption. Kiosks are usually interfaced to some type of monitoring or control\nsystem that will play a role in the critical functions of the kiosk. Gaming\ndevices that have the option of issuing payments via voucher printers are\ncustomarily interfaced to a validation system. When a voucher is redeemed for\ncash, the voucher on the validation system shall be updated to reflect a\nredeemed status. When a patron uses a kiosk as the method of redemption, the\nkiosk shall read the voucher and notify the validation system of all required\nvalidation information. The system shall then determine if the voucher is valid\nand transmit to the kiosk the amount to be paid or instruct the kiosk to reject\nthe voucher. For valid vouchers, payment is made to the patrons from various\ndenominations, coin and currency payment mechanisms. (b) Bill breaking. Bill breaking is the act\nof making change. A patron may wish to insert a bill for any combination of\nchange. Bill breaking may include an insertion of a large denomination bill for\nthe issuance of smaller denomination bills. (c) Voucher issuance. Voucher issuance kiosks\nthat issue vouchers via voucher printers shall be interfaced to a validation\nsystem. When a voucher is printed from the kiosk, the voucher on the validation\nsystem shall be updated to reflect a pending status. The voucher issuance kiosk\nshall receive all its validation information from the voucher validation\nsystem. The voucher validation system shall ensure that the correct information\nis sent to the issuance kiosk and the kiosk shall validate the incoming message\npackets through an error-checking mechanism before printing a voucher. When the\nvoucher printed by the kiosk is redeemed at a gaming device, cashiers' cage or\nkiosk, the system shall change the pending status of the voucher to redeemed\nstatus. (d) Promotional point\nredemption. Promotional point redemption defines the process of a patron\nredeeming promotional player points at the kiosk for cash or a voucher. The\nkiosk in this case is being used as an alternative to the current process of\nthe player approaching the gaming facility cage or player services desk to\nredeem their points. The kiosk in this case shall be interfaced only to an\napproved promotional system/gateway. This Part addresses the use of kiosks when\nredeeming player points for cash or voucher. This Part does not address the use\nof kiosks for redemption of player points for gaming facility merchandise\nand/or other services. (e) Information reporting. The kiosk may be used to display marketing information\nfor customers. This feature is not covered by this Part, as such displays do\nnot affect the integrity of kiosk security and/or accounting.
