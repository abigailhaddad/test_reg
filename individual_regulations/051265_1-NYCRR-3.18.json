  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.18 - Sanitary piping-Item 10p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All sanitary piping, fittings and connections which are exposed to milk, milk\nproducts, whey, condensed milk products or condensed whey, or from which\nliquids may drip, drain or be drawn into products, consist of smooth, impervious, corrosion-resistant, nontoxic, easily cleanable material. (b) All sanitary piping, connections and\nfittings consist of: (1)\nstainless steel of\nthe AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) 300 series; (2)\nequally corrosion-resistant metal which\nis nontoxic and nonabsorbent; or\n(3)\nheat-resistant glass, provided that\nplastic or rubber and rubberlike materials-which are relatively inert, resistant to scratching, scoring, decomposition, crazing, chipping and\ndistortion under normal use conditions; which are nontoxic, fat-resistant, relatively nonabsorbent; which do not impart flavor or odor to the products; and which maintain their original properties under repeated use conditions-may\nbe used for gaskets, sealing applications, and for short flexible takedown\njumpers or connections where flexibility is required for essential or\nfunctional reasons. (c) Sanitary piping, fittings and connections are designed to permit easy cleaning, kept in good repair and free of breaks or corrosion, and contain no dead ends\nof piping in which milk may collect. (d) All interior surfaces of demountable\npiping, including valves, fittings and connections, are designed, constructed\nand installed to permit inspection and drainage. (e) (1)\n\nAll\ncleaned-in-place milk pipelines and return-solution lines are rigid, self-draining, and so supported to maintain uniform slope and alignment. Return-solution lines shall be constructed of material meeting the\nspecifications of subdivision (b) of this section. If gaskets are used, they\nshall be self-positioning, of material meeting the specifications outlined in\nsubdivision (b), and designed, finished and applied to form a smooth, flush\ninterior surface. If gaskets are not used, all fittings shall have\nself-positioning faces designed to form a smooth, flush interior surface. All\ninterior surfaces of welded joints in pipelines shall be smooth and free from\npits, cracks or inclusions. (2)\n\nIn\nthe case of welded lines, the commissioner may require that the installer\nprovide a boroscope or other suitable inspection device to determine the\nacceptability of interior surfaces of welded lines. All welded surfaces shall\nbe approved by the commissioner. (3)\n\nEach cleaning circuit shall have access\npoints for inspection in addition to the entrances and exits. These may be\nvalves, removable sections, fittings or other means or combinations that are\nadequate for inspection of the interior of the line. These access points shall\nbe located at sufficient intervals to determine the general condition of the\ninterior surfaces of the line. (4)\n\nDetailed plans for welded pipeline systems shall be submitted to the\ncommissioner for written approval prior to installation. No alteration or\naddition shall be made to any welded milk pipeline system without prior written\napproval from the commissioner. (f) Milk, milk products, whey, condensed milk\nproducts and condensed whey are conducted from one piece of equipment to\nanother only through sanitary piping. (g) Because of the high pressure required to\nobtain proper dispersal of the product in the drying chamber, the pipeline\nbetween the high-pressure pump and the dryer nozzle may be connected with\npressure-tight threaded fittings or may be welded. (h) All stainless steel lines and vessels\nused to convey or store any of the products included in section\n2.1\nof this Part or any ingredients\nused in the manufacture of such products, cleaning solutions or water shall be\ncolor coded so as to provide easy identification of the material contained\ntherein. The following color coding scheme shall be used: Raw product lines\nred\n\nPasteurized product lines\nblue\n\nCleaning solution lines\ngreen\n\nWater lines (SS only)\nyellow\n\nSugar and dairy food ingredients\norange\n\nAdditional color coding of stainless steel lines to\ndenote ingredients of special products is permitted provided it does not\nduplicate the color coding scheme described above. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
