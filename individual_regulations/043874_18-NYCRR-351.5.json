  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 351.5 - Sources of information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Primary sources. The applicant, recipient, members of his/her household and public records must be relied upon\nas primary sources of information. Information received from applicants, recipients, and members of the household must be verified. The applicant or\nrecipient is required, wherever possible, to provide such verification by\ndocumentation. If the applicant or recipient has previously verified necessary\ninformation which is not subject to change and the social services district\npossesses documentation of such verification in its files, the applicant or\nrecipient is not required to resubmit verification of such information; provided, however, that such documentation may be required in connection with\nany State quality control review of social services district programs. When an\napplicant or recipient establishes that he/she has made reasonable efforts to\nobtain information or verification from a third party (other than a third party\nwho is required to be in the filing unit, or whose income is used in\ndetermining eligibility or an individual living in the household) and the third\nparty fails or refuses to provide the information or verification or seeks to\nimpose a charge or fee for providing the information to the applicant or\nrecipient, the social services official must pay such fee or must assist the\napplicant or recipient in obtaining the information or verification from the\nthird party or by other means as may be necessary. (b) Secondary and collateral sources and\ncollateral investigation. Secondary or collateral sources of information are\nrelatives outside the immediate family group, and other persons, agencies or\nresources. Collateral investigation means the collection of additional\ninformation through contacts with secondary sources such as relatives, employers, banks, insurance companies, school personnel, social agencies, and\nother appropriate individuals and organizations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n351.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
