Tit. 17 § 975.16 - Interest recovered on overpayments of state operating assistance\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the event that an audit of a public transportation\nsystem or private operator discloses the existence of an overpayment of state\noperating assistance, recovery will include interest on the amount of the\noverpayment in accordance with a rate to be established by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance in addition to recovering the amount of state operating\nassistance overpaid. The recovery of interest will be made in the case of an\noverpayment resulting from an audit of revenue passengers and revenue vehicle\nmile operating statistics and/or in the case of an audit of private operators\nwhere more than a reasonable return based on equity or operating revenues and\nexpenses has resulted. Interest will be calculated over a time period marked\nby: (1)\nthe estimated date of receipt\nby the system of the STOA overpayment (which will be identified as the date of\nthe State Comptroller's warrant, plus five more days for delivery); and\n(2)\nthe date of the Department\nletter which provides a final determination regarding a STOA overpayment. Interest will not be charged on any maximum profit overpayments discovered as\nan outgrowth of the normal, annual regulatory cap case.
