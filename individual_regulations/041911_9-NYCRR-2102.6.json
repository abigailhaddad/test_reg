  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2102.6 - Orders where the maximum rent or other facts are in dispute, in doubt, or not known, or where maximum rent must be fixed\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where the maximum rent or any fact\nnecessary to the determination of the maximum rent, or the dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment required to be provided\nwith the accommodation, is in dispute between the landlord and the tenant, or\nis in doubt, or is not known, or is prescribed by section\n2101.1\n(i) or (j)\nof this Title, the administrator at any time upon written request of either\nparty, or on his own initiative, may issue an order determining the facts\nincluding the amount of the maximum rent, the dwelling space, essential\nservices, furniture, furnishings and equipment, required to be provided with\nthe accommodations. Such order shall determine such facts or establish the\nmaximum rent as of May 1, 1950 or the date of first renting, whichever is\nlater, except where the maximum rent is prescribed by section\n2101.1\n(i) or (j)\nof this Title. Where such order establishes the maximum rent it may contain a\ndirective that all rent collected by the landlord in excess of the maximum rent\nestablished under this subdivision for a period not exceeding two years prior\nto the date of its issuance shall be refunded to the tenant within 30 days\nafter such order shall become final. Where the maximum rent is prescribed by\nsection\n2101.1\n(i) of this\n\nTitle, the administrator shall determine the date upon which the housing\naccommodations became subject to this Subchapter and establish the maximum rent\non the basis of the rent charged on January 1, 1957 or the date of first\nrenting, whichever is later. (b) Where the landlord has failed to file an application or report required by\nsection\n2102.5\n(a) and (b)\nof this Part, the administrator at any time upon written request of either\nparty, or on his own initiative, may issue an order establishing the maximum\nrent by decreasing the previous maximum rent of the housing accommodations by\nthat amount which the administrator finds to be the reduction in the rental\nvalue of the housing accommodations because of the decrease in dwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment. The administrator may\ntake into consideration all factors bearing on the equities involved. Such\norder shall establish the maximum rent as of the date of decrease of such\ndwelling space, essential services, furniture, furnishings or equipment or as\nof May 1, 1950, whichever is later, and may contain a directive that all rent\ncollected by the landlord in excess of the maximum rent established under this\nsubdivision for a period not exceeding two years prior to the date of its\nissuance shall be refunded to the tenant within 30 days after such order shall\nbecome final. (c) Where no\nregistration statement had been filed prior to May 1, 1950 under the Federal\n\nAct, or after that date as is required by this Subchapter, the administrator at\nany time upon written request of either party, or on his own initiative, may, when he cannot determine the maximum rent pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection, issue an order fixing a maximum rent which may be established on the\nbasis of the maximum rent for comparable housing accommodations. Where there\nare maximum rents in effect in the same establishment, these may be used as\ncomparable housing accommodations, in the discretion of the administrator. In\ncases of a change in the number of occupants or terms of occupancy in rooming\nhouses, the maximum rent may be established upon the basis of the amount by\nwhich the landlord has customarily varied his rent for such change in the\nnumber of occupants or terms of occupancy as reflected in the maximum rents in\neffect on March 1, 1950. Where the landlord has no customary variation the\nadministrator may issue an order fixing the maximum rent for such rooms, units\nor occupancy based upon the rental value of the change in occupancy or in terms\nof occupancy, after taking into consideration the previous maximum rent\ntherefor. The administrator may take into consideration all factors bearing on\nthe equities involved. Such order shall fix the maximum rent as of May 1, 1950, or the date of first renting, whichever is later, and may contain a directive\nthat all rent collected by the landlord in excess of the maximum rent\nestablished under this subdivision for a period not exceeding two years prior\nto the date of its issuance shall be refunded to the tenant within 30 days\nafter such order shall become final. (d) Where no proper or timely registration\nstatement has been filed as is required by this Subchapter, the administrator\nmay issue an order fixing a maximum rent on the basis of the maximum rents for\ncomparable housing accommodations, as set forth more specifically in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, after taking into consideration all other\nfactors bearing on the equities involved. Such order shall be effective as of\n\nMay 1, 1950, or the date of such first renting, whichever is later, and may\ncontain a directive that all rent collected by the landlord in excess of the\nmaximum rent established under this subdivision for a period not exceeding two\nyears prior to the date of its issuance shall be refunded to the tenant within\n30 days after such order shall become final, provided the administrator shall\nhave instituted a proceeding to establish such maximum rent by May 1, 1952, or\nwithin three months from the time of filing of such registration statement, whichever is later. If the administrator fails to institute a proceeding to\nestablish such maximum rent by May 1, 1952 or within three months from the time\nof filing of such registration statement, whichever is later, any order issued\nfixing the maximum rent under this subdivision shall be effective as of the\ndate of the issuance of the order. (e) Where it is necessary for the\nadministrator to determine whether an establishment which was a hotel on March\n1, 1950 is still a hotel, the administrator shall issue an order determining\nsuch fact. Where the administrator finds that an establishment is no longer a\nhotel, he shall issue orders fixing maximum rents for the housing\naccommodations within such establishment which were not subject to rent\ncontrol. The maximum rents so fixed shall be based upon the maximum rents for\ncomparable housing accommodations taking into consideration all factors bearing\nupon the equities. Such orders shall be effective as of the date of\nissuance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2102.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
