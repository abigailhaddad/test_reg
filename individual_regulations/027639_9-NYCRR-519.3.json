  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.3 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The\nauthority to impose non-judicial punishment charges a commander with the\nresponsibility of exercising his or her authority in an absolutely fair and\njudicious manner. (b) Preliminary\ninquiry. (See N.Y.R.C.M. 303)\n(1)\n\nThe\ncommander of the alleged offender must insure that the matter is promptly and\nadequately investigated. The commander may either investigate the matters\nhimself or delegate such responsibility to a subordinate. However, in the\nlatter case, the investigation should provide the commander with sufficient\ninformation to make an appropriate disposition of the incident. The\ninvestigation should cover: (i) whether an\noffense was committed; (ii)\nwhether\nthe member was involved; (iii)\nthe\ncharacter and military record of the member. (2)\n\nUsually the preliminary investigation is\ninformal and consists of interviews with witnesses and/or a review of police or\nother informative reports. If, after the preliminary inquiry, the commander\ndetermines that the member has committed an offense and that non-judicial\npunishment is appropriate (see N.Y.R.C.M. 306, para c[3]), the commander should\ntake action as set forth in this section. (c) Commander's guide for notification and\nimposition. In all cases, other than summarized proceedings, commanders should\nuse Appendix L-2 (A15) as a guide in conducting the proceedings. (d) Proceedings, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2\n[A16]). (1)\n\nAll entries will be recorded on\nDMNANG form 1057 (Record of Proceedings under section\n130.15\nof the New York\n\nState Military Law, Appendix L-12 [A16]). DMNA form 1057 may be reproduced\nlocally on 8 1/2\" x 11\" paper. (2)\n\nNotification and explanation of rights. (i) The imposing commander will ensure that the member is notified of the\ncommander's intention to dispose of the matter under the provisions of section\n130.15, State Military Code. The member will be provided a copy of DMNA form\n1057 (Appendix L-2 [A16]) with items (1) and (2) completed, including the date\nand signature of the imposing commander. The imposing commander may authorize a\ncommissioned officer, warrant officer, or NCO (E-7 or above), provided such\nperson is senior to the member being notified, to deliver the DMNA form 1057\nand inform the member of his or her rights. The NCO performing the notification\nshould be the unit First Sergeant. In such cases, the notifier should follow\n\nAppendix L-2(A15), modified as required. The member should be provided with a\ncopy of DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2 [A16]) and supporting documents and\nstatements, for use during the proceedings. The member will return the copy to\nthe commander for annotation. It will be given to the member for retention when\nall proceedings are completed. (ii)\n\nRight to remain silent. The member will be informed that: (a) he or she is not required to make any\nstatement regarding the offense or offenses of which he or she is suspected; and\n(b) any statement made may be\nused against him or her in the section\n130.15, Military Law proceeding or in\nany other proceedings, including a trial by court-martial. (iii)\n\nRight to counsel. The member will be\ninformed of the right to consult with military counsel prior to the proceedings\nand be informed of the location of military counsel. (iv)\n\nOther rights. The member will be\ninformed of the right to: (a) fully present\nhis or her case in the presence, except in rare circumstances, of the imposing\ncommander (see subparagraph [vi] of this paragraph); (b) call witnesses; (c) present evidence; (d) request he or she be accompanied by a\nspokesperson; (e) request an open\nproceeding (see clause (vi)(b) of this paragraph); (f) examine available evidence. (v) Decision period. The member\nwill be given a reasonable time to consult with counsel, including time off\nfrom duty, if necessary, and to gather matters in defense, extenuation and/or\nmitigation. Normally, 48 hours is a reasonable decision period, during periods\nof annual training, FTTD, orders under Title 32, section 502(f), State Active\n\nDuty, and other periods of extended duty. If the member is in an inactive duty\ntraining (IDT) status, normally the member should be given until the next\nregularly scheduled drill. If a new imposing commander takes command after a\nmember has been notified of the original imposing commander's intent to impose\npunishment, the member will be notified of the change. (vi)\n\nProceeding. (a) In the presence of the commander. The\nmember will be allowed to personally present matters in defense, extenuation, or mitigation in the presence of the imposing commander, except when, under\nrare circumstances it is not feasible. When personal appearance is requested, but is not possible, the imposing commander will appoint an officer to conduct\nthe proceeding and make recommendations. (b) Open proceeding. Section\n130.15, Military\n\nLaw proceedings are open. However, a member may request an open or closed\nhearing. In all cases, the imposing commander will, after considering all of\nthe facts and circumstances, determine whether the proceeding will be open to\nthe public, but does not require the commander to hold the proceeding in a\nlocation different from that in which he or she conducts normal business; i.e., his or her office. (vii)\n\nSpokesperson. The person who may accompany the member to the section\n130.15\nproceeding and who speaks on his or her behalf need not be a lawyer. An\noffender has no right to legal counsel at the non-judicial proceeding, however, the commander may allow such representation in the proceeding based upon his\ndiscretion. A member may retain civilian counsel to act as his or her\nspokesperson, at no cost to the government; but the commander need not grant a\ndelay for the appearance of any spokesperson, to include civilian counsel so\nretained. No travel fees or any other unusual costs may be incurred at\ngovernment expense for the presence of the spokesperson. The spokesperson's\npresence is voluntary. Because the proceedings are not adversarial in nature, neither the member or the spokesperson (including any attorney present on\nbehalf of the member) may examine or cross-examine witnesses, unless permitted\nby the imposing commander. The member or spokesperson may, however, indicate to\nthe imposing commander relevant issues or questions he or she wishes to explore\nor ask. Notwithstanding this paragraph, examination and cross-examination\nshould be permitted by the commander when reduction or fine is a permissible\npenalty. (viii)\n\nWitnesses. The\nmember's request for witnesses in defense, extenuation or mitigation shall be\nrestricted to those witnesses reasonably available as determined by the\nimposing commander. To determine whether a witness is reasonably available, the\nimposing commander will consider the fact that neither witness fees nor\ntransportation fees are authorized. Reasonably available witnesses will\nordinarily include only personnel at the unit or the installation concerned and\nothers whose attendance will not unnecessarily delay the proceeding. (ix)\n\nEvidence. The imposing commander is not\nbound by the formal rules of evidence before courts-martial and may consider\nany matter, including unsworn statements, he or she reasonably believes to be\nrelevant to the offense. (x) Action\nterminating proceedings. If, after evaluation of all pertinent matters, the\nimposing commander determines that non-judicial punishment is not warranted, the member will be notified that the proceedings have been terminated and all\ncopies of DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]) will be destroyed. (xi)\n\nImposition of punishment. If the\nimposing commander determines, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the member has\ncommitted an offense and decides to impose punishment, ordinarily he or she\nwill announce the punishment to the member. The commander may, if he or she\ndesires to do so, explain to the member why a particular punishment was\nimposed. (xii)\n\nRight to appeal. Appellate rights and procedures, which are available to the member will be\nexplained in section\n519.6\nof this Part. (e) No right to demand trial. New York Army\n\nNational Guard personnel, whether on orders under Title 32, United States Code\nor State active duty under the New York State Military Law may not demand trial\nby court-martial in lieu of non-judicial punishment. This subdivision is not\napplicable to officers and warrant officers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
