  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10§ 2.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nDefinitions shall include the following: (a) For public health reporting purposes, hospital-associated infections shall include an outbreak or increased incidence of disease due to microbiological agents or their toxic products occurring in patients or persons working in the hospital. Any non-reportable hospital-associated infections must be handled nonetheless by hospitals and their infection control committees. (b) A case is defined as a person who has been diagnosed to have a particular disease or condition. The diagnosis may be based solely on clinical judgment or solely on laboratory evidence, or on both criteria. (c) A suspected case is defined as a person who has been diagnosed as likely to have a particular disease or condition. The suspected diagnosis may be based solely on signs and symptoms, or solely on laboratory evidence, or both criteria. (d) An outbreak is defined as an increased incidence of disease above its expected or baseline level. As the number of cases which indicate the presence of an outbreak vary according to the infectious agent, size and type of population exposed, previous exposure or lack of exposure to the disease, and time and place of occurrence, the expected or baseline level of disease shall be assessed by hospitals and their infection control committees as directed in section\n405.11\nof this Title.
