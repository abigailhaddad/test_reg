  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-7.5 - Method of payment for medical care\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraphs (2) through (4) of this subdivision, payment\nby the MA program for services covered under the program which are medically\nnecessary in amount, duration, and scope, will be made to the enrolled MA\nprovider which furnished the services, at the MA rate or fee in effect at the\ntime the services were provided. (2)\n\nPayment may be made to: (i) a practitioner's employer if the\npractitioner would be required to do so as a condition of employment; (ii)\nthe facility in which such services were\nprovided if the facility submits the claim under a contract between a\npractitioner and the facility; or\n(iii)\nan organization, including a health\nmaintenance organization, which furnishes health care through an organized\nhealth care delivery system, if there is a contract between the organization\nand the practitioner under which the organization bills or receives payment for\nthe services. (3)\n(i) Payment may be made to a recipient or the\nrecipient's representative for paid medical bills if: (a) an erroneous MA eligibility determination\nis reversed (whether the reversal is due to the social services district\ndiscovering its own error or is the result of a fair hearing decision or court\norder), or the social services district fails to determine MA eligibility\nwithin the time periods set forth in section\n360-2.4\nof this Part; and\n(b) the erroneous eligibility\ndetermination or the delay in determining eligibility caused the recipient or\nthe recipient's representative to pay for medically necessary services which\notherwise would have been paid for by the MA program. (ii)\n\nPayment under this paragraph is not\nlimited to the MA rate or fee in effect at the time the services were provided, but may be made to reimburse the recipient's or the recipient's\nrepresentative's reasonable out-of-pocket expenditures. In addition, payment\nunder this paragraph may be made with respect to services furnished by a\nprovider who is not enrolled in the MA program, if such provider is otherwise\nlawfully qualified to provide the services, and had not been excluded or\notherwise sanctioned from the MA program under Part 515 of this\n\nTitle. (iii)\n\nFor purposes of\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, an out-of-pocket expenditure will be\nconsidered reasonable if it does not exceed 110 percent of the MA payment rate\nfor the service. If an out-of-pocket expenditure exceeds 110 percent of the MA\npayment rate, the social services district will determine whether the\nexpenditure is reasonable. In making this determination, the district may\nconsider the prevailing private pay rate in the community at the time services\nwere rendered, and any special circumstances demonstrated by the\nrecipient. (4)\n\nPayment\nmay be made to a recipient or the recipient's representative for paid medical\nbills for services received during the recipient's retroactive eligibility\nperiod, provided that the recipient was eligible in the month in which the\nservices were received, in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph. (i) For services received during the period\nbeginning on the first day of the third month prior to the month of the MA\napplication and ending on the date the recipient applied for MA, payment can be\nmade without regard to whether the provider of services was enrolled in the MA\nprogram. However, if the services were furnished by a provider not enrolled in\nthe MA program, the provider must have been otherwise lawfully qualified to\nprovide such services, and must not have been excluded or otherwise sanctioned\nfrom the MA program under Part 515 of this Title. If services were provided\nwhen the recipient was temporarily absent from the State, payment will be made\nif: MA recipients customarily use medical facilities in the other state; or the\nservices were obtained to treat an emergency medical condition resulting from\nan accident or sudden illness. (ii)\n\nFor services received during the period beginning after the date the recipient\napplied for MA and ending on the date the recipient received his or her MA\nidentification card, payment may be made only if the services were furnished by\na provider enrolled in the MA program. (b) The claim of any provider of medical\ncare, services, or supplies assigned under a power of attorney or otherwise, is\ninvalid and cannot be enforced against a social services district. However, an\nassignment from a supplier to a governmental agency or entity or an assignment\nestablished under a court order is valid. (c) A provider of medical care, services, or\nsupplies may employ a business agent, such as a billing service or an\naccounting firm. Such agent may prepare and send bills and receive MA payments\nin the name of the provider only if the compensation paid to the agent is: (1)\nreasonably related to the cost of the\nservices; (2)\nunrelated, directly\nor indirectly, to the dollar amounts billed and collected; and\n(3)\nnot dependent on actual collection of\npayments. (d) A social\nservices district may use any appropriate organization as a fiscal intermediary\nto audit and pay for the district's share of the cost of medical care, services\nand supplies provided to recipients. An appropriate organization is any\ninsurance carrier authorized to conduct audits and make payments to providers\nwho furnish services under Medicare. A social services district must enter into\nan agreement with the organization that meets the requirements of this\nprovision and other appropriate Federal authorities. The department must\napprove the agreement before the organization can be used as a fiscal\nintermediary. (e) Payment for a\nrecipient's transportation costs will be made to the vendor. If payment cannot\nbe made directly to the vendor, it will be made to the recipient as an\nadministrative expense. When the services of an attendant are essential, payment for the attendant's transportation costs will be made to the vendor. If\npayment cannot be made directly to the vendor, payment will be made to the\nattendant as an administrative expense. (f) Payment for home health aide services\nwill be made in the same manner as payment for any other medical care provided\nunder the MA program. (g) Payment\nor part-payment of the premium for personal health insurance covering care and\nother medical benefits which are authorized under the MA program may be made to\nthe insurance carrier or to another appropriate third party: (1)\non behalf of MA households eligible for\nADC, HR or extended MA coverage pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of section\n360-3.3\n(c) of\nthis Part, for cost-effective, employer-sponsored group health insurance\nbenefits. Such premiums will be paid for the benefit of the recipient's spouse\nand dependent children. Non-employer health insurance will be paid, in part or\nin full, when it would reduce the expense of providing MA services; (2)\non behalf of a recipient if the recipient\nis receiving MA as a patient in a medical facility and all the recipient's\nnonexempt income except that expended for the cost of such insurance, is\napplied to the cost of his/her care; or\n(3)\non behalf of a recipient or household\nwhich is eligible for MA if the full cost of such insurance premiums was not\nused in calculating financial eligibility and if full or partial payment would\nreduce the expense of providing MA services. (h) Payment of the COBRA premiums for COBRA\ncontinuation coverage, as defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, will be\nmade by the MA program on behalf of a person described in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision.

(3)\n\nWhen determining the eligibility of a\nperson for payment of the COBRA premiums under this subdivision, the social\nservices district must: (i) use the Federal\nSSI eligibility requirements relating to income and resources; and\n(ii)\nnot consider costs that the person or\nthe person's household has incurred for medical or remedial care. (4)\n(i) The MA program will pay the COBRA\npremiums on behalf of a person who has applied to have the program pay for such\npremiums and who the social services district reasonably expects will meet the\neligibility requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision but for whom the\nsocial services district has not yet received documentation verifying whether\nthe person is eligible for MA payment of his or her COBRA premiums. (ii)\n\nWhen the social services district\nreceives such documentation and determines that such person does not meet the\neligibility requirements of paragraph (2) of this subdivision: (a) the MA program's payment of the person's\nCOBRA premiums will terminate; (b) the person may request a fair hearing pursuant to Part 358 of this Title to\nreview the social services district's determination that he or she is\nineligible for the MA program's payment of his or her COBRA premiums; however, the person will not be entitled to aid continuing; and\n(c) the social services district may request\nthat the person repay the amount of the MA program's payments for his or her\nCOBRA premiums unless a fair hearing decision has held that the social services\ndistrict's determination was incorrect.

The notice must advise\nthe person of his or her right to request a fair hearing and of any aid\ncontinuing rights in accordance with Part 358 of this Title.
