  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4009.21 - Refund-non-starter\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen a horse starts. Every horse shall be considered a\nstarter when the stall gates open on the signal of the starter, unless the\nstewards declare a horse or horses non-starters because, in their opinion, the\nhorses' chances were compromised leaving the starting gate. If so, all bets on\nthe non-starters will be refunded unless the horse wins. For placing and\nprogram purposes, the non-starters will be considered to have run for purse\nonly. If it be determined by the stewards that a horse is declared a\nnon-starter, the money bet on the horse shall be refunded; if such horse is\npart of an entry or field, such circumstances shall be treated as a scratch for\nwagering as provided in section\n4009.20\nof this Part, notwithstanding the placing of any remaining part of the entry or\nfield. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4009.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
