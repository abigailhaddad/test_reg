Any person who applies such horizontal\nforce to a scaffold platform while he is located on any portion of the building\nor other structure at a point more than 10 feet above the ground, grade or\nequivalent surface shall be provided with and shall use an approved safety belt\nwith a lifeline in compliance with this Part (rule).

Such planking shall be either nailed in place or otherwise secured\nagainst displacement. Where such planks rest directly upon stirrups without any\nintermediate supporting frames, they shall be secured together by means of\ncleats nailed to the undersides at intervals not exceeding four feet. Cleats or\nother equivalent means shall be provided on each side of the supporting\nstirrups under the planks to prevent sliding or any movement of the\nplanks. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
