  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-9.5 - Determination of adjusted base proportions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The legislative body of each special\nassessing unit shall establish adjusted base proportions to be applied in the\nlevy of taxes pursuant to section\n1803-a\nof the Real Property Tax Law. For\neach class in the special assessing unit or portion thereof, the adjusted base\nproportion shall be the current base proportion adjusted for physical or\nquantity changes, changes in exemption or changes in class designations that\nhave occurred subsequent to the taxable status date of the reference roll as\nprovided herein. (b) The\nlegislative body may establish a procedure, subject to the approval of ORPTS, for making these adjustments. Where no locally applicable procedure has been\nestablished or approved when the adjusted base proportions are certified, the\nlegislative body shall adjust the current base proportions in the following\nmanner: (1)\nA change in level of assessment\nfactor shall be computed for each class and each portion class as follows: (i) Determine the physical or quantity\ndecrease for the class or portion class by summing the decreases due to\nphysical or quantity changes in the class or portion class, excluding special\nfranchise properties in class three, from the reference roll to the levy\nroll; (ii)\n\nDetermine the surviving\ntotal assessed value of the class or portion class by subtracting the physical\nor quantity decrease so determined from the total assessed value of the class\nor portion class, excluding special franchise properties in class three, on the\nreference roll; (iii)\n\nDetermine the\nnet equalization change of the class or portion class by separately summing the\nincreases and decreases for equalization, excluding special franchise\nproperties in class three, and subtracting the sum of the decreases from the\nsum of the increases; (iv)\n\nDetermine the change in level of assessment factor by dividing the net\nequalization change by the surviving total assessed value of the class or\nportion class, expressing the quotient to at least four places to the right of\nthe decimal point, and adding one to the quotient so determined. (2)\n\nThe taxable assessed value of\nthe property on the levy roll, at the reference roll level of assessment, shall\nbe computed for each class and portion class as follows: (i) Divide the taxable assessed value of the\nproperty in the class or portion class on the levy roll, excluding special\nfranchise properties in class three, by the appropriate change in level of\nassessment factor. (ii)\n\nFor class\nthree, add to the quotient so determined the taxable assessed value of any\nspecial franchise properties in the class or portion class on the levy roll, at\nthe reference roll level of assessment. Such taxable assessed value shall be\ncomputed by ORPTS and provided to the legislative body of the special assessing\nunit no later than five days before the last date provided by law for the\nfiling of the levy roll or 30 days prior to the last date provided by law for\nthe levy of taxes, whichever is sooner. The provisions of Part 8197 of this\n\nTitle shall apply to the extent practicable to the computation of such taxable\nassessed value; provided, however, that the inventory to be valued shall be the\ninventory applicable to the levy roll, but the valuation standard and State\nequalization rate to be applied shall be the same as if the property were being\nassessed for the reference roll. (3)\n\nAn adjustment factor for class quantity\nchanges shall be computed for each class and portion class by dividing (i) the\ntaxable assessed value of the class or portion class on the levy roll, at the\nreference roll level of assessment (i.e., the taxable assessed value determined\npursuant to the preceding paragraph), by (ii) the taxable assessed value of the\nclass or portion class on the reference roll, including special franchise\nproperties in class three. (4)\n\nThe\nadjusted base proportions for the special assessing unit and each portion\nthereof shall be computed as follows: (i) Multiply the current base proportion of each class or portion class by the\nappropriate adjustment factor. (ii)\n\nSum the products so determined. If the sum is not 1.0000 for the special\nassessing unit or portion thereof, divide each class product by such\nsum. (c) The\nsum of the adjusted base proportions for the special assessing unit or portion\nthereof must equal one and each adjusted base proportion must be expressed as a\npercentage to at least four places to the right of the decimal point.
