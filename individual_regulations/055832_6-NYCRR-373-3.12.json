  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.12 - Waste piles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that treat or place hazardous waste in piles, except as\nsection\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. Alternatively, a pile of hazardous waste may be\nmanaged as a landfill under section\n373-3.14\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) Protection from wind. The owner or operator of a pile containing hazardous\nwaste which could be subject to dispersal by wind must cover or otherwise\nmanage the pile so that wind dispersal is controlled. (c) Waste analysis. In addition to the waste analyses required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must analyze a representative sample of waste\nfrom each incoming movement before adding the waste to any existing pile, unless: (1)\nthe only wastes the\nfacility receives which are amenable to piling are compatible with each other; or\n(2)\nthe waste received is\ncompatible with the waste in the pile to which it is to be added. The analysis\nconducted must be capable of differentiating between the types of hazardous\nwaste the owner or operator places in piles, so that the mixing of incompatible\nwaste does not inadvertently occur. The analysis must include a visual\ncomparison of color and texture. Note: As required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with\nsubdivisions (e) and (f) of this section. As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must place the results of this analysis in the\noperating record of the facility. (d) Containment. If leachate or runoff from a pile is a hazardous waste, then either: (1)\n(i) the pile must be placed on an impermeable\nbase that is compatible with the waste under the conditions of treatment or\nstorage; (ii)\nthe owner or operator\nmust design, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of\npreventing flow onto the active portion of the pile during peak discharge from\nat least a 25-year storm; (iii)\nthe\nowner or operator must design, operate and maintain a runoff management system\nto collect and control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year storm; and\n(iv)\ncollection\nand holding facilities (\ne.g., tanks or basins) associated with\nrun-on and runoff control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed\nexpeditiously after storms to maintain design capacity of the system; or\n(2)\n(i) the pile must be protected from\nprecipitation and run-on by some other means; and\n(ii)\nno liquids or wastes containing free\nliquids may be placed in the pile. Note: If collected leachate or runoff is discharged through a\npoint source to waters of New York State, it is subject to the requirements of\narticle 17 of the ECL. (e) Special requirements for ignitable\nor reactive waste. (1)\n\nIgnitable or\nreactive wastes must not be placed in a pile, unless the waste and the pile\nsatisfy all applicable requirements of Part 376 of this Title, and: (i) addition of the waste to an existing\npile: (a) results in the waste or mixture no\nlonger meeting the definition of ignitable or reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(ii)\nthe waste is managed in such a way that\nit is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or\nreact. (f) Special requirements for incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible wastes, or incompatible\nwastes and materials (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples)\nmust not be placed in the same pile, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\nA pile of hazardous waste that is incompatible with any waste or other material\nplaced nearby in other containers, piles, open tanks or surface impoundments\nmust be separated from the other materials, or protected from them by means of\na dike, berm, wall or other device. Comment: The purpose of this is to prevent fires, explosions, gaseous emissions, leaching, or other discharge of hazardous waste or hazardous\nwaste constituents which could result from the contact or mixing of\nincompatible wastes or materials. (3)\n\nHazardous waste must not be piled on the\nsame area where incompatible wastes or materials were previously piled, unless\nthat area has been decontaminated sufficiently to ensure compliance with\nsection\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (g) Closure and post-closure care. (1)\n\nAt closure, the owner or operator must\nremove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system\ncomponents (liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment\ncontaminated with waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless\nsection\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies; or\n(2)\n\nIf, after removing or decontaminating all residues and making all reasonable\nefforts to effect removal or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures and equipment as required in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, the owner or operator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can\nbe practicably removed or decontaminated, the owner or operator must close the\nfacility and perform post-closure care in accordance with the closure and post-\nclosure requirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-3.14\n[d]\nof\nthis Subpart). (h) Design and operating requirements. The owner or operator of each new waste pile unit on\nwhich contruction commences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a\nwaste pile unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992, and each\nreplacement of an existing waste pile unit that is to commence reuse after July\n29, 1992 must install two or more liners and a leachate collection and removal\nsystem above and between such liners, and operate the leachate collection and\nremoval systems, in accordance with section\n373-2.12\n(b)(3), unless exempted under section\n373-2.12\n(b)(4), (5), or (6) of this Part; and must comply\nwith the procedures of section\n373-3.11\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. Construction commences\nis as defined in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle under\nexisting facility. (i) Action leakage rate. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of waste pile units\nsubject to section\n373-3.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart must submit a proposed action leakage rate to the commissioner\nwhen submitting the notice required under section\n373-3.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart. Within 60 days of receipt of the notification, the commissioner\nwill: establish an action leakage rate, either as proposed by the owner or\noperator or modified using the criteria in this subdivision; or extend the\nreview period for up to 30 days. If no action is taken by the commissioner\nbefore the original 60 or extended 90 day review period ends, the action\nleakage rate will be approved as proposed by the owner or operator. (2)\n\nThe commissioner shall approve an action\nleakage rate for waste pile units subject to section\n373-3.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart. The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the\nleak detection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom\nliner exceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate\nsafety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design (\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed\nresponse actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate must allow for\ndecreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation\nand clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.). (3)\n\nTo\ndetermine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator\nmust convert the weekly flow rate from the monitoring data obtained under\nsection\n373-3.12\n(k) of\nthis Subpart, to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each\nsump. Unless the commissioner approves a different calculation, the average\ndaily flow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life\nand closure period. (j) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner\nor operator of waste pile units subject to subdivision (h) of this section must\ndevelop and keep on-site, until closure of the facility a response action plan. The response action plan must set forth the actions to be taken if the action\nleakage rate has been exceeded. At a minimum, the response action plan must\ndescribe the actions specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nIf the flow rate into the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator\nmust: (i) notify the commissioner in writing\nof the exceedence within seven days of the determination; (ii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment\nto the commissioner within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of\nliquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any\nleaks, and short-term actions taken and planned; (iii)\ndetermine, to the extent practicable, the location, size, and cause of any leak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste receipts should\ncease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for\ninspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit should be\nclosed; (v) determine any other\nshort-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days after the\nnotification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the\ncommissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraphs (iii)\nthrough (v) of this paragraph, the results of actions taken, and actions\nplanned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to\nthe commissioner a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken\nand actions planned. (3)\n\nTo make the leak and/or remediation determinations in subparagraphs (2)(iii)\nthrough (v) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts of liquids by source; (b) conduct a finger print, hazardous\nconstituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the leak detection system to\nidentify the source of liquids and possible location of any leaks, and the\nhazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assesments are not\nneeded. (k) Monitoring and inspection. An owner or operator required to have a leak detection\nsystem under section\n373-3.12\n(h) of\nthis Subpart must record the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection\nsystem sump at least once each week during the active life and closure\nperiod.
