  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1000.12 - Evidence and proof\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Evidence. (1)\n\nThe presiding examiner shall require\nparties proposing to litigate issues in the proceeding to provide a list of\nspecific issues they propose to litigate, in advance of or at an issues\nconference, along with a sufficient explanation of why litigation is necessary\nfor each such issue. All issues to be litigated must be relevant. Issues and\nevidence are relevant if they assist the board in making the required findings\npursuant to PSL section 168(2) and the required determinations pursuant to PSL\nsection 168(3) including the considerations required by PSL section\n168(4). (2)\n\nAll evidence submitted\nmust be relevant and material. Evidence is material if it has the reasonable\npotential to affect the outcome of the board's findings or determinations under\nPSL section 168. (3)\n\nAlthough\nrelevant, evidence may be excluded if its value as proof is substantially\noutweighed by a potential for unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue\ndelay, or it is needlessly repetitious or duplicative. The presiding examiner\nmay also preclude irrelevant, repetitive, redundant or immaterial evidence and\nirrelevant or unduly repetitious cross-examination. (4)\n\nAll rules of privilege will be\nobserved. (5)\n\nOther rules of\nevidence need not be strictly applied. Hearsay evidence may be admitted if a\nreasonable degree of reliability is shown. (6)\n\nWhere a part of a document is offered as\nevidence by one party, any party may offer the entire document as evidence or\nthe presiding examiner may require the entire document to be submitted as\nevidence. (7)\n\nAny party may move\nthat evidence, including records and documents, in the possession of the DPS, or other public records, be received in evidence in the form of copies or\nexcerpts or by incorporation by reference. (8)\n\nRecords or documents incorporated by\nreference will be available for examination by the parties before being\nreceived in evidence. (9)\n\nBriefs\nand other documents that attempt to persuade through argument are not evidence\nand may not be entered into the evidentiary record of a proceeding. (10)\n\nAny party may move that official notice\nbe taken of: (i) facts of which judicial\nnotice could be taken pursuant to rule 4511 of the Civil Practice Law and\n\nRules; and\n(ii)\nother facts within\nthe specialized knowledge of the board. (11)\n\nWhen official notice is taken of a\nmaterial fact of which judicial notice could not be taken and that does not\nappear in the evidence in the record, every party will be given notice thereof\nand will, on timely request, be afforded an opportunity to dispute such fact or\nits materiality prior to a decision granting or denying a\ncertificate. (b) Burden\nof proof. (1)\n\nThe applicant has the burden of\nproof to demonstrate that all findings and determinations required by section\n168 of the PSL can be made by the board, and after the board's jurisdiction has\nceased, that all determinations required by the commission may be\nmade. (2)\n\nThe burden of proof to\nsustain a motion is on the party making the motion. (c) Standard of proof. Whenever factual\nmatters are involved, the party bearing the burden of proof must sustain that\nburden by a preponderance of the evidence unless a higher standard has been\nestablished by statute or regulation.
