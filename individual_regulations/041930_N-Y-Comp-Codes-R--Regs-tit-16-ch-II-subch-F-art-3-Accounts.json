(D)\n\nSubdivisions of this account shall be maintained so that it will be possible to\nshow materials and supplies which are held primarily for use in electric\noperations, those held for merchandise operations (see note C below), those\nheld primarily for use in other classes of operations, those held for sale, and\nthose which because of their nature can not be identified with any one of the\nfour foregoing purposes.

Miscellaneous Current Liabilities\n\nThis account shall include all current and accrued\nliabilities not includible in any of the foregoing accounts. (See §\n197.5.)\n\nReserves\n\nSection\n261.

[a][13]) of operating\nproperty (see also §\n197.7\n). It shall also be credited\nwith any amounts which the utility may charge to account 514, Miscellaneous\n\nDebits to Surplus, or transfer to this account for depreciation accrued but not\nprovided for prior to the effective date of this system of accounts. (B)\n\nAt the time of retirement of depreciable\noperating property this account shall be charged with the book cost of the\nproperty retired and the cost of removal, and shall be credited with the\nsalvage value (see §\n196.1, subd. [a][37]) and amounts\nrecovered as insurance or otherwise. It shall be credited with amounts\nchargeable upon order of the commission to account 143, Suspense to be\n\nAmortized as provided in subdivision (f) of section\n197.23. (C)\n\nThis account shall be subdivided so as to\nshow separately the amount applicable to each operating department. (D)\n\nFor ledger and balance sheet purposes the\ndepreciation reserves applicable to Operating Property-Electric and Operating\n\nProperty-General, respectively, shall be regarded and treated as single\ncomposite reserves. For purposes of analysis, however, each utility shall\nmaintain subsidiary records in which each of these reserves is broken down into\ncomponent parts corresponding to the classes, or subdivisions thereof, of\ndepreciable property (see §\n197.7, subd. [c]). These\nsubsidiary records shall show the current credits and debits to the reserves by\nsuch classes, or subdivisions thereof, of depreciable electric property in\nsufficient detail to show separately for each class (1) cost of operating\nproperty retired, (2) cost of removal, (3) salvage, (4) other items, including\nrecoveries from insurance. (E)\n\nWhen\ntransfers of operating property are made from one operating department to\nanother or from or to non-operating property, the accounting shall be as\nprovided in section\n197.34. Note: The utility is restricted in its use of the reserve to the\npurposes set forth above.

(See §\n197.7, subd. [b][2].)\n(B)\n\nThis account shall be concurrently\ncredited with amounts charged to account 514, Miscellaneous Debits to Surplus, to provide a reserve for the amortization of intangible property which does not\nhave a terminable life. (C)\n\nWhen\nany water right, leasehold, franchise, consent, privilege, or patent expires, is sold or relinquished, or is otherwise retired from service, this account\nshall be charged with the amount previously credited hereto in respect of such\nproperty. The difference between the proceeds realized and the book value (see\n§\n196.1, subd. [a][6]) of the\nproperty retired shall be charged or credited to account 790, Amortization of\n\nIntangible Property. (D)\n\nRecords\nshall be maintained so as to show separately the balances applicable to each\nitem of intangible property which is being amortized. (E)\n\nThis account shall be credited with such\namounts as are necessary to reflect, as of the effective date of this system of\naccounts, the expired portion of the life of franchises, consents, patent\nrights, leaseholds, easements, rights of way, and other interests in land, or\nother intangible property which has a terminable life, the cost of which is\nincluded in operating property. To the extent that provision has not previously\nbeen made, the amounts credited to this reserve shall be concurrently debited\nto Surplus. Note: The utility is restricted in its use of the reserve to the\npurposes set forth above. It shall not divert any portion of the reserve to\n\nSurplus or make any other use thereof without the approval of the\ncommission. Section\n263.

The records shall\nbe kept so that the amount of the contribution and description of property to\nwhich it specifically relates will be readily available. (B)\n\nThis account shall include any\ncontributions or payments made by consumers in connection with the installation\nof services the cost of which is included in operating property. (C)\n\nDebits (other than correction of errors)\nshall be made to this account only when contributions are repaid.

(B)\n\nWhen liability for any injury or damage\nis admitted by the utility either voluntarily or because of the decision of a\ncourt or other lawful authority, such as a workmen's compensation board, the\namount awarded shall be charged to this account. If such a liability is to be\ndischarged over a period in excess of one year, the amount thereof shall be\ncredited to account 233, Miscellaneous Long Term Debt; if payment is to be made\nin less than one year, to account 252, Miscellaneous Current Liabilities.

Section 267. Miscellaneous\n\nReserves\n\nThis account shall include amounts reserved by the utility\nfor purposes which are not provided for in any of the preceding reserve\naccounts, including amounts reserved for depreciation of non- operating\nproperty. Note: A separate subdivision shall be set up in respect of each\nsuch reserve, and the utility may be required to show a complete analysis\nthereof in its annual reports to the commission. Deferred Credits\n\nSection 271. Unamortized Premium on\n\nDebt\n\nThis account shall include all credit balances representing\nthe excess of the premium over the discount and expense in connection with the\nissuance of each class of the utility's long term debt. Separate subdivisions\nshall be maintained in respect of each issue of obligations. (See §\n197.9.)\n\nNote: If in connection with an individual issue of debt the\nexpenses incurred exceed the premium realized, the net debit balance shall be\ncarried in account 141, Unamortized Debt Discount and Expense. Section 272. Miscellaneous Unadjusted\n\nCredits\n\nThis account shall include the credit balances in suspense\naccounts that can not be entirely cleared and disposed of until additional\ninformation is received.

(See also §\n197.33.) If the balance is a debit\nit shall be shown in the short column and below it the balance in account 281, Surplus, and the net figure shall be carried to the liability side of the\nbalance sheet.
