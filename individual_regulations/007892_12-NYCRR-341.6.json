Tit. 12 § 341.6 - Duties of superseding podiatrist\n\nState Regulations\nA podiatrist authorized to treat workers' compensation\ncases, when requested to supersede another podiatrist or a physician, must\nbefore beginning treatment, make reasonable effort to communicate with the\nattending podiatrist or the physician to ascertain the patient's condition and\nwhether or not there is any injury or disease affecting any part of the body\nother than the foot. The superseding podiatrist must also advise the attending\npodiatrist or physician of the name of the person who has requested him to\nassume care of the case and state the reason therefor. If the superseding\npodiatrist cannot contact the attending physician or podiatrist and the\nclaimant's condition is such as to require immediate treatment of the foot, the\nsuperseding podiatrist should advise the podiatrist or physician previously in\nattendance, within 48 hours, that he or she now has the patient in his or her\ncare, and send a copy of such notice to the carrier and to the chair. The\npreceding podiatrist or physician shall supply the superceding podiatrist or\nphysician with a complete history of the case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n341.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
