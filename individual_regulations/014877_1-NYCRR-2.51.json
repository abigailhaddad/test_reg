  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.51 - Capping-item 19p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) capping or\nclosing of milk and milk product containers is done in a sanitary manner using\napproved mechanical capping/closing equipment. The term approved mechanical\ncapping and/or closing equipment shall not exclude manually operated machinery. Hand-capping shall be prohibited; provided that, if suitable mechanical\nequipment for the capping or closing of specific container(s) of three gallons\nor more is not available, other methods which eliminate all possibility of\ncontamination may be approved by the regulatory agency. (b) All mechanical capping or closure\nmechanisms are designed to minimize the need for adjustment during\noperation. (c) Bottles and packages\nwhich have been imperfectly capped or closed are emptied immediately into\napproved sanitary containers. Such milk or milk products shall be protected\nfrom contamination, maintained at 45° F (7° C) or less, and subsequently\nrepasteurized or discarded. (d) All\ncaps and closures are designed and applied in such a manner that the pouring\nlip is protected to at least its largest diameter and, with respect to fluid\nproduct containers, removal cannot be made without detection. Single-service\ncontainers are so constructed that the product and the pouring and opening\nareas are protected from contamination during handling, storage, and when the\ncontainers are initially opened. (e) Caps and closures are handled in a\nsanitary manner. The first cap from each tube, the first cap(s) from each roll\nof cap or cover stock, and the first sheet of parchment or cover paper shall be\ndiscarded. The subsequent use of loose caps which are left in the cappers at\nthe end of an operating period after removal from the cap tubes shall be a\nviolation of this item. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.51\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
