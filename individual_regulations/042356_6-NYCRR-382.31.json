  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.31 - Criteria for all disposal methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny method used for a land disposal facility must meet\nthe requirements of this section. (a) General. (1)\n\nShallow land burial must not be\nused as a disposal method. (2)\n\nAny\ndisposal unit used for the disposal of mixed low-level radioactive and\nhazardous wastes or for the disposal of NARM waste mixed with hazardous wastes\nmust meet the applicable requirements of Environmental Conservation Law, article 27, and regulations promulgated pursuant thereto in addition to the\nrequirements of this Part. (3)\n\nThe\ndisposal unit construction methods and techniques must not adversely affect the\nland disposal facility's ability to meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nIn meeting the\nrequirements of this Part, activities performed during the institutional\ncontrol period may not be relied upon for more than 100 years. (b) Design. (1)\n\nThe disposal units are integral parts of\nthe disposal site and must function in concert with other features of the\ndisposal site to ensure that the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part are\nmet. Any disposal method must be compatible with the following design\nrequirements for the disposal site. (i) The\ndisposal site must be designed to complement and improve, where appropriate, the ability of the disposal site's natural characteristics to ensure that the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part will be\nmet. (ii)\n\nThe design of the\ndisposal site must be compatible with the proposed methods of closure and\nstabilization and ensure that the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part will be\nmet. (iii)\n\nThe disposal site design\nfeatures must be directed toward long-term isolation and avoidance of the need\nfor continuing active maintenance after site closure and during the\ninstitutional control period. (2)\n\nThe performance of the disposal units\nmust be capable of being defensibly characterized, modeled, analyzed and\nevaluated. (3)\n\nThe design of the\ndisposal units must provide reasonable assurance of long-term stability. The\ntime periods for such stability shall be: 100 years for disposal units\ncontaining only Class A wastes; 300 years for disposal units containing Class B\nwastes (alone or with Class A wastes); and 500 years for disposal units\ncontaining any Class C waste.
