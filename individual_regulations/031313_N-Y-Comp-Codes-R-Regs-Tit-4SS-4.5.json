With respect to interinstitutional transfers in\nthe Department of Health, the following shall be deemed separate and distinct\nappointing authorities, thereby making such transfers subject to probationary\nperiods prescribed by this section: Central office, including the regional and district\noffices\n\nHelen Hayes Hospital\n\nNew York State Veterans' Homes (Oxford, Batavia, St. Albans\nand Montrose)\n(5)\n(i) An\nappointment, promotion or transfer shall become permanent upon the retention of\nthe probationer after his or her completion of the maximum period of service or\nupon earlier written notice following completion of the minimum period that his\nor her probationary term is successfully completed or, in the case of a\ntransferee, upon written notice that the appointing authority has elected to\nwaive the serving of the probationary term. (ii)\n\nIf the conduct or performance of a\nprobationer is not satisfactory, his or her employment may be terminated at any\ntime after eight weeks and before completion of the maximum period of service. The appointing officer may, however, in his discretion, offer such probationer\nan opportunity to serve a second probationary term of not less than 12 nor more\nthan 26 weeks in a different assignment, in which case the appointment may be\nmade permanent at any time after completion of 12 weeks of service, or the\nemployment terminated at any time after the completion of 8 weeks of service\nand on or before the completion of 26 weeks of service. (iii)\n\nThe probationer's supervisor shall\ncarefully observe his conduct and performance and, at least two weeks prior to\nthe end of the probationary term, shall report thereon in writing to the proper\nappointing authority. The supervisor shall also, from time to time during the\nprobationary term, advise the probationer of his status and progress. A\nprobationer whose services are to be terminated for unsatisfactory service\nshall receive written notice at least one week prior to such termination and, upon request, shall be granted an interview with the appointing authority or\nhis representative. (c) Trainee appointment or promotion. The\nprobationary term for a trainee appointment or trainee promotion shall coincide\nwith the term of training service, except where an appointment from an\nopen-competitive list can be made to either the trainee or journey level\nposition; in that case, the probationary period for the trainee appointment\nwill be from 26 to 52 weeks or the length of the training period, whichever is\ngreater. If the conduct or performance of the probationer is not satisfactory, his employment may be terminated at any time after the completion of a\nspecified minimum period of service and on or before the completion of the term\nof training service. Such specified minimum period of service, unless otherwise\nprescribed in the announcement of examination, shall be eight weeks. (d) Transfers: probationers. A probationer\nshall be eligible for transfer; provided, however, that upon such transfer he\nshall serve a complete probationary period in the new position in the same\nmanner and subject to the same conditions as required upon his employment in\nthe position from which transfer is made. (e) Leave for probationers. When a permanent\nemployee is promoted or transferred to a position in which he is required to\nserve a probationary term, the position thus vacated by him shall not be\nfilled, except on a temporary basis, during such probationary term. At any time\nduring such probationary term the employee shall have the right, upon\nreasonable notice, to return to his previous position at his own election. If\nthe conduct or performance of the probationer is not satisfactory, he shall be\nrestored to his former permanent position at the end of this probationary\nterm. (f) Reinstatement. An\nemployee who is reinstated to a position in accordance with section\n5.4\nof this Title, either in his\nformer agency or another agency, shall serve a new probationary period in the\nsame manner and subject to the same requirements as apply hereunder upon\noriginal appointment to such position. (g) Absence during probationary term. Any\nperiods of authorized or unauthorized absence aggregating up to 10 workdays\nduring the probationary term, or aggregating up to 20 workdays if the\nprobationary term or maximum term exceeds 26 weeks, may, in the discretion of\nthe appointing authority, be considered as time served in the probationary\nterm. When the probationary term for a trainee appointment or trainee promotion\nexceeds one year, any periods of authorized or unauthorized absence in such\nprobationary term aggregating up to 20 workdays multiplied by the number of\nyears, including a fraction of a year, constituting the probationary term, may\nin the discretion of the appointing authority, be considered as time served in\nthe probationary term. Any such periods of absence not so considered by the\nappointing authority as time served in the probationary term, and any periods\nof absence in excess of periods considered by the appointing authority as time\nserved in the probationary term pursuant to this subdivision, shall not be\ncounted as time served in the probationary term. The minimum and maximum\nperiods of the probationary term of any employee shall be extended by the\nnumber of workdays of his absence which, pursuant to this subdivision, are not\ncounted as time served in the probationary term. (h) Restoration to eligible list. A\nprobationer whose employment is terminated or who resigns before the end of his\nprobationary term may request that his name be restored to the eligible list\nfrom which he was appointed, provided such list is still in existence. His name\nmay be restored to such list if the Department of Civil Service, after due\ninquiry, determines that the probationer's service was such that he should be\ngiven a second opportunity for appointment. (i) Temporary or provisional service in\nhigher level position. When an employee who has not completed his probationary\nterm is appointed on a temporary or provisional basis to a higher level\nposition, the period of temporary or provisional service rendered by such\nemployee in such higher level position may, in the discretion of the appointing\nauthority, be considered as satisfactory probationary service in his lower\nposition and may be counted as such in determining the satisfactory completion\nof such probationary term. At any time after the expiration of the minimum\nperiod of the probationary term, or the entire probationary term if it be one\nof fixed duration, the appointing authority shall, on request of such\nprobationer, furnish his decision in writing as to whether or not service in\nsuch higher level position shall be considered as satisfactory probationary\nservice. In the event of an adverse decision by the appointing authority, such\nprobationer, at his request, shall be returned to his lower position for\nsufficient time to permit him to complete his probationary term. The employment\nof such a probationer in his lower position shall not be terminated at the end\nof his probationary term on account of unsatisfactory service unless he shall\nhave actually served in such position, in the aggregate, at least a period of\neight weeks. (j) Removal during\nprobationary term. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to\nlimit or otherwise affect the authority of an appointing authority, at any time\nduring the probationary term, to remove a probationer for incompetency or\nmisconduct, under section\n75\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law or an agreement negotiated between the State and an employee\norganization pursuant to article 14 of such law.
