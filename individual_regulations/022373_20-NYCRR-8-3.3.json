  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-3.3 - Real and tangible personal property rented to the surcharge taxpayer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nReal and tangible personal property\nrented to the surcharge taxpayer must be included for purposes of computation\nof the property factor. (2)\n\nThe\nvalue of real and tangible personal property that is rented to the surcharge\ntaxpayer is determined by multiplying the gross rents payable during the period\ncovered by the report by eight. (b) The term \"gross rents\" as used in this\nsection means the actual sum of money or other consideration payable, directly\nor indirectly, either by the surcharge taxpayer or for its benefit for the use\nor possession of the property and includes: (1)\n\nAny amount payable for the use or\npossession of real and tangible personal property, or any part of such\nproperty, whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as a percentage of\nsales, profits or otherwise. (i) Example. A surcharge taxpayer, pursuant to the terms of a lease, pays the lessor $1,000 per month and at the end of the year pays the lessor 1%\nof its gross sales. Its gross sales were $400,000, resulting in a gross rent of\n$16,000. (2)\n\nAny\namount payable as additional rent or payable in lieu of rent, such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other amount made payable by the terms of a\nlease or other arrangement. (i) Example. A surcharge taxpayer, pursuant to the terms of a lease, pays its lessor $24,000 a year. It also pays real estate taxes of $4,000 and\ninterest on a mortgage in the amount of $2,000 pursuant to the lease. The\ntaxpayer's gross rent is $30,000. (3)\n\nThe proportionate part of the cost of any\nimprovement to real and tangible personal property made by or on behalf of the\nsurcharge taxpayer that reverts to the owner or lessor upon termination of a\nlease or other arrangement. The amount to be included in gross rents is based\non the unexpired term of the lease commencing with the date the improvement is\ncompleted (or the life of the improvement if its life expectancy is less than\nthe unexpired term of the lease). However, where a building is erected on land\nleased by or on behalf of the surcharge taxpayer, the value of the land is\ndetermined by multiplying the gross rent by eight, and the value of the\nbuilding is determined in the same manner as if owned by the surcharge\ntaxpayer. The proportionate part of the cost of an improvement (other than a\nbuilding on leased land) is generally equal to the amount of amortization\nallowed in computing entire net income, regardless of whether the lease\ncontains an option for renewal. (i) Examples. Example 1: A surcharge taxpayer enters into a 21-year\nlease of certain premises at a rental of $20,000 a year. After the expiration\nof one year, it installs a new store front at a cost of $10,000 that reverts to\nthe owner upon the expiration of the lease. Its gross rent for the first year\nis $20,000. However, for subsequent years its gross rent is $20,500 ($20,000\nannual rent plus 1/20\nth\nof $10,000, the cost of the\nimprovement apportioned on the basis of the unexpired term of the\nlease). Example 2: A surcharge taxpayer leases a parcel of vacant\nland for 40 years at an annual rental of $5,000 and erects a building on the\nland that costs $600,000. The value of the land is determined by multiplying\nthe annual rent of $5,000 by eight. The value of the building is determined as\nif owned by the surcharge taxpayer. (c) The term \"gross rents\" does not include: (1)\nintercorporate rents if both the lessor\nand the lessee are properly included in a combined report under article\n9-A; (2)\namounts payable as\nseparate charges for water and electric service furnished by the\nlessor; (3)\namounts payable for\nstorage, unless the storage space is designated for the surcharge taxpayer or\nunder its control; (4)\namounts\npayable pursuant to a capital lease; (5)\nany portion of a rental payment payable\nfor space subleased from the surcharge taxpayer and not used by it. (i) Example. A surcharge taxpayer leases a building located in the\nMCTD, to be used in manufacturing. The rent is $20,000 a year. The taxpayer\nsubleases 40% of the building to one or more subtenants. Since 40% of the rent\npaid by the taxpayer is applicable to the portion of the building subleased, 40% of the rent, or $8,000, is excluded in computing the taxpayer's gross rent\nfor the building, for purposes of determining the building's average value, regardless of the actual amount of rent received by the taxpayer from the\nsublease. (d) For purposes of this section, the term\n\"capital lease\" means any lease that meets at least one of the following: (1)\n\nThe present value of the minimum lease\npayments is 90% of the fair value of the property to the lessor. (2)\n\nThe lease term is 75% or more of the\nleased property's estimated economic life. (3)\n\nThe lease contains a bargain (less than\nfair value) purchase option. (4)\n\nOwnership is transferred to the lessee by the end of the lease term. (e) In exceptional cases, use of\nthe general method described in this section may result in inaccurate\nvaluations of rented real or tangible personal property. In such cases, any\nother method that properly reflects the value may be adopted either on the\ncommissioner's own motion or at the request of the surcharge taxpayer. Another\nmethod of valuation may not be used unless approved by the commissioner. A\nrequest for a different method of valuation must be made in accordance with the\nprocedures for a discretionary adjustment described in section\n4-1.6\nof this Subchapter and\nprovide full information with respect to the property, including the basis for\nthe valuation proposed by the surcharge taxpayer.
