  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 415.19 - Infection control\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe facility shall establish and maintain an infection\ncontrol program designed to provide a safe, sanitary, and comfortable\nenvironment in which residents reside and to help prevent the development and\ntransmission of disease and infection. (a) Infection control program. The facility\nshall establish an infection control program with written policies and\nprocedures under which it: (1)\ninvestigates, controls and takes action to prevent infections in the facility; (2)\ndetermines what procedures such as\nisolation and universal precautions should be utilized for an individual\nresident and implements the appropriate procedures; (3)\nmaintains a record of incidence and\ncorrective actions related to infections; and\n(4)\ncollects documentation of vaccination\nagainst influenza, or requires wearing of a surgical or procedure mask during\nthe influenza season, for personnel who have not received the influenza vaccine\nfor the current influenza season, pursuant to section\n2.59\nof this Title. (5)\n\nRepealed. (b) Preventing spread of infection. (1)\n\nWhen the infection control program\ndetermines that isolation is needed to prevent the spread of infection, the\nfacility shall isolate the resident. (2)\n\nThe facility shall assure that all\nequipment and supplies are cleaned and properly sterilized where necessary and\nare stored in a manner that will not violate the integrity of the\nsterilization. (3)\n\nThe facility\nshall prohibit persons, including but not limited to, staff, volunteers, and\nvisitors known to have a communicable disease or infected skin lesions from\ndirect contact with residents or their food, if direct contact will transmit\nthe disease. (4)\n\nThe facility shall\nrequire physicians and staff to wash their hands after each direct resident\ncontact for which handwashing is indicated by accepted professional\npractice. (c) Linens. Personnel shall handle, store, process, and transport linens so as to prevent\nthe spread of infection. (d) Reporting. The facility shall report increased incidence of infections, including nosocomial infections as defined in section\n2.2\nof this Title, to the\nappropriate area office of the Office of Health Systems Management and shall\nreport, immediately, the presence of any communicable disease as defined in\nsection\n2.1\nof this Title to the city, county or district health officer. (e) Notice to funeral directors. If, at the\ntime of death, a resident was diagnosed as having a specific communicable\ndisease designated in Part 2 of this Title or an infectious disease, a written\nreport of such disease shall accompany the body when it is released to the\nfuneral director or his or her agent, except that no HIV-related information\nshall be disclosed to the funeral director unless the funeral director has\naccess in the ordinary course of business to HIV-related information on the\ndeath certificate of the deceased individual. (f) (1)\n\nThe\nnursing home shall possess and maintain a supply of all necessary items of\npersonal protective equipment (PPE) sufficient to protect health care\npersonnel, consistent with federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nguidance, for at least 60 days, by August 31, 2021. (2)\n\nThe 60-day stockpile requirement set\nforth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be determined by the\n\nDepartment as follows for each type of required PPE: (i) for single gloves, the applicable\npositivity rate, multiplied by the nursing home's average census as determined\nannually by the Department, multiplied by 24; (ii)\nfor gowns, the applicable positivity\nrate, multiplied by the nursing home's average census as determined annually by\nthe Department, multiplied by 3; (iii)\nfor surgical masks, the applicable\npositivity rate, multiplied by the nursing home's average census as determined\nannually by the Department, multiplied by 1.5; and\n(iv)\nfor N95 respirator masks, the applicable\npositivity rate, multiplied by the nursing home's average census as determined\nannually by the Department, multiplied by 1.4. (v) For the purposes of this paragraph, the\nterm \"applicable positivity rate\" shall mean the greater of the following\npositivity rates: (a) The nursing home's\naverage COVID-19 positivity rate, based on reports made to the Department, during the period April 26, 2020 through May 20, 2020; or\n(b) The nursing home's average COVID-19\npositivity rate, based on reports made to the Department, during the period\n\nJanuary 3, 2021 through January 31, 2021; or\n(c) 20.15 percent, representing the highest\n\nRegional Economic Development Council average COVID-19 positivity rate, as\nreported to the Department, during the periods April 26, 2020 through May 20, 2020 and January 3, 2021 through January 31, 2021. (d) In the case of nursing homes previously\ndesignated by the Department as a COVID-positive only facility, the term\n\"applicable positivity rate\" shall be as defined in clause (c) of this\nsubparagraph. (3)\nA nursing home shall be considered to\npossess and maintain the required PPE if: (i) it maintains all PPE on-site; or\n(ii)\nit maintains PPE off-site, provided that\nthe off-site storage location is within New York State, can be accessed by the\nnursing home within at least 24 hours, and the nursing home maintains at least\na 10-day supply of all required PPE on-site, as determined by the calculations\nset forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. A nursing home may enter into\nan agreement with a vendor to store off-site PPE, provided that such agreement\nrequires the vendor to maintain unduplicated, facility-specific stockpiles, the\nvendor agrees to maintain at least a 60-day supply of all required PPE (less\nthe amount that is stored on-site at the facility), and the PPE is accessible\nby the facility 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, year round. In the event the\n\nDepartment finds a nursing home has not maintained the required PPE stockpile, it shall not be a defense that the vendor failed to maintain the\nsupply. (iii)\n\nAny PPE stored\noutside of New York State shall not count toward the facility's required 60-day\nstockpile. (4)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment shall determine the nursing home's average census annually, by\n\nJanuary 1st of each year, and shall communicate such determination to each\nfacility. Nursing homes shall have 90 days to come into compliance with the new\nPPE stockpile requirements, as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, following such determination by the Department. (5)\n\nIn order to maximize the shelf life of\nstockpiled inventory, providers should follow the appropriate storage\nconditions as outlined by manufacturers, and providers are strongly encouraged\nto rotate inventory through regular usage and replace what has been used in\norder to ensure a consistent readiness level and reduce waste. Expired products\nshould be disposed of when their expiration date has passed. Expired products\nshall not be used to comply with the stockpile requirement set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nFailure to possess and maintain the\nrequired supply of PPE may result in the revocation, limitation, or suspension\nof the nursing home's license; provided, however, that no such revocation, limitation, or suspension shall be ordered unless the Department has provided\nthe nursing home with a fourteen day grace period, solely for a nursing home's\nfirst violation of this section, to achieve compliance with the requirement set\nforth herein. (7)\n\nIn the event a\nnew methodology relating to PPE in Residential Health Care Facilities is\ndeveloped, including but not limited to a methodology by the U.S. Department of\n\nHealth & Human Services, and the Commissioner determines that such\nalternative methodology is appropriate for New York nursing homes and will\nadequately protect facility staff and patients, the Commissioner shall amend\nthis subdivision to reflect such new\nmethodology.
