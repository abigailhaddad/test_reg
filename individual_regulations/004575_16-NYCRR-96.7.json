Tit. 16 § 96.7 - Electric submetering equipment requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll submeterers, whether authorized to submeter by\ncommission order, rule, or past practice shall provide or continue to provide\nsubmetered service under the following conditions unless waived in whole or in\npart by commission order for good cause shown: (a) All submetering products and ancillary\nequipment used to monitor electric flow to submetered residents and installed\nor replaced after January 1, 2014 must: (1)\ncomply with the provisions of Parts 92 and 93 of this Title; and\n(2)\nbe physically compatible with the service\nendpoints of the premises' electrical system. Submeters shall be equipped with\nviewable registers, accessible to the resident so the resident may monitor\ntheir own kWh consumption or shall provide alternate mechanisms to allow\nresidents to monitor their own consumption such as through a computer\nprogram; (3)\nsubmeters that are\ncalibrated to register a fixed fraction of the electricity consumed should\ndisplay the meter register multiplier which will be used to determine the\nresident's actual kilowatt hour usage. Any register multiplier used should be\nindicated on resident bills. (b) Ensuring continued submeter performance -\nsubmeter inspection and testing programs shall be instituted to ensure that\nresidents of submetered premises continue to receive reliable and accurate\nelectric consumption measurements. The submeterer or submeterer's agent shall\nconduct an annual testing program to analyze a statistically significant sample\nof the in-service submeters in accordance with the testing procedures and\nstandards outlined in Parts 92 and 93 of this Title. Submeters that do not meet\nthe requirements of Parts 92 and 93 of this Title shall be corrected or\nrecalibrated as soon as practicable but no later than one year after testing\nunless otherwise ordered by the commission. (c) Cost of meter tests for all submeters -\nthe cost of testing a submeter's accuracy shall be borne by the submeterer to\nthe extent described in this paragraph. A recipient of submetered service may\nrequest and receive one submeter test at no cost during a 12-month period when\nthe request is made pursuant to a consumer complaint. A recipient of submetered\nservice may request more than one meter test during a twelve month period and\nmay request that the test be witnessed by Department of Public Service staff; however, if the submeter is not out of the limits as prescribed by Part 92 of\nthis Title, the person requesting more than one annual test will bear the cost\nof such additional meter tests.
