  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 370.4 - Case-by-case regulation of hazardous waste recycling activities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Additional regulation of certain hazardous waste recycling activities on\na case-by-case basis. (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may decide on a case-by-case basis that persons accumulating or\nstoring the recyclable materials described in section\n371.1\n(g)(1)(ii)\n(\nd\n) of this Title should be regulated under Parts 372 and 373\nof this Title. The basis for such decision must be that the materials are being\naccumulated or stored in a manner that does not protect human health and the\nenvironment because the materials or their toxic constituents have not been\nadequately contained, or because the materials being accumulated or stored\ntogether are incompatible. In making this decision, the commissioner will\nconsider the following factors: (i) the types\nand amounts of materials accumulated or stored; (ii)\nthe method of accumulation or\nstorage; (iii)\nthe length of time\nthe materials have been accumulated or stored before being reclaimed; (iv)\nwhether any containments are being\nreleased into the environment, or are likely to be so released; and\n(v) other relevant factors. (b) Procedures\nfor case-by-case regulation of hazardous waste recycling activities. (1)\n\nThe commissioner will use the following\nprocedures, in addition to the procedures under Part 621 of this Title, when\ndetermining whether to regulate hazardous waste recycling activities described\nin section\n371.1\n(g)(1)(ii)\n(\nd\n) of this Title under the provisions of section\n374-1.6\nof this Title. (i) If a generator is accumulating the waste, the commissioner will issue a notice setting forth the factual basis for the\ndecision and stating that the person must comply with the applicable\nrequirements of Parts 372 and 373 of this Title. The notice will become final\nwithin 30 days, unless the person served requests a public hearing to challenge\nthe decision. Upon receiving such a request, the commissioner will hold an\nadjudicatory public hearing. The commissioner will provide notice of the\nhearing to the public and allow public participation at the hearing. The\ncommissioner will issue a final decision based on the hearing officer's report\nstating whether or not compliance with Parts 372 and 373 is required. The\ndecision becomes effective 30 days after service. (ii)\n\nIf the person is accumulating the\nrecyclable material as a storage facility, the notice will state that the\nperson must obtain a permit in accordance with all applicable provisions of\n\nPart 373 of this Title. The owner or operator of the facility must apply for a\npermit within no less than 60 days and no more than six months of notice, as\nspecified in the notice. The owner or operator of a facility who wishes to\nchallenge the commissioner's decision, may do so in the permit application, in\na public hearing held on the draft permit, in comments filed on the draft\npermit or on the notice of intent to deny the permit. The fact sheet\naccompanying the permit will specify the reasons for the department's\ndetermination. The question of whether the commissioner's decision was proper\nwill remain open for consideration during the public comment period discussed\nunder Part 624 of this Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
