  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 95.2 - Computation of tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nstatutes authorizing race meetings and pari-mutuel betting impose a tax equal\nto 4 percent of the admission price of tickets sold or otherwise disposed of. With respect to tickets which are sold, the tax is 4 percent of the amount for\nwhich they are sold, exclusive of taxes, but in no event less than 4 percent of\nthe minimum charge, exclusive of taxes, fixed by the State Racing and Wagering\n\nBoard. With respect to tickets which are disposed of otherwise than by sale, the tax is 4 percent of the amount for which similar tickets are sold, that is, tickets for admission to the same place or accommodations at the same time. If\nsimilar tickets are sold to some purchasers at a price higher than the price\ncharged to others, the tax on tickets disposed of otherwise than by sale is 4\npercent of the highest price for which any similar tickets are sold by the\nlicensee. (b) Where stockholders or\nmembers of any licensee or of any other organization are admitted upon payment\nof an amount less than the price for which tickets are sold to other persons, the tax applies to the amount so paid by them for admission, whether it is\ndesignated as an admission price, service charge or otherwise, but the tax does\nnot apply to the amount paid for stock or membership in the licensee or other\norganization. (c) The tax applies\nregardless of whether or not tickets in the usual form are sold. For example, the price paid for admission through a turnstile, without the issuance of a\nticket, is subject to tax. Passes, cards, badges or the like, which give the\nholder a right to admission, are deemed tickets for the purposes of the tax and\nof these regulations, whether they are sold or disposed of otherwise than by\nsale, except that the tax does not apply to tax-free passes, cards or badges\nissued pursuant to rules or regulations of the State Racing and Wagering Board\nto persons authorized by statute to receive them.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
