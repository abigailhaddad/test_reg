  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.381 - Service lines: excess flow valve performance standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Excess flow valves to be used on single\nresidence service lines that operate continuously throughout the year at a\npressure not less than 10 psig (69 kPa) must be manufactured and tested by the\nmanufacturer according to an industry specification, or the manufacturer's\nwritten specification, to ensure that each valve will: (1)\nfunction properly up to the maximum\noperating pressure at which the valve is rated; (2)\nfunction properly at all temperatures\nreasonably expected in the operating environmental of the service\nline; (3)\nat 10 psig (69 kPa) close\nat, or not more than 50 percent above, the rated closure flow rate specified by\nthe manufacturer and upon closure, reduce the gas flow to the level indicated: (i) for an excess flow valve designed to\nallow pressure to equalize across the valve, no more than five percent of the\nmanufacturer's specified closure flow rate, up to a maximum of 20 cubic feet\n(0.566 cubic meter) per hour; or\n(ii)\nfor an excess flow valve designed to\nprevent equalization of pressure across the valve, no more than 0.4 cubic foot\n(0.011 cubic meter) per hour; and\n(4)\nnot close when the pressure is less than\nthe manufacturer's minimum specified operating pressure and the flow rate is\nbelow the manufacturer's minimum specified closure flow rate. (b) An excess flow valve must meet\nthe applicable requirements of this Part regarding materials and design of\npipeline components. (c) An\noperator must mark or otherwise identify the presence of an excess flow valve\nin the service line. (d) An\noperator shall locate an excess flow valve as near as practical to the fitting\nconnecting the service line to its source of gas supply. (e) An operator should not install an excess\nflow valve on a service line where the operator has prior experience with\ncontaminants in the gas stream, where these contaminants could be expected to\ncause the excess flow valve to malfunction or where the excess flow valve would\ninterfere with necessary operation and maintenance activities on the service, such as blowing liquids from the line. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.381\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
