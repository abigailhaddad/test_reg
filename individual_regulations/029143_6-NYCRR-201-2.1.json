(3)\n'Affected source'. A stationary source that includes one or more fossil fuel\nfired combustion units (\"affected\" units) that are subject to emission\nreduction requirements or limitations established in accordance with the\n\nFederal Acid Rain Program under title IV of the act.

All states and tribal\nlands: (i) whose air quality may be affected\nand that are contiguous to the state where the major stationary source is\nlocated for which a title V facility permit, permit modification or permit\nrenewal is being proposed; or\n(ii)\nthat are within 50 miles of such major stationary source. (5)\n'Applicable requirement'. A standard or\nother requirement in State or Federal regulations required under the act as it\napplies to an emission unit or emission source, including requirements that\nhave been promulgated or approved by EPA through rulemaking at the time of\nissuance of a permit but have future effective compliance dates. Applicable\nrequirements that are in Federal regulations are listed in Part 200, Table\n200.10 of this Title. Applicable requirements generally include the following: (i) any standard or other requirement\napproved in the New York State Implementation Plan (SIP) that is effective at\nthe time of permit issuance; (ii)\nany term or condition of any permit issued pursuant to the requirements of\ntitle I of the act, including the Federal Prevention of Significant\n\nDeterioration (PSD) Program or new source review in nonattainment areas\npursuant to Part 231 of this Title, that are required under the Clean Air Act\nor are taken by a source to avoid an applicable requirement; (iii)\nany standard or requirement promulgated\nto control emissions under section 111 of the act (including the New Source\n\nPerformance Standards or NSPS); (iv)\nany standard or other requirement\npromulgated under section 112 of the act, including any requirement to control\nthe accidental release of regulated substances, pursuant to section 112(r)(7)\nof the act; (v) any standard, regulation or other requirement of the Acid Rain Program under title IV of the\nact; (vi)\nany compliance assurance\nrequirements established pursuant to section 504(b) or section 114(a)(3) of the\nact; (vii)\nany standard, regulation\nor other requirement governing solid waste incineration and\nhospital/medical/infectious waste incineration promulgated under section 129 of\nthe act; (viii)\nany standard, regulation or other requirement promulgated to protect stratospheric ozone\nunder title VI of the act unless the administrator has determined that such\nrequirements need not be contained in a permit issued under this\n\nPart; (ix)\nany standard or other\nrequirement of the program to control air pollution from outer continental\nshelf facilities under section 328 of the act; (x) any national ambient air quality\nstandard, increment, or visibility requirement under title 1, part C of the\nact, but only as it would apply to portable emission sources; (xi)\na standard or other requirement for\nconsumer and commercial products, under section 183(e) of the act; and\n(xii)\na standard or other\nrequirement for tank vessels, under section 183(f) of the act.

(ii)\n\nFor hazardous air pollutants other than\nradionuclides, a stationary source, source, or facility that emits or has the\npotential to emit, in the aggregate, 10 tpy or more of any hazardous air\npollutant as defined in Part 200 of this Title (including any fugitive\nemissions of such pollutant), 25 tpy or more of any combination of such\nhazardous air pollutants (including any fugitive emissions of such pollutants), or such lesser quantity as the administrator may establish by rule. For\nradionuclides the meaning of major stationary source, major source, or major\nfacility shall be specified by the administrator by rule. Notwithstanding the\npreceding sentence, emissions from any oil or gas exploration or oil and gas\nproduction well (with its associated equipment) and the emissions from any\npipeline compressor station or pump station shall not be aggregated with\nemissions from other units, whether or not such units are in a contiguous area\nor under common control, to determine whether such units or stations are major\nstationary sources, major sources, or major facilities.
