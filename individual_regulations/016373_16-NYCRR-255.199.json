  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.199 - Requirements for design of pressure relief and limiting devices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for\nrupture discs, each pressure relief or pressure limiting device must: (1)\nbe constructed of materials such that the\noperation of a device will not be impaired by corrosion; (2)\nhave valves and valve seats that are\ndesigned not to stick in a position that will make the device\ninoperative; (3)\nbe designed and\ninstalled so that it can be readily operated to determine if the valve is free, can be tested to determine the pressure at which it will operate, and can be\ntested for leakage when in the closed position; (4)\nhave its support made of noncombustible\nmaterial; (5)\nhave discharge\nstacks, vents, or outlet ports designed to prevent accumulation of water, ice, or snow, located where gas can be discharged into the atmosphere without undue\nhazard; (6)\nbe designed and\ninstalled so that the size of the opening, pipe, and fittings located between\nthe system to be protected and the pressure-relieving device, and the size of\nthe vent line, are adequate to prevent hammering of the valve and to prevent\nimpairment of relief capacity; (7)\nwhere installed at a district regulator station to protect a pipeline system\nfrom overpressuring, be designed and installed in compliance with subdivision\n(b) of this section to prevent any single incident such as an explosion in a\nvault or damage by a vehicle from affecting the operation of both the\noverpressure protection device and the district regulator; (8)\nexcept for a valve that will isolate the\nsystem under protection from its source of pressure be designed to prevent\nunauthorized operation of any stop valve that will make the pressure relief\nvalve or pressure-limiting device inoperative; and\n(9)\nwhere gas pressures are reduced in two or\nmore stages to supply pipelines except field regulators, be designed and\ninstalled in compliance with subdivision (b) of this section so that any single\nincident in one stage will not adversely affect another stage. (b) For new installations, and for\nexisting aboveground stations supplying low-pressure pipelines, the minimum\nseparation distance between the overpressure protection device and the\nregulator or between stages of regulation shall be: (1)\n50 feet (15.2 meters); or\n(2)\nwhere it is impracticable because of\ninterfering subsurface structures, not less than 25 feet (7.6 meters) upon\napproval of the department. (c) The requirements contained in subdivision\n(b) of this section do not apply to those existing stations which, due to their\nlocations or other station protection design features, are adequately protected\nagainst any credible single incident affecting the operation of both the\noverpressure protection device and the district regulator, or which supply\nintegrated distribution systems employing multiple overpressure protection\ndevices of sufficient capacity to prevent overpressuring of the distribution\nsystem. (d) Notwithstanding the\ninstallation date or the retroactivity provided by section\n255.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart, when overpressure protection is provided by a monitor regulator, a means\nmust be provided to verify that the regulator is functioning\nproperly. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.199\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
