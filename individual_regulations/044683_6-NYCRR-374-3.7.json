  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-3.7 - Petitions to include other wastes under this subpart\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nAny person seeking to add a hazardous\nwaste or a category of hazardous waste to this Part may petition for a\nregulatory amendment under this Subpart and section\n370.5\n(a) and (c)\nof this Title. (2)\n\nTo be\nsuccessful, the petitioner must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner that regulation under the universal waste regulations of this\n\nSubpart: is appropriate for the waste or category of waste; will improve\nmanagement practices for the waste or category of waste; and will improve\nimplementation of the hazardous waste program. The petition must include the\ninformation required by section\n370.5\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. The petition should also address as many of the factors listed in\nsubdivision (b) of this section as are appropriate for the waste or waste\ncategory addressed in the petition. (3)\n\nThe commissioner will evaluate petitions\nusing the factors listed in subdivision (b) of this section. The commissioner\nwill grant or deny a petition using the factors listed in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. The decision will be based on the weight of evidence showing that\nregulation under this Subpart is appropriate for the waste or category of\nwaste, will improve management practices for the waste or category of waste, and will improve implementation of the hazardous waste\nprogram. (b) Factors for petitions to include other wastes under this Subpart. (1)\n\nThe waste or category of waste, as\ngenerated by a wide variety of generators, is listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title, or (if not\nlisted) a proportion of the waste stream exhibits one or more characteristics\nof hazardous waste identified in section\n371.3\nof this Title. (When a\ncharacteristic waste is added to the universal waste regulations of this\n\nSubpart by using a generic name to identify the waste category\n[\ne.g., batteries], the definition of universal waste in\nsections\n370.2\n[b]\nand\n374-3.1\n[i]\nof this\n\nTitle will be amended to include only the hazardous waste portion of the waste\ncategory [\ne.g., hazardous waste batteries]). Thus, only the\nportion of the waste stream that does exhibit one or more characteristics\n(\ni.e., is hazardous waste) is subject to the universal waste\nregulations of this Subpart. (2)\n\nThe waste or category of waste is not exclusive to a specific industry or group\nof industries, is commonly generated by a wide variety of types of\nestablishments (including, for example, households, retail and commercial\nbusinesses, office complexes, conditionally exempt small quantity generators, small businesses, government organizations, as well as large industrial\nfacilities). (3)\n\nThe waste or\ncategory of waste is generated by a large number of generators\n(\ne.g., more than 1,000 nationally) and is frequently generated\nin relatively small quantities by each generator. (4)\n\nSystems to be used for collecting the\nwaste or category of waste (including packaging, marking, and labeling\npractices) would ensure close stewardship of the waste. (5)\n\nThe risk posed by the waste or category\nof waste during accumulation and transport is relatively low compared to other\nhazardous wastes, and specific management standards proposed or referenced by\nthe petitioner (\ne.g., waste management requirements\nappropriate to be added to sections\n374-3.2\n[d], 374-3.3\n[d]\nand\n374-3.4\n[c]\nof this\n\nSubpart; and/or applicable Department of Transportation requirements) would be\nprotective of human health and the environment during accumulation and\ntransport. (6)\n\nRegulation of the\nwaste or category of waste under this Subpart will increase the likelihood that\nthe waste will be diverted from non-hazardous waste management systems\n(\ne.g., the municipal waste stream, non-hazardous industrial or\ncommercial waste stream, municipal sewer or stormwater systems) to recycling, treatment, or disposal in compliance with ECL, article 27, title 9. (7)\n\nRegulation of the waste or category of\nwaste under this Subpart will improve implementation of and compliance with the\nhazardous waste regulatory program. (8)\n\nSuch other factors as may be\nappropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
