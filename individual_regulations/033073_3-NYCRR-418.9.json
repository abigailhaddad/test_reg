(c) Suspension after hearing; revocation. Except as provided in\nparagraph (b) of this subpart, a registration of an MLS may be revoked or\nsuspended only after notice and a hearing as provided in Supervisory Procedure\nG 111. Any hearing held pursuant to the provisions of this Part shall be\nnoticed, conducted and administered in compliance with the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act.
