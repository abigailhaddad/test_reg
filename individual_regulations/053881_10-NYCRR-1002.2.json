  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 1002.2 - Limits on administrative expenses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Limits on\nallowable administrative expenses. No less than 75 percent of the covered\noperating expenses of a covered provider paid for with State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments shall be program services expenses rather than\nadministrative expenses. This percentage shall increase by five percent each\nyear until it shall be no less than 85 percent in 2015 and for each year\nthereafter. In determining whether an expense is a program service expense or\nan administrative expense, a covered provider may allocate a portion of the\nexpense to each type if such allocation is supported by the nature of the\nexpense. Such allocation may include allocation of portions of an employee's\ntime and compensation to administrative or program services. Commencing on July\n1, 2013, the limits on allowable administrative expenses pursuant to this Part\nshall be effective and applicable to each covered provider on the first day of\neach provider's respective covered reporting period. (b) Subcontractors and agents of covered\nproviders. The restriction on allowable administrative expenses in subdivision\n(a) of this section and the reporting requirements in section\n1002.5\nshall apply to\nsubcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a\nsubcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments\nfrom the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during\nthe reporting period and would otherwise meet the definition of a covered\nprovider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized\npayments from the covered provider rather than directly from a governmental\nagency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a\nsubcontractor or agent the terms of these regulations by reference to require\nand facilitate compliance. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly\nreport to the funding or authorizing agency the identity of such subcontractors\nand agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the\ndepartment or its designee. A covered provider shall not be held responsible\nfor a subcontractor's or agent's failure to comply with these\nregulations. (c) Covered providers\nreceiving State funds or State-authorized payments from county or local\ngovernment or from entity contracting on its behalf. The department or its\ndesignee, rather than the county or local unit of government or an entity\ncontracting on behalf of such government, shall be responsible for obtaining\nthe necessary reporting from and compliance by such covered providers, and\nshall issue guidance to affected county and local governments to set forth the\nprocedures by which the department or its designee shall do so. (d) Covered providers with multiple sources\nof State funds or State-authorized payments. If a covered provider receives\n\nState funds or State-authorized payments from multiple sources, the provider's\ncompliance with the restriction on allowable administrative expenses in\nsubsection (a) of this section shall be determined based upon the total amount\nof program services expenses and administrative expenses paid for by such\nfunding received from all of such sources. As set forth in section\n1002.5, the covered provider shall\nreport all of such State funds and State-authorized payments, and the expenses\npaid for by such funding, in the form and at the time specified by the\ndepartment or its designee. (e) Other limits on administrative expenses. If the contract, grant, or other\nagreement is subject to more stringent limits on administrative expenses, whether through law or contract, such limits shall control and shall not be\naffected by the less stringent limits imposed by these regulations. However, the definition and interpretation of terms in this Part shall not be affected\nor limited by the definition or interpretation of terms in other regulations or\nagreements. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n1002.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
