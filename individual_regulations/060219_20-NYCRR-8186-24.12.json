  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-24.12 - Methodology for stratification of sampled classes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nCost\nfactor\nis a multiplier reflecting the relative cost of an average\nappraisal in an ordinary class in terms of the cost of a vacant land\nappraisal. (2)\n\nEffective\nappraisal unit\nis equivalent to one sample parcel of average\ncost. (3)\n\nReldev\nis an adjustment factor based on previous class sampling error which shows the\nrelative difficulty of sampling classes. A reldev is computed by multiplying\nthe CV of an estimate by the square root of the sample size. (4)\n\nSample class\nmeans an\nordinary class which is stratified with \"S\" intervals only. Excluded from a\nsampled class are large units (\"T\" intervals), unsampled intervals (\"U\"\nintervals) and the utility class. (b) Determination of sampled class\nsample size, number of intervals, interval sample size and boundary and\ncontents of interval. (1)\n\nDetermine\nsurvey unit total cost units by multiplying the number of parcels in each\nsampled class by the class cost factor and sum to the survey unit level and the\nspecial assessing unit level. Sampled class\n\nSample class cost\nfactor\n1A and 1B\n1.25\n2A and 2B\n4.00\n4\n3.30\nA\n1.30\nB\n2.90\nC\n1.20\n(2)\n\nDetermine initial sample cost units. (i) For\nspecial assessing units, cities, towns, the Amityville and Wyandanch School\n\nDistricts in the Town of Babylon and village homestead assessing units, calculate the square root of the total cost units for the special assessing\nunit or survey unit, add 25 and then multiply by the appropriate cost unit\nworkload adjustment factor. Assessing unit or\nschool district\n\nCost unit workload\nadjustment factor\n\nNew York City\n1.30\n\nNassau County\n0.40\n\nCities and towns, other than special assessing units, and village homestead assessing units\n0.74\n\nAmityville or Wyandanch School District in the Town\nof Babylon\n0.74\n\nIf the State equalization rate for the base year roll of\ncities and towns, other than special assessing units, or a village homestead\nassessing unit is less than 5.00, the cost unit workload adjustment factor is\nincreased by 25 percent. (ii)\n\nFor a village school assessing unit\nfirst determine effective appraisal units from the following table: Survey unit total cost\nunits\n\nEffective appraisal\nunits\n\nLess than 401\n12 units\n401 to 1,000\n12 units, plus one additional unit for each 200\nsurvey unit total cost units greater than 400\n1,001 to 3,000\n15 units, plus one additional unit for each 500\nsurvey unit total cost units greater than 1,000\n\nGreater than 3,000\n19 units, plus one additional unit for each 1,000\nsurvey unit total cost units greater than 3,000\n(a) Multiply\nthe effective appraisal units by the statewide weighted average cost factor for\nsampled classes, 1.41. (b) Multiply\nthe product from clause (\na\n) by the cost workload adjustment\nfactor of 0.85. (3)\n\nDetermine tentative class sample size. (i) For special assessing units. (a) Determine the estimated market value of\neach sampled class by dividing the assessed value of the class by the\nappropriate adjusted class market value ratio, computed from a prior survey and\nadjusted by the accumulated change in level of assessment from the base year\nroll of the prior survey to the base year roll of the current survey. Use the\nclass 1 adjusted class market value ratio for classes 1A and 1B and the class 2\nclass market value adjusted ratio for classes 2A and 2B. (b) Determine a survey unit class difficulty\nfactor for each sampled class by multiplying the estimated market value of the\nclass, calculated in clause (\na\n), by the class reldev. For New\n\nYork City there is a class reldev for each survey unit class and for Nassau\n\nCounty there is a class reldev for each special assessing unit class. (c) Determine a survey unit weighted\ndifficulty factor for each sampled class by multiplying each survey unit class\ndifficulty factor, calculated in clause (\nb\n), by the square\nroot of the class cost factor and summing the products to a survey unit level. In addition, for New York City determine a citywide weighted difficulty factor\nby summing the products to a citywide level. (d) Determine the tentative sampled survey\nunit class sample size by dividing the survey unit class difficulty factor, calculated in clause (\nb\n), by the square root of the class cost\nfactor and then dividing the resulting quotient by the survey unit weighted\ndifficulty factor, calculated in clause (\nc\n). This result is\nthen multiplied by the survey unit initial sample cost units and rounded to the\nnearest integer. (e) For New York\n\nCity, two additional calculations are required: (1)\n\nDivide the survey unit class difficulty\nfactor, calculated in clause (\nb\n), by the square root of the\nclass cost factor and then divide the resulting quotient by the citywide\nweighted difficulty factor, calculated in clause (\nc\n). This\nresult is then multiplied by the special assessing unit initial sample cost\nunits and rounded to the nearest integer. (2)\n\nAverage the sampled class tentative\nsample size obtained in subclause (\n1\n) with the sampled class\ntentative sample size obtained in clause (\nd\n). The quotient is\nrounded to the nearest integer. (ii)\n\nFor cities and towns, other than special\nassessing units, the Amityville and Wyandanch School Districts in the Town of\n\nBabylon and village homestead assessing units. (a) Multiply the total assessed value of each\nsampled class by the square root of the class cost factor, and sum to the\nsurvey unit level. (b) Divide the\ntotal assessed value of each sampled class by the square root of the class cost\nfactor. (c) Divide the quotient\nobtained for each sampled class in clause (\nb\n) by the sum\nobtained in clause (\na\n). (d) Multiply the survey unit sample cost\nunits by the percentage obtained in clause (\nc\n). The product\nrounded to the nearest integer is the sampled class tentative sample\nsize. (iii)\n\nFor a village\nschool assessing unit. (a) Multiply the survey\nunit sample cost units by the percentage that each sampled class assessed value\nis of the sum of the assessed value of all sampled classes. (b) Divide the product obtained in clause\n(\na\n) by the appropriate class cost factor to determine initial\nsample size. (c) Compare the\ninitial sample size from clause (\nb\n) to the minimum class\nsample size shown in the following table. The larger sample size of the minimum\nsample size or the computed sample size is the sampled class tentative sample\nsize. Number of parcels in\nsampled class\n\nMinimum sampled\nclass sample size\n1\n1\n2 to 4\n2\n5 to 7\n3\n8 to 199\n4\n200 to 999\n6\n1,000 to 1,499\n8\n\nGreater than 1,499\n10\n(4)\n\nDetermine the number of \"S\" intervals in\na sampled class. (i) For New York City, cities, towns, the Amityville and Wyandanch School Districts in the Town of\n\nBabylon and village homestead assessing units, determine the initial number of\n\"S\" intervals in a sampled class from Table 1 below. (a) If the number of parcels in the sampled\nclass is less than 16 parcels, the initial number of intervals equals the\nnumber of intervals indicated in the table. (b) If the number of parcels in the sampled\nclass is greater than 15 parcels, the initial number of intervals is equal to\nthe number of intervals indicated in the table minus one. Table 1\n\nNumber of parcels in\nsampled class\n\nNumber of\nintervals\n\nMinimum interval\nsample size\nless than 7\n1\n\nNumber of parcels\n7 to 15\n2\n3\n16 to 79\n3\n3\n80 to 499\n4\n3\n500 to 999\n4\n4\n1,000 to 3,999\n5\n4\n4,000 to 9,999\n6\n4\n10,000 to 19,999\n7\n4\n20,000 to 29,999\n8\n4\n30,000 to 39,999\n9\n4\nequal to or greater than 40,000\n10\n4\n(ii)\n\nFor Nassau County, determine the initial\nnumber of \"S\" intervals in a sampled class from Table 2 below. (a) If the number of parcels in the sampled\nclass is less than 20, the initial number of intervals equals the number of\nintervals in the table. (b) If the\nnumber of parcels in the sampled class is greater than 19, the initial number\nof intervals equals the number of intervals indicated in the table minus one. Table 2\n\nNumber of parcels in\nsampled class\n\nNumber of\nintervals\n\nMinimum interval\nsample size\nless than 13\n1\n\nNumber of parcels\n13 to 19\n2\n6\n20 to 79\n3\n4\n80 to 499\n4\n4\n500 to 999\n4\n5\n1,000 to 3,999\n5\n4\n4,000 to 9,999\n6\n4\n10,000 to 19,999\n7\n4\n20,000 to 29,999\n8\n4\n30,000 to 39,999\n9\n4\nequal to or greater than 40,000\n10\n4\n(iii)\n\nFor a village school assessing unit. (a) Determine the initial number of intervals\nfrom the following table: Number of parcels in\nsampled class\n\nInitial number of\nintervals\nless than 8\n1\n8 to 49\n2\n50 to 199\n3\n200 to 399\n4\n400 to 599\n5\n600 to 699\n6\n700 to 799\n7\n800 to 899\n8\n900 to 999\n9\ngreater than 999\n10\n(b) Compare the initial number of intervals determined from the preceding table to\nthe result of dividing the sample size by two, and select the smaller of the\ntwo numbers as the number of intervals in the sampled class. (5)\n\nDetermine the\nboundaries and contents of \"S\" intervals. (i) Sum the parcel assessed values in the sampled class from high to low, and test\nthe sum after each parcel is added. (ii)\n\nAt each step in the process, test the\ncumulative assessed value of the interval being constructed against the result\nof the sampled class total assessed value, minus the cumulative assessed value\nof previously completed intervals, divided by the number of intervals left to\nbe completed. (iii)\n\nWhen the test\nindicates that, including the latest parcel added, the cumulative assessed\nvalue for the interval exceeds the test amount, the latest parcel is determined\nto be included in the interval, and the interval being processed is\ncomplete. (iv)\n\nWhen an interval is\ncomplete, the interval total assessed value is subtracted from the sampled\nclass test amount remaining to be assigned, and the count of intervals\nremaining to be constructed is reduced by one. (v) This procedure continues until all\nparcels in the sampled class have been assigned to a value interval. (vi)\n\nFor identification purposes, the value\ninterval which contains the parcel with the lowest assessed value is numbered\n\"001.\" Subsequent intervals are identified from low to high by adding one to\nthe previous interval identifying number. (6)\n\nDetermine boundaries and contents of\nsubintervals. (i) For special assessing units, cities, towns, the Amityville and Wyandanch School Districts in the Town of\n\nBabylon and village homestead assessing units. (a) Examine the first value interval (S001)\nand determine the number of parcels that it contains. (1)\n\nIf the interval contains less than 15\nparcels, or all the parcels in the original interval have the same assessed\nvalue, the boundaries and contents of the interval remain unchanged. (2)\n\nIf the interval contains 15 or more\nparcels with different assessed values, create two subintervals by comparing\nthe assessed values of the parcels in the original interval to the mean\nassessed value of the original interval and assigning parcels, highest assessed\nvalue to lowest, to the higher subinterval until an assessed value not greater\nthan the mean assessed value is found. (3)\n\nThe first parcel found with an assessed\nvalue not greater than the mean assessed value of the original interval, and\nall remaining parcels from the original interval, are assigned to the lower\nsubinterval. (b) For\nidentification purposes, the subinterval which contains the parcel with the\nlowest assessed value is numbered \"001.\" The second subinterval is numbered\n\"002.\" Subsequent intervals are identified from low to high by adding one to\nthe previous interval identifying number. (7)\n\nAllocate class tentative sample size to\n\"S\" intervals. (i) For special assessing\nunits, cities, towns, the Amityville and Wyandanch School Districts in the Town\nof Babylon and village homestead assessing units. (a) The class tentative sample size, rounded\nto the nearest integer, is divided by the number of intervals, resulting in an\ninteger and a remainder. Interval sample sizes are then set, from the lowest\nvalue interval to the highest, equal to the integer plus one for the number of\nintervals equal to the remainder, and equal to the integer for any additional\nintervals. (b) Compare the interval\nsample sizes from clause (\na\n) to the minimum interval sample\nsizes shown in paragraph (4) of this subdivision; the larger sample size is the\ninterval sample size. (c) A sampled\nclass in Nassau County which has greater than 19 parcels and two intervals has\na minimum interval sample size of six. A sampled class in Nassau County which\nhas greater than 19 parcels and three intervals has a minimum interval sample\nsize of four. (ii)\n\nFor a\nvillage school assessing unit, determine the interval sample size in the manner\ndescribed in clause (i)(\na\n) of this paragraph. The sample size\nso determined for a given interval must be a minimum of two. (iii)\n\nWhere the interval sample size would be\ngreater than the number of parcels in the interval, the interval sample size is\nequal to the number of parcels. (iv)\n\nThe sum of the interval sample sizes is\nthe sampled class sample size. (v) The sampled class sample size cannot exceed the number of parcels in the\nclass. (8)\n\nPooling of\nintervals and sample sizes for a village school assessing unit. (i) Examine each interval, from the highest\nnumbered interval to the lowest, to insure that the interval passes either of\nthe following tests: (a) the interval sample\nsize times two is not greater than the number of parcels assigned to the\ninterval; or\n(b) the interval\nsample size is not greater than the result of the number of parcels in the\ninterval minus 10. (ii)\n\nIf the interval fails both tests, the interval is pooled with the next lowest\ninterval by summing the number of parcels, assessed value and sample sizes for\nthe two intervals. (iii)\n\nOnce an\ninterval, or a pooled interval, passes either test, the testing ends for the\nsampled class. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
