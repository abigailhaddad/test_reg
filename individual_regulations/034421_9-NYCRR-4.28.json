  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.28 - Executive order no. 28: establishing a task force on sexual orientation discrimination\n\nState Regulations\n\nOurs is a unique government. It was created and has been\npreserved by people from all over the world who came here seeking one thing\nabove all others: freedom--freedom to believe and to act on those beliefs; freedom that says that so long as an individual's conduct and actions remain a\nmatter of personal expression and do not deprive others of their rights, they\nshould be neither restrained nor punished by government. Our nation values freedom so greatly, it has been written\ninto our Constitution. We all prize that freedom and millions have fought to\nprotect and to extend it. Each generation has come to understand the basic wisdom of\nour Constitution: that only by protecting the freedom of others can we ensure\nit for ourselves; that to encourage or allow government to discriminate against\nany belief or creed or private way of life would threaten us all. This is so\nbecause we could never be sure which particular value would dominate government\nat any particular point in time. Only neutrality by government was deemed safe\nand that is what our Constitution assures. This freedom makes us strong. It is essential to our\npluralism. It protects religious believers, and agnostics, and atheists, and\npolitical dissenters, and conservatives and liberals, creating a nation and a\nstate where the right to live as conscience dictates is enshrined as law. Because of such freedom we enjoy a cultural and religious diversity unmatched\nby any other nation. The freedom our Constitution grants, however, requires that\ngovernment exercise a degree of tolerance unthinkable in societies less open or\ndiverse than ours. It demands a tolerance for the privacy of each individual, a\nrefusal to use the state as an instrument of coercion of belief or thought, however desirable the majority regards a particular belief or thought to\nbe. Even when this freedom is unchallenged, it is so precious\nto us all that our commitment to preserve it from encroachment by government\ndeserves constant reaffirmation and reiteration. But when this freedom is\nquestioned or when evidence of unfair discrimination exists, then our\nreaffirmation is not an option--it is a simple necessity. I have seen evidence of such encroachment. As Secretary of\n\nState, I was required to issue special regulations to prohibit discrimination\nagainst individuals seeking licenses for certain occupations or corporate\nprivileges. Up to that time such licenses were denied on the basis of sexual\norientation or even presumed sexual orientation. There is no reason to believe\nthat the discrimination apparent in that part of government was confined\nthere. No one argued then against my change in the State's\nregulations. No one was heard to say that government had no place in fighting\nunfair discrimination. In fact, in recognition of this, a personnel directive\nagainst discrimination in hiring was issued during the prior\nadministration. I suggest, respectfully, that what was right then is right\nnow. And I believe that there is no justification for the failure to announce\nfreedom from discrimination as the policy, not just of the Department of State\nbut of this entire State government. Indeed, the most persistent argument that has been offered\nin opposition to my stating the views contained in this Order does not really\ncontradict any of them. Rather it says, in effect, we ought not to state this\nconstitutional truth because it may be misrepresented to be something else. Specifically, it is suggested that the argument against discrimination will be\ndistorted into an argument promoting homosexuality. The argument is beside the mark. There is no perfect\nprotection against distortion. Indeed one could as easily argue that silence on\nthis issue could be distorted into an argument promoting discrimination against\nhomosexuals. In this case, this statement and Executive Order are clear. Their essence is that our government cannot promote any religion, creed, belief\nor life-style without thereby threatening all others. This is an argument for securing freedom by insisting on\nneutrality. It is a proposition that is at the very foundation of our nation's\nstrength. We ought never be embarrassed nor afraid to repeat it. Accordingly, for all the above reasons, I am this day\nreiterating the law set down by the Constitution of the United States and the\n\nConstitution of the State of New York as the policy of this\n\nAdministration. Statement of Policy\n1. No State agency or department shall\ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation against any individual in the\nprovision of any services or benefits by such State agency or\ndepartment. 2. All State agencies\nand departments shall prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation in\nany matter pertaining to employment by the State including, but not limited to, hiring, job appointment, promotion, tenure, recruitment and compensation. 3. [FN*] The Office of Employee\n\nRelations is hereby directed to promulgate clear and consistent guidelines\nprohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation to maintain an\nenvironment where only job-related criteria are used to assess employees or\nprospective employees of the State. The Office shall also implement a procedure\nto ensure the swift and thorough investigation of complaints of discrimination\nbased on sexual orientation. Particular effort should be made to conduct\ninvestigations with due regard for confidentiality. 4. In order to assure that we understand\nfully the extent and nature of any discrimination that exists, I will appoint a\ntask force, including the Commissioners of the Departments of Correctional\n\nServices, Health, Mental Health, Labor, Social Services and the Division of\n\nHuman Rights, the Superintendent of State Police, the President of the Civil\n\nService Commission, the directors of the Women's Division, the Office of\n\nEmployee Relations, the Division for Youth and the Office for the Aging, the\n\nChairman of the State Liquor Authority and seven private citizens whom I shall\ndesignate. The task force shall submit such reports and recommendations as it\nsees fit, dealing with individuals' rights to the benefit of government\nservices and opportunity for government service regardless of sexual\norientation. I shall designate a chairperson and vice-chairperson of the\ntask force. Its members shall receive no compensation, but shall be entitled to\nreimbursement for any necessary expenses incurred directly in connection with\nthe performance of their duties. Signed: Mario M.
