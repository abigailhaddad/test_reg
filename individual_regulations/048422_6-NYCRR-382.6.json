  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.6 - Certification of disposal sites and methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section applies to the activities of the commission\nin selecting and proposing one or two sites and one or more disposal methods to\nbe used for the permanent disposal of waste pursuant to article 29 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law. Unless the provisions of article 29 of the ECL\nand this Part otherwise require, article 70 of the ECL and Parts 621, with the\nexception of sections\n621.10\n(b) and (c), and 624 of this Title apply to the commission's and the department's activities\npursuant to article 29 of the ECL. (a) Selection process. (1)\n\nThe commission must\ndevelop and follow a systematic procedure for selecting one or two proposed\nsites and one or more disposal methods for permanent land disposal facilities. The commission must take into account the following factors in the selection of\ndisposal sites and disposal methods: (i) the\nability of land disposal facilities using the proposed site or sites and\ndisposal method or methods to meet the performance objectives in sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part, the\nsiting criteria in sections\n382.20\n-382.23, and the disposal\nmethod criteria in sections\n382.30\n-382.35; (ii)\nthe nature and probability of the\nimpacts on public health and safety, including predictable adverse effects from\naccidents during the transportation of waste to such land disposal facilities, contamination of ground or surface water by leaching and runoff from the land\ndisposal facilities, and fires or explosions from improper storage or disposal\nof volatile, combustible or potentially explosive materials, if any, which may\ncompose a portion of the waste to be delivered to such land disposal\nfacilities; (iii)\nthe potential for\navoidance or mitigation of harm from the unanticipated release of waste or\ncontaminated materials; (iv)\nthe\nnature of the probable impact of a land disposal facility on local governmental\nunits within which such land disposal facilities would be located; (v) the comparative economic implications, including those resulting from engineering considerations, of the potential\nsite or sites and disposal methods for such land disposal facilities; (vi)\nthe safety of workers at a potential\nland disposal facility, including the likelihood of accidental injuries at the\nland disposal facility and the probable radiation dose to workers during normal\noperations; (vii)\nthe nature of the\nprobable environmental impacts, including the predictable adverse effects on\nthe natural environment and ecology, scenic, historic, agricultural, cultural\nand recreational values, water and air quality, and wildlife; (viii)\nthe ability for retrieval or recovery\nof waste; and\n(ix)\nthe adequacy of\nroutes and means for transportation of waste to such land disposal\nfacilities. (2)\n\nThe\ncommission must select one or two proposed sites which can meet the\nrequirements of sections\n382.10\nthrough\n382.35\nof this Part and the\ncapacity requirements in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. For each proposed\nsite, the commission must select one or more proposed disposal methods which\ncan meet the requirements of sections\n382.10\nthrough\n382.35\nof this Part and the\ncapacity requirement in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe proposed site or sites must be of\nsufficient total capacity to provide, using the proposed disposal method or\nmethods, for disposal of all waste estimated by the commission to be generated\nin New York State and to require disposal in a land disposal facility for a\nperiod of at least 30 years beginning on January 1, 1993. Only waste containing\nor contaminated with radioactive materials may be disposed at the land disposal\nfacility. (b) Site\ncharacterization studies. (1)\n\nThe commission\nor other applicant must perform studies, including onsite investigations and\nmonitoring, to characterize the proposed site or sites in order to demonstrate\nthat the proposed site or sites can meet the requirements of sections\n382.10\nthrough\n382.35\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe commission or other applicant may\nconsult with the department in developing plans for site characterization\nstudies. The department may provide specific guidance to the commission or\nother applicant regarding the requirements for such studies. In developing that\nguidance, the department may seek and consider recommendations from the\npublic. (3)\n\nThe commission or other\napplicant must submit its proposed plan for site characterization studies and a\ndescription of the proposed quality assurance (QA) program for such studies to\nthe department for the department's review prior to undertaking the studies. The QA program must meet the provisions of the United States Nuclear Regulatory\n\nCommission's publication, \"Quality Assurance Guidance for a Low-Level\n\nRadioactive Waste Disposal Facility\" (NUREG-1293) Revision 1, April 1991. (See\nsection\n382.99\nof this Part.) The\ncommission or other applicant need not submit the entire plan to the department\nat one time, but may submit portions of the plan for review, as\nappropriate. (4)\n\nThe site\ncharacterization studies must include onsite and, where appropriate, offsite\nmonitoring to provide basic environmental data on the characteristics of the\nproposed site or sites and the surrounding area and the proposed site's or\nsites' suitability for the proposed disposal method or methods. The data must\ndescribe the proposed site's or sites' ecology, meteorology, climate (including\nlikely long-term changes to climate), hydrology, geology, geochemistry, seismology and radioactivity. The studies must identify the known natural\nresources at the proposed site or sites, the exploitation of which could result\nin inadvertent intrusion into the low-level radioactive wastes after the period\nof institutional control. With reference to the proposed site or sites and the\narea around them, information about the population distribution and density\n(including seasonal variations), scenic, cultural, recreational, archaeological\nand historical resources, socioeconomics, agriculture, and other current land\nuses (including seasonal activities) must be collected. The characterization\nstudies must include any other information necessary to make the demonstrations\nrequired by subparagraphs (d)(1)(vii) and (xi) of this section. For those\ncharacteristics that are subject to seasonal variation, data must be collected\nfor at least one continuous 12-month period. (c) Pre-application procedures. (1)\n\nPrior to preparation of the application\nfor certification, the commission must consult with the department regarding\nthe form and content of the application, and the department must provide\nspecific guidance to the commission in a timely manner. (2)\n\nThe commission must hold at least one\npublic scoping meeting to receive public comments on the scope of a draft\nenvironmental impact statement to be prepared regarding the commission's\napplication for certification. (3)\n\nPrior to preparation of the draft environmental impact statement, the\ncommission must submit, for the department's approval, its proposed scope of\nthe draft environmental impact statement. Within 15 calendar days of receiving\nthe proposed scope, the department must either notify the commission that the\nproposed scope is approved, or inform the commission of the deficiencies in the\nproposed scope. If the department fails to notify the commission of its\ndecision within that 15 days, the scope will be deemed approved. (d) Contents of complete\napplication for certification. (1)\nA complete\napplication for certification of one or two proposed sites and one or more\nproposed disposal methods must contain the following information: (i) a narrative description of the site and\ndisposal method selection process the commission followed in choosing the\nproposed site or sites and proposed disposal method or methods, including an\nexplanation of how the siting and disposal method selection criteria in\nsections\n382.20\n-382.23 and 382.30-382.35 of\nthis Part were incorporated into the process and a description of the data\nrelied upon, assumptions made and calculations performed; (ii)\nthe estimated capacity required pursuant\nto paragraph (a)(3) of this section and a description of the method used to\ndetermine the estimated volume of each class of waste to be disposed, including\nthe data relied upon, assumptions made and calculations performed; (iii)\na description of the types and an\nestimate of the quantities of low-level radioactive waste to be received, possessed and disposed of; (iv)\na\ndescription of any plans for use of the land disposal facility or facilities\nfor purposes other than disposal of low-level radioactive wastes; (v) a description of the location and size of\nthe proposed site or sites and maps of suitable scale, including copies of New\n\nYork State Department of Transportation planimetric maps, topographic series, to a scale of 1:24,000, corrected to reflect current municipal boundaries, marked to show the location of the proposed site or sites; (vi)\na description of the proposed disposal\nmethod or methods and equipment and any ancillary facilities for preparing the\nwaste for disposal, including a conceptual design and proposed plan for closure\nand stabilization in sufficient detail to reveal the features which will be\nrelied upon to make the demonstrations required by subparagraph (xi) of this\nparagraph; (vii)\na description of\nthe natural characteristics of the proposed site or sites as determined by any\nstudies done by the commission during the site selection process and the site\ncharacterization studies.
