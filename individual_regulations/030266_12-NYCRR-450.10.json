Tit. 12 § 450.10 - Safety groups\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employers insured in the State Fund may be formed into safety groups for the\npurpose of accident prevention and earning of dividends. Rules and regulations\nconsistent with the purposes for which the Fund was created shall be\nformulated, with the approval of the commissioners, for the formation and\nconduct of such safety groups and proper evidence of approval of such rules by\na majority of the membership of each such safety group so formed shall be\nfurnished to the Fund. (b) Accountings of premiums, losses, expenses and other charges for each such group\nshall be rendered at appropriate intervals and if the balance remaining to the\ncredit of the group, at the close of any policy period, after due consideration\nfor contingencies, is deemed adequate for such purpose, a dividend may be\ncredited or paid to each individual member of the group in an amount equal to\nsuch proportion of said balance as the amount of the member's earned premium\nbears to the total earned premium of the group for that policy period. Such\ndividends may be declared on recommendation of the actuary and approval of the\nexecutive director. (See Part 451 for Basic Rules for Safety Groups.)\n(c) An existing Fund safety group manager, with the written consent of the Executive Director, shall be authorized, with\nrespect to the claims of group members or any policyholder which the Fund\nactuary determines to have anticipated claims in volume equivalent to or in\nexcess of that paid by a safety group, to administer claims, medical\nexaminations and services in a manner consistent with the provisions of\nsections\n450.6, 450.7, and\n450.9\nof this Part. In authorizing\na safety group manager to act under these sections the Executive Director shall\ndetermine that such consent is consistent with providing the policyholder with\nthe lowest cost insurance consistent with the solvency of the Fund. The\n\nExecutive Director shall have the right to rescind any authorization given to a\nsafety group manager pursuant to this subdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
