  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 312.3 - Restrictions and Exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No State\nagency operating in the State shall install or cause to be installed any new or\nreplacement permanent outdoor fixture unless the following conditions are met: (1)\n\nIn the case of roadway lighting or\nparking-lot lighting, whether mounted to poles, buildings or other structures, the fixture is fully shielded. (2)\n\nIn the case of building-mounted fixtures not specifically intended for roadway\nlighting, parking-lot lighting, or facade lighting, the fixture is fully\nshielded when its initial fixture lumens is greater than 3,000 lumens. (3)\n\nIn the case of facade\nlighting, the fixture is shielded to reduce glare, sky glow, and light trespass\nto the greatest extent possible. (4)\n\nIn the case of ornamental roadway\nlighting fixtures, the fixture allows no more than 700 lumens from the fixture\nabove a horizontal plane through the fixture's lowest light emitting part. (5)\n\nFor illumination by new\npermanent outdoor fixtures for applications described in paragraph (1), (2), (3) or (4) of this subdivision, only illuminance levels that are no greater\nthan those required for the intended purpose may be used, in accordance with\nthe industry standards set forth in Section\n312.4. (6)\n\nIn the case of roadway lighting\nunassociated with intersections of two or more streets or highways, the\n\nDepartment of Transportation has determined that the purpose of the lighting\ninstallation or replacement cannot be achieved by installation of reflectorized\nroadway markers, lines, warnings or informational signs, or other passive\nmeans. (b) This Part\nshall not apply: (1)\nif a federal law, rule\nor regulation preempts State law; (2)\nif the outdoor lighting fixture is used\ntemporarily by emergency personnel requiring additional illumination for\nemergency procedures or temporarily used by repair personnel for road repair; (3)\nto navigational lighting\nsystems and other lighting necessary for aviation and nautical safety; (4)\nto lighting for athletic\nplaying areas; provided, however, that all such lighting shall be selected and\ninstalled to shield the lamp or lamps from direct view and to minimize upward\nlighting and glare to the greatest extent possible; (5)\nif the State agency determines a safety\nor security need exists that cannot be addressed by any other method; (6)\nto the replacement of a\npreviously installed permanent outdoor fixture that is destroyed, damaged or\ninoperative, has experienced electrical failure due to failed components, or\nrequires standard maintenance; (7)\nto lighting intended for tunnels and roadway underpasses; or\n(8)\nif the combined cost of acquiring and\noperating a fixture complying with paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subdivision\n(a) of this section is more than 15% greater than the cost of acquiring and\noperating comparable non-compliant fixtures over the life of the lighting\nsystem and if a writ- ten determination with findings has been made that no\ncompliant fixture exists that would meet the cost limitation.
