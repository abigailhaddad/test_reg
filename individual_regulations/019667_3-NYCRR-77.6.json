Tit. 3 § 77.6 - Leasing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to\n\nBanking Law, sections 235(28-b) and 380-j, a savings bank and a savings and\nloan association may acquire and lease personal property. (b) Such leases are subject only to the same\nlimitations as are imposed on such investments for commercial banks or trust\ncompanies under Banking Law, section 96(12) and, to the extent they are deemed\nto be loans, to individual borrowing limitations. (c) For loan limit purposes, such leases are\nconsidered to be secured loans to the lessee except to the extent there is a\nnet unrecovered investment at the end of the lease term. To that extent, the\nlease is considered an unsecured loan. (d) Lease payments are considered to be in\nthe nature of rent and not interest. (e) All leases authorized hereunder must be\non a nonoperating basis. For instance, for purposes of automobile leasing, the\nsavings bank or savings and loan association may not directly or indirectly, provide for the servicing, repair or maintenance of the leased vehicle during\nthe lease term; purchase parts and accessories in bulk or for an individual\nvehicle after the lessee has taken delivery of the vehicle; provide for the\nloan of an automobile during servicing of the leased vehicle; purchase\ninsurance for the lessee; or provide for the renewal of the vehicle's license\nmerely as a service to the lessee where the lessee could renew the license\nwithout authorization from the lessor.
