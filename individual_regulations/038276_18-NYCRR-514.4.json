  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 514.4 - Medicaid eligibility terminal (MET)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The MET is an electronic device which\npermits a provider to verify MA recipient eligibility immediately through\nEMEVS. Any provider who establishes a need to the department's satisfaction may\nrequest the department to provide a MET. (b) The department may require a provider to\nverify MA recipient eligibility by using a MET if the department determines\nthat the provider's claims or orders for MA care, services or supplies meet or\nexceed one or more of the criteria set forth below: (1)\nthe dollar value of claims submitted or\ncare, services or supplies ordered by the provider for the prior 12 month\nperiod exceeds $75,000; or\n(2)\nthe\ndollar value of claims submitted or care, services or supplies ordered by the\nprovider for a weekly period, when projected to a yearly period, will exceed\n$75,000; or\n(3)\nthe number of\nclaims submitted by the provider or amount paid to the provider for a quarterly\nperiod places the provider in the upper quartile of a rank order listing of\nbillers in the applicable provider type; or\n(4)\nthe claims submitted by the provider\nindicate frequent, repetitive encounters with recipients or repetitive\ndispensing patterns; or\n(5)\nthe\nclaims submitted by the provider for a weekly period indicate an increase of 10\npercent or more in total amount billed, average cost per claim or average cost\nper recipient encounter from the previous quarter; or\n(6)\nthe claims submitted by the provider for\na quarterly period exceed by two standard deviations or more the average number\nof claims per recipient encounter submitted or average dollar value of claims\nper recipient encounter submitted by billers in the applicable provider\ntype. (c) If a provider\nis required to use a MET by the department, the provider must continue the use\nof the MET until such time as the department informs the provider in writing\nthat MET use by the provider is no longer mandatory. Not less than one year\nafter a provider has been required to use a MET, the provider may request that\nthe department rescind its order for mandatory MET use by such provider on the\nground that the provider's billings during the yearly period preceding such\nrequest do not fall within any of the criteria set forth in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (d) METS will be\nprovided by the department without charge to providers who establish a need and\nto providers who are required to use them. METS supplied by the department\nremain the property of the department. (e) If the department requires a provider to\nuse a MET, the provider must use the MET verification procedure unless the MET\nor EMEVS is not functioning. Any MET or EMEVS problems should be reported\nimmediately through the emergency telephone numbers set forth in the EMEVS\nprovider manual. (f) When the\nprovider who has been required to use a MET is unable to use the METbecause the\nMET or EMEVS is not functioning, the provider must verify eligibility by\naccessing EMEVS by telephone. (g) If a provider who is required to use a MET does not use the MET verification\nprocedure or the alternative telephone verification procedure, payments for any\nclaims submitted where eligibility was not verified will be denied. If the\ndepartment finds a significant number of unjustified failures by the provider\nto use the MET, the department may treat such provider failures as an\nunacceptable practice under Part 515 of this Title.
