(2)\n\nThe\nrules and forms governing the registration and filing of such labels, brands\nand marks may be obtained from the Commissioner of Labor's office located in\n\nBuilding 12, State Office Building Campus, Albany, NY 12240, or at 345 Hudson\n\nStreet, New York, NY 10014. Notice of the filing of such application shall be\ngiven by the commissioner to interested persons and unions in such manner as\nthe commissioner shall by rule prescribe. (3)\n\nWithin 20 days following such notice by\nthe commissioner, any union or aggrieved person may submit to the commissioner\na written objection to the registration of the device. If no objection is\nsubmitted, the commissioner may register the device and issue a certificate of\nregistration. (4)\n\nObjections duly\nfiled with the commissioner are promptly referred to the board for a\ndetermination on whether the registration should be granted or\ndenied. (5)\n\nThe board may deny\nregistration of a device on any of the following grounds: (i) that the union or association of\nemployees filing the application for registration is not a bona fide\nunion; (ii)\nthat the union or\nassociation of employees filing the application for registration is not the\nrightful owner thereof; (iii)\nthat\nthe union or association of employees filing the application for registration\nhas made misrepresentations concerning the device; or\n(iv)\nthat the device sought to be registered\nby the union or association of employees is so similar to a device previously\nregistered by a union or association of employees that it is calculated to\ndeceive. (d) Revocation proceedings. Section 208, subdivision 4, provides: \"4. On petition of a union or aggrieved person, the\nregistration of any device may be revoked by the board if it determines that\nthe registration was granted improperly or was obtained fraudulently.\"\nNotes\nN.Y.
