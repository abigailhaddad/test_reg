  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-7.2 - Design and construction requirements applicable to all disposal methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The land\ndisposal facility and associated facilities and systems must be designed and\nconstructed in accordance with standard engineering and/or construction\npractices. (b) The design and\nconstruction of the land disposal facility must be carried out under the\ndirection of a licensed engineer. The licensed engineer will be responsible for\nobserving, documenting, and certifying that the design and construction of the\nland disposal facility comply with the requirements of this Part and the\npermit. All engineering certifications must bear the engineer's seal and\nsignature, and the date of certification. (c) To provide for quality assurance during\ndesign and construction, the applicant must: (1)\nimplement a quality assurance and quality\ncontrol (QA/QC) program during all engineering design activities and submit\ndocumentation of the QA/QC program in the application for a permit; (2)\ndevelop a QA/QC program for construction\nto control the procurement of materials and equipment and all construction\nactivities; (3)\nsubmit the\nconstruction QA/QC program as part of the application for a permit; and\n(4)\nimplement the construction\nQA/QC program, as approved by the department in the permit. (d) The construction QA/QC program\nrequired by subdivision (c) of this section must incorporate testing protocols\nfor construction including: (1)\nthe frequency\nof inspection; (2)\nfield\ntesting; (3)\nsampling and field\ntesting procedures and equipment to be utilized; (4)\nthe calibration of field testing\nequipment; (5)\nthe frequency of\nperformance audits; (6)\nthe\nlaboratory procedures to be followed including equipment calibration; (7)\nQA/QC of laboratory procedures; (8)\nthe limits for test failure; and\n(9)\na description of the\ncorrective procedures to be used upon test failure. (e) Both QA/QC programs required by\nsubdivision (c) of this section must: (1)\ninclude all of the QA criteria listed in the United States Nuclear Regulatory\n\nCommission's publication, Quality Assurance Guidance for a Low-Level\n\nRadioactive Waste Disposal Facility(NUREG-1293), Revision 1, April 1991 (see\nsection\n383-1.8\nof this Part); and\n(2)\ncontain provisions for\nauditing the effectiveness of the programs and implementing any necessary\ncorrections to the programs. (f) The permittee must submit a construction\ncertification report to the department within 45 days after completion of each\nmajor phase of the land disposal facility construction as defined in the\npermit. This report must reference the project information submitted and\napproved in accordance with the application requirements of Subpart 383-3 of\nthis Part and must include the following: (1)\ndocumentation and certification that the land disposal facility has been\nconstructed in accordance with the engineering plans and specifications\napproved in the permit and in accordance with the construction requirements of\nthis Subpart; (2)\ndocumentation and\ncertification that all materials meet the materials requirements of the design\nspecifications approved in the permit; (3)\nresults of all quality assurance and\nquality control testing performed, including: (i) documentation of any failed test\nresults; (ii)\ndescriptions of\nprocedures used to remove, replace, or correct any improperly installed\nmaterial or equipment; and\n(iii)\ndocumentation of all retesting performed. (4)\nconstruction record drawings (i.e., as-built drawings) and a comprehensive narrative including daily reports from\nthe engineer responsible for overseeing construction and a series of colored\nphotographs showing the progress of construction of major project features. The\nreport and each record drawing must be certified and stamped by a licensed\nengineer. (g) Survey\ncontrol. Survey control for design and construction must be established in\naccordance with Subpart 383-11 of this Part. (h) Seismic design. Disposal units and other\nstructures that may be used to house waste at any time must be designed to\nremain functional during and following subjection to inertia forces resulting\nfrom the design basis ground motion, as defined in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. The seismic analysis and design must be performed by individuals\nwith relevant qualifications and experience. The seismic design must be based\non the following analyses: (1)\n\nGround motions. Ground motions must be defined in terms of both peak ground motions and\nresponse spectra. The acceleration time histories necessary to perform the\nanalyses required by paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision must be\nconsistent with the response spectral estimates in the period range of\ninterest. (2)\n\nMethodology. Both\ndeterministic/statistical and probabilistic methods must be used to determine\nthe design basis ground motion. Probabilistic estimates of ground motion must\ninclude the effects of all potential sources surrounding the site. Earthquake\nrecurrence models must be established for each source. Source geometry and\nground motion attenuation variability must be taken into account. Where\npossible, uncertainty in any of the above inputs must be included in the\nanalysis. The basis of deterministic/statistical estimates must include\nsite-specific information. A target magnitude and a distance or distance range\nmust be selected based on either the MCE of each potential source surrounding\nthe site or on the magnitude range which most influences the hazard, as\ndetermined from the probabilistic analysis. In cases where the distance from\nsite to source is well defined, estimates of median ground motion may be made\nby means of an acceptable ground motion attenuation relationship. In cases\nwhere the site lies within a source region, ground motions may be defined by\nestimating the median ground motions of a suite of accelerograms recorded at\nsites having similar properties, in the near field of earthquakes which\noccurred in similar tectonic environments and whose magnitude is within 0.5\nmagnitude units of the target magnitude. (3)\n\nDesign basis ground motion. The design\nbasis ground motion shall be: (i) the\nprobabilistic estimate having a mean annual exceedance probability of 10-3\n(i.e., an average return period of 1000 years); or\n(ii)\nthe largest deterministic/statistical\nestimate; or\n(iii)\nthe ground\nmotions which most severely affect or control the design of individual site\nfeatures. In cases where the implied annual exceedance probability\nof the largest deterministic/statistical estimate differs significantly\n(greater than a half order of magnitude) from 10-3, a review of assumptions is\nrequired to determine the reason for the discrepancy. (4)\n\nSite response analysis. A site\nresponse analysis must be performed to numerically evaluate the soil response\ndue to the design basis ground motion. The site response analysis must be based\non modelling appropriate to the soil behavior and the site topography. The\nresults of the analysis must describe the motion at the ground surface by means\nof time histories and/or response spectra. Three-dimensional and nonlinear\neffects must be incorporated into the analysis as necessary where such effects\nare significant. Site response analysis is not required for structures founded\non rock or soil deposits which can be shown will not alter the magnitude and\nfrequency characteristics of the ground motion. (5)\n\nSeismic analysis of structures. A seismic\nanalysis must be performed to evaluate the performance of the disposal units\nand other structures that may be used to house waste at any time when subjected\nto the motion at the ground surface estimated in the analyses required by\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision. The seismic analysis of the disposal units\nmay be performed either by direct integration methods or by modal analyses. Soil-structure interaction effects and nonlinear and three-dimensional effects\nmust also be incorporated as necessary where such effects are\nsignificant. (i) The\nland disposal facility must be designed and constructed to ensure that the\ncombined releases of radioactivity to the environment due to all site\nactivities comply with section\n382.11\nof this Title. (j) The land disposal facility must be\ndesigned and constructed to comply with sections 382.20 through\n382.35\nof this Title. (k) A land disposal facility authorized\npursuant to section\n1854-c\nof the Public Authorities Law must\nbe designed and constructed to comply with the terms and conditions of the\ncertification issued by the department in accordance with Part 382 of this\n\nTitle. (l) The disposal units must\nbe designed and constructed to accommodate gas generation, in a manner that\nprovides reasonable assurance that the performance objectives will be\nmet. (m) The design and\nconstruction of the disposal units must be compatible with the operating\nrequirements of waste emplacement and with unit closure and post-closure\nrequirements. (n) Unless otherwise\nauthorized by the department, the land disposal facility must be designed and\nconstructed to provide for disposal of Class B and C waste in disposal units\nseparate from those containing Class A waste. The department may authorize the\ndisposal of Class A waste with Class B and C waste if the Class A waste meets\nthe stability requirements of section\n382.81\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (o) All waste handling and\ntreatment facilities, including any incinerators, must be designed and\nconstructed to facilitate access for operation, inspection, testing, and\nmaintenance. Releases of radioactivity from these facilities to the environment\nmust be maintained as low as reasonably achievable. (p) The land disposal facility must be\ndesigned and constructed to include the monitoring systems required by Subpart\n383-10 of this Part. (q) The land\ndisposal facility developed pursuant to section\n1854-c\nof the Public Authorities Law must\nbe designed and constructed to provide disposal units of capacity sufficient\nfor the disposal of all low-level radioactive wastes, as estimated by the\ncommission and approved or amended by the decision of the department pursuant\nto section\n382.6\n(f)(6)\nof\nthis Title, to be generated in New York State and requiring disposal in a land\ndisposal facility for a period of at least 30 years beginning on January 1, 1993. (r) The land disposal\nfacility must be designed and constructed to minimize safety hazards to all\npersons on the site. (s) The land\ndisposal facility must be designed and constructed to provide sufficient space\nfor repairs of disposal units, as well as recovery or retrieval of waste, if\napplicable, without interfering with other disposal units or operations on the\ndisposal site.

(u) The land disposal facility must include\nlandscaping designed by a licensed landscape architect. (v) The land disposal facility design and\nconstruction must incorporate the provisions for site security required by\nsections 383-14.2 and\n383-14.3\nof this Part. (w) Except for the spoils resulting from\nconstruction of an underground mined repository, construction and demolition\ndebris from on-site construction must remain on the site and be disposed of\npursuant to Part 360 of this Title. Mine spoils may be sold or used off\nsite. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-7.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
