  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.24 - Advance Notice of Motions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Nothing in this rule shall be\nconstrued to prevent or limit counsel from making any motion deemed appropriate\nto best represent a party's interests. However, in order to permit the court\nthe opportunity to resolve issues before motion practice ensues, and to control\nits calendar in the context of the discovery and trial schedule, pre-motion\nconferences in accordance herewith must be held. The failure of counsel to\ncomply with this rule may result in the motion being held in abeyance until the\ncourt has an opportunity to conference the matter. (b) This rule shall not apply\nto disclosure disputes covered by Rule 14 of this subdivision nor to\ndispositive motions pursuant to CPLR 3211, 3212 or 3213 made at the time of the\nfiling of the request for judicial intervention or after discovery is complete. Nor shall the rule apply to motions to be relieved as counsel, for pro hac vice\nadmission, for reargument or in limine. (c) Prior to the making or filing of a\nmotion, counsel for the moving party shall advise the court in writing (no more\nthan two pages) on notice to opposing counsel outlining the issue(s) in dispute\nand requesting a telephone conference. If a cross-motion is contemplated, a\nsimilar motion notice letter shall be forwarded to the court and counsel. Such\ncorrespondence shall not be considered by the court in reaching its decision on\nthe merits of the motion. (d) Upon review of the motion notice\nletter, the court will schedule a telephone or in-court conference with\ncounsel. Counsel fully familiar with the matter and with authority to bind\ntheir client must be available to participate in the conference. The\nunavailability of counsel for the scheduled conference, except for good cause\nshown, may result in granting of the application without opposition and/or the\nimposition of sanctions. (e) If the matter can be resolved during\nthe conference, an order consistent with such resolution may be issued or\ncounsel will be directed to forward a letter confirming the resolution to be\n\"so ordered.\" At the discretion of the court, the conference may be held on the\nrecord. (f) If the\nmatter cannot be resolved, the parties shall set a briefing schedule for the\nmotion which shall be approved by the court. Except for good cause shown, the\nfailure to comply with the briefing schedule may result in the submission of\nthe motion unopposed or the dismissal of the motion, as may be\nappropriate. (g) On\nthe face of all notices of motion and orders to show cause, there shall be a\nstatement that there has been compliance with this rule. (h) Where a motion must be made\nwithin a certain time pursuant to the CPLR, the submission of a motion notice\nletter, as provided in subdivision (a) of this rule, within the prescribed time\nshall be deemed the timely making of the motion. This subdivision shall not be\nconstrued to extend any jurisdictional limitations period. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\nr. 202.70.24.
