(1)\n\nFor provisional\ncertification in a certificate title in the classroom teaching service for\nwhich this Part requires completion of an examination requirement, the\ncommissioner may issue to a candidate who has not met such examination\nrequirement a two-year nonrenewable conditional provisional certification, notwithstanding that the examination requirement has not been met, and deem\nthat all other requirements for the provisional teacher's certificate in the\ncertificate title in the classroom teaching service have been met, provided\nthat the candidate holds a valid regular teacher's certificate in the same or\nan equivalent title by a state which has contracted with the State of New York\npursuant to section\n3030\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the interstate agreement on the qualifications of educational\npersonnel, and provided further that such regular teacher's certificate issued\nby the other state evidences knowledge, skills, and abilities comparable to\nthose required for certification in New York State. For individuals called to\nactive duty with the Armed Forces, the two-year nonrenewable conditional\nprovisional may be extended by the commissioner for the time of active service\nand an additional 12 months from the end of such service. To meet the\nrequirements for a full provisional certificate in such certificate title, the\ncandidate shall be required to submit to the commissioner, at least 60 days\nprior to the expiration of the conditional provisional certification, satisfactory evidence of meeting the examination requirement for the\nprovisional certificate title sought, as prescribed in this Part. If the\ncandidate meets such examination requirement, the commissioner shall issue a\nprovisional certificate for the term commencing on the day after the expiration\ndate of the conditional provisional certificate and ending five years after the\neffective date of the conditional provisional certificate. This paragraph shall\nnot apply to a candidate who holds a temporary license to teach in a\nprofessional position in the classroom teaching service on or after March 8, 2000. (2)\n\nFor provisional\ncertification in a certificate title in the classroom teaching service for\nwhich this Part does not require completion of an examination requirement, the\ncommissioner may deem that all requirements for the provisional teacher's\ncertificate in the classroom teaching service have been met by a candidate who\nholds a valid regular teacher's certificate in the same or an equivalent title\nby a state which has contracted with the State of New York pursuant to section\n3030\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the interstate agreement on the qualifications of educational\npersonnel, provided that such regular teacher's certificate issued by the other\nstate evidences knowledge, skills, and abilities comparable to those required\nfor certification in New York State. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may deem that all\nrequirements for a provisional teacher's certificate in a title in the\nclassroom teaching service have been met by a candidate who holds a valid\nteacher's certificate in the same or an equivalent title issued by any state\nand also holds a certificate in the same or an equivalent title issued by the\n\nNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards. (4)\nA candidate may meet the educational\npreparation requirements for a provisional certificate in a certificate title\nprescribed in this Part by successfully completing a program of educational\npreparation for a teacher's certificate in such certificate title or its\nequivalent at an institution of higher education approved pursuant to section\n3030\nof the\n\nEducation Law, the interstate agreement on the qualifications of educational\npersonnel.
