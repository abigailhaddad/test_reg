  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 510.1 - Scope and Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nNew York State Legislature has established greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions\nreduction mandates in New York State to 40% below 1990 levels by 2030 and then\nto 85% below 1990 levels by 2050. The State Energy Conservation Construction\n\nCode (Energy Code) is an important regulatory tool to assist in achieving these\ngoals. The New York State Fire Prevention and Building Code Council (Code\n\nCouncil) is authorized to review and amend the Energy Code, or adopt a new\n\nEnergy Code, through the promulgation of rules and regulations. To amend the\n\nEnergy Code, the Code Council must determine that the Energy Code remains cost\neffective with respect to building construction in the State. The Code\n\nCouncil's cost-effective determination must include a lifecycle cost analysis; and the value of societal effects, such as reductions in GHG\nemissions. (b) The purpose of this\n\nPart is to\n(1)\nestablish a methodology for\ndetermining whether the life-cycle costs for a building will be recovered\nthrough savings in energy costs over the design life of the building under a\nlifecycle cost analysis; (2)\ndefine\nsecondary or societal effects to be considered in the cost effectiveness\ndetermination; and\n(3)\nprovide a\nmethod for quantifying the societal effects so that they can be added to the\nlifecycle costs. This Part implements amendments to paragraph (a) of\nsubdivision 2 of section\n11-103\nof the\n\nEnergy Law, as enacted by the \"Advanced Building Codes, Appliance and Equipment\n\nEfficiency Standards Act of 2022.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n510.1\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register June 18, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 25, eff. 6/18/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
