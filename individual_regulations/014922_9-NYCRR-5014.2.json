  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5014.2 - Courier license application and evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application. An applicant for a courier service license shall file an\napplication in a form provided by the commission. An applicant shall have an\nongoing duty to supplement such application as may be necessary to maintain\nupdated information and accuracy. In addition to other requirements the\ncommission may establish, such application shall describe how the audit and\nfinancial controls, technical standards and internal controls proposed for\napplicant's network will comply with the requirements of this Title. (b) Evaluation of\napplication. In evaluating an application for a courier service\nlicense, the commission shall consider such factors as: (1)\nfinancial responsibility and security of\nthe business or activity in which such person is engaged; (2)\nsufficiency of existing lottery sales\nagent and courier service licenses to serve the public convenience; (3)\nwhether the proposed network is\npredominantly frequented by persons under the age of 18 years; (4)\nvolume of expected sales; (5)\nconviction of any offense as defined in\nthe Penal Law; (6)\nveracity and\ncompleteness of information supplied on the application form or any supplement\nthereto; (7)\napplicant's\nindebtedness, if any, to State or local government; (8)\nbusiness experience operating a\nnetwork; (9)\nreputation of the\napplicant; (10)\nwhether the audit\nand financial controls, technical standards, internal controls, proposed for\napplicant's network comply with the requirements of this Part; and\n(11)\nwhether the application submitted\ncontains a business plan demonstrating that compliance with all conditions of a\ncourier service license is achievable. (c) Temporary licenses. The commission may issue a temporary courier service\nlicense to an applicant on a provisional basis pending completion of an initial\napplication review process. As a condition to the issuance of a temporary\nservice license, the applicant shall waive any right to a hearing or to\nchallenge any commission decision in regard to a temporary courier service\nlicense. Any such temporary courier service license may be issued only\nif: (1)\nthe applicant has filed a\ncomplete application with the commission; (2)\nthe completed application, on the face of\nsuch application, discloses no grounds from which the commission readily may\nascertain that there are reasonable grounds to deny the application; and\n(3)\nthe commission receives and\nreviews a fingerprint report from the New York State Division of Criminal\n\nJustice Services and Federal Bureau of Investigation that does not indicate any\ngrounds to withhold a temporary approval. (d) Cooperation required. An applicant for a courier service license shall\ncooperate fully with the commission in the course of the application process. Failure to cooperate with the commission shall be a violation of this section\nand shall be in itself sufficient grounds for denial of such license\napplication. (e) Commission reservation of rights. Nothing in this Title prohibits the commission itself\nfrom engaging in the sale of lottery tickets through a network the commission\noperates or that is operated on the commission's behalf.
