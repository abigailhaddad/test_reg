  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 526.8 - Tangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1101(b)(6)\n(a) Definition. The term\ntangible personal property\nmeans\ncorporeal personal property of any nature having a material existence and\nperceptibility to the human senses. Tangible personal property includes, without limitation: (1)\nraw materials, such as wood, metal, rubber and minerals; (2)\nmanufactured items, such as gasoline, oil, chemicals, jewelry, furniture, machinery, clothing, vehicles, appliances, lighting fixtures, building materials; (3)\nartistic items, such as sketches, paintings, photographs, moving picture films and recordings; (4)\nanimals, trees, shrubs, plants and\nseeds; (5)\nwater; (6)\ncoins and other numismatic items, when\npurchased for purposes other than for use as a medium of exchange; (7)\npostage stamps, when purchased for\npurposes other than mailing; and\n(8)\nprecious metals in the form of bullion, ingots, wafers and other forms. (b) Gas, electricity, refrigeration and steam\nare not considered tangible personal property for the purpose of the tax\nimposed on utility services. Gas sold in containers or in bulk for purposes\nother than heating, cooking or lighting is considered tangible personal\nproperty. See section\n527.2\nof this Subchapter. (c) Tangible\npersonal property does not include: (1)\nreal\nproperty; (2)\nintangible personal\nproperty. Example 1: A corporation has bonds printed. It purchases paper, which\nis tangible personal property, printing and signature services, and must pay\nthe tax on these charges. When the corporation issues the bonds as evidence of\nindebtedness, the bonds at this point in time are not tangible personal\nproperty subject to the sales tax. If, after the bonds are redeemed by the\ncorporation, the bonds are sold for display or collection purposes, they become\ntangible personal property which is subject to the sales tax. (d) Property sold as tangible\npersonal property, and subsequently annexed to real property, or which becomes\npart of real property, is nevertheless considered tangible personal property at\nthe time of sale.
