The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 309 Laws of 1926, shall apply to all natural and artificial reservoirs on the north branch of Clear Creek and to all watercourses tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into said reservoirs, these bodies of water being sources of the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital at Collins, Erie County, New York. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term reservoir whenever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to all storage and impounding reservoirs on Clear Creek which are tributary to or which shall serve as sources of this public water supply or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purposes of this public water supply. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of any kind, the waters of which when running whether continuously or otherwise eventually flow or may flow into the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourses. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of any reservoir or within 50 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital, except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d). (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 500 feet of any reservoir or within 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital. (3)\n\nNo cesspool, pit or other receptacle of any kind which is used for the deposit or storage of human excreta or sewage shall be constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision unless said cesspool, pit or other receptacle is so arranged and equipped that the said excreta or sewage are at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, or unless suitable removable vessels or receptacles for the temporary storage of said human excreta or sewage are provided and at all times maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and in such manner as to permit of convenient removal of said excreta or sewage to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles permitted, under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 18 inches below the surface and at a distance not less than 500 feet from any reservoir or 200 feet from any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital and in such a manner and at such a place as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of or through the ground in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital. (6)\n\nWhenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or to other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, house slops, sink wastes, etc. (1)\n\nNo house slops, bath water, sewage or other excretal matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape in any manner either directly or indirectly into any reservoir or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital nor shall any such matters be thrown, placed, led, discharged or allowed to escape or flow on the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface, except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs (3) and (4) of subdivision (c), within 500 feet of any reservoir or within 100 feet of any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital. (2)\n\nNo sewage disposal plant, the effluent from which is to be discharged or allowed to flow directly or indirectly into any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital shall be constructed, enlarged, altered or put in operation until plans for the same shall have been submitted to and approved by the State engineer and a permit issued by the State Commissioner of Health, allowing the discharge of such effluent as required by law and a copy of the plans, as approved, filed with the Department of Mental Hygiene. (3)\n\nNo garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any creamery, cheese factory or laundry nor water in which milk cans, utensils, clothing, bedding, carpets or harness have been washed or rinsed nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind shall be thrown or discharged directly or indirectly into any reservoir or watercourse, nor shall any such liquid or solid refuse or waste be thrown, discharged or allowed to escape, flow or remain upon the surface of the ground or to percolate into or through the ground below the surface in any manner whereby the same may flow or percolate into any reservoir or watercourse within a distance of 300 feet from any reservoir or within 100 feet from any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the Gowanda State Hospital.
