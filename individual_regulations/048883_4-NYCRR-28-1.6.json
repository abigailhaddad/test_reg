Tit. 4 §§ 28-1.6 - Personal leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personal\nleave is leave with pay for personal business, including religious observance, without charge against accumulated vacation or overtime credits. Employees\nshall be entitled to personal leave, not exceeding a total of five days in a\nyear, to be credited as follows: (1)\n\nAn\nemployee credited with personal leave as provided under this section shall\ncontinue to be credited with five days' personal leave each year on the\nanniversary date of the date such employee was so credited. (2)\n\nAny person who was separated or granted a\nleave of absence without pay from State service prior to the effective date of\nthis Part and is hereafter reemployed or reinstated in State service, and any\nemployee who enters State service after the effective date of this Part, shall\nbe credited with five days' personal leave on the date of such reemployment, reinstatement or entry, as the case may be, and thereafter, except as herein\notherwise provided, shall be credited with five days' personal leave each year\non the anniversary of such date, and, for the purpose of crediting personal\nleave, a per diem or hourly paid employee shall be deemed to enter State\nservice on the date on which such employee becomes subject to the application\nof this Chapter or the date employed if it is anticipated the employee will\nbecome subject to this Chapter. (3)\n\nIf an employee is separated from State service, or granted a leave of absence\nwithout pay from State service, subsequent to the effective date of this Part, and thereafter is reinstated or reemployed within one year following the last\ndate upon which personal leave was credited, the unused personal leave standing\nto such employee's credit at the time of separation or leave of absence shall\nbe restored and such employee shall retain the same anniversary date for the\npurposes of crediting personal leave thereafter under this section as that\nwhich was applicable to such employee prior to such separation or leave of\nabsence. (4)\n\nIf an employee is\nseparated from State service, or granted a leave of absence without pay from\n\nState service, subsequent to the effective date of this Part, and thereafter is\nreinstated or reemployed more than one year following the last date upon which\npersonal leave was credited to the employee, such reinstatement or reemployment\nshall be deemed to be a new entry into State service for the purposes of\ncrediting personal leave under this Part. (5)\n\nIf an employee is appointed, promoted or\ntransferred to another department or agency, the unused personal leave standing\nto the credit of such an employee at the time of such appointment, promotion or\ntransfer shall also be transferred, and the employee shall retain the same\nanniversary date for purposes of crediting personal leave as that which was\napplicable prior to such appointment, promotion or transfer. (b) Personal leave shall not be\ncumulative, and any personal leave credit remaining unused by an employee on\nthe date immediately preceding the anniversary date upon which such employee is\nentitled to receive new personal leave credits hereunder shall be cancelled. Unused personal leave shall not be liquidated in cash at the time of\nseparation, retirement or death. (c) Personal leave may be drawn only at a\ntime convenient to and approved in advance by the appointing authority; provided, however, that personal leave allowed for religious observance shall\nbe granted on the days and hours required, insofar as the same may be granted\nat such time without interference with the proper conduct of government\nfunctions. (d) Personal leave may\nbe used in such units of time as the appointing authority may approve, but the\nappointing authority shall not require that personal leave be used in units\ngreater than one-quarter hour. (e) Personal leave may be used as vacation, subject to the prior approval of the\nappointing authority. The appointing authority may not require an employee to\ngive a reason for the use of personal leave, except where such reason may be\nrequired for the use of vacation for the same absence. (f) A part-time employee who is required to\nwork a fixed number of hours on a fixed schedule five days per week, or who is\nrequired to work at least half-time each biweekly pay period for a fixed number\nof hours on a fixed schedule, shall also receive personal leave as provided\nherein, but total pay when absent on such leave shall be the amount which would\nhave been due had such employee worked regularly at his/her usual hours for\nsuch period.
