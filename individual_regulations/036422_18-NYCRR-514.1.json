  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 514.1 - Policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In order to\navoid unnecessary processing of medical assistance (MA) claims, administrative\nexpense to the MA program, provider billing errors resulting in nonpayment of\nclaims and to reduce unacceptable provider practices, the department may\nrequire a provider to verify MA recipient eligibility. The department may also\nrequire a provider to verify orders for care, services or supplies. (b) A provider required to do so must verify\nMA recipient eligibility by making an inquiry to an electronic data system\nprior to furnishing any item of care, services or supplies for which payment\nwill be claimed under the MA program. A provider required to do so must make an\ninquiry to an electronic data system to determine whether an order for care, services or supplies has been posted in the electronic data system by the\nordering provider and is therefore subject to reimbursement if filled by the\ninquiring provider. (c) The\ndepartment may require a provider to verify recipient eligibility if the\ndepartment determines that the provider engages in a significant number or MA\ntransactions, or the provider's service profile exceeds the department's\nutilization control criteria. The department may require a provider to verify\norders for care, services or supplies if the provider engages in a significant\nnumber of MA transactions, or the provider's service profile exceeds the\ndepartment's utilization control criteria, or other circumstances warrant\nimposition of this control to assure validity of orders for care, services or\nsupplies. (d) A provider required\nto verify recipient eligibility or orders for care, services or supplies who\nfails to verify properly may have payment for claims under the MA program\nwithheld or denied or be subject to sanctions, as defined in Part 515 of this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n514.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
