(c) Utility procedure. A utility\nshall establish a written procedure and billing system to implement this\nsection, which procedure: (1)\nsets forth a\nmethod for establishing an eligible customer's monthly or bimonthly levelized\npayment amount which shall take into consideration the best available relevant\nfactors, including the utility's standard estimation factors, projected rates, fuel adjustment charges, and taxes; (2)\nsets forth a method for comparing the\nactual cost of service rendered, as determined by actual meter readings and any\nrate increases or decreases, to the levelized payment amount, and for adjusting\nupwards or downwards the levelized payment amount to minimize the adjustment\nrequired on the final settlement bill, which comparison shall be done not less\nthan two nor more than four times annually, and at the end of the plan\nyear; (3)\nprovides that each\nlevelized bill clearly identifies the total of the levelized payment amounts\nbilled and the total of the actual dollar value of the consumption used during\nthe period covered by the current bill; (4)\nprovides that a final levelized\nsettlement bill, which is rendered at the end of the plan year, when the\ncustomer requests removal from the levelized payment plan, or when the utility\nremoves the customer from the levelized payment plan: (i) sets forth a reconciliation between the\ntotal levelized payment amount billed, the cost of service actually used and\nthe amounts paid during the plan period; and\n(ii)\nif payment was received in excess of the\ncost of service actually used during the plan period, advises the customer of\nthe utility's policy regarding return of the excess payment, which policy may\nnot permit the utility to credit to the customer's account more than the\nlevelized payment or estimated amount of the next cycle bill, and must provide\nfor the issuance of a refund check for any balance within 30 calendar days of\nthe rendering of the final levelized settlement bill; (5)\nrequires that when the levelized payment\namount is revised, the customer be provided with a general description of such\nrevision calculation, and a telephone number to call at the utility for a more\ndetailed explanation of the revision; and\n(6)\nlimits enrollment to the plan to a time\nof year when the customer will not be subject to undue disadvantage. (d) Removal of levelized payment\nplan. (1)\nA customer may request that the\nutility remove the customer from the levelized payment plan and reinstate\nregular billing at any time, in which case the utility may immediately render a\nfinal levelized settlement bill, and shall do so no later than by the time of\nthe next cycle bill that is rendered more than 10 business days after the\nrequest. (2)\nA utility may only\nremove a customer from its levelized payment plan if the customer becomes\nineligible under subdivision (b) of this section, and provided that the utility\nhas given the customer an opportunity to become current in payment, if\ndelinquency is the cause of the customer's ineligibility, provided further that\nsuch opportunity need only be given once in any 12-month period.
