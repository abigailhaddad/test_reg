  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 179-3.14 - Removal from a temporary release program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Participation in a temporary release\nprogram is a privilege. Nothing contained in the Correction Law, the Executive\n\nLaw or this Subpart shall be construed to confer upon any resident the right to\nparticipate, or to continue to participate, in a temporary release\nprogram. (b) Any resident's\nprivilege to participate in a temporary release program may be revoked by the\nfacility director: whenever he has knowledge that a resident's continued\nparticipation in the program is inconsistent with the safety of the community, the disciplined secure functioning of the facility, or the best interests or\nwelfare of the resident; or if the resident has indicated by his conduct that\nthere is a substantial likelihood he cannot successfully adjust to or complete\nhis temporary release program; or upon recommendation of the temporary release\ncommittee chairperson. Such revocation must be made only with the approval of\nthe director of temporary release programs. (c) Indications of unsuitability for\ncontinued temporary release programming include, but are not limited to: (1)\narrest and/or conviction for a crime\ncommitted while participating in program; (2)\nabsconding, or attempting to abscond, from program; (3)\na violation of\ndivision, facility or temporary release program rules or regulations; (4)\nthreats by the participant against\nhimself, his family, other residents, facility employees, or members of the\ncommunity; (5)\nthreats made against\nthe participant which require his placement in a protective custody\nlocation; (6)\nchanges in the\nparticipant's physical or mental status which have changed his ability to\nsuccessfully adjust to program; (7)\nan uncooperative attitude or a lack of motivation on the part of the\nparticipant evidenced by his failure to successfully participate in the\ntemporary release program; or\n(8)\na\nsignificant negative change in the participant's employment or student\nstatus. (d) Removal\nprocedures for short-term temporary release participants. The assigned parole\nofficer or any employee of the Division for Youth shall notify the facility\ndirector of any firsthand knowledge of a resident's unsatisfactory\nparticipation in a short-term temporary release program. The facility director\nshall determine whether the resident should be removed from the short-term\ntemporary release program and notify the temporary release committee\nchairperson of this decision. (e) Removal procedures for continuous temporary release participants. (1)\n\nThe temporary release parole officer or\nany employee of the Division for Youth who has firsthand knowledge of a\ncontinuous temporary release participant's unsatisfactory or deteriorating\nadjustment to his temporary release program may file a written statement with\nthe chairperson of the temporary release committee requesting a review of the\nparticipant's adjustment to the program. The temporary release committee shall\nthen evaluate the participant's progress in, and adjustment to, the program and\nmake a recommendation to the facility director regarding the participant's\nsuitability for continued participation in the temporary release program. If a\nresident violates a division, facility or temporary release rule or regulation, a report of such violation shall be referred to the adjustment committee for\nconsideration. This violation must be resolved by normal division disciplinary\nprocedures, pursuant to Subpart 179-1 of this Part, before the temporary\nrelease committee may review the participant's program adjustment and\nsuitability for continuation in the temporary release program. (2)\n\nIf a temporary release participant\nreceives a disciplinary infraction or misbehavior report and appears before an\nadjustment committee or facility director's proceeding for a violation of\ndivision, facility or temporary release rule or regulation prior to his\nappearance before the temporary release committee, the adjustment committee or\nfacility director's proceeding shall not recommend removal from a temporary\nrelease program as a dispositional option. However, the adjustment committee or\nfacility director's proceeding may refer a resident's case to the temporary\nrelease committee for review pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. It\nis the temporary release committee's responsibility to make a recommendation to\nthe facility director concerning the resident's suitability for continued\nparticipation in a temporary release program. The temporary release committee\nmay not use a disciplinary infraction or misbehavior report as a reason for\nrecommending that a resident be removed from a temporary release program if the\ndisciplinary violation is not sustained by an adjustment committee or facility\ndirector's proceeding. However, the temporary release committee may recommend a\nparticipant's removal from a temporary release program for other\nreasons. (3)\n\nUpon receiving a\nwritten request to review a temporary release participant's adjustment in a\ntemporary release program, the chairperson of the temporary release committee\nshall evaluate the referral and schedule a meeting of the temporary release\ncommittee in accordance with the urgency of the referral. If the resident has\nnot had a disciplinary violation sustained by an adjustment committee or a\nfacility director's proceeding, and the resident has not been transferred from\nthe temporary release facility, he shall be scheduled to appear at the\ntemporary release committee meeting. At least 24 hours before the resident's\nscheduled meeting with the temporary release committee, he shall be given a\nwritten statement of the reason(s) for his referral. A copy of the statement\nshall be retained in the resident's facility file. (4)\n\nUpon convening the meeting of the\ntemporary release committee, the chairperson shall advise the committee members\nof the nature of the referral and the resident's adjustment in program to date, and provide any other information which the committee needs to evaluate the\nresident's adjustment. The resident shall then be given the opportunity to meet\nwith the temporary release committee to discuss the evaluation of his program\nparticipation. (5)\n\nThe temporary\nrelease committee shall ensure that appropriate efforts have been made to\naddress the resident's problems. Then, the temporary release committee shall\ndecide, by majority vote, what action should be recommended to the facility\ndirector. The chairperson of the temporary release committee shall promptly\nforward to the facility director a written statement containing the committee's\nrecommendation and its reason(s) therefor. (6)\n\nImmediate transfer. (i) A temporary release participant who is\nconsidered a security risk may be transferred from a temporary release facility\nto another division secure facility before a temporary release committee\nmeeting, adjustment committee meeting or facility director's proceeding is\nconvened. A participant may be considered a security risk if: (a) he is violent; (b) he presents a danger to himself, other\npersons, property, or facility security; (c) there is an immediate threat to his\nsafety; (d) there is reasonable\ncause to believe he may try to escape or abscond; or\n(e) he has been arrested and released on bail\nor his own recognizance. (ii)\nA temporary release participant also may\nbe transferred if he requires immediate medical or other professional care or\ntreatment which is not available at the temporary release facility. (iii)\nA transfer order must be obtained from\nthe director of temporary release programs to move a resident out of a\ntemporary release facility. (iv)\n\nIn\nall other cases, the removal or revocation procedures described in paragraphs\n(2)-(5) and (7)-(10) of this subdivision must be completed before a participant\nmay be transferred from the temporary release facility. (v) It is not necessary for a temporary\nrelease participant who has been transferred from the temporary release\nfacility and who has a sustained disciplinary violation to appear at the\ntemporary release committee meeting. However, if a disciplinary violation is\nnot sustained against a temporary release participant who has already been\ntransferred from the temporary release facility, the chairperson of the\ntemporary release committee at the facility from which the resident was\ntransferred shall visit the resident at the facility to which he has been\ntransferred to advise the resident of the nature of the referral and the\nfactors about which the temporary release committee is concerned, and to give\nthe resident the opportunity to address these issues in the chairperson's\npresence. At least 24 hours before the resident is scheduled to appear before\nthe temporary release committee chairperson, the resident shall be given a\nwritten statement of the reason(s) for his referral. (vi)\n\nIn exigent circumstances, the facility\ndirector of the facility from which the resident has been transferred may\nrequest the facility director of the facility to which the resident was\ntransferred to have that facility's temporary release committee meet with the\nresident to advise him of the nature of the referral and the factors about\nwhich the sending temporary release committee is concerned, and to give the\nresident the opportunity to address these issues in the presence of the\nreceiving facility's temporary release committee. At least 24 hours before the\nresident is scheduled to appear before the temporary release committee, he\nshall be given a written statement of the reasons for his referral. (vii)\n\nIn exigent circumstances where the\nreceiving facility's temporary release committee cannot be assembled, the\nfacility director may act as the temporary release committee for program review\npurposes. (viii)\n\nThe chairperson of\nthe temporary release committee holding the meeting shall promptly forward a\nwritten statement to the facility director of the facility where the resident\nhas been participating in a temporary release program, recommending that the\nresident either be returned to that facility for further temporary release\nprogramming or be removed from temporary release. The statement shall include\nthe reason(s) for the recommendation. (7)\n\nThe facility director shall either\napprove or disapprove the temporary release committee's recommendation. If the\nfacility director disapproves such a recommendation, he shall provide the\ntemporary release committee chairperson who made the recommendation with a\nwritten statement of the reason(s) for his decision. (8)\n\nIf the facility director approves a\nrecommendation that a resident be removed from the temporary release program, the resident's privilege to participate in a temporary release program shall be\nrevoked. (9)\n\nThe facility director\nshall advise the chairperson of the temporary release committee of any action\nto revoke a resident's privilege to participate in a temporary release program. The temporary release committee chairperson then shall forward a written\nstatement to the resident, advising that removal from temporary release has\nbeen ordered by the facility director and stating the reason(s) why this action\nis being taken. Copies of this statement shall also be placed in the resident's\nfacility file and made available to the Board of Parole before the resident's\nnext appearance. (10)\n\nWhen a\nresident's privilege to participate in a temporary release program is revoked, a copy of the temporary release committee's recommendation and the facility\ndirector's decision shall be forwarded to the director of temporary release\nprograms for review. If a disciplinary violation was a factor in the decision\nto revoke the resident's temporary release privilege, a copy of the adjustment\ncommittee's or facility director's proceeding reports regarding the violation\nshall also be forwarded. A transfer order shall be obtained from the director\nof temporary release programs to move a resident out of the temporary release\nfacility. (11)\n\nParole Board action\naffecting participation. (i) A resident held\nmore than 12 months. (a) A resident who meets\nthe Board of Parole and is ordered held in excess of 12 months is statutorily\nineligible to continue to participate in a temporary release program unless his\nconditional release or maximum expiration date is less than 12 months away. Such a resident shall be removed from program immediately. An order from the\ndirector of temporary release programs shall be obtained to transfer the\nresident to an appropriate secure facility. (b) A resident who is removed from the\nprogram because he was held by the Board of Parole in excess of 12 months has\nno entitlement to be placed back in a temporary release program immediately\nupon his again becoming statutorily eligible for temporary release. A new\napplication for temporary release must be submitted at that time. (ii)\nA resident held less than 12\nmonths. (a) A resident who meets the Board of\n\nParole and is ordered held for less than 12 months, or a resident held for more\nthan 12 months who has a conditional release or maximum expiration date less\nthan 12 months away, shall be reevaluated by the temporary release committee to\ndetermine whether he should be permitted to continue in program or any aspect\nof his program should be changed before he is again permitted to leave the\nfacility on temporary release. If the temporary release committee concludes\nthat a resident should be removed from his temporary release program, the\nresident shall appear before the temporary release committee and the procedures\ndetailed in paragraphs (2) through (10) of this subdivision shall be\nfollowed. (b) When appropriate, the\nparole officer at the temporary release facility shall ensure that the Board of\n\nParole's decision regarding a continuous temporary release participant is made\navailable immediately to the temporary release committee chairperson so the\ntemporary release committee can make a prompt decision whether the participant\nshould be permitted to leave the facility on temporary release, and schedule an\nevaluation if necessary. Whenever possible, the parole officer should give the\ntemporary release committee chairperson the Board of Parole's reason(s) for\nordering an appearance at a later date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
