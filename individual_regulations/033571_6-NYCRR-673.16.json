  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 673.16 - Condition ratings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Based on\nits investigation, the department may assign a condition rating to any\ndam. (b) The condition ratings that\nmay be assigned are: (1)\n\"Unsafe\". Dams with\ndeficiencies of such a nature that failure of the dam is imminent and immediate\naction is required to eliminate or reduce the danger. Among the deficiencies\nwhich could result in this rating are seepage which is carrying soil particles, significant erosion problems, and serious structural deficiencies, which may\ninvolve movement or cracking of the structure. Severely inadequate spillway\ncapacity may also result in a condition rating of \"unsafe.\"\n(2)\n\"Unsound\". Dams with deficiencies of such\na nature that the safety of the dam cannot be assured. Among the deficiencies\nwhich could result in this rating are developing seepage problems, structural\nstability inadequacies, or seriously inadequate spillway capacity. Hazard class\nB or C dams for which there is no demonstration that the spillway capacity and\nstability are adequate may receive a condition rating of \"unsound.\"\n(3)\n\"Deficiently maintained\". Dams with\nphysical or operational deficiencies which do not require further significant\nengineering analysis. Some corrective action is required, often in the form of\nincreased maintenance, to correct the condition of the dam. (4)\n\"No deficiencies noted\". A safety\ninspection or engineering assessment, and/or investigation by the department, did not reveal deficiencies. (c) Dams with several deficiencies which\ncould be assigned more than one condition rating will be assigned the most\nsevere rating category applicable. (d) The owner of a dam that is assigned a\ncondition rating of \"unsafe\", \"unsound\" or \"deficiently maintained\" will be\nnotified in writing, by certified mail, of the condition rating of the dam and\nthe basis therefore. The notice will include the hazard classification assigned\nto the dam and will require such corrective action as the department deems\nappropriate, including the timely correction of deficiencies, with due\nconsideration of the potential impacts associated with the corrective action. The notice may require the owner to implement or submit for approval and\nimplement, an enhanced dam safety program pursuant to this section. (e) Any corrective action shall be carried\nout in a manner that complies with this Part and any other applicable\nrequirements of the department, including permit requirements. (f) The owner of a dam with a condition\nrating of \"unsafe\", \"unsound\" or \"Deficiently Maintained\" is in violation of\nECL article 15, section 0507 and this Part. The department may pursue formal\nenforcement proceedings to compel the implementation of an enhanced safety\nprogram and/or the prompt correction of all deficiencies. The failure of a dam\nowner to comply with an order of the department is a violation of this Part and\nECL article 15, section 0507. (g) The department may change a dam's condition rating as necessary at any time to\naccurately reflect the deficiencies or improvements in the dam. Upon changing\nthe condition rating, the department shall notify the dam owner in writing and\nprovide the basis thereof. (h) Any\nperson may provide to the department, and the department shall consider, information relevant to the assignment of a condition rating to a\ndam. (i) Enhanced safety program. (1)\n\nAn enhanced safety program may consist of\none or more of the following, at the request of the department, based on its\ndiscretion upon consideration of public safety and the specific characteristics\nof the dam and its location: (i) an inspection\nand maintenance plan, emergency action plan, and engineering assessment report, each of which is in compliance with this Part; (i) a regular schedule of safety\ninspections; (iii)\nreservoir\nrestrictions; (iv)\nfinancial\nassurance associated with the cost of breach or removal of the dam; and/or\n(v) other measures which the\ndepartment determines are necessary to protect public\nsafety. (2)\n\nFinancial\nassurance means a dam owner establishes and maintains financial security that\nis payable to the department in an amount sufficient to pay for the breach or\nremoval of the dam by the department, should such breach or removal be deemed\nnecessary. (i) The amount of the financial\nsecurity is sufficient if it is adequate to fully cover the costs associated\nwith a breach or removal of the dam, including the costs of: labor and\nmaterials for design and construction; investigations and surveys; construction\nplans; environmental mitigation associated with any of the actions taken; and\nany other appropriate cost as determined by the department. (ii)\n\nThe form of the financial security shall\nbe one or more of the following: a surety bond guaranteeing performance; one or\nmore irrevocable letters of credit, payable to or at the direction of the\ndepartment; a trust fund established for the benefit of the department; a\npolicy of insurance that provides the department with acceptable rights as a\nbeneficiary thereof and that is issued by an insurance carrier whose operations\nare subject to regulation and examination by a State agency; one or more\nannuities; or one or more certificates of deposit; any other form which the\ndepartment determines to be acceptable. (j) A dam owner may contest the department's\nassignment of or change to a condition rating within 30 days of the date of the\ndepartment's notice. The dam owner must send to the department's dam safety\nsection, a written request for review of the condition rating, and must\naccompany the request with documentation as to the particular deficiencies\nnoted by the department, and specific engineering documentation in sufficient\ndetail to support a different condition rating. The director of the\ndepartment's Division of Water, or duly authorized designee, will review the\nrequest and supporting documentation and issue a written decision either\ndenying the request or changing the condition rating. (k) The department may adopt the content of\nan alternative Federal program of condition rating, provided the alternative\nrating program is consistent with the condition rating system in this\n\nPart.
