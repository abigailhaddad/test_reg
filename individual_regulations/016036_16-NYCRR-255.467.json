  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.467 - External corrosion control: electrical isolation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each buried or submerged pipeline must be\nelectrically isolated from other underground metallic structures, unless the\npipeline and the other structures are electrically interconnected and\ncathodically protected as a single unit. (b) One or more insulating devices must be\ninstalled where electrical isolation of a portion of a pipeline is necessary to\nfacilitate the application of corrosion control. (c) Except for unprotected copper inserted in\na ferrous pipe, each pipeline must be either electrically isolated from any\nmetallic casing that is part of the underground system or, if isolation is not\nachieved because it is impractical, must be treated by other measures to\nminimize corrosion of the pipeline inside the casing. (d) Inspection and electrical tests must be\nmade to assure that electrical isolation is adequate. (e) An insulating device may not be installed\nin an area where a combustible atmosphere is anticipated unless precautions are\ntaken to prevent arcing. (f) Where\na pipeline is located in close proximity to electrical transmission tower\nfootings, ground cables or counterpoise, or in other areas where fault currents\nor unusual risk of lightning may be anticipated, it must be provided with\nprotection against damage due to fault currents or lightning, and protective\nmeasures must also be taken at insulating devices. (g) For any pipeline constructed after\n\nDecember 1, 1993 that is located parallel and in close proximity to or crosses\nunderneath an overhead high-voltage (69 kV or higher) electric transmission\nfacility, the step and touch voltages induced by magnetic fields of overhead\nelectric lines under steady state conditions shall be limited to 15 volts or\nless at all points where a person could normally touch the pipeline or a\npipeline appurtenance. This does not apply to buried pipelines or to locations\nwhere access is limited by use of fences or barriers to personnel that are\ntrained in safe practices regarding step and touch voltages. The short term\nemergency loading condition of the circuit as defined by the New York\n\nIndependent System Operator for the electric facility shall be used in\ndetermining the magnitude of such step-and-touch voltages. (1)\n\nStep voltage means the root mean square\nvoltage difference between any two points on the ground surface separated by\none meter (approximately the distance of one step) in the direction of the\nmaximum voltage gradient. (2)\n\nTouch\nvoltage means the root mean square voltage difference between any point on the\nground where a person may stand and any point on the pipeline or its\nappurtenances which can be touched simultaneously by either hand. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.467\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
