  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 210.6 - \"in lieu of\" moving expenses for a business or commercial occupant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It shall be the\noption of the business or farm operation (including a displaced business or\nfarm operation which is discontinued) upon written notification from the\ndepartment to elect to receive a fixed relocation payment of up to $5,000 in\nlieu of moving expenses. This fixed relocation payment is calculated in an\namount equal to the average annual net earnings of the business or farm\noperation or $5,000, whichever is the lesser amount. (b) In the case of a business, eligibility\nfor this payment is contingent upon the State's determination that: (1)\nthe business cannot be relocated without\na substantial loss of its patronage and\n(2)\nis not part of a commercial enterprise\nhaving at least one other establishment which is not being acquired by the\n\nState or the United States and which is engaged in the same or a similar\nbusiness. The term \"patronage\" as used herein means the average\ndollar volume of business transacted during the two taxable years immediately\npreceding the year in which the business is displaced, or the projection for\nthe next two years of the average dollar volume of business at the new location\nof the displaced business. (c) In the case of a farm operation, no such\nfixed relocation payment shall be made unless the State determines that the\nacquisition causes the discontinuance of the farm operation or its displacement\nand relocation from its existing location. (d) The term \"average annual net earnings\" as\nused in subdivision (a) of this section means one-half of any earnings of the\nbusiness before Federal, State and local income taxes, during the two taxable\nyears immediately preceding the taxable year in which the business is acquired. \"Average annual net earnings\" include any compensation paid by the business to\nthe owner, his spouse, or his dependents during the two year period. Such\nearnings and compensation may be established by Federal or State income tax\nreturns filed by the business and its owner, his spouse and his dependents\nduring the two year period. State or Federal tax returns for the tax years in\nquestion are the primary sources for verification of earnings and compensation. An affidavit from the owner stating his net earnings can also be accepted\nprovided it grants the State the right to review the records and accounts of\nthe business or farm operation. (e) In the case of a corporate owner of a business or farm operation, earnings\nshall include any compensation paid to the spouse or dependent of the owner of\na majority interest in the corporation. For the purpose of determining majority\nownership, stock held by a husband, his wife and their dependent children shall\nbe treated as one unit. There is no requirement that the business be in the\nsame location for the entirety of the two preceding taxable years. If the\nbusiness or farm operator affected can show that it was in business for 12\nconsecutive months during the two taxable years prior to the taxable year in\nwhich it is required to relocate, had income during such period and is\notherwise eligible, the owner of the business or farm operation is eligible to\nreceive the payment specified. The 12 month period used by the business or farm\noperation in filing income tax returns is acceptable as a taxable year. The\nbusiness or farm operation must provide information to support its net earnings\nif the owner elects to accept the payment provided for in lieu of moving costs. Where the business or farm was in operation for 12 consecutive months or more\nbut was not in operation during the entire two preceding taxable years, the\npayment is to be computed by dividing the net earnings for the total period by\nthe number of months the business or farm was operated and multiply by\n12.
