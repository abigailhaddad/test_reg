  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 350-2.6 - Temporary waiver\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\n(1)\nA designated food scraps generator may\npetition the department for a temporary waiver from some or all requirements of\nthis Part, on forms acceptable to the department. The petition must include\nevidence of on one or more of the justifications identified in subdivision (b)\nof this section. (2)\n\nOther than\nemergency waivers, a waiver petition must be submitted to the department by\n\nOctober 1 of the year prior to the calendar year for which the waiver is\nrequested. If approved, the waiver will be valid from January 1 through\n\nDecember 31 of the following year. For emergency waivers, the petition may be\nsubmitted at any time and the waiver, if approved, will be valid for up to one\nyear. (b) Justifications. Acceptable justifications include the following. (1)\n\nJustification 1. Even though the\ngenerator is listed as a designated food scraps generator by the department, the generator does not produce two tons (on a wet weight basis) or more of food\nscraps per week based on an annual average. Increased food donation cannot be\nused to reduce the calculation of food scraps produced by the generator for\npurposes of this justification. (2)\n\nJustification 2. The total cost of solid waste management including organics\nrecycling is at least 10 percent greater than the total cost of disposal\nwithout organics recycling. (3)\n\nJustification 3. The organics recycler(s) or intermediary facility(ies) within\n25 miles (measured in a straight line), as identified by the department in the\nlist, does not have available capacity. (4)\n\nJustification 4. A food scraps\ntransporter is not available to the designated food scraps generator. (5)\n\nJustification 5. Other circumstances\nunique to the designated food scraps generator. (c) Information that must be submitted with\nthe petition. The petition must include at least one justification along with\nthe documentation (at a minimum) set forth in this subdivision. (1)\n\nJustification 1. The following\ninformation must be submitted. (i) If food\nscraps are not separated from other wastes at the point of generation: ('a')\ndocumentation from the transporter or\nother verified source that indicates the amount of total waste removed from the\ngenerator for the previous year; ('b')\ndocumentation that indicates the\nquantity of food donated for the previous year; ('c')\nan estimate of the proportion of food\nscraps (including food-soiled paper) in the waste stream to the nearest 10%\n(waste is 60% food scraps, as an example); ('d')\ncalculations showing the annual average\nweekly food scraps generation; ('e')\na description of any seasonal variation expected in the waste stream quantity\nand food scraps content, if applicable; and\n('f)\nother relevant information to justify\nthe amount of food scraps generated. (ii)\n\nIf food scraps are separated from other\nwastes at the point of generation: ('a')\ndocumentation, e.g., email, invoice from the transporter or other verified\nsource that indicates the amount of food scraps removed from the generator for\nthe previous year; ('b')\na\ndescription of any seasonal variation expected in the food scraps quantity\nproduced, if applicable; ('c')\ncalculations showing the annual average weekly food scraps generation; and\n('d')\nother relevant\ninformation to justify the amount of food scraps generated. (2)\n\nJustification 2. The following information must be submitted. (i) An analysis of the cost of disposal\nincluding documentation from the transporter or other verified source that\nindicates the total cost for disposal of all solid waste removed from the\ndesignated food scraps generator for the previous year. (ii)\n\nAn analysis of the cost of recycling of\nfood scraps including documentation from all food scraps transporters available\nto the designated food scraps generator, indicating the average monthly cost, as measured over a calendar year, for recycling of food scraps and managing the\nremainder of the waste stream removed from the generator. The analysis must\ninclude: ('a')\nan evaluation of the amount of\nwaste reduced and cost savings through increased food donation and\n('b')\nan evaluation of the cost savings by\nreducing the frequency of waste collection and reduce the cost of waste\ndisposal since food scraps are removed from the waste stream. (iii)\n\nAn analysis with supporting\ncalculations showing the cost of recycling food scraps compared to the cost of\ndisposing of the food scraps as solid waste for the designated food scraps\ngenerator. (3)\n\nJustification 3. The following information must be submitted. (i) documentation from any transporter and/or\norganics recycler or intermediary facility contacted by the designated food\nscraps generator indicating why the organics recycler or intermediary facility\ncannot accept the generator's food scraps at the present time and whether they\nwill be able to do so during the coming calendar year when the waiver would be\nin effect. (4)\n\nJustification 4. The following information must be submitted. (i) documentation from the transporter\ncurrently used by the designated food scraps generator indicating that they do\nnot provide food scraps transport; and\n(ii)\ndocumentation (email, etc.) from each\nfood scraps transporter available in the designated food scraps generator's\narea indicating that they cannot provide food scraps transport for the\ngenerator during the coming calendar year when the waiver would be in\neffect. (5)\n\nJustification 5. The designated food scraps generator must submit a detailed\nexplanation of the unique circumstances, and why it is seeking a waiver from\ncompliance with this part. (d) Emergency waivers\nA designated food scraps generator may petition the\ndepartment to obtain a waiver without submitting the information outlined in\nsubdivisions (a) - (c) of this section for situations that require immediate\nrelief, such as unexpected closure of an organics recycler or intermediary\nfacility or an emergency response event. An emergency waiver request may be\nsubmitted at any time of the year. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
