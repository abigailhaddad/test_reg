  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 534.8 - Refunds or credits based on erroneous, illegal, or unconstitutional payment or collection of tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1139\n(a) Authorization. (1)\nA refund or credit is allowable for any\ntax, penalty, or interest which was erroneously, illegally, or\nunconstitutionally collected or paid. (2)\n\nAny person who has erroneously, illegally, or unconstitutionally collected a tax from a customer may, repay\nsuch tax to the customer and in turn claim a refund or credit of such tax from\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance, provided the tax has been paid to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (3)\n\nNo refund or credit may be made to any\nperson of tax which he collected from a customer until he shall first establish\nto the satisfaction of the Department of Taxation and Finance, as provided in\nsection\n534.2\nof this Part, that he has in fact repaid such tax to the customer. (b) Refund of taxes collected by a\nperson liable for the payment of such tax. (1)\n\nWhere a person required to collect tax, collects tax on receipts, amusement charges or rent not subject to tax, for\nexample, a vendor who collects tax on the sale of a service which is not\nsubject to sales tax were he is the ultimate consumer of the tangible personal\nproperty used in rendering the service, the sale of which to a consumer is not\ntaxable to him, or a contractor, subcontractor or repairman who collects tax on\nthe receipts from erecting structures or buildings which become a part of the\nreal property and which are a capital improvement, the tax collected must be\npaid over to the Department of Taxation and Finance. A refund of such\nerroneously collected tax is allowable to the purchaser of the nontaxable\nservice or capital improvement. The vendor or contractor is liable for and will\nbe assessed any tax due which he failed to pay on his purchase of tangible\npersonal property used as the ultimate consumer in performing a nontaxable\nservice or capital improvement. Any penalties and interest charges which have\naccrued on the amount of tax previously due will also be assessed. Example 1: A homeowner engages a contractor to erect a garage on a\n\"furnish and install\" contract. The agreed price of the garage completely\nerected is $2,400. The contractor purchases the building components without\npaying the sales tax due thereon. Upon completion of the garage, the contractor\nbills the customer $2,400 plus 7% tax or $2,568. The customer pays in full the\namount billed and claims a refund of $168 for sales tax erroneously paid on a\ncapital improvement. The refund is approved and paid. The contractor will be\nassessed the tax due on the building components purchased by him and any\npenalties and interest that have accrued. (2)\n\nWhen a contract is entered into for a\ncapital improvement any tax paid by a contractor or subcontractor as the\npurchaser at the taxable retail sale (which is considered in computing the\ncontract price or for which reimbursement is required by the contractor to be\nmade to him), is not deemed to be a collection of tax from the customer, since\nthe tax is imposed on the contractor and not on the customer. Example 2: A homeowner enters into a \"cost plus\" contract for the\nerection of a garage. The contract specifically provides that the home-owner\nwill reimburse the contractor in full for all of the contractor's costs\nincluding sales tax paid by the contractor upon materials used. The contractor\npurchased $1,100 worth of materials upon which he paid $77, the proper rate of\nsales tax. The homeowner is given an itemized bill for materials and sales tax\ntotaling $1,177 and pays it. The reimbursement of the $77 to the contractor for\nthe tax paid is a contractual reimbursement by the customer of the contractor's\nexpenses and not an erroneous collection of sales tax and may not be refunded\nor credited to the homeowner. The same would be true of any other charge\nitemized in the contract and bill for the capital improvement to real\nproperty. Example 3: A customer enters into a lump sum contract for a capital\nimprovement. The contractor included the sales tax on his purchases of material\nin computing the contract price, and showed such sales tax separately in\nperiodic billings to the customer. The customer later files for a refund of the\nsales tax. Such refund is not allowable since it was not a payment of tax by\nthe customer; it was reimbursement of the contractor's\nexpenses.
