(2)\n\nThe calcium carbonate equivalence of\nagricultural liming materials derived from magnesium sources also may be\ndetermined according to procedures of the Association of Official Agricultural\n\nChemists, as outlined in Journals of the Association of Official Agricultural\n\nChemists, as follows: (i) Volume 45 (1), page\n200, February, 1962; (ii)\n\nVolume 46\n(1), page 96, February, 1963; and\n(iii)\n\nVolume 46 (4), pages 611 to 616, August, 1963.
