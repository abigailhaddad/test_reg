  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 9-2.4 - Computation of tax under the entity method\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Under the entity method, for purposes of\ndetermining the taxes measured by the business income base, capital base, and\nthe fixed dollar minimum, a corporate partner is treated as owning an interest\nin the partnership entity. The partner's interest in the partnership is an\nintangible asset that is business capital. (b) Business income base. (1)\n\nTo the extent a corporation's entire net\nincome (ENI) includes its distributive share of partnership items of income, gain, loss and deduction, such items will be treated as business income. The\ncorporation's distributive share of such partnership items must be apportioned\nas provided in subdivision (e) of this section and included in the\ncorporation's apportioned business income. (2)\n\nWhile a corporation may have the\ninformation concerning one or more of the modifications set forth in section\n208(9), such as state bond interest, a corporation using the entity method does\nnot have all the information necessary to properly compute its article 9-A tax\nusing the aggregate method. Therefore, no modifications should be made with\nrespect to any partnership items. (c) Capital base. The corporation's interest\nin a partnership is business capital and is apportioned as provided in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. The corporation's interest in the partnership\nis the value shown on its books and records kept in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles. If the interest is a marketable security, it is\nvalued at fair market value (FMV). The capital base does not include any other\namounts that the corporation may have included on its balance sheet with\nrespect to its interest in the partnership. (d) Fixed dollar minimum. The corporation\ndoes not take into account any partnership items in determining its fixed\ndollar minimum tax. (e) A\ncorporation must apportion its distributive share of partnership items of\nincome, gain, loss and deduction included in its business income and its\ninterest in the partnership included in its business capital by its BAF\ndetermined under Part 4 of this Subchapter, computed without regard to its\ndistributive share of any partnership items of income, gain, loss or deduction. In addition, the MCTD apportionment percentage determined under Part 8 of this\n\nSubchapter must be computed without regard to its distributive share or\nproportionate part, as the case may be, of any partnership items. (f) Because the corporation is treated as\nowning an intangible asset, it is not entitled to claim any portion of any tax\ncredit that would be computed at the partnership level. (g) Example. Corporation X is a partner in Partnership P. For state\ntax purposes, the only information Corporate Partner X receives from\n\nPartnership P is a statement that lists its proportionate share of New York\n\nState income (loss), as well as state source income for other states in which\n\nPartnership P operates. The statement does not specify how the state source\namounts were computed, nor does it confirm that the New York article 9-A rules\nwere used to compute the New York amount. Therefore, Corporate Partner X does\nnot have the necessary information to properly compute its article 9-A tax\nusing the aggregate method, and it must compute its tax using the entity\nmethod. As such, the specific information provided by Partnership P about New\n\nYork State income (loss) must be disregarded. To compute its tax under article\n9-A, Corporate Partner X must include its total distributive share of income, gain, loss and deduction from Partnership P as business income. The amount of\nsuch amounts from Partnership P are then multiplied by a BAF computed without\nregard to the amounts from Partnership P. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
