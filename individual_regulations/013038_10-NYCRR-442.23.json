  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.23 - Debt financing for plant replacement and expansion purposes\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1440 ]\n(a) Debt financing for plant replacement and\nexpansion programs may take many forms. Under the terms of most debt financing\nagreements the debtor is required to perform or is prohibited from performing\ncertain acts. In many instances, debt financing gives rise to special\naccounting treatment because of discounts and premiums on bond issues, financing charges, formal restrictions on debt proceeds, and sinking and other\nrequired funds. (b) Discounts\nand premiums on bond issues. [ 1441 ] Discounts and premiums arising from the issue\nof bonds must be amortized over the life of the related issue(s). Bond\ndiscounts must be recorded as a reduction of the related debt (Bonds Payable -\nNet of Unamortized Discount). Bond premium must be recorded as Other Deferred\n\nCredits (account 2140). (c) Financing charges. [ 1442 ] Costs of obtaining debt financing other than\ndiscounts (\ne.g., legal fees, underwriting fees, special\naccounting costs) must be recorded as deferred costs and amortized over the\nlife of the related debt. (d) Accounting for debt\nproceeds. [ 1443 ]\n(1)\n\nDebt agreements for financing plant replacement and expansion programs may or\nmay not require formal segregation of debt proceeds prior to their use. Proceeds which are not required to be formally segregated prior to their use\nmust be recorded as other noncurrent assets in the Unrestricted Fund. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, all funds\nreceived under covenant agreement arrangements which require formal segregation\nand/or separate accountability shall be recorded in the Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion Fund until such time as the project is completed. Upon completion, the asset and related debt must be transferred to the Unrestricted Fund. (e) Sinking and\nother required funds. [ 1444 ]\n(1)\n\nThese funds are usually established to comply with loan provisions whereby\nspecific deposits are to be used to insure that adequate funds are available to\nmeet future payments of: (i) interest and\nprincipal (retirement of indebtedness funds); or\n(ii)\nproperty insurance, related taxes, repairs and maintenance costs, equipment replacement (escrow funds). (2)\n\nFunds of this nature may also\nbe required to be held by trustees outside the hospital. Income generated from\nthe investment of such funds may be immediately available to the hospital or\nsuch income may be held by the trustee for some future designated\npurpose. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis Part, all sinking and other required funds will be accounted for in the\nfollowing manner: (i) All fund assets, whether trusteed or otherwise, must be recorded in the Unrestricted Fund as a\nlong-term investment. The only exception is when the funds are restricted by\ncovenant agreement. (ii)\n\nAll income\ngenerated from the investment of such funds must be recorded as nonoperating\nrevenue in the Unrestricted Fund, except as required under number 1386. Income\ngenerated from funds under covenant agreement may be accounted for as an\naddition to the appropriate restricted fund balance account. (f) Early debt\nretirement. [ 1445 ]\n(1)\n\nMany bond contracts provide for the calling of any portion or all of the issue\nat the option of the company at a stated price, usually above par, for the\npurpose of enabling the corporation to reduce its indebtedness before maturity\nas occasion arises, or to take advantage of opportunities to borrow on more\nfavorable terms. Bonds are often retired piecemeal through sinking fund\noperations. (2)\n\nCosts incidental to\nthe recall of bonds before their date of maturity are considered debt\ncancellation costs. Such costs include bond recall penalties, unamortized bond\ndiscounts and expenses, legal and accounting fees, etc. These costs must be\nreduced by any unamortized bond premiums and recorded in the Unrestricted Fund\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting\npractices.
