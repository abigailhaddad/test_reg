  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-4.3 - Records to be kept\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe obligation of the local agency to keep formal books\nof account with respect to a State-aided project becomes operative, technically\nspeaking, only with the date of the contract for State aid. The local agency\nshould, nevertheless, as a practical matter keep some formal records of\nexpenditures made prior to that date, in order to support claims for their\nsubsequent admission as eligible development costs and to facilitate the audit\nand review by the division. Such records may be in memorandum form, if the\nexpenditures are being made on behalf of the local agency by some other agency, or they may be part of other accounting records of the local agency or they may\nbe separate records, maintained on a cash basis, if the expenditures are being\nmade by the local agency. Funds received by a local agency for indeterminate\nexpenditures should be deposited in a bank account and disbursements made by\ncheck. All expenditures should be supported by vouchers or other evidence of\nauthorization, in readily available form. Separate records, if maintained, should consist of, as a minimum, cash receipts and cash disbursements\nregisters. If desired, a general ledger may also be set up. The use of the\napplicable general ledger accounts of the division's uniform system of\naccounts, in this event, is recommended, as follows: (a) Account 1116, Local Funds. This is a cash\naccount recording the receipt and disbursement of funds for the indeterminate\nexpenditures. (b) Account 1610, Indeterminate Expenditures. The indeterminate expenditures are charged to this\naccount as made, to be held in suspense for audit, review, and approval by the\ndivision. (c) Account 2119D, Sundry\n\nAccounts Payable. This account is credited with the funds received by the local\nagency for the payment of indeterminate expenditures, if such funds represent a\nloan to the local agency. (d) Account 2800, Capital Surplus. This account is credited with the funds received\nby the local agency for the payment of indeterminate expenditures, if such\nfunds represent a donation, gift, appropriation, or advance which, it is not\nexpected or intended, that the local agency will be required to\nrepay. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-4.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
