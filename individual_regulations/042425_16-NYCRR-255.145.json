  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.145 - Valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for cast\niron and plastic valves, each valve must meet the minimum requirements, or the\nequivalent, of API 6D (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). A valve may\nnot be used under operating conditions that exceed the applicable\npressure-temperature ratings contained in those standards. (b) Each valve must be able to meet the\nanticipated operating conditions. (c) No valve having shell components made of\nductile iron may be used at pressures exceeding 80 percent of the pressure\nratings for comparable steel valves at their listed temperature. However, a\nvalve having shell components made of ductile iron may be used at pressures up\nto 80 percent of the pressure ratings for comparable steel valves at their\nlisted temperature, if: (1)\nthe\ntemperature-adjusted service pressure does not exceed 1,000 psig (6.9 MPa); and\n(2)\nwelding is not used on any\nductile iron component in the fabrication of the valve shells or their\nassembly. (d) No valve\nhaving shell (body, bonnet, cover, and/or end flange) components made of\nductile iron may be used at pressures exceeding 80 percent of the pressure\nratings for comparable steel valves at their listed temperature. (e) No valve having shell (body, bonnet, cover, and/or end flange) components made of cast iron, malleable iron, or\nductile iron may be used in the gas pipe components of compressor\nstations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.145\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
