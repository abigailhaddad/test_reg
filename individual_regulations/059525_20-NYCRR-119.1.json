  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 119.1 - New York fiduciary adjustment and its allocation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 619\n(a) General. A resident estate or trust may realize items of income or\ngain or incur items of loss or deduction which, if received or incurred by an\nindividual taxpayer, would give rise to one or more of the modifications\ndescribed in sections\n112.2\n-112.5, 112.7-112.9 and 115.2-115.3 of this Article. In the case of a resident\nestate or trust, all such modifications are combined in the New York fiduciary\nadjustment, which must be allocated among the estate or trust and its\nbeneficiaries as provided in section\n119.2\nor\n119.3\nof this Part. The modifications, or portions thereof, which may not be included\nin the New York fiduciary adjustment and which, therefore, may not be allocated\namong the estate or trust and its beneficiaries, are discussed in subdivision\n(c) of this section. The Federal taxable income of the estate or trust is\nmodified to reflect its share of the New York fiduciary adjustment, and the\n\nFederal adjusted gross income of each resident beneficiary is modified to\nreflect his share thereof (see section\n112.4\nand\n118.4\nof this Article). As to nonresident estates and trusts and nonresident\nbeneficiaries, see Part 139 of this Title. (b) Definition of New York fiduciary\nadjustment. The\n\nNew York fiduciary adjustment\nis the\nnet amount of the modifications described in sections\n112.2\n-112.3, 112.7-112.9, 115.2 and subdivisions (b) and (c) of section\n115.3\nof this Article, which relate to items of income, gain, loss or deduction of\nthe estate or trust. If the estate or trust is a beneficiary of another estate\nor trust or is a member of a partnership, the New York fiduciary adjustment\nalso includes the modifications described, respectively, in section\n112.4\nor\n112.5\nof this Article with respect to such other estate or trust or\npartnership. Example: A resident estate or trust has the following\nmodifications for 1979: Additions: (1)\n\nInterest income received on bonds of the State of\n\nCalifornia. (See section\n112.2\n[a]\nof this Article.)\n$1,000\n(2)\n\nNew York State personal income tax paid in 1979. (See section\n115.2\n[a]\nof this Article.)\n300\n(3)\n\nExpenses deducted in computing Federal taxable\nincome of the estate or trust which were incurred for the production or\ncollection of income from United States government bonds. (See section\n115.2\n[c]\nof this Article.)\n50\n\nTotal additions\n$1,350\n\nSubtractions: (4)\n\nInterest income received on United States\ngovernment bonds. (See section\n112.3\n[a]\nof this Article.)\n$600\n(5)\n\nRefund received in 1979 of overpayment of prior\nyear's New York State personal income tax. (See section\n112.3\n[g]\nof this Article.)\n100\n(6)\n\nOrdinary and necessary expenses paid during 1979\nfor the production or collection of income from State of California bonds. (See\nsection\n115.3\n[c]\nof this Article.)\n150\n\nTotal subtractions\n850\n\nNew York fiduciary adjustment\n$500\n\nSince the total of the items to be added to Federal\ntaxable income is more than the total of the items to be subtracted, the New\n\nYork fiduciary adjustment (net amount) is a plus figure; that is, the share of\nthe trust or estate in this fiduciary adjustment must be added to its Federal\ntaxable income, and the share of any 400 resident beneficiary must be added to\nhis Federal adjusted gross income. If the fiduciary adjustment, on the facts of\na particular case, should be a minus figure, the share of the estate or trust\nwould be subtracted from its Federal taxable income and the share of any\nresident beneficiary would be subtracted from his Federal adjusted gross\nincome. (c) The net amount\nof the modifications which comprise the New York fiduciary adjustment does not\ninclude: (1)\nany of the modifications or\nportions thereof, described in sections\n118.3\nand\n118.5\nof this Article, which relate to principal or corpus items included in the\n\nFederal taxable income of the estate or trust and which are not included in the\n\nFederal distributable net income of the estate or trust; (2)\nany modification or portion thereof, described in subdivisions (a) and (b) of section\n112.2\nof this Article, subdivisions (a), (b) and (d)-(g) of section\n112.3\nof this Article, with respect to any amount which is paid or permanently set\naside during the taxable year for a charitable purpose in accordance with the\nterms of the governing instrument. If a charitable organization is specifically\ndesignated in the governing instrument as a distributee of a particular item of\nincome, or portion thereof, in respect of which a modification would ordinarily\nbe required under any of the subdivisions referred to in this paragraph, no\npart of such modification is to be included in the New York fiduciary\nadjustment. If a charitable organization is designated in the governing\ninstrument as a distributee of a percentage or part of the estate or trust\nincome, but not as the distributee of a particular item of income, the portion\nof such a modification to be excluded from the New York fiduciary adjustment is\nsuch proportion of the modification as the amount paid or payable to the\ncharitable organization bears to the total income of the estate or trust. Example: The governing instrument of a resident trust provides\nthat the income of the trust is to be divided as follows: one-third to a\ncharitable organization, one-third to a designated beneficiary, and the\nremaining one-third accumulated for later distribution to a minor. The income\nof the trust for taxable year 1979 includes interest on California bonds of\n$9,000 and ordinary dividend in come of $15,000. Based upon these facts, the\n\nNew York fiduciary adjustment would be determined in the following\nmanner: Total California bond interest\n\nLess: Portion attributable to the\ncharitable organization computed as follows: $8,000 (total income paid or set aside for\ncharitable organization)\n×\n$9,000 (California\n=\n$3,000\n$2,400 (total income of trust)\nbond interest)\n\nNew York fiduciary adjustment\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
