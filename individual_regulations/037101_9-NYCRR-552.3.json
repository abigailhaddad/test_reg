  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 552.3 - Inventory of prioritization process for application forms\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Within 180 days from the effective date\nof this regulation each State agency shall: (1)\nreview and inventory its existing\napplication forms that are intended to be commonly used by the general\npublic; (2)\ndetermine which of\nthese application forms, if any, have already been made available to the\ngeneral public on the internet and which have not; and\n(3)\nestablish a priority list for making\navailable to the general public on the internet those application forms that\nhave not previously been made so available. (b) With respect to those application forms\nthat the inventory shows have not been made available to the general public on\nthe internet, each State agency shall prioritize the order and estimated\ntimeframe in which such application forms will be made available on the\ninternet. In establishing a priority list for making application forms\navailable on the internet, the State agency may consider, among other things: (1)\nthe annual demand for a particular\napplication form among the general public; (2)\nthe intended scope of the distribution of\na particular application form; and\n(3)\nwhether a particular application form is\nreadily convertible to internet form. In assessing whether an application form\nis \"readily convertible to internet form,\" the State agency may consider, among\nother things, the characteristics of an application form, including, but not\nlimited to, graphic content, security features, and other technical issues, including the need to comply with laws, policies, and procedures in regard to\nthe accessibility of internet information and applications, that may make\nconversion to internet form more difficult. (c) The inventory prepared by the State\nagency pursuant to paragraph (a)(1) of this section and the priority list\nestablished by the State agency pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section\nshall be posted on a State agency website. The State agency website on which\nthe inventory and priority list are posted shall include a conspicuous and\ndirect link to the inventory and the priority list. (d) At least once per year, the State\nagency's inventory and priority list shall be updated to reflect the\ndevelopment and distribution by the State agency of any new or redesigned\napplication form that is intended to be commonly used by the general public. Such updated inventory and priority list shall be posted on a State agency\nwebsite\n(e) In developing a new\napplication form or updating an existing application form that is intended to\nbe commonly used by the general public, a State agency shall, whenever\npracticable and reasonable, do so in a manner that facilitates making such\napplication form available on the internet at the time it is initially made\navailable to the general public. If the State agency is unable to make a newly\ndeveloped or updated application form available on the internet at the time it\nis initially made available to the general public, the State agency shall, as\nprovided in subdivision (d) of this section, add such new or updated\napplication form to the State agency's inventory and priority list.
