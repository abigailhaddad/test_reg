(1)\n\nThe New York State Advisory Council for\ntitle IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act has accepted full\nresponsibility for evaluating the overall effectiveness of the title IV of the\n\nElementary and Secondary Education Act program. Evaluation of the title IV of\nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act program has been a topic at every\ncouncil meeting held during the past fiscal year. The evaluation plan for each\nfiscal year is developed in accord with State advisory council policies and\nsubjected to their review with revisions being incorporated into the plan based\non their recommendations. Status reports by evaluators concerning\nimplementation of the evaluation plan have been presented to the advisory\ncouncil at each of its meetings. These reports have been helpful in increasing\nthe council's understanding of the evaluation process. The practice of\nutilizing status reports will be continued in fiscal year 1978. (2)\n\nDuring the coming fiscal year, efforts\nwill be made to generate special evaluation reports which will be particularly\nhelpful to advisory council members in fulfilling their advisory role. These\nspecial reports will be timed to coincide with major policy determinations\nfacing the council. Examples of proposed reports include: report on the status\nof the maintenance of effort problem under title IV of the Elementary and\n\nSecondary Education Act--parts B and C; report on the financial impact of the\npart B formula on various types of local districts; report on the outcomes of\nthe monitoring process for part C projects; report on the utility of the part C\nstrategy of transferring successes. Additional reports will be generated for\nselected part C strengthening projects. (d) Reporting activities. During the 1978\n\nFederal fiscal year, the advisory council plans to fulfill its reporting\nresponsibilities as outlined in section 403(b) of The Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act through the publication of an annual report for fiscal year 1977. The report will discuss the council's activities, recommendations as well as\nits evaluation procedures and results. The report will be disseminated to local\nschool districts and interested agencies and organizations throughout the\n\nState. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
