Thereafter such number shall appear on the outside cover and first\npage, to the right of the caption, of every paper tendered for filing in the\naction. Each such cover and first page also shall contain an indication of the\ncounty of venue and a brief description of the nature of the paper. In addition\nto complying with the provisions of CPLR 2101, every paper filed in court shall\nhave annexed thereto appropriate proof of service on all parties where\nrequired, and if typewritten, shall have at least a double space between each\nline, except for quotations and the names and addresses of attorneys appearing\nin the action, and shall have at least one-inch margins. In addition, every\npaper filed in court, other than an exhibit or printed form, shall contain\nwriting on one side only, except that papers that are fastened on the side may\ncontain writing on both sides. Papers that are stapled or bound securely shall\nnot be rejected for filing simply because they are not bound with a backer of\nany kind. (b) Omission or\n\nRedaction of Confidential Personal Information in Civil Actions and\n\nProceedings. (1)\n\nExcept for any action or\nproceeding arising under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, or prosecution of a\nviolation of an ordinance of a city, town or village, or in a petition for\nchange of name under the Civil Rights Law, or as otherwise provided by rule or\nlaw or court order, and whether or not a sealing order is or has been sought, the parties shall omit or redact confidential personal information in papers\nsubmitted to the court for filing. For purposes of this rule, confidential\npersonal information (\"CPI\") means: i. the\ntaxpayer identification number of an individual or an entity, including a\nsocial security number, an employer identification number, and an individual\ntaxpayer identification number, except the last four digits thereof; ii. the date of an individual's birth, except\nthe year thereof; iii. the full\nname of an individual known to be a minor, except the minor's initials; and\niv. a financial account number, including a credit and/or debit card number, a bank account number, an\ninvestment account number, and/or an insurance account number, except the last\nfour digits or letters thereof. (2)\n\nThe court sua sponte or on motion by any\nperson may order a party to remove CPI from papers or to resubmit a paper with\nsuch information redacted; order the clerk to seal the papers or a portion\nthereof containing CPI in accordance with the requirement of 22 NYCRR §\n216.1\nthat any sealing be no\nbroader than necessary to protect the CPI; for good cause permit the inclusion\nof CPI in papers; order a party to file an unredacted copy under seal for in\ncamera review; or determine that information in a particular action is not\nconfidential. The court shall consider the pro se status of any party in\ngranting relief pursuant to this provision. (3)\n\nWhere a person submitting a paper to a\ncourt for filing believes in good faith that the inclusion of the full\nconfidential personal information described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is material and necessary to the adjudication\nof the action or proceeding before the court, he or she may apply to the court\nfor leave to serve and file together with a paper in which such information has\nbeen set forth in abbreviated form a confidential affidavit or affirmation\nsetting forth the same information in unabbreviated form, appropriately\nreferenced to the page or pages of the paper at which the abbreviated form\nappears. (4)\n\nThe redaction\nrequirement does not apply to the last four digits of the relevant account\nnumbers, if any, in an action arising out of a consumer credit transaction, as\ndefined in subdivision (f) of section\none hundred\nfive\nof the civil practice law and rules. In the event\nthe defendant appears in such an action the defendant may without leave of\ncourt submit papers disclosing full account numbers to the extent necessary to\nensure that an order or judgment issued by the court contains proof\nsatisfactory to a credit reporting agency. In the event the defendant appears\nin such an action and denies responsibility for the identified account, the\nplaintiff may without leave of court amend his or her pleading to add full\naccount or CPI by (i) submitting such amended paper to the court on written\nnotice to defendant for in camera review or (ii) filing such full account or\nother CPI under seal in accordance with rules promulgated by the chief\nadministrator of the courts. (5)\n\nWhenever an application is submitted to a court seeking a change of name\npursuant to Civil Rights Law Article 6, change of sex designation pursuant to\n\nCivil Rights Law Article 6- a, or both forms of relief in a combined\napplication, then: i. the application shall be\nimmediately deemed sealed upon filing; ii. the clerk of the court shall take all\nreasonable steps necessary to seal and safeguard the applicant's current name, proposed new name, current sex designation, proposed new sex designation, residential and business addresses, telephone numbers, and any other\ninformation contained in any pleadings or papers submitted to the court in\nconnection with the application to prevent inadvertent or unauthorized use or\ndisclosure while the matter is pending, including, but not limited, ensuring\nthat such an application proceeds with an anonymous caption, until a\ndetermination or further order is issued by the Court; iii. where such application is sealed, the\nclerk of the court shall not allow any person, other than the party or the\nattorney or counsel for the party, to access the application, except by order\nof the Court; and\niv. prior to the\nentry of a final determination or order on such an application, the Court must\ndecide whether any legal basis is present so as to support maintaining the\nsealing imposed in accordance with this rule, and, where an application and/or\nany document submitted in support of it will not remain sealed, the Court\nshould order the applicant to submit a complete copy of the application with\nall confidential personal information redacted and/or removed in accordance\nwith Rule 208.4(b) if the applicant has not done so before any unsealing order\ntakes effect.
