This section shall apply\nto all cases, both civil and criminal, heard by a jury in any court. (b) After the jury has been\nsworn and before any opening statements or addresses, the court shall determine\nif the jurors may take notes at any stage of the proceedings. In making this\ndetermination, the court shall consider the probable length of the trial and\nthe nature and complexity of the evidence likely to be admitted. (c) If the court authorizes\nnote-taking, it shall direct the jurors that they may make written notes if\nthey so desire and that the court will provide materials for that purpose if\nthey so request. The court also shall instruct the jurors in the proper use of\nany notes taken, and its instructions shall include but not be limited to the\nfollowing: (1)\njurors should not\npermit their note-taking to distract them from the proceedings; (2)\nany notes taken are only an\naid to memory and should not take precedence over a juror's independent\nrecollection; (3)\nthose jurors who choose not to take notes should rely on their own independent\nrecollection of the evidence and should not be influenced by any notes that\nanother juror may take; (4)\nany notes taken are only for the\nnote-taker's own personal use in refreshing his or her recollection of the\nevidence; (5)\nif there\nis a discrepancy between a juror's recollection of the evidence and the juror's\nnotes, the jury should request a readback of the record and the court's\ntranscript prevails over a juror's notes; and\n(6)\nnotes are not a substitute for the\nofficial record or for the governing principles of law as enunciated by the\ntrial court. These instructions shall be repeated at the\nconclusion of the case as part of the court's charge prior to the commencement\nof jury deliberations. (d) The court shall require the jurors to\nprint their names or other identifier on the cover of the binder that contains\nthe notes and shall collect each juror's notes at the end of each trial day\nuntil the jury retires to deliberate. The jurors may refer to their notes\nduring the proceedings and deliberations. (e) Any notes taken are confidential and\nshall not be available for examination or review by any party or other person. After the jury has rendered its verdict, the court shall ensure that the notes\nare promptly collected and destroyed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
