  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 200.6 - Commercial crime insurance coverage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every cemetery\ncorporation shall carry commercial crime insurance or similar insurance\ncoverage for the acts or omissions of cemetery directors, officers, and\nemployees as well as volunteers who handle money, accounts or securities for\nthe cemetery. (b) The annual\nfinancial report filed with the division shall set forth the amount of\ncommercial crime coverage, the classes of persons included, the name of the\ncarrier/issuer, the policy number, and the expiration date of coverage. (c) The amount of coverage\nrequired is $15,000 or 10% of total financial assets, whichever is greater, up\nto a maximum of $500,000. Notwithstanding the foregoing: (1)\nthe division may, at its discretion, order a cemetery to obtain commercial crime coverage in excess of $500,000 if\nit determines that an increase in coverage is appropriate and that such\ncoverage is readily available in the marketplace. A cemetery subject to such\norder may file a protest with the Cemetery Board pursuant to section\n200.2\n(b); and\n(2)\n\nUpon application as\nprescribed by the division showing good cause for such relief, a cemetery may\nrequest that the division reduce, waive or modify the requirements under this\nsection. Good cause may include proof that the cemetery is unable to obtain\ncommercial crime insurance or similar coverage despite diligent effort, or that\nthe cost of such coverage at the level required by this section is onerous and\nunreasonable.
