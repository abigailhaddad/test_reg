  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-7.2 - Materials and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Storage of materials. Asbestos project non-ACM preparatory and waste transfer\nmaterials (i.e., plastic sheeting, duct tape, clean waste containers, etc.)\nshall be stored to prevent damage or contamination. Replacement materials shall\nbe stored outside all project regulated abatement work areas, staging areas and\nwaste transfer/storage areas until Phase II C is completed. (b) Damaged or deteriorating materials. Damaged or deteriorating non-ACM materials shall not be used and shall be\nremoved from the premises. (c) Fireproofing or insulation replacement. When ACM, PACM or asbestos material\nthat has been used for fireproofing or insulation (thermal, chemical, electrical, acoustical, etc.) has been removed as part of an asbestos project, and the building is not scheduled for demolition or replacement of the affected\nbuilding system, fireproofing or insulation at least equivalent to that\nremoved, shall be installed and maintained by the building/structure owner in\nconformance with all applicable codes. (d) Adhesive materials. Duct tape and spray\nadhesive shall be capable of sealing joints of adjacent sheets of plastic, facilitating attachment of plastic sheets to finished or unfinished surfaces of\ndissimilar materials and adhering under both dry and wet conditions. (e) Caulks. Non-ACM products shall be used to\nused to seal openings and penetrations during regulated abatement work area\npreparation and installation of critical barriers. (f) Containers. Watertight lockable\ncontainers shall be provided to receive and retain any asbestos containing or\ncontaminated material for storage until disposal. The containers shall be\nmarked with danger labels. (g) Enclosure project material. Materials for enclosure projects shall be\nimpact-resistant and installed to be airtight. (h) Fire-retardant expandable foam. Non-ACM\nproducts with a flashpoint above 140° F, shall be used to seal openings and\npenetrations during regulated abatement work area preparation and installation\nof critical barriers. (i) Ladders\nor scaffolds. Where ladders or scaffolds are used on a project to allow all\nwork surfaces to be easily and safely reached for removal and cleaning, care\nshall be taken to prevent breaching of the containment areas. Scaffold joints\nand ladder openings shall be sealed with duct tape to prevent incursion of\nasbestos. Scaffolds, ladders and their use shall comply with OSHA 29 CFR\n1926\nand other applicable codes. (j) Ladders and scaffolds for visitors. During Phase II of the asbestos project, the asbestos abatement contractor shall make available, to authorized visitors, ladders or scaffolds of sufficient dimension and quantity so that all work\nsurfaces can be easily and safely reached. Scaffolds, ladders and their use\nshall comply with OSHA 29 CFR\n1926\nand other applicable codes. (k) Plastic bags. Plastic bags used for waste\nstorage or disposal shall be at least six mil in thickness and be marked with\ndanger labels. (l) Plastic\nsheeting. Fire-retardant plastic sheeting of at least six mil thickness in\nsizes and shapes to minimize the number of joints shall be used. (m) Repair materials. Non-ACM materials shall\nbe used. Repair materials shall be compatible with existing materials and\nsubstrates. Insulation and other repair materials shall also comply with all\napplicable building, energy and fire codes and shall be installed in accordance\nwith these codes and manufacturer's recommendations. (n) Surfactants. Any surfactant used shall be\nnon-carcinogenic and non-toxic in its liquid form. (o) Ventilation for power tools. Power tools\nused to drill, cut, or otherwise disturb asbestos material in regulated\nabatement work areas, shall be manufacturer-equipped with HEPA-filtered local\nexhaust ventilation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-7.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
