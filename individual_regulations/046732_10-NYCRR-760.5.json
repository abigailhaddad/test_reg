  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 760.5 - Determinations of public need\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe following methodology shall be\nutilized in the evaluation of applications involving the establishment and/or\nconstruction of certified home health agencies, excluding long-term home health\ncare programs, in order to determine the need for such agencies. It is intended\nthat this methodology, when used in conjunction with the planning standards and\ncriteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Title, which are\nalso applicable to the determination of need for certified home health agencies\nand which are incorporated herein, represent a statement of basic principles\nand planning/decisionmaking tools for guiding and directing the development and\nexpansion of certified home health agencies throughout the State. The\nmethodology is conceptually based on the application of uniform planning\nobjectives at the health systems agency and/or State level. Its purpose is to\nprovide guidance, to permit flexibility and to assist the health systems\nagencies, the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, the Public Health\n\nCouncil, the commissioner and potential applicants in determining the estimated\nneed for certified home health agencies. The objective of the methodology is to\nensure that an adequate supply of certified home health agency capacity is\navailable and accessible, while at the same time avoiding the proliferation of\nunneeded agencies. The application of the methodology is expected to result in\nreducing the need for institutional acute and long-term care by developing and\nexpanding the availability of certified home health agency services which may\nserve as appropriate alternatives to institutional care. (2)\n\nIn making determinations of public need\nunder this section prior to January 1, 1988, calculations of total projected\nneed, projections of met need, and determinations of standard agency case\ncapacity shall be based on agencies that have reported nursing cases by age and\nsex cohorts in diagnostic categories to the department on forms provided by the\ndepartment regardless of whether such cases were admissions of the reporting\nagency or admissions of another agency for which the reporting agency provided\nservices through contract arrangement. (b) (1)\n\nThe\ncommissioner shall designate certified home health agency planning areas within\neach health systems agency region among which the need estimates calculated\npursuant to this section will be allocated. The commissioner shall designate\neach county as a separate planning area unless, with the advice of the State\n\nHospital Review and Planning Council, he has approved a proposal by a health\nsystems agency to designate two or more contiguous counties as a planning\narea. (2)\nA health systems agency\nmay submit a proposal to the commissioner to designate two or more contiguous\ncounties as a planning area. Factors which shall be considered by a health\nsystems agency in proposing, the State Hospital Review and Planning Council in\nproviding advice regarding, and the commissioner in designating two or more\ncontiguous counties as a planning area shall include, but need not be limited\nto, the following: (i) provider travel\npatterns including driving time and availability of public\ntransportation; (ii)\nthe\navailability of existing certified home health agency case capacity; and\n(iii)\nother factors identified\nby the health systems agencies. (c) Certified home health agency need\nestimates. (1)\n(i) Certified home health agency need\nestimates shall be calculated at least once every three years using the most\ncurrently available and analyzed data. The factors and methodology to be\nutilized by the Public Health Council and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, in estimating the public need for certified home health agencies shall include, but need not be limited to, the development of statewide normative use rates, and consideration of the local characteristics and demographics of the planning\narea. Prior to January 1, 1986, the normative use rates shall be calculated on\nthe basis of reported certified home health agency nursing case. A\ncase\nis defined as an admission or readmission to a certified\nhome health agency during a given calendar year. Such cases shall include those\nreported in the noninfective disease and disability categories, the infective\nand parasitic diseases categories (excluding tuberculosis and venereal disease\nand all disease contacts) and the ill without diagnosis category (symptoms, signs and ill-defined conditions) or comparable categories as listed on the\ndepartment form. Subsequent to December 31, 1985, the calculation of normative\nuse rates shall also include consideration of certified home health agency\ncases which represent admissions or readmissions during a calendar year\ndirectly to therapy services. (ii)\n\nThe number of reported cases shall be adjusted by the department to remove\nreported cases from the data base which represent either nursing assessments\nsolely to determine an individual's eligibility to participate in the personal\ncare program administered by the Department of Social Services, or reporting\nerrors and inconsistencies. In the absence of explicit data, such adjustments\nshall be determined by the department based on the statewide distribution of\nnursing visits per case reported by certified home health agencies as follows: (a) the ratio of reported nursing visits to\nreported cases for each agency shall be computed; and\n(b) the reported nursing visits of an agency\ndivided by the statewide mean of the visit to case ratios minus one standard\ndeviation shall be computed to derive adjusted cases. (2)\n\nThe statewide normative use\nrates shall be derived using the lower of the reported cases as described in\nsubparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision or the adjusted cases as determined\nunder subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision for each county for the\nfollowing age/sex cohorts: (i) male, 0-19\nyears; (ii)\nmale, 20-44\nyears; (iii)\nmale, 45-64\nyears; (iv)\nmale, 65-74\nyears; (v) male, 75-84\nyears; (vi)\nmale, 85+\nyears; (vii)\nfemale, 0-19\nyears; (viii)\nfemale, 20-44\nyears; (ix)\nfemale, 45-64\nyears; (x) female, 65-74\nyears; (xi)\nfemale, 75-84 years; and\n(xii)\nfemale, 85+\nyears. (3)\n\nThe cases for\neach age/sex cohort for each county shall be expressed as a use rate in cases\nper 1,000 population and ranked from the lowest to the highest with the use\nrates for the same cohort for all other counties. Outliers shall be removed\nfrom the high end of each of the 12 age/sex cohort rankings. A use rate shall\nbe considered an outlier if it is the highest use rate in an age/sex cohort\nranking and is more than 20 percent higher than the next highest use rate in\nsuch ranking. After deletion of any outliers, the average of the 10 highest use\nrates for each of the 12 age/sex cohort rankings shall be determined. Such\naverage for each cohort ranking shall represent the statewide normative use\nrate for its respective cohort for purposes of estimating need. The statewide\nnormative use rates are then applied to the most current New York State\n\nDepartment of Commerce population figures for each county projected five years\ninto the future to derive an estimate of need, expressed as cases per\nyear. (4)\nA health systems agency\nmay submit a plan to the Public Health Council and the commissioner which\nproposes adjustments to the need estimates for a planning area within its\nregion. The Public Health Council and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, with\nthe advice of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, may reject or\napprove all or a portion of the proposed adjustments based upon consideration\nof pertinent factors, including, but not necessarily limited to the following: (i) whether the proposed adjustments reflect\nconsistency with the objectives and requirements of this section and section\n709.1\nof this Title; (ii)\nwhether the proposed adjustments take\ninto consideration the number of patients on alternate care status in hospitals\nserving the planning area; and\n(iii)\nwhether the proposed adjustments\nidentify special populations in need of certified home health agency\nservices. (d) (1)\n\nTo estimate unmet need for certified home\nhealth agencies in a planning area, the projected need as determined pursuant\nto subdivision (c) of this section, together with any adjustments thereto, shall be compared to the case capacity of approved certified home health\nagencies in such planning area projected five years into the future. Estimates\nof projected capacity of certified home health agencies shall be calculated at\nleast once every three years using the most currently available and analyzed\ndata. (2)\n\nThe projected capacity of\na certified home health agency that has reported case data to the department\nfor at least two calendar years shall be the number of annual adjusted cases\nprojected to grow for five years at an annual rate equal to the average annual\nstatewide case growth rate for all such certified home health agencies in the\n\nState for the two most recent calendar years for which case data has been\nanalyzed pursuant to this section, or the average annual case growth rate for\nall such certified home health agencies in the agency's planning area for the\ntwo most recent calendar years for which case data has been analyzed pursuant\nto this section, whichever is less. (3)\n\nThe projected case capacity for a\ncertified home health agency that has reported case data for one year only or\nthat was not operational during the most recent reporting year shall be no\ngreater than: (i) the adjusted cases reported\nfor the most recently completed and analyzed calendar year of operation, if\nany; or\n(ii)\nthe standard agency\ncase capacity for the population density category of the agency's planning\narea, whichever is higher. (4)\n\nThe standard agency case capacity of a\nplanning area shall be determined based on the population density category of\nthat planning area. For each population density category, the standard agency\ncase capacity shall be defined as the mean of the adjusted cases for all\ncertified home health agencies reporting cases for at least two calendar years\nin that population density category reduced by one standard error of the mean. In determining the standard agency case capacity, an agency's cases shall be\nexcluded if its inclusion would result in a shift in the standard agency case\ncapacity greater than 15 percent. Such exclusions shall be limited to one\nagency at the lower and upper end of the range of adjusted cases. If a\ncertified home health agency's reported cases in planning areas in more than\none population density category, the cases shall be counted in the population\ndensity category having the plurality of cases. For purposes of such\ndetermination, planning areas shall be grouped into the following population\ndensity categories: (i) areas with a\npopulation density no greater than 200 persons per square mile; (ii)\nareas with a population density greater\nthan 200 but no greater than 800 persons per square mile; (iii)\nareas with a population density greater\nthan 800 but no greater than 5,000 persons per square mile; or\n(iv)\nareas with a population density greater\nthan 5,000 persons per square mile. (5)\nA health systems agency may submit a\nproposal to the Public Health Council and the commissioner which recommends\nadjustments to reduce the estimates of projected met need for a planning area\nwithin its region. The Public Health Council and/or the commissioner, as\nappropriate, with the advice of the State Hospital Review and Planning Council, may reject or approve all or a portion of the proposed adjustments based upon\nconsideration of pertinent factors, including, but not necessarily limited to, documentation indicating that one or more approved agencies within its planning\narea will not attain or retain the growth rates projected for such\narea. (6)\n\nThe sum of the projected\ncase capacities for a planning area shall be the estimate of projected met need\nfor certified home health agency capacity for such area. (e) (1)\n\nNotwithstanding that need may otherwise have been determined to be met under\nthis section, the Public Health Council and/or the commissioner, as\nappropriate, may recognize the need for additional certified home health\nagencies or agency case capacity where: (i) an applicant proposes to provide services to patients that would otherwise\nrequire care in a facility or program licensed by the Office of Mental Health\nor the Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities when the\nappropriate office documents the number of individuals in the applicant's\nplanning area that are eligible for care in a facility or program licensed by\nsuch office who would also be eligible for and would benefit from certified\nhome health agency services, the nature of the certified home health agency\nservices required by such individuals, the expected length of time such\nindividuals would require certified home health agency services and the\ninability of existing certified home health agencies to provide such services. The Office of Mental Health or the Office of Mental Retardation and\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities shall provide the necessary documentation to the\ndepartment before an application to provide care for such individuals may be\nacted on. The certified home health agency case capacity approved to serve any\nspecial population under this subparagraph shall not be counted as part of the\navailable resources to satisfy public need for certified home health agency\ncase capacity otherwise estimated under this section; or\n(ii)\nan applicant proposes to be established\nas a special pilot program home health agency; and: (a) has demonstrated how the direct provision\nof home health agency services by the applicant will improve continuity of\ncare, access to services, cost effectiveness and efficiency; (b) has identified and described a particular\npopulation group and any special needs of such group, and has estimated the\nnumber of people therein to be served and the geographic area where the\nservices will be provided; (c) has\ndemonstrated how the applicant will be better able than other home health\nagencies in the service area to meet any special needs of the defined\npopulation group; and\n(d) has\nagreed to, and if approved shall, prepare and file an annual report to the\ncommissioner and the State Hospital Review and Planning Council on meeting the\nprogram's objectives, including reaching its approved case capacity, enhancing\nquality assurance and access to services, and improving cost effectiveness and\nefficiency. (2)\n\nThe commissioner shall: (i) specifically\nlimit the case capacity and service area of a special pilot program home health\nagency, approved pursuant to subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, consistent with the program scope as set forth in the application; and\n(ii)\napprove no more than 10\nsuch special pilot program home health agencies. (3)\n\nAn agency program approved pursuant to\nthis subdivision shall be exempt from the requirements relating to minimum\nannual case capacity and serving an entire certified home health agency\nplanning area as set forth in subdivisions (g) and (h) of this\nsection. (4)\n\nAn agency program\napproved pursuant to this subdivision shall not have a case capacity that\nexceeds 10 percent of the entire certified home health agency planning area's\nprojected need. (f) (1)\n\nThe need estimates for each planning area\ntogether with any approved adjustments determined under this section shall\nconstitute the estimate of the public need for certified home health agency\ncase capacity in the planning area. (2)\n\nPublic need shall be deemed satisfied for\neach planning area when the projected case capacity of approved certified home\nhealth agencies meets the estimate of public need for the planning\narea. (g) Approval\nof new agencies. (1)\n(i) Except as provided below, the number of\nnew agencies which may be approved in a certified home health agency planning\narea shall not exceed the nearest rounded number derived from dividing the\nunmet need by the standard agency case capacity for the planning area's\npopulation density category. (ii)\n\nWhere there is not sufficient remaining unmet need to approve a new agency\nunder subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a new agency may be approved to meet\nsuch unmet need if the Public Health Council determines that such need will not\notherwise be met and such unmet need is sufficient to sustain an efficiently\noperated agency. (2)\n\nWhere there is remaining unmet need, an agency may be approved to serve more\nthan one planning area without meeting the standard agency case capacity for\neach such planning area provided that the agency's total proposed case capacity\namong all planning areas to be served by it is no less than the standard agency\ncase capacity for the planning area to be served by such agency with the\ngreatest population density. (h) In addition to meeting the other\napplicable provisions of this section, an applicant for initial certification\nshall be approved as meeting public need only if the applicant: (1)\nagrees to serve the entire certified home\nhealth agency planning area. Pursuant to the procedure set forth in section\n709.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, exceptions to serving the entire planning area may be permitted under\nspecial circumstances, including but not limited to those set forth below, provided that the agency agrees to serve the entire alternate service area\ndesignated for such agency. Such circumstances include: (i) geographic barriers and/or travel time\nwhich may impede service delivery to the entire planning area provided that the\nremaining portion of the planning area is adequately served; (ii)\nproposals in which an applicant will\nfocus its program of care in specific underserved areas which form only a\nportion of a planning area; and\n(iii)\nother factors identified by the local\nhealth systems agency; and\n(2)\nagrees to serve general hospital\ninpatients on alternate care status that would be suitable to receive home\ncare; (3)\nagrees to serve\npopulation groups in the planning area that have difficulty gaining access to\nappropriate certified home health agency care due to minority status, age, medical history, case complexity, or payment source; and\n(4)\nensures the provisions of charity care in\neach fiscal year of the agency in an amount no less than two percent of the\nprojected total annual operating costs of the agency in that fiscal year for\nnot-for-profit and for-profit agencies and agencies operated by public benefit\ncorporations and 3 1/3 percent of projected total annual operating costs of the\nagency for public agencies. Charity care is care provided at no charge or\nreduced charge for the services the agency it certified to provide to patients\nwho are unable to pay full charges, are not eligible for covered benefits under\ntitle XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, are not covered by private\ninsurance and whose household income is less than 200 percent of the Federal\npoverty level. Adjustments to the required percentages of charity care may be\nmade by the department upon recommendation of the appropriate health systems\nagency to reflect significant county variations from the State average with\nrespect to the proportion of indigent and medically uninsured persons to the\ntotal population; and\n(5)\ndemonstrates an ability and willingness to attain a minimum annual case\ncapacity no less than the standard agency case capacity for its planning area\npopulation density category, or the remaining need, whichever is less, within\nthree years of the date of issuance of its certificate of approval. (i) For initial certification of\nhome health agencies and where public need is established herein, priority\nconsideration will be given to applicants who demonstrate that they will: (1)\nreduce the utilization of general\nhospital and residential health care facilities in the planning area; (2)\nprovide charity care in excess of that\nspecified in paragraph (h)(4) of this section; or\n(3)\nprovide, in addition to the minimum\nservices required by this Subchapter, three or more of the following which\ninclude social work, occupational therapy, physical therapy, speech/language\npathology and nutrition services. (j) Any application wherein a determination\nof public need is made pursuant to this section shall be subject to the\nfollowing: (1)\n(i) The Public Health Council and/or the\ncommissioner, as appropriate, may, during the processing of an application, propose to disapprove the application solely on the basis of a determination of\npublic need in advance of the consideration of the other review criteria\nrequired by article 36 of the Public Health Law without, however, waiving the\nright to consider such other criteria at a later date. (ii)\n\nThe local health systems agency may, during its review process, determine to recommend disapproval of an application\nsolely on the basis of a determination of public need. (2)\n\nIn the event the Public Health Council\nand/or the commissioner proposes to disapprove an application on the basis of a\nlack of public need and the applicant requests a hearing, the Public Health\n\nCouncil and/or the commissioner, as appropriate, may direct the completion of\nthe other reviews required by article 36 of the Public Health Law. The\napplication shall then be returned to the Public Health Council and/or the\ncommissioner as appropriate, to consider such reviews, the results of which may\nthen be included as grounds for the proposed disapproval to be considered at\nthe hearing. If the Public Health Council and/or the commissioner, as\nappropriate, directs the completion of such reviews, a copy of the report\ncontaining the results of the reviews shall be mailed to the applicant at least\n60 days prior to the date set for hearing. (3)\n\nIn the processing of an establishment\napplication, the commissioner may recommend disapproval based on a review\nlimited to a determination of public need. In the event the Public Health\n\nCouncil does not concur with the commissioner's recommendation of disapproval, it shall return the application to the department at which time all other\nrequired reviews shall be completed. When all other reviews are completed, the\napplication shall be returned to the Public Health Council for\naction. (k) The\nprovisions of this section shall be evaluated by the department and the health\nsystems agencies by January 1, 1988 to assure that projected need for certified\nhome health agencies is adjusted to reflect changes in health care delivery and\nmedical practice patterns, including but not limited to general hospital\nprospective payment, residential health care facility case mix reimbursement, improved facility discharge planning procedures, increased utilization of\nambulatory care, and uniform patient assessment of potential home care\nrecipients. This evaluation shall include an examination of the standard agency\ncase capacity, planning areas and other factors utilized in this\nsection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
