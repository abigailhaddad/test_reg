PURPOSE, SCOPE, AND\nGENERAL DESCRIPTION OF PRODUCTS COVERED\n1.1 Purpose.--The purpose of this Commercial Standard is to\npromulgate minimum standards for vinyl plastic film in order to maintain the\nquality of the materials in question for the mutual protection of manufacturers\nand consumers. 1.2 Scope. --This standard covers methods of test and\nrequirements for general purpose vinyl plastic film to insure satisfactory\nproducts for consumer use. The requirements and methods of test specify\nthickness tolerances, yield per roll, width tolerances, shrinkage at elevated\ntemperatures, contamination, appearance, crocking, tensile properties, tear\nresistance, volatility of plasticizer, water extraction, low-temperature\nimpact, and flammability. Suggested forms for declaring compliance with the\nstandard and an identifying hallmark are included. 1.3 General description of products covered. --The material\ncovered is nonrigid, unsupported, vinyl plastic film 10 mils and less in\nthickness, including transparent, translucent, and opaque material, whether\nplain, embossed, molded or otherwise surface treated. 2. DIMENSIONAL TOLERANCES\n2.1 Thickness. --The average thickness of the film shall be\nwithin +- 10 percent of that specified. The average thickness shall be\ndetermined from five uniformly spaced readings taken across the width of the\nsheet. The referee test method for average thickness shall be the method\ndescribed in paragraph 4.1. 2.1.1. Average thickness based on yield per roll.--The yield of\nmaterial in any one roll shall be based on average thickness of the film, which\nshall be +- 5 percent of the thickness specified, calculated as follows: Average thickness (mils) = 770 x net weight (lb)\nspecific gravity x length (yd) x width (in.). 2.2 Width. --The film shall be held to a tolerance of + 1/2 - 0\nin. of the width specified by the purchaser and agreed to by the manufacturer. This tolerance shall apply when the material is in roll form on the\ncore. 2.3 Length. --The length of material, excluding that which has\nbeen subjected to embossing, printing, etc., shall be continuous in any one\nroll, and the total length in a roll shall be as agreed to by the manufacturer\nand the purchaser. 3. REQUIREMENTS\n3.1 Shrinkage at elevated temperatures. --The average\ndimensional change shall be not greater than 7 percent in any direction when\nthe film is tested at a temperature of 100° C for 30 minutes in accordance\nwith the method referred to in paragraph 4.2. 3.2 Contamination. --The material shall be as free as is\ncommercially practicable from pinholes, particles of foreign matter, and\nundispersed raw materials. The material shall have no visible holes. 3.3 Appearance. --The material shall be as free as is\ncommercially practicable from visual defects, e. g., \"cold-checks,\" \"crow's\nfeet,\" \"pine trees,\" \"streaks,\" and \"blisters.\" It shall also have smooth\nedges, free from cuts and nicks. 3.4 Crocking. --The amount of color transferred from the\nspecimen under examination to the white test square shall not be perceptible\nwhen the material is tested in accordance with the method described in\nparagraph 4.3. 3.5 Tensile properties. --The minimum average tensile strength\nof the material, when tested in accordance with the method referred to in\nparagraph 4.4, shall be 2,100 psi when tested with the pendulum-type machine\nand 2,300 psi when a static-controlled separation-type machine is used. Either\nof these methods may be used. If the film meets the requirement by any one\nmethod, the film shall be considered as passed. The minimum ultimate elongation\nof the materials shall be 150 percent. 3.6 Tensile tear resistance. --The minimum average tensile tear\nstrength of the film (either plain or after embossing, if embossed) in any\ndirection shall be 200 lb/in. when tested in accordance with the method\nreferred to in paragraph 4.5. 3.7 Elmendorf tear resistance.--The minimum average Elmendorf\ntear strength of the film (either plain or after embossing, if embossed) in any\ndirection shall be 180 grams per sheet for film 3 mils or less in thickness, and 60 grams per mil for film greater than 3 mils in thickness, when tested in\naccordance with the method referred to in paragraph 4.6. 3.8 Plasticizer volatility. --The average weight loss based on\ninitial film weight shall be not more than 10 percent for film 3 mils or less\nin thickness, 9 percent for film 4 mils, 7 1/2 percent for film 6 mils, and 5\npercent for film 8 mils in thickness, when tested at a temperature of 70°\n+- 2° C (158° +- 3.6° F) for 24 hours in accordance with the method\nreferred to in paragraph 4.7. 3.9 Water extraction. -- The material shall show not more than\n1 percent average loss lay weight when tested in accordance with the method\nreferred to in paragraph 4.8. 3.10 Low-temperature impact. --Not more than 2 specimens out of\n10 shall fail when tested at a temperature of -17.8° +- 2° C (0° +-\n3.6° F) in accordance with the method described in paragraph 4.9. 3.11 Flammability.--The rate of burning shall not exceed 1.2\nin./sec as judged by the average of five determinations length wise and five\ndeterminations transverse to the direction of processing, when the material is\ntested with the SPI flammability tester in accordance with the method described\nin paragraph 4.10. NOTE.--Light stability. At the industry meeting on November 18, 1952, the desirability of including a requirement for light stability was\ndiscussed at some length. The Society of the Plastics Industry (SPI) Committee which\nprepared this recommended, Commercial Standard for general purpose vinyl\nplastic film recognized the value and need of such a requirement. However, after years of work by the SPI group, which was assigned the problem of\nselecting or developing a suitable method of test for light stability, as well\nas the enormous amount of work done by the American Society for Testing\n\nMaterials and various governmental agencies, such as the National Bureau of\n\nStandards, no suitable method has been found or developed. Two major\ndifficulties have been encountered: (1)\nthe poor degree of reproducibility\nbetween different pieces of apparatus of the same type; (2)\nthe poor degree of correlation between\nlaboratory light stability tests and service behavior. The SPI group working on light stability hopes to have a\nreasonably satisfactory method in a year or two. It was the opinion of the\ncommittee recommending this specification for promulgation as a Commercial\n\nStandard that it would be more of a detriment to the plastic film industry than\na benefit to wait for another 2 years to issue this standard because of the\nlack of this one test. When a suitable test method is developed, the Commercial\n\nStandard call be revised. Any help which anyone can offer to the SPI group will\nbe appreciated. 4. METHODS OF TESTS\n4.1 Average thickness (weight method). 4.1.1. Apparatus. (a) Analytical balance, equipped with pan straddle or other stationary support, sensitive to 0.0005 gm. (b) Class\nS. weights. (c) Beaker, 250\nml. (d) Fine nonabsorbent thread or\nwire. (e) Thermometer, 0° to\n100° C, graduated in 1° divisions. (f) Die or template, for cutting test\nspecimens, 10 cm by 10 cm, with a dimensional tolerance of +- 0.01 cm per\nside. (g) Sharp knife or razor. 4.1.2. Test specimens. --Five 10-cm by 10-cm specimens taken\nuniformly across the width of the sheet shall be tested. 4.1.3. Test conditions. --The specimens shall be conditioned and\ntested in accordance with procedure A of ASTM[FN1] D618, Tentative Methods of\n\nConditioning Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials for Testing. 4.1.4. Procedure. 4.1.4.1 By means of the die or template and the sharp knife or\nrazor, cut five specimens from the sample of material. 4.1.4.2 Weigh each specimen to the nearest 0.5 mg on the\nanalytical balance. Record the weight as W. 4.1.4.3 Following the procedure of ASTM D792, Methods of Test\nfor Specific Gravity of Plastics, method A, determine the specific, gravity of\neach specimen and record as D. Use of a wetting agent is recommended. 4.1.5. Calculations. --Calculate the average thickness of each\ntest specimen, using the following formula, and average the two values. T = 394W = 3.94 W, 100D D\nwhere\nT = average thickness of test, specimen in mils\nW = weight of test specimen in gm\nD = density of test specimen in gm/cc (specific gravity =\ndensity in metric units)\n394= conversion factor, cm to mils\n100= area of specimen in sq cm\n4.2 Shrinkage at elevated temperatures.--The dimensional change\nshall be determined in accordance with ASTM D1204, Method of Test for\n\nMeasurement of Changes in Linear Dimensions of Nonrigid Thermoplastics Sheeting\nand Film. 4.3 Crocking. 4.3.1. Definition. --Colorfastness to rubbing (crocking) is\nunderstood to be resistance to physical transfer of color from the material\ntested to a piece of white cotton under the conditions of the test. 4.3.2. Apparatus. --AATCC Crockmeter. (Crockmeter and cloth, 2-\nby 2-in. test squares, may be obtained from the secretary of the American\n\nAssociation of Textile Chemists & Colorists, Lowell Textile Institute, Lowell, Mass.)\n4.3.3. Materials. --White bleached cotton cloth, starch-free, cut into 2-in. test squares. Lawns, percales, or printcloths are suitable. (See\npar. 4.3.2). 4.3.4. Test specimens.--Two 2- by 5-in. specimens of film shall\nbe used, one for the dry test and one for the wet test. 4.3.5. Procedure. --The test specimen shall be preconditioned in\naccordance with ASTM D618, procedure A, Tentative Methods of Conditioning\n\nPlastics and Electrical Insulating Materials for Testing. The test specimen\nshall then be placed on the base of the Crockmeter so as to rest flat on the\nabrasive cloth with its long dimension in the direction of the rubbing. The\nsquare of white testing cloth is mounted over the end of the finger which\nprojects downward from the slide, with the weave oblique to the direction of\nrubbing, and is held in place by the spiral clip. The covered finger of the\nslide is then placed on the test specimen and is slid back and forth for 20\nrubbings, that is, for 10 steady turns of the crank at the rate of 1 turn per\nsecond. For wet rubbing (crocking) tests, the white testing square is\nthoroughly wet out in distilled water, squeezed, and then passed through a\nwringer between two sheets of filter paper just before use. Otherwise the\nprocedure for wet rubbing is the same as for dry rubbing. Accidental damage to the rubbing finger, spiral clip, or\nabrasive cloth may be repaired when noticeable as follows: The abrasive cloth\nis neatly renewed; the clip is bent further open or shut over an inserted rod\nof the correct diameter, as required; and the finger is resurfaced by movement\non an extra piece of fine emery cloth in a manner simulating regular\nuse. 4.4 Tensile properties.--The tensile strength and elongation\nshall be determined in accordance with method B of ASTM D882, Methods of Test\nfor Tensile Properties of Thin Plastic Sheets and Films, using specimens 1 in. wide. The thickness of the specimens tested shall be determined as described in\nparagraph 4.1. 4.5 Tensile tear resistance.--The tensile tear strength shall\nbe determined in accordance with ASTM D1004, Method of Test for Tear Resistance\nof Plastic Film and Sheeting. The thickness of the specimens tested shall be\ndetermined as described in paragraph 4.1. 4.6 Elmendorf tear resistance.--The Elmendorf tear strength\nshall be determined in accordance with ASTM D689, Method of Test for Internal\n\nTearing Resistance of Paper, except that readings obtained where the tear\ndeviates more than 10 mm (3/8 in.) from the line of the initial slit shall not\nbe rejected when obtained with embossed films. The thickness of the specimens\ntested shall be determined as described in paragraph 4.1. 4.7 Plasticizer volatility. --The plasticizer volatility shall\nbe determined in accordance with ASTM D1203, Method of Test for Volatile Loss\nfrom Plastic Materials. 4.8 Water extraction.--The percentage loss in weight from\nextraction by distilled water shall be determined in accordance with ASTM\nD1239, Method of Test for Resistance of Plastic Films to Extraction by\n\nChemicals, except that the specimens shall be preconditioned for 3 hours at\n50° +- 3° C (122° +- 5.4° F), removed from the oven, placed in\nthe desiccator, and allowed to cool to room temperature before weighing. Also, the immersion test shall be made for 24 hours at 50° +- 3° C (122°\n+- 5.4° F) in distilled water only. 4.9 Low-temperature impact. 4.9.1. Apparatus. --Cold chambers, at least 18 by 18 by 18 in., that open from the top are preferable. Dry-ice cabinets, cooled by circulated\nair and solid carbon dioxide, that are equipped with heater units perform well\nfor this test. The impact machine shown in figures 1 and 2 is constructed of\ncold-rolled steel except for the bolts, screws, and rubber stopper. All\nstructural parts (i, e., base, anvil, arm, arm supports, and shaft) may be\nchromium-plated. The arm including rubber stopper and bolt shall weigh 6 lb 13\noz, +- 1 oz. Lubricants are not usually necessary. However, if lubrication\nis necessary, suitable low-temperature lubricants shall be used. A 2- by 5 3/4-in. die; a good desk-type stapler with metal\nbase, and stop mounted on base exactly 1/2 in. back of the center of the groove\nthat turns the staple; 2- by 5-in. cards of regular 5- by 8-in. index-file-card\nstock. 4.9.2. Procedure.--The impact machine shall be in the cold\nchamber at -17.8° +- 2° C (0° +- 3.6° F) at all times. The\ntemperature shall be measured in close proximity to the test specimen. Ten specimens shall be cut with a die with the long dimension\nparallel with the transverse direction of the film or sheet. Each 2- by 5 3/4\nin. specimen shall be cut and folded lengthwise with a normal loop at room\ntemperature. The two ends of the folded specimen and one end of the 2- by 5-in. card shall be matched exactly, with the loop lying on the card. Two staples\nshall be crimped, 1/2 in. from and parallel to the 2-in. end of the\nstack. The mounted specimens with loops up shall be placed in the cold\nchamber at the desired testing temperature for a conditioning period of 1\nhour. The card with specimen (after conditioning) shall be placed on\nthe anvil with the crimped ends of the staples on the back of the card fitted\ninto the groove in the anvil. (See fig. 2.) The card shall be handled, not the\nsample. The arm shall be allowed to fall free from a position within 5 degrees\noff perpendicular to the base. In order to facilitate this, a mechanical\nrelease device may be employed. The arm shall then be raised, the sample on the\ncard shall be removed from the anvil, and the next specimen shall be positioned\nand struck, and so forth. The removed specimen shall be examined for failure, which shall\nconsist of breaking into two or more pieces. Image\n\nImage\n\nImage\n4.10. Flammability. 4.10.1. Apparatus and materials.--The apparatus shall be\nconstructed essentially as shown in figure 3 and shall consist of the\nfollowing: 4.10.1.1 Specimen holder.--A removable, flat, specimen-holding\nrack, the upper and lower sections of which are separate, shall have the shape\nand dimensions shown in figure 4 (sketch of sample-holding rack.) The specimen\nis supported by tight closure of the upper and lower sections around the sides\nof the specimen. The center section of the rack contains an open U-shaped area\nin which burning of the specimen takes place. At the open end of the rack the\nforked sides are at an angle of 45° for the last inch. Thus, when the rack\nis slid into the cabinet on runners mounted at a 45° angle, the bent\nportion of the specimen adjacent to the igniter flame is vertical and the\nremainder is at 45°. The switch actuators consist of suitable springs mounted on the\nside of the rack, one just beyond the curved portion at the open end, and the\nother at the closed end of the U-shaped holder. The springs are depressed and\nheld in position prior to ignition by means of cotton thread suitably wound\nacross the specimen and securely attached to the rack. As flame reaches these\nthreads, the springs are released, thus activating the microswitches of the\nstop clocks. 4.10.1.2 Igniter flame.--The igniter flame shall be produced at\nthe tip of a No. 22 hypodermic needle jet. The igniter shall be so located in\nthe cabinet that the tip of the needle is 9/16 in. from the surface of the\nspecimen when the specimen rack is in place. 4.10.1.3 Cabinet.--The cabinet shall protect the igniter flame\nand specimen from air currents during tests, yet contain a suitable door or\nwindow for visual operation, provision for inserting the specimen holder, and\nadjustable vents to supply sufficient air for combustion of the specimen. It\nshould also be capable of rapid ventilation following a test so that all\ncombustion products can be removed between tests. A hood may be used if its\nexhaust fan is turned off during the test. 4.10.1.4 Timing mechanism.--The burning rate shall be\ndetermined by a stop clock through microswitches mounted on the specimen-holder\nrack. The clock is started when the specimen flame burns the first thread, and\nis stopped when the thread at the upper end of the holder, 6 in. from the first\nthread, burns apart. The timing mechanism shall be capable of indicating time\ninterval to 0.1 second. 4.10.1.5 Butane. --Unless otherwise specified, butane gas shall\nbe used for the igniter flame. 4.10.1.6 Thread.--J. & P. Coats heavy-duty white cotton\nthread. 4.10.1.7 Microburner. 4.10.2. Test specimens. 4.10.2.1 Test specimens shall be 3 in, in width and 9 in. in\nlength. They shall be free from folds or wrinkles. Five specimens from each\ndirection (machine and transverse) of a given material shall be tested. 4.10.2.2 Conditioning. --The conditioning procedure shall\nconform to the requirements of procedure B of ASTM D618, Tentative Methods of\n\nConditioning Plastics and Electrical Insulating Materials for Testing. 4.10.3. Procedure. 4.10.3.1 After preparing the specimens, the holder shall be\nthreaded so as to depress the switch actuators (springs) at least 1/4 in. from\nthe edge of the holder. Each actuator shall be separately threaded, the thread\npassing down through the J-slots and under the upper jaws so that the thread is\nadjacent to the specimen when the holder is closed. 4.10.3.2 The specimen shall be inserted into the holder so that\nit extends down into the lock springs and is held firmly between the two wires\nat the open end of the burning channel. These wires insure that the end of the\nspecimen is always the correct distance from the igniter flame. The sample\nshall be free from wrinkles or distortion when the holder is closed. The\nspecimen should not extend beyond the outer edge of the lower plate, otherwise\nthe rack may not slide freely on the slide channel on introducing it into the\ncabinet. 4.10.3.3 Prior to introducing the specimen and holder into the\ncabinet, both electrical switches shall be set for automatic timing. The needle\nvalve regulating the butane flow shall be adjusted to provide a 1/2-in. flame. (When the specimen is in place its surface is 9/16 in. from the tip of the\nneedle and the flame is just barely flattened against the specimen. This can be\nchecked by using a specimen made of asbestos in place of a plastic\nspecimen.)\n4.10.3.4 With the hood fan off, clocks zeroed, and the flame\nadjusted as mentioned, the door is closed and the specimen holder is then\ninserted at a constant rate. The holder should be allowed to slide down the\nrails by gravity, taking about one-half second to travel the length of the\nslide. Any hesitation in bringing the specimen holder fully into burning\nposition may cause erroneous ignition results. 4.10.3.5 The burning time shall be read from the stop clock and\nthe rate of burning calculated. Results that deviate from the mean value of all\ntests should be rejected if the deviation of the doubtful value is more than\nfive times the average deviation from the mean obtained by excluding the\ndoubtful value. Such doubtful values shall be discarded and retests\nmade. 5.
