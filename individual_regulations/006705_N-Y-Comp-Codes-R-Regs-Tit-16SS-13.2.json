(7)\nA service application\nmust be signed by the applicant or an authorized agent of the applicant, and a\ncopy must be provided to the applicant or agent. In the case of agents, a\nutility may require suitable proof of the authorization of the agent. (c) Denial of application.

(3)\nA\nutility shall advise any applicant who submits an incomplete application, in\nwriting and within three business days after receipt of the application, of the\ninformation and/or documents that must be submitted in order for the\napplication to be considered complete. Such notice shall not itself be\nconsidered a denial of the application. (4)\n\nEvery utility shall maintain, for a\nperiod of not less than one year, service applications that are denied and the\nutility's written notice of denial. (d) Utilities shall comply with subdivisions\n(a) and (b) of this section no later than March 18, 1988. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
