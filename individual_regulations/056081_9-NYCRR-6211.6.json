  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6211.6 - Voter History and Prevention of Duplicate Voting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) During the early voting period, the\nvoting history record for each voter shall be continually updated to reflect\nthat a voter has voted early. A record indicating a voter has voted during the\nearly voting period shall be available to poll workers at every early voting\nsite at which a voter is eligible to vote in near real time. In such instance\nwhere a voter is only eligible to vote at one early voting site, the single\npoll book at such site for such voter may serve as the continually updated\nrecord of voter history throughout the early voting period. (b) By Election Day, the voting history\nrecord of each voter who has cast a ballot during the early voting period shall\nbe entered into the voter registration system of the board of elections. Such\nvoting history shall be included in the voter registration poll record that is\nused on Election Day to determine the eligibility of voters. Such Election Day\nrecord must differentiate voters who voted early from those who appeared to\nvote on the day of election. (c) Any\nvoter who the board of elections has identified as having voted during the\nearly voting period shall not be eligible to vote on Election Day, except such\nvoter shall be entitled to complete an affidavit ballot if such voter claims\nnot to have voted early. Such affidavit shall be marked as such. (d) No later than the third day after a n\nelection, the voting history record of each voter who has signed a poll record\nand thus cast a ballot on such election day shall be entered into the voter\nregistration system of the board of elections, and the voter history for such\nelection day voters, early voters and all voters with a notation pursuant to\n\nElection Law § 9-209(1)(d) that indicates that the voter has voted in such\nelection shall be uploaded to the statewide voter registration list. (e) Not later than the third day after a n\nelection, by five o'clock p.m. on such day, the board of elections shall\nprepare a list, including data elements prescribed by the board of elections\nand in the format specified by the state board of elections, of all persons who\nsubmitted an affidavit ballot. Such list shall be provided to the state board\nof elections, and the state board of elections shall provide a combined list of\nall affidavit ballots submitted statewide to the boards of elections. (f) No later than seven businesses days after\nthe completion of the canvass, the voting history record of each voter who has\ncast an absentee, military, special or federal ballot on Election Day or who\nhas cast an affidavit ballot during early voting or on Election Day for whom\nsuch information was not already entered shall be entered into the voter\nregistration system of the board of elections and the statewide voter\nregistration list. (g) Boards of\nelections shall provide information regarding voter registration records or\nvoting records in their custody to other boards of elections, upon request, as\nsoon as reasonably practicable. (h) The board of elections, as required by Election Law § 8-600(1), shall establish\nprocedures to ensure that persons who vote during early voting shall not be\npermitted to vote subsequently in the same election. Such procedures shall\nremain in effect until amended by the board of elections and shall be filed\nwith the state board of elections on or before the sixtieth day preceding the\nfirst day of the early voting period. Such procedures shall be approved or\nrejected by the co-executive directors of the state board of elections within\ntwo weeks of filing. If such procedures are rejected, notice shall be provided\nto the board of elections of the reasons therefor. The board of elections shall\nthen have three business days to amend their procedures and resubmit the same\nto the state board of elections for approval. (i) Boards of elections shall provide to the\nstate board, in the manner specified by the state board, the number of voters\nwho vote early on each day of early voting by the next business day after such\nday of early voting. This notice is intended: to serve as both a notice of\nemergency adoption and a notice of proposed rule making. The emergency rule\nwill expire July 2, 2022. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
