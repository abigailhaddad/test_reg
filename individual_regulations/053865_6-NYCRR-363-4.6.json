(f) Environmental monitoring plan. The environmental monitoring plan must include: (1)\na description of the critical\nstratigraphic section; (2)\na\ndescription of all proposed monitoring points, including leachate, condensate, underdrains, groundwater, surface water, and sediment; (3)\nthe analyses to be performed; (4)\na description of the statistical methods\nto be used; (5)\nreporting\nrequirements; (6)\na site plan with\ntopographic contours which depicts the location of all proposed monitoring\npoints in relation to facility boundaries, surface water bodies, and property\nboundaries; and\n(7)\nan\nimplementation plan that contains a sampling schedule, the sequence of landfill\nconstruction, a schedule for the construction of the groundwater monitoring\nwells, and a schedule for initiation of the existing water quality and\noperational water quality monitoring programs, and a contingency water quality\nmonitoring plan which specifies trigger mechanisms for its\ninitiation. (8)\n\nSampling design\nrequirements. The environmental monitoring plan must comply with the following: (i) Groundwater sampling. Groundwater\nmonitoring wells must be capable of detecting facility-derived groundwater\ncontamination within the critical stratigraphic section. (a) Horizontal well spacing. (1)\n\nHorizontal spacing of wells must be based\nupon site-specific conditions. These conditions may include groundwater flow\nrates, estimated longitudinal and transverse dispersivity rates, proximity to\nor presence of sensitive environments and groundwater users, the nature of\ncontaminants disposed of at the site, and the proposed design and size of the\nfacility. (2)\n\nIn the first\nwater-bearing unit of the critical stratigraphic section: (i) monitoring well spacing along the\ndowngradient perimeter of the facility must not exceed 500 feet. The department\nmay require closer well spacing in sensitive or geologically complex\nenvironments; (ii)\nmonitoring well\nspacing along the upgradient or crossgradient perimeter of the facility must\nnot exceed 1,500 feet. The department may require closer well spacing in\nsensitive environments or where upgradient sources of contamination are known\nto exist; and\n(iii)\nin areas of\npoorly defined flow conditions, the number of monitoring wells and well spacing\nmust be decided based on site-specific hydrogeology, subject to approval by the\ndepartment. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment may require the monitoring of water-bearing units below the first\nwater-bearing unit based on the potential for contaminant migration to those\nunits. Well spacing in any subsequent water-bearing units must be decided based\non site-specific hydrogeology, subject to approval by the department. (4)\n\nSensitive environments or areas where\npublic health concerns exist may be subject to more intensive groundwater\nmonitoring requirements. In addition, the department may require the applicant\nto develop an acceptable computer model of contaminant plume behavior from\nhypothetical leaks in the liner system to assist in determining monitoring well\nplacement. (5)\n\nAll downgradient\nmonitoring wells must be located within 50 feet of or as close as possible to\nthe waste boundary to ensure early detection of any contaminant plume, unless\nprecluded by site conditions. All monitoring wells should avoid construction\nwithin structural berms wherever possible. (6)\n\nAll upgradient monitoring wells must be\nplaced far enough from the waste boundary to avoid any facility-derived\nimpacts. (b) Well screen\nplacement. (1)\n\nWell screens must be located\nto readily detect groundwater contamination throughout the saturated thickness\nof the first water-bearing unit, and must be installed at a representative\nnumber of points at each subsequent permeable unit throughout the critical\nstratigraphic section. Well screens must not act as conduits through\nimpermeable layers. Wells monitoring the uppermost water bearing unit must be\nscreened to ensure that the water table surface is within the screened interval\nat all times. (2)\n\nUpgradient and\ncrossgradient monitoring wells must monitor the same hydrologic units as the\ndowngradient monitoring wells, whenever possible. (3)\n\nScreen length. Well screens must not\nexceed 20 feet in length, unless otherwise approved by the department. The\napplicant must provide technical justification for the actual screen length\nchosen. (c) Geophysical\nand geochemical techniques. The department may require the use of geophysical\nand geochemical techniques where existing contamination is suspected, to locate\ncontaminated zones before selecting well locations and screen depths for\nenvironmental monitoring points. (d) The department may require the monitoring\nof any groundwater suppression system built at a facility. Existing water\nquality monitoring at these points may not be required. (ii)\n\nSurface water and sediment sampling. The\nenvironmental monitoring plan must include monitoring points for all surface\nwater bodies that may be significantly affected by a contaminant release from\nthe facility. Sampling activities at these monitoring points must include\nsurface water, and may include sediment if determined necessary by the\ndepartment. (a) In bodies of standing water, these points must be located at the closest point to the facility and must be\nincluded in existing water quality monitoring. (b) In streams, these points must include\nsufficient upgradient and downgradient locations to allow the facility's impact\nto be measured. (c) Monitoring of\nany on-site spring, seep or groundwater discharge zone may be required if the\nflow rate is sufficient to permit collection of an adequate sample\nvolume. (d) Any iron floc deposits\nwhich form in springs, seeps or groundwater discharge zones downgradient of the\nfacility must be described and sampled as part of the Site Investigation\n\nReport. These deposits may, at the discretion of the department, be included in\nthe monitoring program. (iii)\n\nLeachate sampling. The location of all\nleachate sampling points at the facility must be described. (a) All sampling points should be located to\nminimize pumping of leachate before sampling. Sampling points in the primary\nand secondary leachate collection system should be adequate to sample liquids\nbeneath each discrete leachate collection area or facility cell. (b) Leachate in the primary leachate\ncollection system of new cells must be analyzed semi-annually for expanded\nparameters for a minimum of five years after cell operation begins. After five\nyears of cell operation, the department may consider a reduction to annual\nsampling if the owner or operator demonstrates that the concentrations of\nconstituents have not changed significantly as supported by statistical\nanalysis. (c) Leachate in the\nsecondary leachate collection system must be monitored semi-annually for\nbaseline parameters. Sampling and analysis requirements may be increased if the\nallowable leakage rate, as defined in paragraph 363-7.1(f)(7) of this Subpart, is exceeded. After five years of cell operation, the department may consider a\nreduction to annual sampling if the owner or operator demonstrates that the\nconcentrations of constituents have not changed significantly as supported by\nstatistical analysis. (iv)\n\nWater supply well sampling. If sampling\nand analysis of water supply wells is to be performed, then the sampling\nfrequency and analysis for water supply wells should be determined on a\ncase-by-case basis in conjunction with the Department of Health and/or the\nlocal health department. (v) Condensate sampling. The location of all condensate sampling points at the\nfacility must be described. Condensate sampling in new cells must be done\nsemi-annually for expanded parameters for a minimum of five years. After five\nyears, the department may consider reductions in the frequency of testing, number of parameters analyzed, and number of locations sampled if the owner or\noperator demonstrates constituent concentrations are stable as supported by\nstatistical analysis and that the proposed remaining sampling locations will be\nrepresentative of the locations previously sampled. (9)\n\nWater Quality Monitoring Programs. A\nwater quality monitoring program must be implemented for all environmental\nmonitoring points specified in the environmental monitoring plan. As described\nin this subdivision, the water quality monitoring program must be tailored to\nthe site to establish existing water quality prior to disposal of waste, operational water quality during operation of the site, the post-closure\nperiod, and the custodial care period, and, if contamination is detected at the\nsite, contingency water quality. (i) Existing\nwater quality. The facility must establish an existing water quality database\nto characterize the site geochemistry. (a) The permit application must include a preliminary evaluation of water quality\nconsisting of two rounds of sampling and analyses for a representative number\nof monitoring points. The representative number of monitoring points must\ninclude upgradient and downgradient locations (if practical) in each\nwater-bearing unit within the critical stratigraphic section. (1)\n\nThe first round of sampling must be\nanalyzed for expanded parameters. The second round must be analyzed for\nbaseline parameters plus any additional parameters which were detected in the\ninitial expanded parameters analysis. These samples should be taken at the\napproximate periods of high and low groundwater flow. (2)\n\nThe department may require sampling and\nanalysis of additional monitoring points to further define site geochemistry in\nsupport of the interpretations and conclusions of the site investigation\nreport. (b) The\nfollowing must be completed before the facility becomes operational. (1)\n\nAll of the environmental monitoring\npoints must be sampled and analyzed for four rounds. The first round must be\nanalyzed for expanded parameters, followed by a minimum of three rounds of\nsampling and analysis for baseline parameters, plus any additional parameters\nwhich were detected in the initial expanded parameters analysis. Each of the\nfour rounds must occur during a different quarter of the year. The department\nmay approve phased sampling as facility cells are constructed. The sampling of\nthese phased monitoring points should begin at least one year prior to waste\ndeposition and must conform with the analytical requirements of this\nclause. (2)\nA database of existing\nwater quality must be established for each hydrogeologic flow regime being\nmonitored at the site. The department may require collection of data subsequent\nto initial facility operation from upgradient monitoring points, or other\nmonitoring points that have not been altered by landfill activities, in order\nto augment and refine the existing water quality database. (3)\n\nThe existing water quality at a facility\nmay be determined using: (i) an interwell\nanalysis (i.e., the pooling of all of the environmental monitoring points\nwithin a given hydrogeologic flow regime); (ii)\nsubsets of interwell analyses (i.e., the\npooling of environmental monitoring points into two or more subsets of\nenvironmental monitoring points within a given hydrogeologic flow regime); or\n(iii)\nan intrawell analysis, where each individual monitoring point is monitored independently of all other\nwells within a given hydrogeologic flow regime. A minimum of eight quarters\nmust be completed for each well that is to be evaluated on an intrawell\nbasis. (4)\n\nThe existing\nwater quality database must comply with the following requirements: (i) the existing water quality database must\ninclude a separate data set for each parameter. Each data set must include one\nor more sampling events and one or more sampling points. Decisions regarding\nhow to group data into data sets must be made in a manner that maximizes the\nextent to which variability within the data sets approximates a normal\ndistribution; (ii)\nfor each data\nset, the mean (existing water quality value), standard deviation and\ncoefficient of variation must be calculated. For the purpose of these\nregulations, data sets which have a coefficient of variation of 0.5 or less\nwith less than 15 percent of the data being non-detects will be considered\nsuitable for use in setting \"Type A\" statistical trigger values. The \"Type A\"\nstatistical trigger value for each data set is calculated by adding three\nstandard deviations to the mean. In cases where the percentage of non-detects\nexceeds 15 percent, the coefficient of variation is greater than 0.5, or there\nare other indications that the data set is not normally distributed, the\nexisting water quality value is defined as the median of the data set and a\n\"Type B\" statistical trigger value corresponding to the 90th percentile of the\ndata set must be used; (iii)\nthe\nfollowing practices must be followed to minimize variability within data sets\nwhich are included in the existing water quality database: (a) the size of data sets should be maximized\nby pooling data from different wells which are screened within the same\nhydrostratigraphic unit and show similar pre-operational water\nquality; (b) monitoring points\nwhich exhibit significant differences in pre-operational water quality for a\nparticular parameter should not be pooled within the same data set for that\nparameter. In cases where it is necessary to split data sets due to\nheterogeneity of data, it may be necessary to compensate for the reduced size\nof the data set by collecting additional rounds of pre-operational water\nquality data or by augmenting pre-operational data with upgradient operational\ndata; (c) Non-detects with\nassociated detection limits higher than applicable standards or higher than\ndetected values within the same data set, must not be used as a basis for\nestablishing existing water quality; (d) for statistical calculations, except as\nallowed in subitem (c) above, non-detects will be assigned a value of one-half\nthe detection limit; and\n(e) steps\nmust be taken to ensure that detection limits associated with non-detected\nvalues in existing water quality data sets do not exceed the applicable\ngroundwater quality standards or any of the detected values for other sampling\npoints and/or rounds of sampling within the same data set. Non-detects\nassociated with elevated detection limits must be discarded and additional\nsamples must be collected from the affected monitoring point in order to\nprovide the minimum number of data points required for characterization of\nexisting water quality. (iv)\n\nIf the department determines that the\nsampling results are not representative of existing water quality, or do not\nconstitute a normal, uniform distribution, the department may specify\nadditional sampling and/or analyses it considers necessary to establish\nexisting water quality at the site. (5)\n\nIf elevated contaminant levels are\ndetected and additional detailed information is needed to establish a complete\nexisting water quality database, the department may require one or more rounds\nof routine, baseline or expanded parameter sampling and analysis in any\nsampling point. (6)\n\nAdditional\nsampling and analysis beyond the site boundaries may be required to determine\nthe nature and extent of contamination, as well as the source if possible. This\nevaluation may require the construction, sampling, and analysis of additional\nmonitoring wells and/or surface water sampling points. Based upon the results\nof this additional data, the department may require analysis for any and all\nexpanded parameters, to be included in quarterly or annual operational water\nquality sampling. (ii)\n\nOperational water quality. The\noperational water quality monitoring is conducted during the operation, closure, and post-closure periods of the facility must be described. The\noperational water quality monitoring must be designed to distinguish\nfacility-derived contamination from the existing water quality at the site\nusing the trigger values established pursuant to item 363-\n4.6(f)(9)(i)('b')('4')('ii') of this section. The minimum requirements for\noperational water quality monitoring are: (a) sampling and analysis must be performed at least quarterly, once a year for\nbaseline parameters and 3 times for routine parameters. The baseline sampling\nevent must occur at the same time each year; (b) the department may approve phased\nsampling as facility cells are constructed. The sampling of the phased\nmonitoring points must begin at least one year prior to waste deposition in the\nnewly constructed cells or as approved by the department; (c) the department may allow a facility to\nreduce its monitoring from quarterly to semi-annually if the facility can meet\nthe following conditions: (1)\nthe secondary\nleachate collection and removal system demonstrates conformance with the\nallowable leakage rate requirements of paragraph 363-7.1(f)(7) of this\n\nSubpart; (2)\nthe facility has\ncompiled at least five years of operational water quality data; (3)\nthe department is satisfied that the\nfacility has not contaminated groundwater; (4)\nthe groundwater flow velocity is not\nexcessive, flow direction has not changed significantly, and hydrogeologic\nconditions at the site support the operator's position that it can be\nadequately monitored; and\n(5)\nthe\nfacility must monitor semi-annually for baseline parameters. (d) the department may allow the\nomission of the winter sampling round once a complete understanding of water\nchemistry has been obtained and the facility demonstrates an acceptable liner\nperformance to the department. (e) Operational water quality analysis must include at least those parameters\nspecified in the Water Quality Analysis Tables in subdivision\n363-4.6\n(h) of this\nsection for routine and baseline parameters. The department may modify these\ntables before granting a permit for the facility, or during the duration of the\npermit, based on the leachate composition. If subsequent leachate compositions\nvary or if the waste disposed of at the facility changes, the department may\nadjust analytical requirements accordingly. (f) Within 90 days of completing the\nquarterly field sampling activities, the owner or operator must determine if a\nsignificant increase has occurred for any parameter at any monitoring well. A\nsignificant increase has occurred if the water quality result for a parameter\nexceeds the trigger value for that parameter established pursuant to item\n363-4.6(f)(9)(i)('b')('4')('ii') of this section. For parameters which do not\nhave a statistical trigger value because pre-operational and upgradient data\nare limited to non-detects, detection of the parameter for the first time in a\nmonitoring point is considered a significant increase. (g) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to clause (e) of this subparagraph, at any monitoring well that there\nis a significant increase for one or more of the parameters during field\nsampling for the routine or baseline parameters, excluding the field\nparameters, the owner/operator: (1)\nmust, within 14 days of this finding, notify the department indicating which\nparameters have shown significant increases; and\n(2)\nmust sample and analyze all monitoring\npoints, or an approved subset, for the baseline parameters during the next\nquarterly sampling event. Subsequent sampling and analysis for baseline\nparameters must be conducted at least semiannually until the significant\nincrease is determined not to be facility-derived or the department determines\nmonitoring is not needed to protect public health and the environment; or\n(3)\nmay attempt to demonstrate\nto the department that a source other than the facility caused the\ncontamination or that the significant increase resulted from error in sampling\nor analysis, or from natural variation in groundwater quality. This\ndemonstration may include one or more verification samples, collected from the\naffected monitoring point and analyzed for the parameter in question. A\nnarrative documenting this demonstration must be included with the quarterly\nmonitoring report, or separately submitted to the department for review and\napproval. If a successful demonstration is made, documented and approved by the\ndepartment, the owner or operator may continue operational water quality\nmonitoring as specified in this clause. (h) If the owner or operator determines, pursuant to clause ('f') of this subparagraph, that there is a significant\nincrease for one or more of the parameters during two successive monitoring\nevents at any monitoring well, the owner or operator: (1)\nmust, within 14 days of this finding, notify the department indicating which parameters have shown significant\nincreases; and\n(2)\nmust implement a\ncontingency monitoring program meeting the requirements of subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph within 90 days. (iii)\n\nContingency water quality. A\ncontingency water quality monitoring, as described in this paragraph, which\nmust be conducted when a significant increase over the existing water quality\nvalue has been detected pursuant to clause (f)(9)(ii)('f') of this paragraph\nfor one or more of the routine or baseline parameters listed in the Water\n\nQuality Analysis Tables in subdivision (h) of this section. All contingency\nwater quality monitoring plans are subject to department approval, and must\ninclude the following: (a) within 90 days of\ntriggering a contingency water quality monitoring program, the owner or\noperator must sample and analyze the groundwater for the expanded parameters\nlisted in the Water Quality Analysis Tables in subdivision\n363-4.6\n(h) of this\n\nPart. A minimum of one sample from each monitoring well (upgradient and\ndowngradient), or a selected subset, must be collected and analyzed during this\nsampling. If any constituents are detected in the downgradient wells at\nconcentrations exceeding the applicable trigger values as a result of the\nexpanded parameter analysis, a minimum of two independent samples from each of\nthe sample wells must be collected within 30 days of obtaining the results of\nthe expanded parameter analysis and analyzed for the detected constituents. These samples must be collected within two weeks of each other and then\ncompared to the existing water quality database established pursuant to\nsubparagraph 363-4.6(f)(9)(i) of this section. If an increase in the existing\nwater quality values in the upgradient wells is indicated by this comparison, the existing water quality values for these parameters must be revised to\nreflect the newly acquired upgradient contingency monitoring data within each\nhydrogeologic flow regime. The department may delete any of the expanded\nparameters if it can be shown that the removed parameters are not reasonably\nexpected to be in, or derived from, the waste contained in the landfill based\non the leachate sampling being performed pursuant to subparagraph\n363-4.6(f)(8)(iii) of this section; and\n(b) after obtaining the results from the\ninitial or subsequent sampling required in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the owner or operator must: (1)\nwithin 14\ndays, notify the department to identify the expanded parameters that have\nexhibited a significant increase from the existing water quality value; (2)\nwithin 90 days, and on a\nquarterly basis thereafter, resample all wells, conduct analyses for all\nbaseline parameters, and for those additional expanded parameters that exhibit\nsignificant increases. In addition, the owner or operator must sample and\nconduct analyses annually on all wells for the expanded parameters. At least\none sample from each upgradient and downgradient well must be collected and\nanalyzed during these sampling events. The department may reduce the\nrequirements of this clause based on site-specific conditions; and\n(3)\nestablish groundwater protection\nstandards for all parameters that exceed trigger values calculated in\naccordance with item (f)(9)(i)('b')('4')('i') of this paragraph. The\ngroundwater protection standards must be established in accordance with clause\n('c') of this subparagraph. (4)\n\nIf\nthe concentrations of any of the expanded parameters are shown to be at or\nbelow the applicable trigger values for two consecutive sampling events, the\nowner or operator must notify the department of this finding and, if approved\nby the department, may remove that parameter from the contingency water quality\nmonitoring program. If the concentrations of all the parameters are shown to be\nbelow the applicable trigger values for two consecutive sampling events, then\nthe owner or operator must notify the department and, if approved by the\ndepartment, may return to operational water quality monitoring. (5)\nif the concentrations of any expanded\nparameters are above the applicable trigger values, but all concentrations are\nbelow the groundwater protection standard established under clause ('c') of\nthis subparagraph, the owner/operator must continue contingency\nmonitoring. (6)\nif one or more\nparameters are detected at levels above the groundwater protection standard\nestablished under clause ('c') of this subparagraph in any sampling event, the\nowner or operator must notify the department within 24 hours to identify the\nexpanded parameters that have exceeded the groundwater protection standard, and\nnotify appropriate local government officials within seven days of detection. The owner or operator must also: (i) demonstrate that a source other than the facility caused the contamination, or\nthat the significant increase resulted from error in sampling or analysis, or\nfrom natural variation in groundwater quality. This report must be submitted\nfor approval by the department. If a successful demonstration is made, the\nowner or operator must continue monitoring in accordance with the contingency\nwater quality monitoring program pursuant to subparagraph (f)(9)(iii) of this\nsection, and may return to operational monitoring if the expanded parameters\nare at or below the applicable trigger values established pursuant to item\n(f)(9)(i)('b')('4')('ii') of this section. Unless and until a successful\ndemonstration is made, the owner or operator must comply with subclause ('6')\nof this clause, including initiating an assessment of corrective measures; or\n(ii)\ncomply with the following: (a) characterize the nature and extent of the\nrelease by installing additional monitoring wells as necessary; (b) install at least one additional\nmonitoring well at the facility boundary in the direction of contaminant\nmigration and establish the existing water quality for this well; (c) notify all persons who own land or reside\non land that is directly over or within 500 feet downgradient of any part of\nthe plume of contamination if contaminants have migrated off-site as indicated\nby sampling of wells in accordance with subclause ('1') of this clause; and\n(d) initiate an assessment of\ncorrective measures pursuant to the provisions of Subpart 363-10 of this\n\nPart; (7)\ndemonstrate that a source other than the facility caused the contamination, or\nthat the significant increase resulted from error in sampling or analysis, or\nfrom natural variation in groundwater quality. This report must be submitted\nfor approval by the department. If a successful demonstration is made, the\nowner or operator must continue monitoring in accordance with the contingency\nwater quality monitoring program pursuant to subparagraph 363-4.6(f)(9)(iii) of\nthis section, and may return to operational monitoring if the expanded\nparameters are at or below the applicable trigger values established pursuant\nto item 363-4.6(f)(9)(ii)('b')('4')('ii') of this section. Unless and until a\nsuccessful demonstration is made, the owner or operator must comply with clause\n(e) of this subparagraph, including initiating an assessment of corrective\nmeasures. (c) The owner\nor operator must establish a groundwater protection standard for each parameter\ndetected above its statistical trigger value in the groundwater. The\ngroundwater protection standards are: (1)\nfor\nparameters for which a maximum contaminant level (MCL) has been established in\n40 CFR Part\n141, as incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title, or for which a\nstandard has been established pursuant to Part 701, 702, or 703 of this Title, the MCL or the standard established under this Title for that constituent, whichever is more stringent; (2)\nfor parameters for which MCLs or standards have not been established, the\ntrigger value for the parameter established from wells in accordance with item\n(f)(9)(i)(b)(4)(ii) of this paragraph; or\n(3)\nfor parameters for which the trigger\nvalue established pursuant to item (f)(9)(i)(b)(4)(ii) of this section is\nhigher than the MCL or standard, the trigger value. (10)\n\nReporting\n\nRequirements. Unless more rapid reporting is required to address an imminent\nenvironmental or public health concern, the owner or operator of the facility\nmust report all water quality monitoring results to the department within 90\ndays of the conclusion of the sample collection. The report must include: (i) a table showing the sample collection\ndate, the analytical results (including all peaks even if below method\ndetection limits [MDLs]), designation of upgradient wells and location number\nfor each environmental monitoring point sampled, potentiometric data, applicable water quality standards, and groundwater protection standards if\nestablished, MDLs, and Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) numbers for all\nparameters; (ii)\ntables or\ngraphical representations comparing current water quality with existing water\nquality and with upgradient water quality.

The site analytical\nplan must describe the method of sample collection and preservation, chain of\ncustody documentation, analyses to be performed, analytical methods, data\nquality objectives, procedures for corrective actions, and procedures for data\nreduction, validation and reporting. The site analytical plan will pertain to\nexisting water quality monitoring programs, operational water quality\nmonitoring programs, and a contingency water quality monitoring program that\nspecifies trigger mechanisms for its initiation. The site analytical plan must\ncomply with the following: (1)\n\nData quality\nobjectives. (i) The data quality objectives\nfor the data generation activity must be established prior to the initiation of\nany sampling. (ii)\n\nThe data quality\nobjectives must define the goals of each phase of the water quality monitoring\nprogram, including, but not limited to, the following: (a) reasons for the analytical\nprogram; (b) identification of any\nregulatory programs and standards applicable to the analytical program; and\n(c) minimum detection limits\nfor each of the parameters listed in the Water Quality Analysis\n\nTables. (iii)\n\nThe data\nquality objectives must be the basis for the development of all other portions\nof the site analytical plan. (2)\n\nAnalytic quality assurance (AQA)/analytic\nquality control (AQC). The site analytical plan must include a discussion of\nthe AQA/AQC for the sampling program associated with the facility and must be\nsufficient to ensure that the data generated by the sampling and analysis\nactivities are of a quality commensurate with their intended use and the\nrequirements of the department. The discussion must detail the AQA/AQC goals\nand protocols for each type of environmental monitoring to be performed at the\nfacility. Elements must include a discussion of the quality objectives of the\nproject, enumeration of AQC procedures to be followed, and reference to the\nspecific standard operating procedures that will be followed for all aspects of\nthe environmental monitoring program. (3)\n\nField sampling procedures. (i) All field sampling procedures must be\ndescribed in detail in the site analytical plan. All field quality control\nprocedures must be described including types and frequency of field quality\ncontrol samples to be collected (e.g., field blanks, trip blanks, field\nduplicates, reference materials and material blanks). (ii)\n\nAll samples must be collected and stored\nin the order of the parameter's volatilization sensitivity using methods, consistently applied, which ensure sample integrity. (iii)\n\nAll sampling equipment must be\nconstructed of inert components designed to obtain samples with minimal\nagitation and contact with the atmosphere; be cleaned and protected during\ntransport to avoid contamination; and checked before use. Dedicated equipment\nmust be constructed of appropriate inert components and must be appropriate for\nthe types of sampling to be performed. (iv)\n\nSamples must be properly preserved and\ndelivered to the laboratory with proper chain of custody within all appropriate\nholding times for the parameters to be analyzed. (v) The sampling procedures and frequencies\nmust be protective of public health and the environment. (vi)\n\nMonitoring well sampling techniques must\nbe consistently performed each time a well is sampled, and must comply with the\nfollowing: (a) In areas where the presence of\nexplosive or organic vapors is suspected, ambient air in the well must be\nchecked for their presence before the well is evacuated. (b) For wells with documented contamination, where contamination by non-aqueous phase liquids may be present, standing water\nin the well must be checked for immiscible layers or other contaminants that\nare lighter or heavier than water (floaters or sinkers). If present, floaters\nor sinkers must be sampled and analyzed separately by a method described in the\nsite analytical plan. (c) Evacuation of the well must replace stagnant water in the well and the sand\npack with fresh water representative of the formation. Evacuation methods, including pumping rate, depth of pump intake, and method of determining\nsufficiency of evacuation must be consistently applied each time the well is\nsampled. Evacuation methods must create the least possible turbidity in the\nwell. Where the static water level in the well is above the top of the sand\npack, the water level should not be lowered below the top of the sand pack\nduring purging whenever feasible. Evacuated water must be properly\nmanaged. (d) The proposed\nevacuation methods to be used at the facility must be described in the\nenvironmental monitoring plan. All alternative evacuation techniques proposed\nfor the facility wells must be identified for each well. (e) After evacuation of the well, volatile\norganic samples must be collected. (f) Field analysis must be performed after\nvolatile organic samples have been collected, either within the borehole using\na probe or from the next sample collected. All field test equipment must be\ncalibrated at the beginning of each sampling day and checked and recalibrated\naccording to the manufacturer's specifications. Calibration data must be\nreported with the analytical results. (g) Groundwater samples must not be filtered, except when due to site-specific conditions, sample turbidity cannot be reduced\nto 50 nephelometric turbidity units (NTUs) or less by good sampling technique\nor well redevelopment, the department may approve collection of both filtered\nand unfiltered samples for analyses of the inorganic parameters. All other\nrequired analyses will be on the unfiltered samples. (vii)\n\nSurface water and sediment sampling\ntechniques must be consistently applied to all samples, and must comply with\nthe following: (a) Surface water samples\ncollected from shallow water should not include bottom sediment. In shallow\nmoving water, downstream samples must be collected first to avoid disturbances\nfrom the bottom sediments. (b) Each\nwater body over three feet deep that is sampled must be checked for\nstratification, and each stratum must be checked for contamination using field\nparameters. Each stratum showing evidence of contamination must be separately\nanalyzed. If no stratum shows evidence of contamination, a composite sample\nhaving equal parts of water from each stratum must be analyzed. (c) Sediment samples may be taken at each\nlocation from which surface water samples are taken, and should consist of the\nupper five centimeters of sediment. (viii)\n\nWater supply well sampling methods\nmust be consistently applied each time a well is sampled and must comply with\nthe following: (a) If possible, samples\nshould be collected directly from the well so as to yield water representative\nof the formations supplying the well. If this is not possible, samples must be\ncollected as near to the well as possible and before the water is softened, filtered, or heated. (b) If\npossible, samples should be collected before the water enters the pressure\ntank; otherwise the water must run long enough to flush water stored in the\ntank and pipes. (c) Before\nsampling, water must be evacuated from the well to ensure a fresh sample of\naquifer water. (d) If samples are\ncollected from a tap, aerators, filters, or other devices must be removed\nbefore sampling. (ix)\n\nCorrective action. Standard operating procedures must be established describing\nthe procedures used to identify and correct deficiencies in the sample\ncollection process. The standard operating procedure must specify that each\ncorrective action be documented in the sampling report submitted to the\ndepartment, with a description of the deficiency, the corrective action taken, and the persons responsible for implementing the corrective action. Any\nalterations to the field sampling procedures must be included as an amendment\nto the site analytical plan. (4)\n\nLaboratory procedures. (i) Laboratory analyses must be performed by\na laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval categories by\nthe New York State Department of Health's Environmental Laboratory Approval\n\nProgram (ELAP). (ii)\n\nThe site\nanalytical plan must contain the standard operating procedures of all\nlaboratory activities related to the environmental monitoring plan. Any\nrevisions to these standard operating procedures must be documented. Standard\noperating procedures must be available for the following, at a minimum: (a) receipt, storage and handling of\nsamples; (b) sample scheduling to\nensure that holding time requirements are met; (c) reagent/standard preparation; (d) general laboratory techniques (e.g., glassware cleaning procedures, operation of analytical balances, pipetting\ntechniques and use of volumetric glassware); (e) description of how analytical methods are\nactually to be performed including precise reference to the analytical method\nused, and not a simple reference to standard methods; (f) standard operating procedures for\nequipment calibration and maintenance to ensure that laboratory equipment and\ninstrumentation are in working order, including, but not limited to procedures\nand schedules for calibration and maintenance in accordance with manufacturer's\nspecifications; and\n(g) for a\ncorrective action, standard operating procedures must be established for\nidentifying and correcting deficiencies in the laboratory procedures. The\nstandard operating procedure must specify that each corrective action be\ndocumented in the sampling event report submitted to the department with a\ndescription of the deficiency, the corrective action taken, and the person\nresponsible for implementing the corrective action. Any alterations to the\nlaboratory procedures must be included as an amendment to the site analytical\nplan. (5)\n\nData quality assessment. At the conclusion of each sampling event and analysis\nof the samples collected, data quality assessment must occur. A data quality\nassessment report must be submitted with the results from each sampling event. Data quality assessment must occur in two phases - data validation and data\nusability analysis. (i) Data validation. (a) For those sampling events for which only\nroutine parameters are analyzed, the required data validation may be performed\nby the laboratory that performed the sample analyses. (b) For those sampling events in which\ngroundwater samples are analyzed for baseline or expanded parameters, the data\nvalidation must be performed by a person with experience with similar\nvalidation projects and who is not affiliated with the laboratory that\nperformed the analyses and who is acceptable to the department. (c) The data validation must be performed on\nall analytical data for the facility at a rate acceptable to the department, but not less than five percent of the data generated, and must consist, at a\nminimum, of the following: (1)\nfield records\nand analytical data are reviewed to determine whether the data are accurate and\ndefensible. All AQA/AQC information must be reviewed along with any corrective\nactions taken during that sampling event; and\n(2)\nall data summaries must be clearly marked\nto identify any data that are not representative of environmental conditions at\nthe site, or that were not generated in accordance with the site analytical\nplan. (ii)\n\nData usability analysis. (a) The data\nusability analysis must be performed on all analytical data generated by the\nrequirements for this Part for the facility and must consist of the following: (1)\nan assessment to determine if the data\nquality objectives were met; (2)\nfor consistency, comparison of the analytical data with the results from\nprevious sampling events; (3)\nevaluation of field duplicate results to indicate the samples are\nrepresentative; (4)\ncomparison of\nthe results of all field blanks, trip blanks, equipment rinstate blanks, and\nmethod blanks with full data sets to provide information concerning\ncontaminants that may have been introduced during sampling, shipping, or\nanalysis; (5)\nevaluation of matrix\neffects to assess the performance of the analytical method with respect to the\nsample matrix, and determine whether the data have been biased high or low due\nto matrix effects; (6)\nintegration\nof the field and laboratory data with geological, hydrogeological, and\nmeteorological data to provide information about the extent of contamination, if it occurs; and\n(7)\ncomparison of\nprecision, accuracy, representativeness, comparability, completeness, and\ndefensibility of the data generated with that required to meet the data quality\nobjectives established in the site analytical plan. (h) Water\nquality analysis tables. The water quality analysis tables in this section list\nthe routine, baseline, and expanded parameters for analysis of all monitoring\nsamples. The department may modify the parameters for analysis based on the\nlocation of the landfill or site-specific characteristics of waste disposed at\nthe landfill.
