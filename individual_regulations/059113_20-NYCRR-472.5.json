  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 472.5 - Maximum gross weight in excess of legal limits\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 502\n\nIn the event that the maximum gross weight set forth in\nthe permit is in excess of the legal limits provided in the Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw, nevertheless the issuance of such a permit does not authorize a vehicle to\ncarry weights in excess of those permitted by the Vehicle and Traffic Law. Accordingly, an operator of a motor vehicle may be guilty of a violation of the\nweight provisions of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and subject to the penalties\ntherein imposed even though the highway use permit issued for such vehicle sets\nforth a maximum gross weight in excess of the legal limits. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n472.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
