  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.38 - Parlay betting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nconsistent with the public interest and the best interests of racing generally, with permission of the commission, the track operator may offer parlay betting\nas a service to the betting public. (b) The parlay is not a pari-mutuel pool. The\nparlay is a series of bets combining betting entries in win, place, show or\nproposition pools in each of two or more separate races in chronological order. The initial amount bet constitutes the bet on the first betting entry in the\nfirst parlay race (leg); if successful, the payoff from winning the first leg\n(to the lowest penny) is then bet on the betting entry designated in the second\nleg; if again successful, and if the parlay continues, the payoff from winning\nthe second leg is then bet (to the lowest penny) in the third leg; etc. (c) A parlay bet may combine\nany of the races on the program and must combine at least two and not over\neight races. Bets are limited to win, place, show or proposition pool types for\nwhich a corresponding pool is conducted on the race selected. The races in a\nparlay must be chronological but need not be consecutive nor combine the same\ntype pool. The parlay shall be designated on one pari-mutuel ticket that may\nalso evidence other parlay bets combining the same races. A parlay bet ticket\nmust contain all win, place or show bets without any proposition bets or all\nproposition bets without any win, place or show bets. (d) A parlay bet may not combine bets in the\nsame race or earlier races (so-called reverse bets) nor on races on other\nprograms. (e) While payoffs\ninserted as bets in subsequent races are broken to the lowest penny (unlike\nregular payoffs), payoffs to the parlay bettor shall be broken to the lowest\ndime. Resulting parlay breakage shall be reported separately and added to\nregular breakage at the end of the program for the purpose of taxation and\ndistribution. (f) Parlay payoffs\nwill be so inserted as bets in subsequent pools by the track operator that the\namount of such bets, including their effect on the betting odds, will be\ndisplayed as soon as possible after the initial change of the morning line\ndisplay. (Bet totals in such pools shall be displayed in truncated fashion, to\nthe lowest dollar.)\n(g) If any\ntaxing authority requires the withholding of any portion of a winning parlay\npayoff prior to the completion of all bets in the parlay, such parlay shall\nthereupon terminate at such point and be payable to the ticket holder without\nfurther completion, selections in future races being voided. Such consequence\nshall be publicly announced and prominently displayed by the track operator who\nshall inform the public by explanation and examples of the operation of this\nsubdivision before the start of the racing program. (h) Parlay wagers may be cancelled by the\nticket holder, in accordance with track policy on cancellations, only prior to\nthe start of the first parlay race in which a parlay selection starts. Thereafter, the parlay must either be completed or be terminated by operation\nof these rules in order to be entitled to a payoff. The holder of the parlay\nticket shall not have the option to cash in such bet prior to completion after\na designated parlay entry actually starts in a race. (i) If a race, pool or betting entry in a\nparlay is scratched (which includes an entry being declared a nonstarter for\nbetting purposes, or a race or pool being declared \"off\") the parlay shall be\nconstituted by the remaining legs; if there are no remaining legs, the parlay\nterminates. (j) A bet on a coupled\nentry or field is considered a bet on the remaining part of such coupled entry\nor field in the event any part of such entry or field starts for pari-mutuel\npurposes in accordance with section\n4122.27\nof this Part. Parlay\ntickets incorporating an entry or field in which a scratch occurs are\nrefundable only in accordance with subdivision (h) of this section. (k) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable to the public by the track operator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
