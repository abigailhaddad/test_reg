(b) New York C corporations. Every New York C\ncorporation subject to the tax imposed by article 9-A must file form CT-300 on\nor before the fifteenth day of the third month following the close of its\ntaxable year and pay with such form a mandatory first installment of estimated\ntax equal to: (1)\n25% of the second preceding\nyear's tax, if such tax exceeded $1,000 but was equal to or less than $100,000; or\n(2)\n40% of the second preceding\nyear's tax, if such tax exceeded $100,000. (c) The mandatory first installment required\nto be paid pursuant to this section must be paid for a taxable year of any\nlength, including short taxable years. (d) Examples. Example 1: Corporation A, a New York C corporation, is a\ncalendar-year filer. Its tax for the 2020 taxable year is $200,000 and its tax\nfor the 2021 taxable year is $50,000. Since the mandatory first installment of\nestimated tax for C corporations is based on the second preceding year's tax, Corporation A must pay a mandatory first installment of estimated tax for the\n2022 taxable year equal to $80,000 (40% of $200,000). The installment must be\nmade on form CT-300, on or before March 15, 2022. Example 2: Corporation B, a New York S corporation, is a\ncalendar-year filer. Its tax for the 2021 taxable year is $3,000. Since the\nmandatory first installment for S corporations is based on the preceding year's\ntax, Corporation B must pay a mandatory first installment of estimated tax for\nthe 2022 taxable year equal to $750 (25% of $3,000). The installment must be\nmade with its report required for the 2021 taxable year (or with its\napplication for extension) due on or before March 15, 2022. Example 3: Corporation C, a New York C corporation, has\ntwo short periods for the 2021 taxable year. Its tax for the first 2021 short\nperiod, January 1, 2021, through August 31, 2021, is $710,000 and its tax for\nthe second 2021 short period, September 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021, is\n$340,000. Corporation C must pay a mandatory first installment of estimated tax\nfor the 2022 taxable year equal to $284,000 (40% of $710,000) on form CT-300, on or before March 15, 2022. Example 4: Corporation D, a New York C corporation, is a\ncalendar-year filer. Its tax for the 2020 taxable year is $10,000,000 and its\ntax for the 2021 taxable year is $16,000,000. Corporation D knows that a short\nperiod report will be required pursuant to section\n6-1.2\nof this Subchapter for the\nperiod January 1, 2022, through March 31, 2022. It must still pay a mandatory\nfirst installment of estimated tax for the 2022 taxable year equal to\n$4,000,000 (40% of $10,000,000) on form CT-300, on or before March 15, 2022. Example 5: Corporation E, a New York C corporation, first becomes subject to tax under article 9-A on June 1, 2021. Its first New\n\nYork taxable year runs June 1, 2021, through December 31, 2021. Corporation E\nis not required to pay a mandatory first installment of estimated tax for the\n2022 taxable year because it was not required to file a report for the second\npreceding taxable year of 2020.
