This paragraph does not apply if\nadequate and sufficient data are available to justify values greater than 100\nug/L using procedures from both sections 702.4 and\n702.5\nof this Part. The derivation\nof this value for any specified mixture does not preclude the existence or\nderivation of a Health (Water Source) standard or guidance value for any\nindividual organic substance in the mixture.
