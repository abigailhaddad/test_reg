  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 153.9 - Mooring facilities during closed season\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Floats which have actually transported\nfreight on the canal system at some time during the immediately preceding\nnavigation season, including tugs which have supplied motive power to such\nfloats, will be afforded free mooring facilities at the canal terminals for a\nperiod not to exceed one year insofar as space is available. The Canal\n\nCorporation shall assign such mooring space by issuance of a revocable permit\npursuant to Part 156 of this Title. (b) Preference will be given to loaded floats\nover light floats, and the operator of any float or floats may be called upon\nto shift such float or floats from time to time to a different berth, or to\nanother terminal, when in the opinion of the Canal Corporation, such change of\nberth is desirable. When adequate space for loaded floats is not available, the\nlight floats may be required to vacate the terminal. If such order for change\nof berth or to vacate a berth is not accomplished promptly, the shift may be\nmade by the Canal Corporation and the cost of such shift will become a charge\nagainst the float and its owner. (c) Floats which have not transported freight on the canals during the immediately\npreceding navigation season, may be allowed to moor at the canal terminals\nunder a revocable permit and at a mooring rate to be determined by the Canal\n\nCorporation. (d) Floats used in the\nrepair of the active canal floats described in the above subdivisions may be\nassigned mooring facilities at a mooring rate to be determined by the Canal\n\nCorporation when, in the discretion of the Canal Corporation, space is\navailable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n153.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
