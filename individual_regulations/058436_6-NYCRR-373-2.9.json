  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.9 - Use and management of containers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of all hazardous waste facilities that store containers of hazardous\nwaste, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. Note: Under sections\n371.1\n(h) and\n371.4\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Title, if a hazardous waste is emptied from a container, the residue\nremaining in the container is not considered hazardous waste if the container\nis \"empty\" as defined in section\n371.1\n(h). In that\nevent, management of the container is exempt from the requirements of this\nsection. (b) Condition\nof containers. If a container holding hazardous waste is not in good\ncondition (\ne.g., severe rusting, apparent structural defects)\nor if it begins to leak, the owner or operator must transfer the hazardous\nwaste from this container to a container that is in good condition, or manage\nthe waste in some other way that complies with the requirements of this\n\nSubpart. (c) Compatibility of waste with containers. The owner or operator must use a container made of or\nlined with materials which will not react with, and are otherwise compatible\nwith, the hazardous waste to be stored, so that the ability of the container to\ncontain the waste is not impaired. (d) Management of containers. (1)\nA container holding hazardous waste must\nalways be closed during storage, except when it is necessary to add or remove\nwaste. (2)\nA container holding\nhazardous waste must not be opened, handled or stored in a manner which may\nrupture the container or cause it to leak. (3)\n\nContainers holding hazardous waste must\nbe marked with the words \"Hazardous Waste\" and with other words identifying\ntheir contents. Note: The use of containers in transportation is governed by\nU.S. Department of Transportation regulations, including those set forth in\n49 CFR\n173.28\n(see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]). (e) Inspections. At least weekly, the owner or operator must inspect areas\nwhere containers are stored, looking for leaking containers and for\ndeterioration of containers and the containment system caused by corrosion or\nother factors. Note: See section\n373-2.2\n(g)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart and subdivision (b) of this section for remedial action required\nif deterioration or leaks are detected. (f) Containment. (1)\n\nContainer storage areas, other than those\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, must have a containment system\nthat is designed and operated as follows: (i) A base must underlie the containers, which is free of cracks or gaps and is\nsufficiently impervious to contain leaks, spills and accumulated precipitation\nuntil the collected material is detected and removed. (ii)\n\nThe base must be sloped or the\ncontainment system must be otherwise designed and operated to drain and remove\nliquid resulting from leaks, spills or precipitation, unless the containers are\nelevated or are otherwise protected from contact with accumulated\nliquids. (iii)\n\nThe containment\nsystem must have sufficient capacity to contain 10 percent of the volume of\ncontainers or the volume of the largest container, whichever is greater. Containers that do not contain free liquids need not be considered in this\ndetermination. (iv)\n\nRun-on into the\ncontainment system must be prevented unless the collection system has\nsufficient excess capacity in addition to that required in subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph to contain any run-on which might enter the system. (v) Spilled or leaked waste and accumulated\nprecipitation must be removed from the sump or collection area in as timely a\nmanner as is necessary to prevent overflow of the collection system. Note: If the collected material is a hazardous waste under Part\n371 of this Title, it must be managed as a hazardous waste in accordance with\nall applicable requirements of Parts 372 and 373. If the collected material is\ndischarged through a point source to waters of New York State, it is subject to\nthe requirements of title 17 of article 17 of the ECL. (2)\n\nStorage areas that store\ncontainers holding only wastes that do not contain free liquids need not have a\ncontainment system defined by paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except as\nprovided by paragraph (3) of this subdivision or provided that: (i) the storage area is sloped or is\notherwise designed and operated to drain and remove liquid resulting from\nprecipitation; or\n(ii)\nthe\ncontainers are elevated or are otherwise protected from contact with\naccumulated liquid. (3)\n\nStorage areas that store containers holding the wastes listed in this paragraph\nthat do not contain free liquids must have a containment system defined by\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision: F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and\nF027. (g) Special\nrequirements for ignitable or reactive waste. Containers holding ignitable or reactive waste must be\nlocated at least 15 meters (50 feet) from the facility's property line. Note: See section\n373-2.2\n(i)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart for additional requirements. (h) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible\nwastes, or incompatible wastes and materials (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples), must not be placed in the same\ncontainer, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in an unwashed container that previously\nheld an incompatible waste or material. Note: As required by section\n373-2.2\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with\nthis subdivision. Also, section\n373-2.2\n(i)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart requires waste analyses, trial tests or other documentation to\nassure compliance with paragraph (i)(2) of such section. As required by section\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must place the results of each waste analysis\nand trial test, and any documented information, in the operating record of the\nfacility. (3)\nA storage\ncontainer holding a hazardous waste that is incompatible with any waste or\nother materials stored nearby in other containers, piles, open tanks or surface\nimpoundments must be separated from other materials or protected from them by\nmeans of a dike, berm, wall or other device. Comment: The purpose of this section is to prevent fires, explosions, gaseous emission, leaching or other discharge of hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste constituents which could result from the mixing of incompatible\nwastes or materials if containers break or leak. (i) Closure. At closure, all hazardous waste and hazardous waste\nresidues must be removed from the containment system. Remaining containers, liners, bases, and soil containing or contaminated with hazardous waste or\nhazardous waste residues must be decontaminated or removed. Note: At closure, as throughout the operation period, unless\nthe owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with 6 NYCRR\n371.1\n(d)(4), that the solid waste removed from the containment system is not a hazardous\nwaste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must\nmanage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 372 and 373\nof this Title. (j) Air emission standards. The owner or operator shall manage all\nhazardous waste placed in a container in accordance with the applicable\nrequirements of sections\n373-2.27, 373-2.28 and\n373-2.29\nof this Subpart.
