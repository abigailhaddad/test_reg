  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 188.10 - Records schedules issued by the state archives\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General records retention and disposition\nschedules may be issued by the State Archives to authorize the retention and\ndisposition of records common to some or all agencies. (b) At least 40 days prior to issuance, the\n\nState Archives will forward a copy of a proposed general records schedule to\nthe offices of the Attorney General and State Comptroller for their review. The\n\nAttorney General or a designee shall review the schedule to determine if\nproposed dispositions meet legal requirements. The State Comptroller or a\ndesignee shall review the schedule to determine if proposed dispositions meet\nfiscal and audit requirements. If either the Attorney General or State\n\nComptroller, within 30 days after receiving a proposed schedule, shall advise\nthe State Archives that any records should not be destroyed according to the\nproposed schedule, no authorization to destroy such records will be included on\na general records retention and disposition schedule issued by the State\n\nArchives. (c) Each agency records\nmanagement officer shall inform the director in writing of the agency's intent\nto adopt and use a general records schedule. Adoption of a general records\nschedule eliminates the need for an agency to comply with the provisions of\nsection\n188.6\nof this Part for those\nrecords included on the general records schedule. In the event of duplication\nof any record series between a general records retention and disposition\nschedule and an approved agency retention and disposition schedule, the\nprovisions of the agency schedule shall prevail for that agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n188.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
