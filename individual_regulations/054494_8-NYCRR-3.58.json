(iii)\n\nThe department may make site visits to\nthe proprietary college for which transfer of degree-conferring authority is\nbeing requested and institutions operated by the prospective owner, and require\nthe prospective owner to provide additional reports and documentation in\nsupport of its application. (iv)\n\nThe deputy commissioner shall review the information submitted by the\nprospective owner and information obtained during the department's site visits, and other information obtained by the department during the department's review\nfor transfer of degree-conferring authority, and make a recommendation on the\nmatter within 60 days of receipt of a complete application, as determined by\nthe department.

(i) The Board of Regents may\nconsent to a temporary transfer of degree-conferring authority after the change\nof ownership or control of the institution already has been made, upon an\nadequate showing of good cause by the institution. For purposes of this\nparagraph, good cause shall include but not be limited to, evidence\nsatisfactory to the Board of Regents that conditions outside of the new owner's\ncontrol caused the transfer of ownership or control of the institution prior to\nthe institution obtaining the consent of the Board of Regents for the transfer\nof degree-conferring authority, provided that it is in the best interests of\nstudents at the institution to permit the institution to continue to offer\ndegree programs. (ii)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall review the institution's application for a temporary transfer\nof degree-conferring authority and may request other information from the\ninstitution during its review.

(iii)\n\nWhen the department determines that it\nis in the best interests of students of the institution, the department may\nrequire the institution to have a teach-out agreement with other institution(s)\nthat is acceptable to the department, before making a positive recommendation\nto the Board of Regents that it grant consent to the temporary transfer of\ndegree-conferring authority. The teach-out agreement shall be a written\nagreement between the institution requesting consent to the temporary transfer\nof degree-conferring authority and one or more degree-granting institutions. The agreement shall provide for the continuity of educational services to\nstudents enrolled in registered programs at the institution in the event that\nthe Board of Regents does not consent to the transfer of degree-conferring\nauthority after a review pursuant to paragraph (6) of this subdivision. To be\nacceptable to the department, the teach-out agreement shall ensure that the\nteach-out institution(s): (a) has the\nnecessary experience, resources, and support services to provide educational\nprograms that are of acceptable quality and reasonably similar in content, structure, and scheduling to that provided by the institution requesting\nconsent to the transfer of degree-conferring authority; and\n(b) can provide students access to the\nprograms and services without requiring them to move or travel substantial\ndistances. (iv)\n\nThe\n\nBoard of Regents consent to such temporary transfer may limit or condition the\ndegree-conferring authority of the institution. Such temporary transfer shall\nbe for an initial period not to exceed 180 days, but may be extended for such\nadditional periods as determined by the Board of Regents. (v) Before consent to a temporary transfer of\ndegree-conferring authority may be granted, the new owner must also apply under\nthe regular procedures of paragraph (6) of this subdivision for the review\nrequired for the transfer of degree-conferring authority. (f) Revocation of or limitation on\ndegree-conferring authority. (1)\n\nThe Board of\n\nRegents may revoke in whole or part or limit the degree-conferring authority of\na proprietary college for sufficient cause. As a prerequisite for the\nrevocation in whole or part of degree-conferring authority in accordance with\nthe requirements of this subdivision, all registered programs at the\ninstitution leading to the degree(s) covered by the revocation must first be\ndenied re-registration by the department pursuant to the requirements and\nprocedures prescribed in Part 52 of this Title. Such prerequisite shall not\napply when the proceeding under this subdivision does not concern revocation of\nan institution's authority to confer a degree or degrees and only concerns\nlimitations on degree-conferring authority, such as enrollment caps. (2)\n\nProcedures for determining whether to\nrevoke or limit degree-conferring authority. (i) The department may review the capacity of\na proprietary college to continue to have degree-conferring authority and may\ncause the institution to undergo site visits and require the institution to\nprovide reports and written information in support of the continuation of\ndegree-conferring authority. The department's review shall determine whether\nthe institution violated substantive requirements of Part 52 of this Title that\ndemonstrate that the institution does not have the ability to offer quality\nprograms leading to the degree(s) covered by the revocation or that demonstrate\nthat the institution must have limitations on degree-conferring authority to\nensure the quality of the degree programs offered by the institution. (ii)\n\nThe deputy commissioner shall review the\nrecord relating to the denial of re-registration of programs leading to the\ndegree(s) covered by the revocation, information submitted by the institution\nand information obtained during the department's site visits, and other\ninformation obtained during the department's review of the institution for\ncontinuing degree-conferring authority. Based upon such review, the deputy\ncommissioner may recommend that the Board of Regents revoke in whole or in part\nor otherwise limit the authority of a proprietary college to confer degrees\nupon sufficient cause, meaning the institution violated substantive\nrequirements of Part 52 of this Title that demonstrate that the institution\ndoes not have the ability to offer quality programs leading to the degree(s)\ncovered by the revocation or that demonstrate that the institution must have\nlimitations on degree-conferring authority to ensure the quality of the degree\nprograms. This recommendation shall include the factual basis for the\nrecommendation and shall be sent to the institution. (iii)\n\nWithin 30 days of receipt of the deputy\ncommissioner's recommendation to revoke or limit degree-conferring authority, the institution may request the deputy commissioner to reconsider that\nrecommendation, and may submit with the application for reconsideration\nadditional written information in support of its position. If the institution\ndoes not request reconsideration during this time frame, the deputy\ncommissioner's recommendation shall be the final recommendation on whether the\ndegree-conferring authority shall be revoked in whole or part or limited, and\nsuch recommendation shall be transmitted to the Board of Regents. (iv)\n\nIf the institution timely requests\nreconsideration, the deputy commissioner shall consider the additional written\ninformation submitted by the institution and make a final recommendation to the\n\nBoard of Regents on whether to revoke in whole or part or limit\ndegree-conferring authority of the institution. Such final recommendation shall\ninclude the factual basis for the recommendation and shall be sent to the\ninstitution and transmitted to the Board of Regents. (v) Within 30 days of receiving the final\nrecommendation of the deputy commissioner, the proprietary college may submit\nto the Board of Regents a written response to the deputy commissioner's final\nrecommendation, which may include supporting affidavits, exhibits, and\ndocumentary evidence and may present legal argument. In such written response, the proprietary college may at its discretion request an opportunity for oral\nargument. (vi)\n\nThe matter shall be\nreviewed by a panel of the Board of Regents consisting of at least three\n\nRegents designated by the Chancellor of the Board of Regents. This panel shall\nhear oral argument, if requested by the proprietary college in its written\nresponse as prescribed in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph. At this oral\nargument, representatives of the proprietary college and the deputy\ncommissioner may speak and present additional documentary evidence and written\nsubmissions. After its consideration of the deputy commissioner's\nrecommendation, the written response of the proprietary college, if any, and\noral argument and documentary evidence and written submissions taken at oral\nargument, if any, the designated Regents panel shall make a recommendation to\nthe full Board of Regents as to whether the degree-conferring authority shall\nbe revoked in whole or part or limited. Such recommendation shall include the\nfactual basis for the recommendation. (vii)\n\nRegents decision. At a regularly\nscheduled public meeting, the Board of Regents shall consider the findings and\nrecommendations of the designated Regents panel and make the final\ndetermination on whether the degree-conferring authority of the institution\nshall be revoked in whole or part or limited. (g) Surrender of degree-conferring authority. (1)\nA proprietary college may make\napplication to surrender in whole or in part its degree-conferring authority. Such application shall be in writing and submitted to the department. The\ninstitution shall describe in such application how it will meet the\ninstitutional responsibilities prescribed in subdivision (h) of this section\napplicable when there is a cessation of degree-conferring authority at a\nproprietary college. (2)\n\nAt a\nregularly scheduled public meeting, the Board of Regents shall determine\nwhether to accept the proprietary college's request to surrender in whole or\npart its degree-conferring authority. (h) Institutional responsibilities upon\ncessation of degree-conferring authority. A proprietary college whose\ndegree-conferring authority has expired or has been surrendered, denied, or\nrevoked shall: (1)\ncease recruitment for\nenrollment of new students in each program registered pursuant to Part 52 of\nthis Title creditable towards the degree or degrees covered by the expiration, surrender, denial, or revocation of degree-conferring authority; (2)\ncease operation of each program\nregistered pursuant to Part 52 of this Title creditable towards the degree or\ndegrees that are covered by the expiration, surrender, denial, or revocation of\ndegree-conferring authority by the effective date of such expiration, surrender, denial or revocation; and\n(3)\ncooperate with the department to ensure\nthat students already enrolled in programs creditable towards the degree or\ndegrees covered by the expiration, surrender, denial or revocation of\ndegree-conferring authority are able to find avenues for completion of their\nstudies with a minimum of disruption.
