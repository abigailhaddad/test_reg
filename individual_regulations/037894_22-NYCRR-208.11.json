  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 208.11 - Motion parts; motion calendars; motion procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Motion parts and calendars. There shall be such motion parts and motion calendars as the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts shall designate. (b) Motion procedure. (1)\n\nAll contested motions and\nproceedings shall be returnable at 9:30 a.m. unless an earlier time is directed\nby the court. The moving party shall serve copies of all affidavits and briefs\nupon the adverse parties at the time of service of the notice of motion. The\nanswering party shall serve copies of all affidavits and briefs as required by\nCPLR 2214. Affidavits shall be for a statement of the relevant facts, and\nbriefs shall be for a statement of the relevant law. Unless otherwise directed\nby the court, answering and reply affidavits and all other papers required to\nbe furnished to the court by CPLR 2214(c) must be filed no later than the time\nof argument or submission of the motion. (2)\nA judge presiding in any part of\ncourt where motions are returnable may determine that any or all motions in\nthat part be orally argued and may direct that moving and responding papers be\nfiled with the court prior to the time of argument. (3)\n\nUnless oral argument has\nbeen requested by a party and permitted by the court, or directed by the court, motion papers received by the clerk of the court on or before the return date\nshall be deemed submitted as of the return date. Attendance by counsel or pro\nse party at the calendar call shall not be required unless: (i) a party intends to make an\napplication to the court that is not on the consent of all parties; (ii)\nattendance of counsel or\noral argument is directed by the court; or\n(iii)\noral argument is requested by a\nparty. Attendance by counsel for a party not\nrequesting oral argument is not required where the hearing of oral argument is\nbased solely upon the request of another party. A party requesting oral\nargument shall set forth such request in its notice of motion or on the first\npage of the answering papers, as the case may be. A party requesting oral\nargument on a motion brought on by an order to show cause shall do so as soon\nas practicable before the time the motion is to be heard. (4)\n\nWhere there is an\nissue of fact to be tried the court may, in its discretion, order an immediate\ntrial of such issue, in which event the action shall be referred to the\nadministrative judge or a designee for assignment.
