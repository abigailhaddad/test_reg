  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 448.3 - Special anchorage areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Special anchorage area designation. (1)\n\nPursuant to the provisions of section\n43\nof the Navigation Law, the commissioner\nmay, by rule, regulation or order, designate such areas as he or she may deem\nproper as special anchorage areas. (2)\n\nAn adjacent upland owner only may make\napplication to the commissioner for a revocable permit to maintain a special\nanchorage area, without expense to the State, within the limits of his\nproperty. The commissioner may approve of the establishment of special\nanchorage areas if, in his opinion, such area will not be a hazard to\nnavigation. (3)\n\nWhen authorization\nin the form of a revocable permit has been duly granted, the special anchorage\narea shall be deemed lawfully established. If, in the judgment of the\ncommissioner, special anchorage areas authorized by him are found to be\nimproperly maintained, or have become a hazard to navigation, or the reason for\ntheir establishment no longer exists, or that the permittee has failed to\ncomply with the conditions of the permit or rules and regulations contained\nherein, the commissioner may revoke such permit by causing a written notice to\nbe mailed to the person to whom it was issued, directing the removal of all\nfloating objects contained within such permit area by a specified date. The\nperson to whom such notice is directed shall thereupon remove the floating\nobjects in accordance with such instructions. In case of failure by the person\nso directed to remove the floating objects within the specified time, the\ncommissioner may cause their removal. The cost and expense of such removal\nshall be a charge against the person authorized to maintain the area, and the\ncommissioner may bring any action or proceeding against such person to recover\nthe cost of removal of such floating objects. (4)\n\nAll such areas when so designated shall\nbe marked in accordance with the specifications contained in this\n\nPart. (b) Area marking\nspecifications. The offshore limits of an area shall be marked with lighted\nbuoys and shall mark the exact location indicated in the permit. The shore\nlimits of the area may also be marked with lighted markers placed on stanchions\nwhich are higher than the offshore markers. In each case, buoys marking such\nareas shall meet the following specifications: (1)\n\nColor. White. (2)\n\nNumbering. None--each buoy shall be\nlettered \"SPECIAL ANCHORAGE AREA\", in block form of good proportion and colored\nblack. The lettering shall be on two sides of the buoy. (3)\n\nLighting. White flashing lights shall be\ninstalled and must conform to specifications made by the commissioner depending\nupon location and other factors. (4)\n\nShape. Can. (5)\n\nConstruction. Types of construction shall\nbe approved on an individual basis, considering the location and other factors. However, all buoys must be so designed that the light will be at least three\nfeet above the waterline. (c) Moorings in anchorage area. Moorings may\nbe placed within the limits of a special anchorage area in such a manner so as\nto allow each moored vessel to swing free with wind or current, and with enough\nclearance to avoid contact with any other moored vessel. At no time may a\nvessel or part thereof extend outside the limits of the anchorage area. Vessels\nof less than 65 feet in length when anchored in a special anchorage area are\nnot required to display anchor lights at night. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
