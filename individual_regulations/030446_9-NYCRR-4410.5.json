  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4410.5 - Parlay betting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nconsistent with the public interest and the best interests of racing generally, with permission of the commission, an off-track operator may offer parlay\nbetting as a service to the betting public involving races at tracks similarly\noffering such service. (b) The\nparlay is not a pari-mutuel pool, but is a series of bets combining betting\nentries in win, place or show pools in each of two or more separate races in\nchronological order. The initial amount bet constitutes the bet on the first\nbetting entry in the first parlay race (leg); if successful, the payoff from\nwinning the first leg (to the lowest penny) is then bet on the betting entry\ndesignated in the second leg; if again successful, and if the parlay continues, the payoff from winning the second leg is then bet (to the lowest penny) in the\nthird leg; etc. (c) A parlay bet\nmay combine any of the races on a daily program and must combine at least two\nand not over six races. Bets are limited to win, place or show pool types for\nwhich a corresponding pool is conducted on the race selected. The races in a\nparlay must be chronological but need not be consecutive nor combine the same\ntype pool. The parlay shall be designated on one pari-mutuel ticket which may\nalso evidence other parlay bets combining the same races. (d) A parlay bet may not combine bets in the\nsame race or earlier races (so-called reverse bets) nor on races on other day's\nprograms. (e) While payoffs\ninserted as bets in subsequent races are broken to the lowest penny (unlike\nregular payoffs), payoffs to the parlay bettor shall be broken to the lowest\ndime. Resulting parlay breakage shall be reported separately and added to\nregular breakage at the end of the program for the purpose of taxation and\ndistribution. (f) Parlay payoffs\nwill be so inserted as bets in subsequent pools by the off-track operator that\nthe amount of such bets, including their effect on the betting odds, will be\ndisplayed as soon as possible after the initial change of the morning line\ndisplay at the track. (Bet totals in such pools shall be displayed in truncated\nfashion, to the lowest dollar.)\n(g) If any taxing authority requires the withholding of any portion of a winning\nparlay payoff prior to the completion of all bets in the parlay, such parlay\nshall thereupon terminate at such point and be payable to the ticket holder\nwithout further completion, selections in future races being voided. Such\nconsequence shall be publicly announced and prominently displayed by the off-\ntrack operator who shall inform the public by explanation and examples of the\noperation of this subdivision before the start of a day's program. (h) Parlay wagers may be cancelled by the\nticket holder, in accordance with track policy on cancellations, only prior to\nthe start of the first parlay race in which a parlay selection starts. Thereafter, the parlay must either be completed or be terminated by operation\nof these rules in order to be entitled to a payoff. The holder of the parlay\nticket shall not have the option to cash in such bet prior to completion after\na designated parlay entry actually starts in a race. (i) If a race, pool or betting entry in a\nparlay is scratched (which includes an entry being declared a nonstarter for\nbetting purposes, or a race or pool being declared \"off\") the parlay shall be\nconstituted by the remaining legs; if there are no remaining legs, the parlay\nterminates. (j) A bet on a coupled\nentry or field is considered a bet on the remaining part of such coupled entry\nor field in the event any part of such entry or field starts for pari-mutuel\npurposes in accordance with the rules governing the track where the race is\nheld. Parlay tickets incorporating an entry or field in which a scratch occurs\nare refundable only in accordance with subdivision (h) of this\nsection. (k) Surcharge shall only\naccrue when a parlay becomes payable to the holder. (l) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable to the public by the off-track betting off-track operator in each of\nits branches. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
