In making the\nrecommendation regarding the time within which the next condition assessment of\nthe parking garage or portion thereof should be performed, the responsible\nprofessional engineer shall consider the parking garage's age, maintenance\nhistory, structural condition, construction materials, frequency and intensity\nof use, location, exposure to the elements, and any other factors deemed\nrelevant by the responsible professional engineer in his or her professional\njudgment. (8)\n\nThe\nauthority having jurisdiction shall review each condition assessment report.
