  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8600.1 - Statement of purpose and applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A need exists to coordinate and expedite\nthe delivery of governmental services to business locating or expanding in New\n\nYork State. As part of the effort to meet that need, the Office of Business\n\nPermits has been mandated to provide a master application procedure and a\ncentral preapplication conference program. These two services will provide an\napplicant who requires business permits from several State agencies with\ninteragency coordination of the application process and a single forum for the\nexchange of pertinent information. This coordinating program will assist\nbusiness in making sound decisions based on comprehensive information. It also\nwill provide the State with more integrated planning information on potential\neconomic expansion within its borders. The provisions of this Part apply only\nto the involvement of State agencies. In almost every instance, however, the\n\nFederal government and one or more local governmental units will have an\ninterest as well. The office may encourage the involvement of the appropriate\n\nFederal and local agencies to the maximum extent feasible and practicable. The\nprocedures in this Part may be coupled with conceptual review, Part 8700 of\nthis Subtitle, especially when it is desirable to enhance planning for a future\ndevelopment phase. (b) The permits\nof the following agencies are subject to the master application procedure: Adirondack Park Agency; Department of Agriculture and Markets; Division of\n\nAlcoholism and Alcohol Abuse; Alcoholic Beverage Control Division (State Liquor\n\nAuthority); Athletic Commission; Banking Department; Department of Commerce; Commission on Cable Television; Education Department; Energy Office; Department\nof Environmental Conservation; Office of General Services; Department of\n\nHealth; Division of Housing and Community Renewal; Division of Human Rights; Insurance Department; Department of Labor; Department of Law; Office of Mental\n\nHealth; Office of Mental Retardation and Developmental Disabilities; Department\nof Motor Vehicles; Office of Parks and Recreation; Department of Public\n\nServices; Racing and Wagering Board; Department of Social Services; Department\nof State; Division of Substance Abuse Services; Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance; Thruway Authority; Department of Transportation; Workers' Compensation\n\nBoard; Audit and Control; Power Authority; and Military and Naval\n\nAffairs.
