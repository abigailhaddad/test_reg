  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 453.2 - Site characteristics; stationary test\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\nmotor vehicle to be tested shall be parked on the test site. A microphone\ntarget point shall be established on the ground surface of the site, on the\ncenterline of the lane in which the motor vehicle is parked, at a point that is\nwithin three feet (0.9 m) of the longitudinal position of the vehicle's exhaust\nsystem outlet(s). A microphone location point shall be established on the\nground surface not less than 35 feet (10.7 m) and not more than 83 feet (25.3\nm) from the microphone target point. Within the test site is a triangular\nmeasurement area. A plan view diagram of a standard test site, having an open\nsite within a 50-foot (15.2 m) radius of both the microphone target point and\nthe microphone location point, is shown in Figure 2 below. (2)\n\nMeasurements may be made at a test site\nhaving smaller or greater dimensions in accordance with the rules in Part 454\nof this Title. Image\n(b) The test site must be an open\nsite, essentially free of large sound-reflecting objects. However, the\nfollowing objects may be within the test site, including the triangular\nmeasurement area: (1)\n\nSmall cylindrical\nobjects such as fire hydrants or telephone or utility poles. (2)\n\nRural mailboxes. (3)\n\nTraffic railings of any type of\nconstruction except solid concrete barriers (see section\n450.2\n[s]\n). (4)\n\nOne or more curbs having a height of one\nfoot (0.3 m) or less. (c) The following objects may be within the\ntest site if they are outside of the triangular measurement area of the site: (1)\n\nAny vertical surface, regardless of size\n(such as a billboard), having a lower edge more than 15 feet (4.6 m) above the\nground. (2)\n\nAny uniformly smooth\nsurface slanting away from the vehicle with a slope that is less than 45\ndegrees above the horizontal. (3)\n\nAny surface slanting away from the vehicle that is 45 degrees or more and not\nmore than 90 degrees above the horizontal, if all points on the surface are\nmore than 15 feet (4.6 m) above the surface of the ground in the test\nsite. (d) The surface of\nthe ground within the measurement area must be relatively flat. (See section\n450.2\n[o]\n). The\nsite shall be a \"hard\" site. However, if the site is determined to be \"soft\", the correction factor specified in section\n454.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle shall be applied to the measurement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n453.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
