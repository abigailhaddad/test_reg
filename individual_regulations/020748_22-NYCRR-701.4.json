  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 701.4 - Judicial warning of possible contempt\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept in the case of the most\nflagrant and offensive misbehavior which in the court's discretion requires an\nimmediate adjudication of contempt to preserve order and decorum, the court\nshould warn and admonish the person engaged in alleged contumacious conduct\nthat his conduct is deemed contumacious and give him an opportunity to desist\nbefore adjudicating him in contempt. Where a person so warned desists from\nfurther offensive conduct, there is ordinarily no occasion for an adjudication\nof contempt. Where a person is summarily adjudicated in contempt and punishment\ndeferred, if such person desists from further offensive conduct the court\nshould consider carefully whether there is any need for punishment for the\nadjudicated contempt. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n701.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
