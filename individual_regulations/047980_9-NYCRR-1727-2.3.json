  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1727-2.3 - Determination of income\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In the\ndischarge of the responsibilities listed above, the housing company shall take\nsuch steps as it deems necessary to ascertain and verify that the probably\naggregate annual income of applicant's household does not exceed applicable\nincome limits. Applicants, tenants, and cooperators are required to cooperate\nfully in obtaining verification of income. (b) For admission applicants, each adult\nhousehold member 18 years of age or older who filed an income tax return for\nthe prior calendar year must provide a certified copy of either the New York\n\nState income tax return obtained from the New York State Department of Taxation\nand Finance or the Federal income tax return obtained from the Internal Revenue\n\nService. (c) Verification of income\nfor adult household members who did not file an income tax return will be based\nupon one or more sources of information outlined below to obtain reasonably\nacceptable verification. (1)\n\nRequests for\nstatements of earnings reported to the Social Security Board are to be\nsubmitted only where earnings cannot otherwise be conclusively verified, such\nas tenants/cooperators who claim not to have worked, not to have filed income\ntax returns, or are employed by relatives. Requests for social security\nstatement must be submitted on Social Security Administration form SSA-7004 and\nmust show tenant's/cooperator's home address as return address. It is the\nresponsibility of tenant/cooperator to deliver report to housing company office\nupon receipt. Social security records are usually not available until six\nmonths after completion of quarter. (2)\n\nNotarized employer's statement signed by\nofficer or responsible party of firm. (3)\n\nCurrent and/or past pay stubs and pay\nenvelopes if: (i) they identify the recipient\nclearly; (ii)\nare for a pay period\nwithin the past year; and\n(iii)\nprovide a reasonably clear basis for determining rate of pay. Tenants or\ncooperators should be advised to retain all such stubs or envelopes. (4)\n\nReferee's report, in the case\nof workers' compensation. (5)\n\nTenants/cooperators unemployment insurance card, notification of benefits, D.P.U.I. tables and check stubs. (6)\n\nMilitary pay tables, allotment tables, allotment checks and notarized statement from commanding officer of unit to\nwhich assigned, in case of service members. (7)\n\nNotarized affidavits from person or\npersons making contributions, setting forth the amounts contributed and the\ndates of such contributions. (8)\n\nEmployer's report or standard allotments for tips or other\nconsiderations. (d) The\ncalculation of probable aggregate annual income described below is identical\nwhether determining probable income for admission or for continued occupancy. In determining probable aggregate annual household income, income from all\nsources, including that of minors, will be taken into account with the\nfollowing exceptions: (1)\n$20,000 (or, if\nauthorized by the division, a larger amount) of the earnings from the gainful\nemployment of a minor under the age of 21 years. (2)\n$20,000 (or, if authorized by the\ndivision, a larger amount) of each adult secondary wage-earners' earned\nincome. (3)\n\nPayments made by the\n\nState or a municipality for child care of foster children in private homes. For\npurposes of determination of probable aggregate annual income, a secondary wage\nearner is any gainfully employed adult member of the household other than the\nchief wage earner and the chief wage earner is the person who is primarily\nresponsible for dependents in the household, whose income is generally from\nemployment or self-employment and usually exceeds income of any other adult\nmember of the household. Any question as to determination of chief wage earner\nshould be resolved, if possible, on the basis of affording advantage to\napplicant or tenant. (4)\n\nThe\npersonal exemptions and deductions for medical expenses as are actually taken\nby the taxpayer and the amounts received from Federal old age, survivors and\ndisability insurance benefits. (5)\n\nFor the purpose of determining the eligibility for both admission and continued\noccupancy of tenant-cooperators, housing companies may, with the approval of\nthe division, add the following amounts to the carrying charges listed in their\nschedules of income limits: (i) the\nconsideration the cooperator paid for such share; (ii)\nany capital assessment and voluntary\ncapital contributions approved by the division and paid by the cooperators to\nthe housing company; and\n(iii)\na\nproportionate share of the actual aggregate amortization paid on all existing\nand prior mortgages on the housing company during such period as shall be fixed\nby the housing company, to the extent not already included in the consideration\npaid for such shares. (e) Income, as determined by the housing\ncompany, is subject to review by the division upon submission of applications\nfor admissions or transfers. In the case of continued occupancy, income\ndetermination is subject to review by the division. (f) Payments made to tenants for child care\nby State, county or other governmental agencies for care of foster children in\ntenant's/cooperator's homes constitute reimbursement to the foster parents for\nmoney expended by the foster parents on behalf of the child. Such monies are\ntherefore not to be included when determining probable aggregate annual\nincome. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
