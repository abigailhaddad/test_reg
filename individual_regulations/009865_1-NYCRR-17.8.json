Such ingredients\nare cultured after pasteurization with a characterizing bacteria culture\nincluding but not limited to strains of Lactobacillus bulgaricus and\n\nStreptococcus thermophilus; provided, however, fruit, nuts or other flavoring\nmaterials may be added before or after the mix is pasteurized and cultured.

The finished yogurt shall weigh\nnot less than five pounds per gallon. The name of the food is frozen yogurt.
