  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-7.6 - Additional design and construction requirements for belowground disposal units\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Protective\nenclosure. (1)\n\nEach disposal unit must be\nprovided with a separate, independently supported protective enclosure that\nwill function from the beginning of operations until disposal unit\nclosure. (2)\n\nProtective enclosure\ndesign. The protective enclosure must be designed to meet the following\nrequirements: (i) the protective enclosure\nmust be freestanding and provide weather and frost protection to the disposal\nunit; (ii)\nthe protective enclosure\nmust be capable of being removed at disposal unit closure without adversely\naffecting the performance of the disposal units; and\n(iii)\nthe protective enclosure must be\nwatertight and capable of being easily inspected and repaired. (3)\n\nThe roof of the protective\nenclosure and of the disposal unit must be sloped at a gradient of no less than\ntwo percent and sufficient to facilitate drainage and prevent ponding of\nwater. (b) Water\ninfiltration resistance. The exterior of the disposal units must be protected\nagainst water infiltration by at least two barriers to water infiltration. Each\nbarrier must function independently (i.e., the effective performance of each\nbarrier must not require the presence or proper performance of any other\nbarrier). The barriers may be sealant materials, bentonite impregnated panels, polymeric sheet membranes, or other materials or structures. (c) Cover. (1)\nA cover must be installed over the\ndisposal unit during disposal unit closure. The cover must be designed and\nconstructed to: (i) protect the disposal unit\nagainst frost, weathering, erosion, and burrowing animals; (ii)\nprovide resistance to water\ninfiltration; (iii)\ndirect\npercolating or surface water away from the waste; and\n(iv)\nprotect against inadvertent intrusion, if required by section\n382.33\n(a) or\n382.34\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe cover must be sufficiently\nthick to place the roof of the disposal unit below the maximum depth of frost\npenetration. (3)\n\nThe design of a\nmulti-layer cover must include stability analyses to demonstrate that no\nsliding or sloughing will occur at any interface between the various components\nunder the most severe conditions anticipated. Such analyses must be based on\nthe results of tests of interfaces between the same materials as proposed in\nthe cover design. (4)\n\nThe\nrequirement for a cover may be satisfied by either a multi-layer cover meeting\nthe requirements of subdivision (d) of this section or an alternative design\nmeeting the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision. (d) Multi-layer earthen cover requirements. (1)\n\nUnless an alternative design is approved by the department, a multi-layer\nearthen cover must meet the following requirements. The cover must be composed\nof, at a minimum, the following layers from the disposal unit upward: (i) Compacted low permeability barrier layer. A low permeability barrier layer consisting of a low permeability soil material\nmust be constructed to resist the infiltration of water into the underlying\nwaste disposal unit(s). (ii)\n\nPolymeric sheet membrane layer. A polymeric sheet membrane layer must be\ninstalled over the compacted low permeability barrier layer to resist water\ninfiltration into the underlying disposal unit area. (iii)\nA subsurface drainage layer. Immediately above the polymeric sheet membrane, a subsurface drainage layer, consisting of a free-draining gravel material, must be installed. Above the\nsubsurface drainage layer, a geosynthetic filter fabric must be installed and\ncovered by a protective sand layer. (iv)\n\nAn anti-erosion and burrow barrier\nlayer. An anti-erosion and burrow barrier layer must be installed above the\nsubsurface drainage layer to protect the multi-layer earthen cover against\nfrost action, erosion, root penetration, and damage caused by burrowing\nanimals. (v) Common fill layer. A\ncommon fill layer must be constructed over the anti-erosion and burrow barrier\nlayer providing a separation between the anti-erosion and burrow barrier layer\nand the surface topsoil layer. The common fill layer will help maintain\nadequate moisture content within the topsoil layer for promoting growth of the\nvegetation cover. (vi)\n\nTopsoil\nlayer. A topsoil layer must be designed and constructed to maintain vegetative\ngrowth over the multi-layer earthen cover. (2)\n\nThe installation and grading of adjacent\nmaterial layers within the earthen cover must incorporate geosynthetic filter\nfabric and/or other design provisions to minimize the risk of soil particles\nmigrating into and clogging the underlying layers. (3)\n\nThe surface and intermediate material\nlayers composing the earthen cover must be graded to provide for positive\ndrainage away from the disposal unit. The surface of the earthen cover must be\nat a slope that will not promote erosion. The minimum slope must not be less\nthan four percent and the maximum slope must not be more than 25\npercent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-7.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
