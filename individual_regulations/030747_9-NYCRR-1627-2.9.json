  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-2.9 - Annual re-examination procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Re-examination of eligibility for\ncontinued occupancy is to be conducted at least once a year. Such\nre-examination should be conducted during first calendar quarter unless size of\nproject makes it unfeasible. If re-examination can not be conducted in one\nquarter, then work should be divided into four quarters and re-examinations\nscheduled accordingly. (b) Proper\nscheduling of work in connection with re-examination is necessary to insure\ncompletion in an efficient manner. When re-examinations are spaced on a\nquarterly basis, control cards should be prepared for all tenants with\ndifferent colored cards being used for each quarter. (c) Appropriate forms should be distributed\nto tenants by 20th day of first month of quarter. Each tenant should receive\none copy of instructions for completing forms and two copies of tenant's\napplication for continued occupancy. Forms should be returned to authority\nwithin two weeks of their issuance and this fact should be clearly stated on\ntenants instruction sheet. Follow-up should be made of any forms not received\nby scheduled date. (d) Upon receipt\nof form from tenant, form should be carefully reviewed and any omissions or\nerrors corrected. Any insertions or corrections made as result of review should\nbe made by tenant returning form. However, whether corrections or insertions\nare made by tenant or reviewer, they must be initialed by tenant. If additional\ninformation is needed, written request to that effect should be forwarded to\ntenant and a copy of request attached to tenants application for continued\noccupancy. Date on which information should be returned must be shown on notice\nand should normally be less than one week. (e) Verification of income items should be as\nprompt as possible although if a number of tenants have same employer, requests\nfor verification may be accumulated and forwarded to employer under one\ncovering letter. Upon receipt of verification, income should be projected and\nrent adjustment, if indicated, made as of effective date of rent change (see\ndefinition, §\n1627-2.3\n). (f) If verification is not returned promptly, follow-up should be made. If there is an extended delay in return of\nverification, however, unverified information may be projected where a rent\nincreaseis indicated so that rent can be increased by effective date of rent\nchange. However, such re-examination will not be considered complete until\nsatisfactory verification is received. (g) Tenant's income record should be prepared\nupon completion of re-examination. Any interim change during year resulting\nfrom quarterly review, tenants reporting of change, etc., will be shown in\nspace provided. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1627-2.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
