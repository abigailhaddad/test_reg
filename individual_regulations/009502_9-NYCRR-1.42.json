  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.42 - Executive order no. 42: relating to procedures for submission and settlement of certain grievances of state employees\n\nState Regulations\n\nWith the advent of collective negotiations between the\n\nState and employee organizations pursuant to the Public Employees' Fair\n\nEmployment Act of 1967, collectively negotiated agreements (\"collective\nagreements\") have been entered into which provide for grievance procedures\nwhich are intended to supersede in whole or in part the grievance procedures\nprovided for by the Executive Order heretofore issued on August 28, 1963. Such\nnegotiated grievance procedures are a milestone in the development of\ncollective negotiations in the public sector. Nevertheless, there is still an\nimportant reason for the continuation of procedures for the settlement of\ngrievances of employees who are not covered by collective agreements or for the\nsettlement of non-contract grievances which are outside of the scope of the\ngrievance procedure set forth in any such collective agreement. 1. Every employee to whom this order applies\nshall have the right to present his grievance in accordance with this order, free from interference, coercion, restraint, discrimination or reprisal. He\nshall have the right to present his grievance individually or with a\nrepresentative of his own choosing at all steps of the grievance procedure\nhereunder, except that where there is in effect a collective agreement covering\na negotiation unit which includes such employee which was entered into between\nthe State and an employee organization, then such employee may not choose as\nhis representative any employee organization other than the employee\norganization with which such agreement was negotiated nor may any employee\norganization other than the one with which such agreement was negotiated\ninitiate or process a grievance except to the extent permitted by such\nagreement. 2. Grievance Appeals\n\nBoard. The Grievance Appeals Board established by the executive order\nheretofore issued on August 28, 1963 shall be transferred to the Office of\n\nEmployee Relations. It shall consist of three members appointed by and who\nshall serve at the pleasure of the Director of Employee Relations. No person\nregularly employed in a full time position in the State service shall be\neligible for appointment to the Board. One member shall be designated by the\n\nDirector to serve as chairman of the Board. The compensation of the members of\nthe Board shall be fixed by the Director with the approval of the Director of\nthe Budget. 3. Departmental\n\nProcedures. The head of each State department or agency shall, subject to the\napproval of the Grievance Appeals Board established pursuant to this order, establish formal procedures for the submission of grievances by employees and\nfor the prompt and orderly consideration and determination of such grievances\nby supervisors and the department or agency head. 4. Powers and Duties of the Grievance Appeals\n\nBoard. The Grievance Appeals Board is hereby charged with the responsibility\nfor and empowered to: establish and maintain a program for resolving employee\ngrievances relating to conditions of employment in the State service not\ninconsistent with the State's obligations as an employer under the Public\n\nEmployees' Fair Employment Act of 1967 or collective agreements entered into\nthereunder. promulgate and amend from time to time, with the approval\nof the Director of Employee Relations, such regulations as may be necessary to\ncarry out the provisions of this order and to review and approve grievance\nprocedures established by departments and agencies pursuant to this order and\nsuch regulations, including provisions for reasonable time off without charge\nto leave credits for grievants, representatives and witnesses. hold hearings, to conduct investigations, to require the\nattendance of officers and employees of the State as witnesses and to require\nthe production or examination of records, books and papers of State departments\nor agencies relating to administration of the grievance procedure. render advice and assistance to officers and employees of\n\nState departments and agencies in any matter relating to the establishment or\nuse of the procedures provided for or adopted pursuant to this order or the\nregulations issued thereunder. report to the Director of Employee Relations for\nappropriate action the failure of any department or agency to establish\nproperly or maintain satisfactorily the standards, principles, determinations\nand procedures embodied in or authorized by this order. 5. Appeals. An employee within a time limit\nand upon compliance with the regulations of the Board, may appeal to the Board\nfrom a determination made pursuant to this order by the head of his department\nor agency, or his designated representative, as the case may be. The Board\nshall conduct such review of the appeal as it deems appropriate and may require\nthe appearance before it of the appellant and other parties to the grievance; provided, however, that the appellant shall be entitled upon his request to a\nhearing before the Board or its designee. If the appeal involves the\nenforcement of a law, a civil service rule or regulation or a written rule, regulation or order of a department or agency, the findings of fact and the\nrecommendation of the Board shall be transmitted to the departments or agencies\ninvolved for appropriate action in accordance with the facts found by the\n\nBoard. In all other cases, the determination of the Board shall contain a\nstatement of the facts and an advisory recommendation to the departments or\nagencies involved. Copies of the determination of the Board shall be sent to\nthe employee involved, to his representative and to the Director of Employee\n\nRelations. 6. Application. (a) The provisions of this order shall apply\nto employees in the executive branch of the State government (1) who are not\ncovered by a collective agreement between the State and a certified or\nrecognized employee organization or (2) who are covered by a collective\nagreement which accords such employees the right to continue to process\ngrievances under this order. (b) The provisions of this order and the procedures established hereunder shall be\napplicable to grievances in any department or agency claiming an act or\nomission resulting in an injustice to an employee and arising out of conditions\nwhich are in whole or in part subject to the control of the head of such\ndepartment or agency and which involve alleged safety or health hazards, unsatisfactory physical facilities, surroundings, materials or equipment, unfair or discriminatory supervisory and disciplinary practice, unjust\ntreatment by fellow workers, unreasonable assignment of working hours or\npersonal time allowances, unfair or unreasonable work quotas, and all other\ngrievances relating to conditions of employment; provided, however, that this\norder shall not apply to matters which are reviewable under administrative\nprocedures established by law or under the rules of the State Civil Service\n\nCommission, or the rules of other departments or agencies having the force and\neffect of law or rules governing grievances of employees in the professional\nservice of the State University of New York as defined in Section\n355-a\nof the\n\nEducation Law, or grievances concerning the interpretation, application or\nclaimed violation of a specific term or provision of a collective agreement\nbetween the State and an employee organization. 7. Repeal of Previous Order. The Executive\n\nOrder heretofore issued on August 28, 1963 is hereby revoked and superseded by\nthis executive order. Grievances initiated but not finally resolved prior to\nthe effective date of this order may be continued under the terms of the\nexecutive order issued on August 28, 1963. Signed: Nelson A.
