Outrigger beams shall extend not more than six feet\nbeyond the face of the building or other structures. The inboard ends of\noutrigger beams, measured from the fulcrum points to the extreme inboard points\nof support, shall be not less than one and one-half times the outboard ends in\nlength. Any wood beams used as outriggers shall rest on their least dimensions. The sides of any such wood beam shall be plumb and the edges shall be\nhorizontal. The fulcrum point of any outrigger beam shall rest on a secure\nbearing which is at least six inches in each horizontal dimension. Every\noutrigger beam shall be secured in place against movement in any direction and\nshall be securely braced at the fulcrum point against tipping. (b) Inboard supports. The inboard ends of outrigger beams shall be securely\nsupported either by means of struts bearing against the sills in contact with\nan overhead structure or by means of anchoring tension members such as U-bolts\nsecured to the structural frame of the building or other structure. The inboard\nends of outrigger beams shall be secured against tipping and the entire\nsupporting structures shall be securely braced in both directions to prevent\nany horizontal movement of such structures. (c) Design and construction. (1)\n\nUnless outrigger scaffolds are designed\nby a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of New York, the\nminimum sizes of the members of such scaffolds shall be in accordance with\n\nTable XI of this Subpart. (2)\n\nAny\noutrigger scaffold designed by a professional engineer licensed to practice in\nthe State of New York shall be constructed to conform to such design. A copy of\nthe detailed drawings and specifications showing the sizes and spacing of the\nmembers of such scaffold shall be kept at the job site available for\nexamination by the commissioner. (d) Planking. The planking of every outrigger scaffold platform shall\nbe laid tight and shall extend to within three inches of the wall of the\nbuilding or other structure. Such planking shall be nailed or bolted to the\noutriggers. (e) Screening.

Such superstructures shall not exceed six feet\nin height above the outrigger beam supports and shall otherwise conform with\nthis Part (rule). In no case shall horses be used as supports for such\nsuperstructures. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
