  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2D.40 - Location of Destination Signs\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 03A Although one Destination sign along an intersection\napproach is usually sufficient, a series of two or more signs along a\nmulti-lane approach might better enable motorists to select the proper\nlane. Guidance: 03B Where a second destination sign is used along an\nintersection approach to enable proper lane selection, it should be placed\nbetween 800 and 1400 feet in advance of the intersection. Where a route sign\n\nJunction assembly is used, this sign should be placed between two hundred and\nfour hundred feet in advance of the Junction assembly. Option: 03C A supplemental Destination sign may be located on the\nfar right corner of the intersection where the approach is controlled by a stop\nsign or flashing red signal indication. A supplemental Destination sign may be\nlocated on the far side of the stem of a 'T' intersection. If longitudinal\nspace along the intersection approach is severely limited, this location may\nalso be used as an alternative to the advance location on the intersection\napproach. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2D.40\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
