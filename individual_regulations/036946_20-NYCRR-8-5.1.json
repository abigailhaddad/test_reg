  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-5.1 - Computation of the payroll factor\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The percentage of the surcharge taxpayer's payroll apportioned to the MCTD is\ndetermined by dividing the wages, salaries and other personal service\ncompensation of the surcharge taxpayer's employees within the MCTD, except\ngeneral executive officers, during the period covered by the report by the\ntotal amount of such compensation of all of the surcharge taxpayer's employees\nwithin New York State, except general executive officers, during the period\ncovered by the report. (b) Wages, salaries and other compensation include all amounts paid for services rendered\nto the surcharge taxpayer by its employees, after intercorporate eliminations\nof such amounts paid by members of a combined group, and do not include amounts\npaid by the surcharge taxpayer that do not have the element of compensation for\npersonal services already rendered or to be rendered. (c) Wages, salaries and other compensation\nare computed either on the cash or the accrual basis, in accordance with the\nmethod of accounting used in computing the entire net income (ENI) of the\nsurcharge taxpayer. (d) (1)\n\nEmployees within the MCTD include all\nemployees regularly connected with or working out of an office or place of\nbusiness of the surcharge taxpayer within the MCTD, irrespective of where the\nservices of such employees were performed. However, the commissioner may permit\nor require the surcharge taxpayer to instead compute the payroll factor on the\nbasis of the amount of compensation paid for services performed within the MCTD\nif both of the following are established: (i) that a substantial part of the surcharge taxpayer's payroll was paid to\nemployees either attached to an office in the MCTD, but who performed a\nsubstantial part of their services outside the MCTD, or attached to an office\noutside the MCTD, but who performed a substantial part of their services within\nthe MCTD; and\n(ii)\nthat the\ncomputation of the payroll factor according to the general rule stated above\nwould not properly reflect the amount of the surcharge taxpayer's business done\nwithin the MCTD by its employees. (2)\n\nServices performed within the MCTD will\nbe deemed to be: (i) in the case of an\nemployee whose compensation depends directly on the volume of business secured\nby such employee, for example, a salesperson on a commission basis, the amount\nreceived by such employee for such business attributable to the employee's\nefforts within the MCTD; (ii)\nin\nthe case of an employee whose compensation depends on achieving results other\nthan as described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the proportion of the\ntotal compensation that the value of such employee's services within the MCTD\nbears to the value of all of the employee's services within New York\n\nState; (iii)\nin the case of an\nemployee compensated on a time basis, the proportion of the total amount\nreceived by such employee that such employee's working time within the MCTD\nbears to the employee's total working time within New York State; and\n(iv)\nin the case of an employee compensated\nby a combination of the bases of subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this\nparagraph, the aggregate of the amounts arrived at pursuant to (i) through\n(iii).
