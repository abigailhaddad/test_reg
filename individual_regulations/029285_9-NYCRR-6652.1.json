  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6652.1 - Designation of area agencies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The office designates area agencies and, for OAA, specifies the geographic areas they serve. Any general purpose local\ngovernment, governing tribal council of an Indian reservation, or organization\nrepresenting a region or metropolitan area may apply to have an area agency\ndesignated to serve the area under OAA. If the office denies the application, the applicant may request a hearing under this Chapter. If the office again\ndenies such application following the hearing, the applicant may file a written\nappeal with the United States Commissioner on Aging within 30 days following\nreceipt of the hearing decision. (b) The office designates a sole area agency\nwithin each geographic area that serves as planning and service area, as\nspecified under this section. In designating such an area agency, the office\ngives the right of first refusal to a unit of general purpose local government\nif such unit qualifies to be an area agency and has boundaries reasonably\ncontiguous with the geographic area. Because most human services in New York\n\nState (including CSE and EISEP) are administered at the county level or by New\n\nYork City, the office gives a high priority to units of county government and\n\nNew York City whose purpose is to administer programs for elderly people, in\ndetermining geographic areas to be served by area agencies. In designating area\nagencies, the office gives priority to established offices on aging and to\n\nIndian tribal organizations whose jurisdiction is essentially the same as that\nof a geographic area designated under this section. Public or private\nnot-for-profit agencies with the authority and capacity to administer human\nservices may apply to be designated area agencies for geographic areas\nspecified under this section. (c) In determining geographic areas to be served by area agencies under OAA, the\noffice will consider the geographical distribution of elderly people in New\n\nYork State; the incidence of the need for supportive services, nutrition\nservices, multipurpose senior centers, and legal assistance; the distribution\nof elderly individuals who have low incomes; the distribution of resources\navailable to provide such services or centers; the boundaries of existing areas\nwithin the State which were drawn for the planning or administration of\nsupportive services programs; the location of units of general purpose local\ngovernment within the State; and other relevant factors. Before designating the\narea agency, the office considers the views of units of general purpose local\ngovernment within the area and conducts an onsite assessment to determine\nwhether the agency being considered for designation as an area agency has the\ncapacity to meet its responsibilities under OAA, CSE and EISEP. (d) Area agencies which serve geographic\nareas covering one or more complete counties (excluding Indian reservations\nwith their own area agencies) or New York City may also administer CSE and\nEISEP for the county (including CSE and EISEP services on such reservations) or\nfor New York City. Two or more counties served by a single area agency may join\ntogether for CSE and EISEP through written agreement providing for the\nproportionate local match to be borne by each county, employment of personnel, receipt and disbursement of funds, and other matters specified by the office. Area agencies which do not serve complete counties do not participate in CSE or\nEISEP. (e) The office will\ndesignate each area agency to serve as a single-purpose agency to plan, advocate, coordinate and administer programs solely for older persons. However, the office may, at its discretion provide for other permissible purposes for an\narea agency. Unless specifically authorized by SOFA through an approved area\nplan or plan amendment to do otherwise, all currently designated area agencies\non aging must continue to function as single-purpose agencies, with the\nexception of area agencies on aging that have previously received permission\nfrom SOFA in a plan or plan amendment to operate as a multi-purpose agency with\na single organizational unit possessing all the agency's authority and capacity\nwith respect to Older Americans Act and other aging programs, or as a component\nunit fulfilling specified functions of a multi-purpose agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6652.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
