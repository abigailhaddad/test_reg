(b) When a\nlawyer has terminated an association with a firm, the firm is prohibited from\nthereafter representing a person with interests that the firm knows or\nreasonably should know are materially adverse to those of a client represented\nby the formerly associated lawyer and not currently represented by the firm if\nany lawyer remaining in the firm has actual knowledge of, or has accessed, information protected by Rule 1.6 or Rule 1.9(c) that is material to the\nmatter. (c) When a lawyer becomes\nassociated with a firm, the firm may not knowingly represent a client in a\nmatter that is the same as or substantially related to a matter in which the\nnewly associated lawyer, or a firm with which that lawyer was associated, formerly represented a client whose interests are materially adverse to the\nprospective or current client unless\n(1)\nthe\nnewly associated lawyer did not acquire any information protected by Rule 1.6\nor Rule 1.9(c) that is material to the current matter; or\n(2)\nthe newly associated lawyer's current\nfirm acts promptly and reasonably to: (i) notify, as appropriate, lawyers and nonlawyer personnel within the firm that\nthe personally disqualified lawyer is prohibited from participating in the\nrepresentation of the current client; (ii)\nimplement effective screening procedures\nto prevent the flow of information about the matter between the personally\ndisqualified lawyer and the others in the firm; (iii)\nensure that the disqualified lawyer is\napportioned no part of the fee therefrom; and\n(iv)\ngive written notice to the former client\nto enable it to ascertain compliance with the provisions of this Rule, except\nthat if the notice would disclose confidential information protected by Rule\n1.6 the notice may be temporarily postponed but shall be sent promptly after\nsuch confidential information is known to the former client or is otherwise no\nlonger protected by Rule 1.6; (3)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (c) (2), the\nscreening measures set forth in subparagraphs (c) (2) (i) -(iv) of this Rule\nwill not prevent imputation of conflicts within a firm pursuant to paragraph\n(a) of this Rule where the matter is a litigation, arbitration, or other\nadjudicative proceeding and the newly associated lawyer, while associated with\nthe prior firm, either (i) substantially participated in the management and\ndirection of the matter, or (ii) had substantial decision-making responsibility\nin the matter on a continuous day-to-day basis. (i) The disqualification of lawyers\nassociated in a firm with former or current government lawyers is governed by\n\nRule 1.11 and not by this Rule. (d) A disqualification prescribed by this\n\nRule may be waived by the affected client or former client under the conditions\nstated in Rule 1.7.

(h) A lawyer related to another lawyer as\nparent, child, sibling or spouse shall not represent in any matter a client\nwhose interests differ from those of another party to the matter who the lawyer\nknows is represented by the other lawyer unless the client consents to the\nrepresentation after full disclosure and the lawyer concludes that the lawyer\ncan adequately represent the interests of the client.
