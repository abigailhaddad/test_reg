  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 30-3.14 - Prohibition against student being instructed by two consecutive ineffective teachers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nstudent may not be instructed, for two consecutive school years, in the same\nsubject by any two teachers in the same district, each of whom received a\nrating of Ineffective under an evaluation conducted pursuant to this section in\nthe school year immediately prior to the school year in which the student is\nplaced in the teacher's classroom; provided, that if a district deems it\nimpracticable to comply with this subdivision, the district shall seek a\nteacher-specific waiver from the department from such requirement, on a form\nand timeframe prescribed the commissioner. (b) If a district assigns a student to a\nteacher rated ineffective in the same subject for two consecutive years, the\ndistrict must seek a waiver from this requirement for the specific teacher in\nquestion. The commissioner may grant a waiver from this requirement if: (1)\nthe district cannot make alternative\narrangements and/or reassign a teacher to another grade/subject because a\nhardship exists (for example, too few teachers with higher ratings are\nqualified to teach such subject in that district); and\n(2)\nthe district has an improvement and/or\nremoval plan in place for the teacher at issue that meets certain guidelines\nprescribed by the commissioner.
