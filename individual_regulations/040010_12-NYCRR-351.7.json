Tit. 12 § 351.7 - Number of examinations needed to evaluate industrial hearing loss; fairest method of determining loss from results of successive examinations\n\nState Regulations\n\nExaminations as to the extent of hearing impairment should\nbe performed by qualified professionals, board-certified otolaryngologists, otologists or licensed audiologists, using audiometers meeting standards as\nspecified in ANSI S3.6-1969, \"Specifications for Audiometers.\" However, the\ndiagnosis of disease process and the extent of causally related loss of hearing\nshall be made by a board-certified otolaryngologist or otologist. (b) The test environment should meet or\nexceed criteria detailed in ANSI S3.1- 1960, \"Criteria for background noise in\naudiometer rooms\". Internal test consistency and professional judgment should\ndetermine whether a second or third test battery or other more extensive forms\nof testing may be necessary. Pure tone audiometry (air conduction and bone\nconduction), impedance measurements, speech thresholds and speech\ndiscrimination measures shall be considered to establish the nature and extent\nof the hearing impairment. (c) Examinations shall be made after the date of separation from harmful exposure\nto noise in accordance with the provisions of section\n49-bb\nof the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n351.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
