  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 79.3 - Outer interment receptacle price list\n\nState Regulations\nA funeral firm shall present for information and review a printed or typewritten price list to individuals who inquire in person about outer interment receptacles. The funeral firm may neither discuss nor show outer interment receptacles until an outer interment receptacle price list is offered to the customer. The list must contain at least the retail price of each outer interment receptacle which does not require special ordering; supplier name; model name or number; description of construction material; and the effective date of the prices listed. In immediate conjunction with the prices must be the following statement: \"No New York State or local law requires you to buy a receptacle to surround the casket in the grave. However, many cemeteries require that you have such a receptacle so that the grave will not sink. Either a burial vault or grave liner will satisfy these requirements.\" The list must contain the true funeral firm name and address as registered with the department and a caption describing the list as an \"Outer Interment Receptacle Price List.\" In lieu of a written list, the firm may use other formats, such as notebooks, brochures or charts, if they contain the same information as required in a printed or typewritten list and are displayed in a clear and conspicuous manner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n79.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
