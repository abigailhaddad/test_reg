Commencing with 2014-15 school year\nresults, notwithstanding the provision of this paragraph, a public school, charter school or school district will not be held accountable for an\naccountability group that consists of fewer than 30 students on performance\ncriterion set forth in subdivision (j) of this section if the \"all students\"\naccountability group for that performance criterion includes at least 30\nstudents for that school year and the accountability group with fewer than 30\nstudents did not fail to meet participation rate requirements pursuant to\nsubparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nFor purposes of determining adequate\nyearly progress, only the performance of continuously enrolled students in\ngrades 3-8 shall be included for consideration. (4)\n\nAn accountability group shall be deemed\nto have made adequate yearly progress on a performance criterion specified in\nparagraph (j)(1) of this section if: (i) the\nsuperintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school\nhas submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to\nsection\n100.2\n(bb)(2)\nof\nthis Part or section\n119.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(ii)\nfor accountability groups consisting of\n40 or more students, either: (a) the\nparticipation rate for the current year equals or exceeds 95 percent; or\n(b) the weighted average of the\ncurrent year and prior year participation rates equals or exceeds 95\npercent; (iii)\nfor\naccountability groups consisting of 30 or more students: (a) the accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from the\nannual measurable objective for that criterion; or\n(b) the accountability group met or exceeded, or did not differ significantly as determined by the commissioner, from an\nannual performance target established by the commissioner. (5)\n\nAn accountability group within\na public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made\nadequate yearly progress on a performance criterion specified in paragraphs\n(j)(2) and (3) of this section if: (i) the\nsuperintendent of the school district or the principal of the charter school\nhas submitted the required student data files to the commissioner pursuant to\nsection\n100.2\n(bb)(2)\nof\nthis Part or section\n119.3\n(b) of this\n\nTitle in the timeframe and format specified by the commissioner; and\n(ii)\nfor elementary and middle levels, 80\npercent of students enrolled on all days of the science test administration, who did not have a significant medical emergency, received valid scores; and\n(iii)\nthe accountability group\nwithin the school or school district, or charter school at the applicable grade\nlevels met or exceeded the performance criteria; or\n(iv)\nthe high school cohort met or exceeded\nthe performance criteria. (6)\n\nFor each school year, public schools, school districts, and charter schools in which no students or, pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision fewer than 30 students, participate in the\n\nState assessments for English language arts or mathematics, or in which the\nmajority of students are not continuously enrolled, shall conduct a\nself-assessment of their academic program and the school learning environment, in such format and using such criteria as may be prescribed by the\ncommissioner. Such self-assessment shall not be required of those schools and\nschool districts for which the commissioner shall conduct a review of the\nperformance of the school or school district in accordance with paragraph (7)\nof this subdivision. The superintendent of the school district or principal of\nthe charter school shall review the self-assessment(s) and make a\nrecommendation to the commissioner, in such format and according to such\ntimeframe as the commissioner may prescribe, as to whether the accountability\ngroup within the school or school district has made adequate yearly progress. The commissioner shall consider the self-assessment, board recommendation and\nany other relevant information in determining whether the accountability group\nwithin the school or school district made adequate yearly progress. (7)\n\nThe accountability status of public\nschools, school districts, and charter schools serving grades 1 and/or 2, but\nnot grade 3 or higher, (hereafter referred to as \"feeder schools\") will be\ndetermined using backmapping. In school districts with such feeder schools and\nin school districts that accept grade 3 students from feeder schools by\ncontract, the grade 3 State assessment results for each feeder school student\nwill be attributed to the feeder school as well as to the school or charter\nschool in which the student took the assessment. The student's results will be\nattributed to a feeder school only if the student was continuously enrolled in\nthe feeder school from the date prescribed by the commissioner on which the\nBEDS forms are required to be completed until the end of the school year in the\nhighest grade served by the feeder school. In a district, if all schools\nserving grade 3 make adequate yearly progress for the accountability groups, in\na given year, all feeder schools served by the school district will be deemed\nto have made adequate yearly progress. If one or more schools enrolling\nstudents from a feeder school fail to make adequate yearly progress for one or\nmore accountability groups on a performance criterion set forth in subdivision\n(j) of this section, the commissioner will aggregate the school district's\ngrade 3 results on that criterion by feeder school and determine whether each\nfeeder school made adequate yearly progress on that criterion. (8)\nA registered school that has no\ncontinuously enrolled students because all students are students with\ndisabilities who attend the school and who have been placed outside of their\ndistrict of residence (in New York City, outside of their community school\ndistrict of residence) for educational services by the district committee on\nspecial education or a school district official shall participate in a\nself-assessment based on the students who are enrolled in the school. (9)\n\nEffective with 2013-2014 school year\nresults and continuing with the results for each school year thereafter, the\n\"all students\" accountability group for a public school, charter school or\nschool district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly progress on a\nperformance criterion specified in paragraphs (j)(1) and (2) of this section if\nall the accountability groups, except the \"all students\" group, for which a\npublic school, charter school or school district is accountable on that\nperformance criterion made adequate yearly progress. Effective with 2014-2015\nschool year results and continuing with the results for each school year\nthereafter, the \"all students\" accountability group for a public school, charter school or school district shall be deemed to have made adequate yearly\nprogress on a performance criterion specified in paragraph (j)(3) of this\nsection if all the accountability groups, except the \"all students\" group, for\nwhich a public school, charter school or school district is accountable on that\nperformance criterion made adequate yearly progress. (g) Differentiated accountability for\nschools and districts. Prior to the commencement of the 2012-2013 school year, the\ncommissioner, based on the 2010-2011 school year results, shall designate focus\ndistricts, priority schools and focus charter schools. Prior to the\ncommencement of the 2013-2014 school year, based on the 2011-2012 school year\nresults, and each year thereafter up through and including 2016-2017 school\nyear, based on the subsequent school year results, the commissioner shall\ndesignate public schools requiring a local assistance plan. (1)\n\nPreliminary identification of priority\nschools prior to the commencement of the 2015-2016 school year. (i) The commissioner shall preliminarily\ndesignate a school as priority if: (a) the\nschool implemented a transformation, turnaround or restart model in the\n2011-2012 school year pursuant to a school improvement grant pursuant to\nsection\n100.2\n(p)(10)(iv)\n(\na\n) of this Part; or\n(b) the school is a high school that has a\nfour year cohort graduation rate for the \"all students\" group that is less than\n60 percent for the 2004, 2005 and 2006 high school graduation cohorts; or\n(c) the school is an elementary\nor middle school that: (1)\nhad a combined\nperformance index of 111 or below in English language arts and mathematics for\nthe all students group in 2010-2011; and\n(2)\nmade a 10 point gain or less in its\n2010-2011 combined performance index for the all students group compared to its\n2009-2010 combined performance index; and\n(3)\nwas identified as in improvement, corrective action, or restructuring during the 2011-2012 school year; and\n(4)\nhad a combined median\nstudent growth percentile in English language arts and math for the 2009-2010\nand 2010-2011 school years combined for the all students group of 50 percent or\nbelow; and\n(5)\nhad less than 50\npercent of the accountability groups in the school have 2010-2011 median\nstudent growth percentiles that exceeded the statewide median student growth\npercentile for that accountability group; or\n(d) the school is a high school that: (1)\nhad a combined performance index of 106\nor below in English language arts and mathematics for the all students group; and\n(2)\nwas identified as in\nimprovement, corrective action, or restructuring during 2011-2012 school year; and\n(3)\nmade a four point gain or\nless in its 2010-2011 combined English language arts and mathematics\nperformance index for the all students group compared to its 2009-2010\nperformance index. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner shall not preliminarily\nidentify a school in a special act school district as a priority school unless\nthe school meets the conditions specified in this subdivision and also has been\nidentified by the commissioner as a school under registration review because of\na poor learning environment, pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nPreliminary\nidentification of priority schools based upon 2014-2015 school year results: (i) the commissioner shall preliminarily\ndesignate a school as priority if: (a) the\nschool is a high school that has a four year cohort graduation rate for the\n\"all students\" group that is less than 60 percent for the 2008, 2009 and 2010\nfour year high school graduation cohorts; or\n(b) the school is an elementary or middle\nschool that: (1)\nhad a 2014-2015 combined\n\nEnglish language arts and mathematics performance index at or below the cut\npoint established by the commissioner for the \"all students\" group; and\n(2)\ndid not make the required\nprogress as established by the commissioner in its 2014-2015 combined English\nlanguage arts and mathematics performance index for the \"all students\" group\ncompared to its 2013-2014 combined performance index; and\n(3)\nhad a combined mean student growth\npercentile in English language arts and mathematics for the 2013-2014 and\n2014-2015 school years combined for the \"all students\" group of 50 percent or\nbelow; and\n(4)\nhad 50 percent or\nless of the accountability groups in the school for which the school is\naccountable have a 2014-2015 mean student growth percentiles that exceeded the\nstatewide median student growth percentile for that accountability group; or\n(c) the school is a\nhigh school that: (1)\nhad a combined English\nlanguage arts and mathematics performance index at or below the cut point\nestablished by the commissioner for the \"all students\" group; and\n(2)\ndid not make the required progress as\nestablished by the commissioner in its 2014-2015 combined English language arts\nand mathematics performance index for the \"all students\" group compared to its\n2013-2014 combined performance index. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner shall not preliminarily\nidentify a school if the 2011 four year or 2009 five year graduation rate for\nthe \"all students\" group is 70 percent or more. (iii)\n\nAt the commissioner's discretion, a\nschool will not be identified as a priority school for Performance Index for a\ngrade level if the \"all students\" group meets one or more of the following\nprogress filters: (a) made adequate yearly\nprogress for English language arts and mathematics for 2013-2014 and\n2014-2015; (b) made a 10 point gain\nin performance index from 2013-2014 to 2014-2015; (c) made a 10 percent point gap reduction in\nperformance index from 2013-2014 to 2014-2015. (iv)\n\nAt the commissioner' discretion, a\nschool may be considered to have made progress and will not be identified as a\npriority school for graduation rate if the \"all students\" group meets one or\nmore of the following progress filters: (a) the 2009 five year cohort graduation rate is at or above 60 percent; (b) the 2011 four year or the 2010 five year\ncohort graduation rate is at or above 60 percent; (c) the increase in four year graduation rate\nis 10 points or more from 2008 to 2010 cohort; (d) the increase in four year or five year\ngraduation rate is 10 points or more from 2009 to 2010 cohort; (e) there is a 10 percent gap reduction for\nthe four year graduation rate from the prior cohort. (v) The commissioner shall not preliminarily\nidentify a school in a special act school district as a priority school unless\nthe school meets the conditions specified in this subdivision and also has been\nidentified by the commissioner as a school under registration review because of\na poor learning environment, pursuant to paragraph (k)(2) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nPreliminary\nidentification of focus districts and schools prior to the commencement of the\n2015-2016 school year. (i) The commissioner\nwill preliminarily designate a district or a charter school as focus using the\nfollowing methodology: (a) Preliminary\nidentification as focus district or focus charter school based on combined\n\nEnglish language arts and mathematics performance index: (1)\n\nFor each district and charter school, the\ncombined 2010-11 performance index (PI) of ELA and Math for the\nelementary-middle and secondary levels for each accountability group, except\nthe all students group, is determined. (2)\n\nFor each accountability group, except the\nall students group, the combined 2009-10 and 2010-11 ELA and Math median\nstudent growth percentile is determined. If the accountability group's median\nstudent growth percentile is above the combined 2009-10 and 2010-11 statewide\naverage for that accountability group then the performance index of the\naccountability group is removed from those for which the school district or\ncharter school can be identified as a focus district or focus charter\nschool. (3)\n\nIf an accountability\ngroup's 2006 four year graduation cohort rate exceeds the statewide average for\nthe accountability group, then the performance index of the accountability\ngroup is removed from those for which the school district or charter school can\nbe identified as a focus district or focus charter school. (4)\n\nIf a remaining accountability group is\namong the lowest five percent in the State for combined ELA and math\nperformance index for the 2010-2011 school year, as determined by the\ncommissioner, the district or charter school will be preliminarily identified\nas a focus district or focus charter school. (b) Preliminary identification of focus\ndistrict or focus charter school based on graduation rate. (1)\n\nFor each school district and charter\nschool, the 2006 four year graduation cohort rate for each accountability\ngroup, except the all students group, is determined. Each such accountability\ngroup for which the graduation rate exceeds the statewide rate for that\naccountability group is removed from consideration as an accountability group\nfor graduation rate for which the school district or charter school can be\nidentified as a focus district or focus charter school. (2)\n\nFor each remaining accountability group\nfor which the 2005 five year graduation cohort rate is above the State average\nfor that accountability group, the accountability group is removed from\nconsideration as an accountability group for graduation rate for which the\nschool district or charter school can be identified as a focus district or\nfocus charter school. (3)\n\nFor each\nremaining accountability group, if the accountability group's 2006 four year\ngraduation cohort rate exceeds the 2004 four year graduation cohort rate by at\nleast 10 percent, then the accountability group is removed from consideration\nas an accountability group for graduation rate for which the school district or\ncharter school can be identified as a focus district or focus charter\nschool. (4)\n\nIf any of the remaining\naccountability groups are among the lowest five percent in the State for\ngraduation rate, as determined by the commissioner, the school district or\ncharter school will be preliminarily identified as a focus district or focus\ncharter school. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner shall not preliminarily\nidentify a special act school district as a focus district unless at least one\nschool in the school district has been preliminarily identified as a priority\nschool. (iii)\nA school district in\nwhich a school has been preliminarily identified as a priority school shall be\npreliminarily identified as a focus district. (4)\n\nPreliminary identification of focus\ndistricts and schools, based upon 2014-2015 school year results: (i) the commissioner will preliminarily\ndesignate a district as focus using the following methodology: (a) preliminary identification as focus\ndistrict based on combined English language arts and mathematics performance\nindex: (1)\n\nFor each district, for the\nelementary-middle or the secondary level the combined 2014-2015 performance\nindex of English language arts and mathematics for each accountability group, except the \"all students\" group, is determined. (2)\n\nIf a district's combined 2013-2014 and\n2014-2015 mean student growth percentile is above the state average for an\naccountability group, then the elementary-middle level performance index of the\naccountability group is removed from those for which the school district can be\nidentified as a focus district. (3)\n\nIf a district's 2010 four year or 2009 five year graduation rate is above the\n\nState average for an accountability group, then the elementary-middle or\nsecondary level performance index of the accountability group is removed from\nthose for which the school district can be identified as a focus\ndistrict. (4)\n\nIf a district makes a\n10 point gain or 10 percent gap reduction from the 2013-2014 performance index\nfor an accountability group, then the grade level performance index of the\naccountability group is removed from those for which the school district can be\nidentified as a focus district. (5)\n\nIf a district makes adequate yearly progress for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015\nfor an accountability group, then the accountability group is removed from\nthose for which the school district can be identified as a focus\ndistrict. (6)\n\nIf a remaining\naccountability group is among the lowest percentile in the State for the\ncombined performance index of English language arts and mathematics for the\n2014-2015 school year, as determined by the commissioner, the district will be\npreliminarily identified as a focus district, except that in determining which\nracial-ethnic groups will be considered among the lowest percentile in the\nstate, the commissioner shall create a single rank ordered list to which a\nuniform standard shall be applied such that any racial-ethnic group performing\nbelow the single cut point shall be preliminarily identified. (b) Preliminary identification of\nfocus district based on graduation rate. (1)\n\nFor each school district, the 2010 four year graduation cohort rate for each\naccountability group, except the \"all students\" group, is determined. (2)\n\nIf a district's 2010 four year or 2009\nfive year graduation rate is above the State average for the accountability\ngroup(s), then the accountability group is removed from those for which the\nschool district can be identified as a focus district. (3)\n\nIf a district makes a 10 point gain from\nthe 2009 four year graduation rate or the 2008 five year graduation rate in the\naccountability group(s), then the accountability group is removed from those\nfor which the school district can be identified as a focus district. (4)\n\nIf a district makes a 10 percent gap\nreduction from the 2009 four year graduation rate in the accountability\ngroup(s), then the accountability group is removed from those for which the\nschool district can be identified as a focus district. (5)\n\nIf a district makes a 10 point gain from\nthe 2008 four year graduation rate in the accountability group(s), then the\naccountability group is removed from those for which the school district can be\nidentified as a focus district. (6)\n\nIf a district makes adequate yearly progress for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 in\nthe accountability group(s), then the accountability group is removed from\nthose for which the school district can be identified as a focus\ndistrict. (7)\n\nIf any of the\nremaining accountability groups are among the lowest percentile in the State\nfor graduation rate, as determined by the commissioner, the school district\nwill be preliminarily identified as a focus district, except that in\ndetermining which racial-ethnic groups will be considered among the lowest\npercentile in the State, the commissioner shall create a single rank ordered\nlist to which a uniform standard shall be applied such that any racial-ethnic\ngroup performing below the single cut point shall be preliminarily identified. (i) The commissioner shall not preliminarily\nidentify a special act school district as a focus district unless at least one\nschool in the school district has been preliminarily identified as a priority\nschool. (ii)\nA school district in\nwhich a school has been preliminarily identified as a priority school shall be\npreliminarily identified as a focus district. (5)\n\nNotification of\npreliminary identification of a priority school, focus district or focus\ncharter school. (i) If a charter school whose\nelementary-middle or secondary grade level English language arts and\nmathematics combined performance index for the 2014-2015 school year or whose\nfour year graduation rate for the 2010 graduation rate cohort for an\naccountability group is at or below the cut points established by the\ncommissioner and which are not making progress for that accountability group as\ndetermined by the commissioner, will be identified a charter focus\nschool. (ii)\n\nAt the commissioner's\ndiscretion, a charter school may be designated as making progress if it\nachieves one or more of the progress filters pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of\nparagraph (8) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nFor each preliminarily identified\npriority school, focus district or focus charter school, the school district or\ncharter school shall be given the opportunity to present to the commissioner\nadditional data and relevant information concerning extenuating or\nextraordinary circumstances faced by the school district or school that should\nbe cause for the commissioner to not identify a district as a focus district, a\npublic school as a priority school, or a charter school as a priority or focus\nschool. The commissioner shall remove from preliminary priority school\nidentification any school identified pursuant to clause\n(1)(i)(\nb\n) of this subdivision where the school district or\ncharter school provides evidence that the school's 2007 four year graduation\ncohort rate for the \"all students\" group equals or exceeds 60\npercent. (iv)\n\nCharter schools and\nschool districts will be informed of the preliminary status of the school\ndistrict and schools, and will be provided the opportunity to appeal such\npreliminarily identification, in a format and according to such time line as\nprescribed by the commissioner. (v) If a charter school or school district appeals the designation of a transfer\nhigh school as a priority school, the commissioner shall give careful\nconsideration to the mission of the school, student performance, and the\nschool's ability to effectively serve its students in a turnaround environment. The commissioner will take into account student performance factors including\nthe age and number of credits that members of the cohort have upon admission to\nthe school and the success of the school in graduating students up to the age\nof 21. (6)\n\nDetermination\nof priority school, focus district or focus charter school status. The\ncommissioner shall review the additional information provided by the school\ndistrict or charter school and make a determination regarding the designation\nof the school as a priority school or the school district as a focus district\nor the charter school as a focus charter school and provide notice to the\nschool district or charter school of the determination. (7)\n\nIdentification of focus schools prior to\nthe commencement of the 2015-2016 school year. (i) Upon identification as a focus district, the commissioner will require the school district to identify a specified\nminimum number of schools upon which it will focus its support and intervention\nefforts. (ii)\n\nIf the school\ndistrict has been identified as a focus district solely because it has one or\nmore priority schools in the school district, then the commissioner will\nprovide the school district with the list of schools that are identified as\nfoscus schools, which shall consist of those schools whose ELA and math\ncombined performance index for 2010-2011 school year or whose graduation rate\nfor the 2006 graduation rate cohort for an accountability group is at or below\ncut points established by the commissioner and which are not making progress\nfor that accountability group as determined by the commissioner. The district\nmay petition the commissioner, using such format as the commissioner may\nprescribe, to substitute for good cause one or more schools on the list with\nschool(s) selected by the district. (iii)\n\nIf a school district has been\nidentified as a focus district pursuant to subparagraph (f)(2)(i) of this\nsection, then all of the schools within the school district shall be\npreliminarily identified as focus schools. The commissioner shall assign the\nschool district a minimum number of schools, as provided in subparagraph (viii)\nof this paragraph, that must be designated as focus schools based upon the\nnumber of non-proficient student results in English language arts and math on\n2010-2011 school year assessments and non-graduation results for the 2006\ngraduation rate cohort for the accountability groups for which the school\ndistrict has been identified as a proportion of the number of non-proficient\nresults and non-graduate results for all focus districts in the\n\nState. (iv)\n\nIf a school has fewer\nthan a total of 15 non-proficient student results in the accountability\ngroup(s) for which it could be potentially identified, then the school will not\nbe identified for non-proficient student results. If the school has fewer than\n15 non-graduation results in the accountability group(s) for which it could be\npotentially identified, then the school will not be identified for\nnon-graduation results. (v) If a\nschool has more than 60 percent of its students meeting or exceeding the\nproficiency standard in ELA and math for all accountability group(s) for which\nthe school could be identified, then the school will not be identified for\nnon-proficient student results. If the school has a graduation rate of 60\npercent or more for all accountability group(s) for which the school could be\nidentified, then the school will not be identified for non-graduation\nresults. (vi)\nA priority school\nshall not be identified as a focus school. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner will provide each\nfocus district identified pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision with\ntwo rank-ordered list of schools as follows: (a) A list rank-ordered based on the\npercentage of non-proficient and/or non-graduation results for each\naccountability performance criterion for each accountability group for which\nthe school district has been identified as a focus district. (b) A list rank-ordered based on the number\nof non-proficient and/or non-graduation results for each accountability\nperformance criterion for each accountability group for which the school\ndistrict has been identified as a focus district. (viii)\n\nThe minimum number of schools that a\nfocus district must identify as focus schools shall not exceed 85 percent of\nthe elementary and middle schools and 85 percent of the high schools in the\nschool district that have not been identified as priority schools. In the event\nthat all schools in the school district meet the conditions specified in\nsubparagraph (iv), (v) or (vi) of this paragraph, then the school district\nshall not receive rank-ordered lists but will be required to identify at a\nminimum any one school in the school district as a focus school. (ix)\nA focus district may choose to: (a) provide support to all of its schools to\naddress the performance of accountability group(s) on the accountability\nmeasure(s) that caused the school district to be identified; or\n(b) identify a subset of schools as focus\nschools from the rank-order lists provided by the commissioner based on: (1)\nthe number of students in a school who\nare not proficient in ELA or mathematics or non-graduates in the accountability\ngroups for which the school district was identified; (2)\nthe percent of students who are not\nproficient in ELA or mathematics or non-graduates in the accountability groups\nfor which the school district was identified. (c) The school district must use the selected\nrank-ordered list to identify at least the minimum, required number of focus\nschools. (d) The focus district may\npetition the commissioner, using such format as he may prescribe, to substitute\nfor good cause one or more lower ranked schools on the list selected by the\nschool district for higher ranked schools. In the case of the city school\ndistrict of the City of New York, if the chancellor identifies more than the\nminimum number of schools in a community school district, the chancellor may\nrequest that such additional schools be credited towards meeting the minimum\nnumber of school requirement in other community school districts within the\nsame county. (e) A focus district\nshall provide the commissioner with its proposed list of focus schools\naccording to such timeline as prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner\nshall review and approve the proposed list and provide notification to the\nschool district of which schools have been designated as focus\nschools. (f) Prior to the start of\neach school year, the commissioner shall provide each focus district with the\nopportunity to revise its approved list of focus schools. (x) Before placing a transfer high school on\nthe rank-ordered lists of potential focus schools, the commissioner shall\nreview the performance of the school on a case-by-case basis, giving careful\nconsideration to the mission of a particular school, student performance, and\nthe school's ability to effectively serve its students in a turnaround\nenvironment. The commissioner will take into account the graduation cohort\ndata, the age and number of credits that members of the cohort have upon\nadmission to the school; and the success of the school in graduating students\nup to the age of 21. (8)\n\nIdentification of focus schools with the 2014-2015 school year results: (i) If the school district has been\nidentified as a focus district, then the commissioner will provide the school\ndistrict with the list of schools that are preliminarily identified as focus\nschools, which shall consist of those schools whose elementary-middle or\nsecondary grade level English language arts and math combined performance index\nfor the 2014-2015 school year or whose four year graduation rate for the 2010\ngraduation rate cohort for an accountability group is at or below the cut\npoints established by the commissioner and which are not making progress for\nthat accountability group as determined by the commissioner. The district may\npetition the commissioner, using such format as the commissioner may prescribe, to substitute for good cause one or more schools on the list with school(s)\nselected by the district. If there are no schools in a district that meets the\ncriteria to be a focus school, then the commissioner will not identify a focus\nschool in that district. (ii)\n\nAt\nthe commissioner's discretion, a school may be designated as making progress if\nit achieves one or more of the following progress filters: (a) If a school's combined 2013-2014 and\n2014-2015 mean student growth percentile is above the state average in the\naccountability group(s) for which it could be potentially identified, then the\nschool need not be identified for those accountability group(s) at the\nelementary-middle level. (b) If a\nschool's 2010 four year or 2009 five year graduation rate is above the state\naverage for the accountability group(s) for which it could be potentially\nidentified, then the school need not be identified for those accountability\ngroup(s) at the elementary-middle or secondary level. (c) If a school makes a 10 point gain or 10\npercent gap reduction from the 2013-2014 performance index in the\naccountability group(s) for which it could be potentially identified, then the\nschool need not be identified for those accountability group(s) at that grade\nlevel. (d) If a school makes a 10\npoint gain from the 2009 four year graduation rate or the 2008 five year\ngraduation rate in the accountability group(s) for which it could be\npotentially identified, then the school need not be identified for those\naccountability group(s). (e) If a\nschool makes a 10 percent gap reduction from the 2009 four year graduation rate\nin the accountability group(s) for which it could be potentially identified, then the school need not be identified for those accountability\ngroup(s). (f) If a school makes a\n10 point gain from the 2008 four year graduation rate in the accountability\ngroup(s) for which it could be potentially identified, then the school need not\nbe identified for those accountability group(s). (g) If a school makes adequate yearly\nprogress for the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 in the accountability group(s) for\nwhich it could be potentially identified, then the school need not be\nidentified for those accountability group(s). (iii)\nA priority school shall not be\nidentified as a focus school. (iv)\n\nThe focus district may petition the commissioner, using such format as the\ncommissioner may prescribe, to substitute for good cause one or more schools\nnot identified as focus for a school that has been identified as focus or to\nself-identify a school as focus. In the case of the city school district of the\n\nCity of New York, if the chancellor identifies more than the minimum number of\nschools in a community school district, the chancellor may request that such\nadditional schools be credited towards meeting the minimum number of school\nrequirement in other community school districts within the same\ncounty. (v) A focus district shall\nprovide the commissioner with its proposed list of focus schools according to\nsuch timeline as prescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner shall review\nand approve the proposed list and provide notification to the school district\nof which schools have been designated as focus schools. (vi)\n\nPrior to the start of each school year, the commissioner shall provide each focus district with the opportunity to\nrevise its approved list of focus schools. (vii)\n\nBefore placing a transfer high school\non the list of potential focus schools, the commissioner shall review the\nperformance of the school on a case-by-case basis, giving careful consideration\nto the mission of a particular school, student performance, and the school's\nability to effectively serve its students in a turnaround environment. The\ncommissioner will take into account the graduation cohort data, the age and\nnumber of credits that members of the cohort have upon admission to the school; and the success of the school in graduating students up to the age of\n21. (9)\n\nSchool requiring\na local assistance plan. (i) For the 2015-2016\nand 2016-2017 school years, using the 2013-2014 and 2014-2015 school year\nresults respectively, a school that has not been designated as a priority or\nfocus school shall be designated as a local assistance plan school if the\nschool: (a) failed to make adequate yearly\nprogress (AYP) for an accountability group for three consecutive years on the\nsame performance criterion in subdivision (j) of this section; provided that\nsuch school shall not be designated as a local assistance plan school if the\nschool has met other measures of progress as determined by the commissioner\npursuant to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph; or\n(b) has gaps in achievement on a performance\ncriterion in subdivision (j) of this section and the school has not shown\nsufficient progress toward reducing or closing those gaps, or meeting other\nmeasures of progress as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, between students who are members and students who are\nnot members of that accountability group; or\n(c) for determinations based on 2013-2014\nschool year results, the school is located in a district that is not designated\nas Focus and the school meets the criteria for identification as a focus school\npursuant to subparagraph (7)(ii) of this subdivision, and such other measures\nof progress as determined by the commissioner pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph and for determinations based on 2014-2015 school year results\nand each school year's results thereafter the school meets the criteria for\nidentification pursuant to paragraph (8) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding the\nprovisions of clauses (i)(\na\n) through (\nc\n) of\nthis paragraph, the commissioner may consider other measures of progress in\ndetermining whether to identify a school as a local assistance plan school\nusing the 2013-2014 school year results and/or the 2014-2015 school year\nresults, including but not limited to: (a) whether a subgroup has made two consecutive years of AYP; (b) the subgroup's Student Growth Percentile\n(SGP) is above State average; (c) the percentile rank of the Performance Index (PI)/graduation rate of a subgroup\non an accountability measure as compared to the percentile rank of the\nPI/graduation rate of the subgroup in other schools in the State; (d) whether the graduation rate of the\nsubgroup is above State average; and/or\n(e) if the subgroup's performance on an\naccountability measure has changed from year to year. (iii)\n\nFor transfer high schools for which a\ndistrict has submitted alternative high school cohort data, the commissioner\nshall review such data to determine whether the school shall be designated as\nrequiring a local assistance plan. (iv)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraphs (i), (ii)\nand (iii) of this paragraph, commencing with the 2014-2015 school year results\na school shall not be identified as a local assistance plan school until the\nschool meets any of the criteria specified in clauses (i)(\nb\n)\nand (\nc\n) of this paragraph for two consecutive years. (v) Districts will be informed of the\npreliminary status of its schools and will be provided the opportunity to\nappeal the identification of any preliminarily identified school. (vi)\n\nThe commissioner shall remove from local\nassistance plan status a school that for two consecutive school years does not\nmeet the criteria for identification in clauses (i)(\na\n), (\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of this paragraph. (vii)\n\nThe commissioner shall consider the\n2015-2016 school year results in determining whether a school designated as a\nlocal assistance plan school pursuant to this paragraph shall retain such\ndesignation in the 2017-2018 school year. (10)\n\nPublic notification of identification as\na priority or focus school. (i) Upon receipt\nof an accountability designation of priority or focus, the board of education\n(in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) or charter school\nboard of trustees shall take appropriate action to notify the general public of\nthe issuance of such designation. Such action shall include, but need not be\nlimited to, direct notification, within 30 days of receipt of the\ncommissioner's designation, in English and translated, when appropriate, into\nthe recipient's native language or mode of communication, to persons in\nparental relation of children attending the school that it has been designated\nas priority or focus, and disclosure by the school district at the next public\nmeeting of the local board of education or by the charter school board of\ntrustees at the next public meeting of such designation. (ii)\n\nEach school year during which a school\nremains under the identification as a priority or focus school, by June 30th or\nat the time of a student's initial application or admission to the school, whichever is earliest, the board of education or charter school board of\ntrustees shall provide direct notification to parents or other persons in\nparental relation to children attending the school that the school remains a\npriority or focus school. Such notification shall include a summary of the\nactions that the school district and school are taking to improve student\nresults and an explanation of any district programs of choice, magnet programs, transfer policies, or other options that a parent or a person in parental\nrelation may have to place the child in a different public school within the\nschool district. Such notification shall include the timelines and process for\nparents exercising their rights to school choice. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, in the event that a priority\nschool has been identified as a struggling school or a persistently struggling\nschool pursuant to section\n100.19\nof this Part and/or a school\nunder registration review pursuant to this section, the district may use a\nsingle notification to fulfill the annual public notification requirements of\nsubparagraph (7)(ii) of this subdivision and subparagraph (l)(1)(ii) of this\nsection and section\n100.19\n(c)(1)(ii)\nof this Part. (h) Interventions. (1)\n\nDistrict diagnostic review for focus\ndistricts. Commencing in the 2012-2013 school year, each focus district shall\nparticipate annually in a diagnostic review using a diagnostic tool of quality\nindicators as prescribed by the commissioner that shall focus on the\naccountability group(s) for each accountability performance criterion for which\nthe school district and its schools have been identified as priority and/or\n\nFocus. (2)\n\nSchool and district\ndiagnostic review.

(b) For schools\ndesignated as focus and priority in the years in which an integrated\nintervention team does not conduct an on-site diagnostic review, the school\ndistrict will be required to annually use a diagnostic tool, in the form and\ncontent prescribed by the commissioner, to inform the development of the\ndistrict comprehensive improvement plan and the school comprehensive education\nplan. (c) For schools designated as\nrequiring a local assistance plan, the school, in collaboration with the school\ndistrict, will be required to annually use a diagnostic tool, in the form and\ncontent prescribed by the commissioner, to inform the development of the local\nassistance plan. (d) Any school\ndesignated as a school requiring a local assistance plan but located within a\nfocus district may upon the approval of the commissioner be included in the\nsubmission of the district comprehensive improvement plan, which will replace\nthe requirements of the local assistance plan. (ii)\n\nDistrict comprehensive improvement plan. (a) Commencing with the plan for the\n2015-2016 school year, each focus district shall develop a district\ncomprehensive improvement plan, in such format as may be prescribed by the\ncommissioner, to identify the actions that will be taken to improve student\nperformance levels of the accountability group(s) for each accountability\nperformance criterion for which the school district has been identified as a\nfocus district or one or more schools within the school district have been\nidentified as priority schools. The plan shall: (1)\nbe developed in such format as may be\nprescribed by the commissioner, and shall be formally approved by the board of\neducation of the school district (in New York City, approved by the chancellor\nor the chancellor's designee) no later than three months following the\ndesignation of the school district as a focus district, except that the\ncommissioner may waive this timeline for good cause, and shall be subject to\nthe approval of the commissioner, upon request; (2)\nspecify the supports and interventions, from the list of allowable expenditures and activities approved by the\ndepartment, that the school district will provide to each school in the school\ndistrict that has been identified as priority or focus school or a school\nrequiring a local assistance plan and the funding sources that will be used for\nsuch supports and interventions; (3)\nbe implemented no later than the\nbeginning of the 2016-2017 school year or immediately upon approval of the\nboard of education, if such approval occurs after the first day of regular\nschool attendance; (4)\nbe developed\nin consultation with parents, school, staff, and others pursuant to section\n100.11\nof this Part; (5)\nbe made widely available through public\nmeans, such as posting on the Internet, distribution through the media, and\ndistribution through public agencies, according to such timeline as may be\nestablished by the commissioner; (6)\nbe updated annually, including an\nanalysis of achievement of prior year goals, and, as so updated, approved by\nthe board of education (in New York City, approved by the chancellor or the\nchancellor's designee) and implemented no later than the first day of regular\nstudent attendance of each year that the school district remains a focus\ndistrict; (7)\ninclude a description\nof goals, targets, activities and timeline for implementation; (8)\nrequire the prior approval of the\ncommissioner for any significant modification of the school district's approved\ncomprehensive improvement plan. (b) Commencing with the plan for the\n2013-2014 school year, the district comprehensive improvement plan shall be\ndeveloped based on the diagnostic reviews of the school district and schools\nwithin the school district. (c) In\nlieu of a district comprehensive improvement plan, each charter school\nidentified as a focus school or priority school shall take such actions as are\nrequired by its charter authorizer pursuant to article 56 of the Education Law, consistent with the charter agreement that each charter school has with its\ncharter authorizer and as determined by the charter school's board of trustees\nin consultation with the charter school's authorizer.

(vii)\n\nPublic school choice. Each school district that receives title I funds that has\na school designated as priority or focus pursuant to this paragraph, shall\nprovide public school choice consistent with section\n120.3\nof this Title. (i) Removal from\naccountability designation. (1)\n\nRemoval of priority school designation. Based upon 2011-2012 and 2012-2013\nschool year results, and each two consecutive school year period thereafter, a\nschool district or charter school may petition for a school to be removed from\npriority status if the school meets performance targets established by the\ncommissioner, and the school has a combined performance index in ELA and\nmathematics for the all students group that exceeds the thresholds for\nidentification as a priority school in the second year of the two year period. For high schools, the four year or five year cohort graduation rate must equal\nat least 60 percent for two consecutive years, the four year graduation rate\ncohort must equal or exceed 60 percent in the second year of the two year\nperiod and the school must meet the performance targets established by the\ncommissioner, except for transfer high schools, for which the commissioner will\nestablish a graduation rate goal and progress targets based on the specific\nconditions and circumstances present at each transfer high school. The school\nmust also meet the participation rate requirement in ELA and mathematics for\nall groups for which it is accountable in the most current school year results\nthat are being used as the basis for the petition. (i) A school that begins to fully implement a\nwhole-school reform model must complete implementation of the model even after\nremoval from priority designation. (ii)\n\nSchools that are removed from priority\nstatus before they begin implementation of a model will not be required to\nimplement the model. (2)\n\nRemoval of focus district and focus school designation. (i) Commencing with 2011-2012 and 2012-2013\nschool year results, and each consecutive two year period thereafter, a school\ndistrict may petition to have its focus designation revised if the school\ndistrict meets the participation requirement in ELA and mathematics for all\naccountability groups and the performance targets established by the\ncommissioner, and the school district has a combined performance index in ELA\nand mathematics for each group for which the school district is accountable\nthat exceeds the thresholds for identification in the second year of the two\nyear period. For all groups for which the school district is accountable for\ngraduation rate, the district must also exceed the graduation rate threshold\nfor identification with the four year or five year graduation rate in the first\nyear and with the four year graduation rate in the second year of the two year\nperiod. The school district may petition for the removal of focus designation\nfor any focus school in the school district that meets these same performance\ntargets and participation rate requirements for ELA and mathematics, except\nthat for a focus school that is identified pursuant to paragraph (g)(8) of this\nsection, a district may petition for removal if the school meets the criteria\nspecified in subparagraph (g)(10)(vi) of this section. (ii)\n\nUpon receipt of a petition for revision\nof status by a focus district, the commissioner will review the status of the\nschool district and each priority and focus school in the school district. If\nthe school district and each priority school and focus school within the school\ndistrict meet the criteria for removal, the commissioner shall remove the focus\ndesignation from the school district and the focus and priority designation\nfrom all schools within the school district. Commencing with 2015-2016 school\nyear results, if the school district does not meet the criteria for removal but\neach priority and focus school within the school district meets the criteria\nfor removal, the district will remain a focus district but each school within\nthe district shall be removed from priority or focus school\ndesignation. (iii)\n\nIf the school\ndistrict meets the criteria for removal, but not every priority or focus school\nwithin the school district meets the criteria for removal, the commissioner\nshall only remove the focus or priority designation from schools that meet the\ncriteria for removal. The school district will remain a focus district and\nthose schools that do not meet the criteria for removal will remain designated\nas focus or priority schools as applicable. The minimum number of schools that\nmust be designated as focus shall be reduced to reflect this removal. (iv)\n\nFor accountability determinations made\nprior to the 2015-2016 school year, if the school district does not meet the\ncriteria for removal but one or more of its focus schools meet the criteria for\nremoval, the school district must, for each focus school it petitions for\nremoval of focus designation, identify school(s) not currently identified as\npriority or focus to replace the school(s) meeting the criteria for removal, except that a school district is not required to: (a) designate additional new focus schools to\nreplace focus schools meeting the criteria for removal if by so doing the\nnumber of focus schools in the district would exceed the number of focus\nschools that the commissioner requires a school district to identify pursuant\nto paragraph (g)(7) of this section; or\n(b) designate a school as a focus school that\nmeets the criteria for focus school removal pursuant to this subdivision in\norder to replace a focus school meeting the criteria for removal. (v) For accountability\ndeterminations made prior to the 2015-2016 school year, notwithstanding the\nprovisions of this subparagraph, a school district must identify at least one\nschool as focus school if the school district does not meet the criteria for\nremoval but all of its priority and focus schools meet the criteria for\nremoval. (vi)\n\nRemoval of focus\ncharter school designation. (a) Commencing\nwith 2011-2012 and 2012-13 school year results and for each consecutive two\nyear period thereafter, a charter school may petition for the charter school to\nbe removed from focus status if the charter school meets the participation\nrequirement in ELA and math for all accountability groups and the performance\ntargets established by the commissioner, which will at a minimum require that\nthe charter school have a combined performance index in ELA and mathematics for\neach group for which the charter school was identified that exceeds the\nthresholds for identification in the second year of the two year period. The\ncharter school must also exceed the graduation rate threshold for\nidentification for two consecutive years for all accountability groups for\nwhich the charter school is accountable for graduation rate. (b) Upon receipt of a petition for removal by\na charter school, the commissioner will review the status of the charter\nschool, and if the charter school meets the criteria for removal, the\ncommissioner shall remove the focus designation from the charter\nschool. (j) Public school, school district and\ncharter school performance criteria. Each school district and school accountability group shall\nbe subject to the performance criteria specified below: (1)\n\nElementary/middle-level English language\narts and mathematics, and high school English language arts and mathematics\nrequirements. An annual measurable objective is a performance index set by the\ncommissioner for 2010-11 school year results for each accountability group and\nthat increases annually in equal increments so as to reduce by half the gap\nbetween the performance index for each accountability group in the 2010-11\nschool year and reach a goal of a performance index of 200 by the 2016-17\nschool year, except that, beginning with the 2012-2013 school year and\nthereafter, for each accountability group in elementary/middle-level English\nlanguage arts and mathematics, an annual measurable objective is a performance\nindex set by the commissioner for the 2012-13 school year that increases\nannually in equal increments so as to reduce by half the gap by the 2016-17\nschool year between the performance index of each accountability group in the\n2012-13 school year and a performance index of 147. (2)\n\nAnnual high school or high school\nalternative cohort. (i) Except as provided in\nsubparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, the annual high school cohort\nfor purposes of computing the high school performance index for English\nlanguage arts and mathematics for any given school year shall consist of those\nstudents who first enrolled in ninth grade three years previously anywhere and\nwho were enrolled in the school on the first Wednesday in October of the\ncurrent school year. The annual school district high school cohort for purposes\nof determining the high school performance index for ELA and math for any given\nschool year shall consist of those students who first enrolled in ninth grade\nthree years previously anywhere and who were enrolled in the school district or\nplaced by the school district committee on special education or by school\ndistrict officials in educational programs outside the school district on the\nfirst Wednesday in October of the current school year. Students with\ndisabilities in ungraded programs shall be included in the annual school\ndistrict and high school cohort in the third school year following the one in\nwhich they attained the age of 17. (ii)\n\nThe following students shall not be\nincluded in the annual high school cohort: students who transferred to another\nhigh school or approved alternative high school equivalency preparation program\nor high school equivalency preparation program approved pursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part, or criminal\njustice facility, who left the United States or its territories, or who are\ndeceased; except that, beginning with students who first entered grade 9 in the\n2007-2008 school year, the following students will be included in the high\nschool cohort of the school they attended before transferring: (a) students who transfer to an approved\nalternative high school equivalency preparation program or high school\nequivalency preparation program approved pursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part, but leave that\nprogram before the end of the third school year after the school year in which\nthey first entered grade 9 without having earned a high school equivalency\ndiploma or without entering a program leading to a high school diploma; and\n(b) students who transfer to\nany high school equivalency preparation program other than those approved\npursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nThe following students shall\nnot be included in the annual school district high school cohort: students who\ntransferred to a high school that is not a component of the school district or\nto an approved alternative high school equivalency preparation program or high\nschool equivalency preparation program approved pursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part, or criminal\njustice facility, who left the United States or its territories, or who are\ndeceased; except that, beginning with students who first entered grade 9 in the\n2007-2008 school year, the following students will be included in the high\nschool cohort of the school district they attended before transferring: (a) students who transfer to an approved\nalternative high school equivalency preparation program or high school\nequivalency preparation program approved pursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part, but leave that\nprogram before the end of the third school year after the school year in which\nthey first entered grade 9 without having earned a high school equivalency\ndiploma or without entering a program leading to a high school diploma; and\n(b) students who transfer to\nany high school equivalency preparation program other than those approved\npursuant to section\n100.7\nof this Part. (iv)\n\nThe high school alternative\ncohort in any given year shall consist of those students enrolled in the high\nschool on the first Wednesday of October three years previously who were still\nenrolled in the school on the first Wednesday of October two years previously. Transfer high school may voluntarily submit to the commissioner information on\nthe performance of an alternative high school cohort. (3)\n\nElementary/middle-level science\nrequirements. An annual measurable objective is a performance index set by the\ncommissioner for 2010-11 school year results for each accountability group that\nincreases annually in equal increments so as to reduce by half the gap between\nthe performance index for each accountability group in the 2010-11 school year\nand reach a goal of a performance index of 200 by the 2016-17 school\nyear. (4)\nA high school cohort\ngraduation rate goal established annually by the commissioner, or progress in\nrelation to the previous school year's graduation rate as measured by the four\nyear graduation rate cohort and the five year graduation rate cohort. (i) The four year graduation rate cohort for\neach public school and charter school shall consist of those students\n(including an ungraded student with a disability) whose first date of entry\ninto grade 9 (anywhere) was four years previously and whose last enrollment in\nthe school did not end because of transfer to another school, death, or leaving\nthe United States. The graduation rate is computed as the number of cohort\nmembers who earn a local diploma or Regents diploma by August 31st following\nthe fourth school year after the school year in which the cohort first entered\ngrade 9 divided by the total four year annual graduation rate cohort\nmembership. (ii)\n\nThe four year\ngraduation rate cohort for each school district shall consist of those students\n(including an ungraded student with a disability) whose first date of entry\ninto grade 9 was four years previously (anywhere) and whose last enrollment in\nthe school district did not end because of transfer to another school district, death, or leaving the United States. The graduation rate is computed as the\nnumber of cohort members who earn a local diploma or Regents diploma by August\n31st following the fourth school year after the school year in which the cohort\nfirst entered grade 9 divided by the total four year annual graduation rate\ncohort membership. (iii)\n\nThe five\nyear graduation rate cohort for each public school and charter school shall\nconsist of those students (including an ungraded student with a disability)\nwhose first date of entry into grade 9 (anywhere) was five years previously and\nwhose last enrollment in the school did not end because of transfer to another\nschool, death, or leaving the United States. The graduation rate is computed as\nthe number of cohort members who earn a local diploma or Regents diploma by\n\nAugust 31st following the fifth school year after the school year in which the\ncohort first entered grade 9 divided by the total five year annual graduation\nrate cohort membership. (iv)\n\nThe\nfive year graduation rate cohort for each school district shall consist of\nthose students (including an ungraded student with a disability) whose first\ndate of entry into grade 9 (anywhere) was five years previously and whose last\nenrollment in the school district did not end because of transfer to another\nschool district, death, or leaving the United States. The graduation rate is\ncomputed as the number of cohort members who earn a local diploma or Regents\ndiploma by August 31st following the fifth school year after the school year in\nwhich the cohort first entered grade 9 divided by the total five year annual\ngraduation rate cohort membership. (v) Students with disabilities in ungraded\nprograms shall be included in the four year annual school district and high\nschool cohort in the fourth school year following the one in which they are\nassigned a first date of entry into ninth grade. (vi)\n\nStudents with disabilities in ungraded\nprograms shall be included in the five year annual school district and high\nschool cohort in the fifth school year following the one in which they are\nassigned a first date of entry into ninth grade. (k) Identification of\nschools for public school registration review. (1)\n\nBeginning with 2014-2015 school year\nresults and thereafter, the commissioner shall place under preliminary\nregistration review those schools identified as priority for at least three\nconsecutive years that are determined to have made insufficient progress\ntowards the implementation of their comprehensive improvement plan or have\nfailed to demonstrate progress since identification as a priority school in\nimproving student results on the performance criteria specified in paragraphs\n(j)(1) and (4) of this section, except that the commissioner may upon a finding\nof extenuating circumstances extend the period during which the school must\ndemonstrate progress. (2)\n\nBeginning\nwith 2012-13 school year, the commissioner may also place under preliminary\nregistration review any school that has conditions that threaten the health, safety and/or educational welfare of students or has been the subject of\npersistent complaints to the department by parents or persons in parental\nrelation to the student, and has been identified by the commissioner as a poor\nlearning environment based upon a combination of factors affecting student\nlearning, including but not limited to: high rates of student absenteeism, high\nlevels of school violence, excessive rates of student suspensions, violation of\napplicable building health and safety standards, high rates of teacher and\nadministrator turnover, excessive rates of referral of students to or\nparticipation in special education or excessive rates of participation of\nstudents with disabilities in the alternate assessment, evidence that the\nschool does not maintain required programs and services; evidence of failure to\nappropriately refer for identification and/or provide required programs and\nservices to students with disabilities pursuant to Part 200 of this Title; evidence of failure to appropriately identify and/or provide required programs\nand services to English language learners pursuant to Part 154 of this Title, excessive transfers of students to alternative high school and high school\nequivalency programs and excessive use of uncertified teachers or teachers in\nsubject areas other than those for which they possess certification. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (g) of this section, any school\nthat is identified as a school under registration review pursuant to this\nparagraph shall also be identified as priority school and shall be subject to\nall of the requirements of this section. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may also place under\nregistration review any school for which a school district fails to provide in\na timely manner the student performance data required by the commissioner to\nconduct the annual assessment of the school's performance or any school in\nwhich excessive percentages of students fail to fully participate in the State\nassessment program. (4)\n\nFor each\nschool identified for preliminary registration review pursuant to paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, the school district shall be given the opportunity to\npresent to the commissioner additional data and relevant information concerning\nextenuating or extraordinary circumstances faced by the school that should be\ncause for the commissioner to not identify the school for registration\nreview.

Upon such approval, the commissioner shall direct that the school district submit in a format and\naccording to a timeline prescribed by the commissioner a revised improvement\nplan, a new comprehensive improvement plan, or a plan for phase out or closure\nthat implements the recommendations of the integrated intervention team. Upon\napproval of the plan by the commissioner, the school shall be required to\nimplement such plan. If the school district fails to submit an approvable plan, the commissioner may recommend to the Board of Regents that the registration be\nrevoked and the school be declared an unsound educational environment pursuant\nto paragraph (6) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nStruggling and persistently struggling\nschools identified for registration review. (i) A school that is identified for\nregistration review that has also been identified as a struggling school or\npersistently struggling school pursuant to section\n100.19\nof this Part shall implement\nthe school receivership provisions of that section, except that if the school\nfails to make demonstrable improvement pursuant to section\n100.19\nof this Part for two\nconsecutive years, the commissioner may direct that the school receivership be\nterminated and provide the district the opportunity to take one of the\nfollowing actions: (a) convert the school to a\ncharter school pursuant to Education Law section 2851(3); (b) enter into a contract with the State\nuniversity trustees, subject to the approval of the Commissioner of Education, pursuant to Education Law section 355(n) for the education of the children of\nthe school; or\n(c) for the city\nschool district of the City of New York, entering into a contract with the city\nboard and the City University of New York pursuant to Education Law section\n2590(k) to administer a New York City public high school. (ii)\n\nIn the event that the school district\ndoes not submit an acceptable plan in such format and in such timeline as the\ncommissioner may establish, the commissioner may direct that the school\ndistrict close or phase out the school pursuant to a plan approved by the\ncommissioner. (5)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may require a school district to submit such reports and data as\nthe commissioner deems necessary to monitor the implementation of the\nimprovement plan, comprehensive education plan, or closure or phase out plan\nand to determine the degree to which the school has achieved the progress\nrequired by the commissioner. Such reports shall be in a format and in\naccordance with such timeframe as are prescribed by the commissioner. The\ncommissioner may upon a finding of good cause extend the deadline for\nsubmission of a required plan. (6)\n\nIf the school has not taken the required actions and/or demonstrated progress\nas delineated by the commissioner pursuant to paragraph (3) or paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, the commissioner shall recommend to the Board of Regents that\nthe registration be revoked and the school be declared an unsound educational\nenvironment, except that the commissioner may upon a finding of extenuating\ncircumstances extend the period during which the school must demonstrate\nprogress.

(iii)\n\nWithin 30 days of the\ndate of notice of the commissioner's recommendation, a panel comprised of three\nmembers of the Board of Regents, appointed by the chancellor, shall convene to\nconsider the commissioner's recommendation, review any written response\nsubmitted by the board of education and, if timely requested by the board of\neducation, hear the oral argument. (m) Removal of schools from\nregistration review, school phase-out or closure. (1)\n\nIn the event that a school has\ndemonstrated the progress necessary to be removed from registration review, the\nsuperintendent may petition the commissioner to remove the school from\nregistration review. (2)\nA school\nshall not be removed from registration review if, in the commissioner's\njudgment, conditions that may contribute to a poor learning environment, as\nidentified in paragraph (k)(3) of this section, remain present in the\nschool. (3)\n\nIn the event that a\nschool placed under registration review prior to the 2012-2013 school year\ndemonstrates that it has met its previously established progress targets\npursuant to section\n100.2\n(p) of this\n\nPart, but is identified in the 2012-2013 school year as priority pursuant to\nsubdivision (g) of this section, the school shall remain under registration\nreview and shall follow the intervention requirements pursuant to subdivision\n(h) of this section and meet the targets for removal as a priority school\npursuant to subdivision (i) of this section, pursuant to a timeline prescribed\nby the commissioner. (4)\n\nIn the\nevent that a school placed under registration review prior to the 2012-2013\nschool year demonstrates that it has met its previously established progress\ntargets pursuant to section\n100.2\n(p) of this\n\nPart, and is not identified in the 2012-2013 school year as priority pursuant\nto subdivision (g) of this section, the school shall be removed from\nregistration review. (5)\n\nIn the\nevent that a board of education either seeks to phase out or close a school\nunder registration review or is required to to close or phase out a school\npursuant to paragraph (l)(3) of this section, the board of education (in New\n\nYork City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee) shall submit for\ncommissioner's approval, a plan identifying the intervention that will be\nimplemented and will result in phase out or closure, in the form and content\nprescribed by the commissioner. The commissioner will consider the academic\nimpact of such phase out or closure on other schools within the school district\nand may grant approval of such plan provided that: (i) official resolutions or other approvals\nto phase out or close the existing school have been adopted by the local board\nof education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's\ndesignee); (ii)\na formal phase out\nor closure plan has been developed and approved in accordance with the\nrequirements of the intervention prescribed by the commissioner pursuant to\nsubdivision (h) of this section; and\n(iii)\nparents, teachers, administrators, and\ncommunity members have been provided an opportunity to participate in the\ndevelopment of the phase out or closure plan. (6)\n\nIn the event that a board of education\nseeks to redesign a school under registration review or a priority school, the\nboard of education (in New York City, the chancellor or chancellor's designee)\nshall submit to the commissioner a petition and a redesign plan, in such form\nor format as prescribed by the commissioner, requesting that the redesigned\nschool be approved. (i) The commissioner may\ngrant such petition, and the school may be approved as redesigned, provided\nthat: (a) official resolutions or other\napprovals to replace the existing school with the redesigned school have been\nadopted by the local board of education (in New York City, the chancellor or\nchancellor's designee); (b) parents, teachers, administrators, and community members have been provided an\nopportunity to participate in the development of the redesign plan; and\n(c) upon examination of\nfactors, the commissioner determines that the redesigned school constitutes a\nnew and satisfactory educational program. Such factors may include, but not be\nlimited to, the school mission; school climate; school administration and\nstaff; grade configurations and groupings of students; zoning patterns; curricula and instruction; professional development programs; facilities; and\nparent and community involvement in decision making. In making a determination\nthe commissioner will consider the academic impact of such redesign on other\nschools within the school district. (ii)\n\nAt the time that a redesigned school is\napproved, the commissioner shall delineate the student performance results that\nthe school must demonstrate to be removed from registration review and/or\npriority status. For schools under registration review, if, after the\ndesignated period of time, the school has not demonstrated such results as\ndelineated by the commissioner, the commissioner shall recommend to the Board\nof Regents that the registration be revoked pursuant to paragraph (l)(5) of\nthis section.
