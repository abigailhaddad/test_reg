  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 11.5 - Residential service-special procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section provides special protections for specified\nresidential customers regarding the termination, disconnection or suspension\nand restoration of utility service in cases involving medical emergencies, the\nelderly, blind or disabled, and terminations, disconnections or suspensions\nduring periods of cold weather. This section applies to all or any part of\nresidential utility service, regardless of the type of provider. (a) Medical emergencies. (1)\n\nNo utility shall terminate, disconnect or\nsuspend or refuse to restore service when a medical emergency, as certified by\na medical doctor or local board of health, exists; provided, however, that a\ndemonstration of the customer's inability to pay charges for service shall be\nrequired before a certificate of medical emergency can be renewed. (2)\nA medical emergency exists when a\nresident of a customer's residence suffers from a serious illness or a medical\ncondition that severely affects his well-being. An inability to pay charges for\nservice is demonstrated when a customer is unable to pay past due and current\nutility bills because of insufficient liquid assets and current income, considering other necessary and reasonable expenses of the customer such as\nfood, shelter and medical expenses as documented by provision of the\ninformation required in the form set forth in Appendix A-3 of this Title, or\nsuch other form approved by the commission. (3)\n\nCertification. An initial certification\nof a medical emergency by a medical doctor or local board of health may be made\nby telephone and shall remain effective if written certification is provided\nthereafter to the utility within five business days. If written certification\nof a medical emergency is provided to a utility that uses or appears on a\nconsolidated bill, that utility shall notify any other utility that uses or\nappears on the consolidated bill immediately upon receiving such certification. Any certification of a medical emergency shall be submitted on stationery of\nthe medical doctor or local board of health, shall be signed by the medical\ndoctor or an official of the local board of health qualified to make a medical\njudgment and shall state the name and address of the certifying medical doctor\nor local board of health, the doctor's State registration number, the name and\naddress of the seriously ill person, the nature of the serious illness or\nmedical condition and an affirmation that the illness or condition exists or\nwill be aggravated by the absence of utility service. The certificate shall be\neffective for 30 days from the time the utility receives an oral or written\ncertification, whichever occurs earlier. In deciding whether the conditions for\na medical emergency are met, the medical doctor or qualified official of the\nlocal board of health should use his or her best medical judgment. A utility\nreceiving an initial certificate shall promptly so notify the customer in\nwriting and shall provide information on renewal of certificates, including the\nform set forth in Appendix A-3, infra, or such other form approved by the\ncommission. (4)\n\nCertificate\nrenewal. If the medical condition is likely to continue beyond the expiration\nof an initial certification, a certificate may be renewed, provided: (i) a medical doctor or qualified official of\nthe local board of health states in writing to the utility the expected\nduration of the medical emergency and explains either the nature of the medical\nemergency or the reason why the absence of utility service would aggravate the\nmedical emergency; and\n(ii)\nthe\ncustomer demonstrates an inability to pay charges for service. A customer shall, before the expiration of the initial\ncertification, submit to the utility, the information required in the form set\nforth in Appendix A-3, infra, or such other form approved by the commission, for the purpose of demonstrating an inability to pay charges for service. A\ndistribution utility shall, within five days of submission of such information, determine whether the customer's liquid assets and current income are\ninsufficient to pay utility bills, considering other necessary and reasonable\nexpenses of the customer such as food, shelter and medical expenses. Whenever a\ndistribution utility determines that a customer has not demonstrated a\nfinancial hardship, it shall provide the customer with written notice of the\ndetermination and the customer's right to a review of the determination by the\ncommission or its authorized designee. A distribution utility shall stay any\ndisconnection or suspension activity pending its determination on the\ncustomer's ability to pay and any review of such determination by the\ncommission or its authorized designee. A renewed certificate shall remain in\neffect for 30 days, provided that in cases certified as chronic by a medical\ndoctor or qualified official of the local board of health, the renewed\ncertificate shall remain in effect for 60 days or such longer period as may be\napproved by the commission or its designee. The statement of financial hardship\nshall be completed and submitted to the distribution utility whenever a\ncertificate is renewed. (5)\n\nSpecial rule for life support systems. If\na customer or a resident of the customer's premises suffers from a medical\ncondition requiring utility service to operate a life-sustaining device, such\nas an iron lung or a dialysis machine, certification by a medical doctor or\nqualified official of a local board of health shall remain effective until\nterminated by the commission or its designee, provided the residential customer\ndemonstrates an inability to pay charges for service providing the information\nrequired by Appendix A-3, infra, or such other form approved by the commission, on not less than a quarterly basis. Every utility shall maintain a special file\non such residential customers and an appropriate identification on the meters\nof such customers for the purpose of ensuring that utility service is provided\nas long as the medical emergency and customer inability to pay continue, as\ndetermined by the commission. In addition to other applicable requirements, a\nutility shall provide 15 days' written notice to the commission before\nterminating, disconnecting or suspending service to any such\ncustomer. (6)\n\nNo utility shall\nterminate, disconnect or suspend service to a residential customer after the\nexpiration of a certification of medical emergency or after the utility\ndetermines that the customer has an ability to pay charges for service without\nfirst sending the customer a final notice of termination, disconnection or\nsuspension 15 days prior to the date of termination, disconnection or\nsuspension. (7)\n\nWhile certification\nof medical emergencies remain in effect, customers shall remain liable for\npayment of utility service and shall make reasonable efforts to pay charges for\nsuch service. The authorized designees of the commission shall be available to\noffer assistance to utilities and customers for working out equitable payment\narrangements in order to avoid substantial arrearages at the end of a medical\nemergency. (b) Customers\nwho are elderly, blind or disabled. (1)\n\nNo\nutility shall terminate, disconnect or suspend or refuse to restore service\nwhere a residential customer is known to or identified to the utility to be\nblind, disabled, or 62 years of age or older, and all the remaining residents\nof the household are 62 years of age or older, 18 years of age or under, or\nblind or disabled, without complying with the procedures specified in this\nsubdivision. A person shall be considered disabled if the person has a\ndisability, as that term is defined in the Human Rights Act (Executive Law, § 292[21]). A person shall be considered blind if the person has central\nvisual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting\nlens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such\nthat the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than\n20 degrees shall be considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or\nless. (2)\n\nIn such cases, a utility\nshall make a diligent effort to contact by telephone, or in person if telephone\ncontact is unsuccessful, an adult resident at the customer's premises at least\n72 hours prior to termination, disconnection or suspension of service for the\npurpose of devising a plan that would preclude termination, disconnection or\nsuspension and arrange for payment of bills. The plan may include a deferred\npayment agreement, and payment or a guarantee of payment by any governmental, social welfare agency or private organization. Where a utility and such\ncustomer are unable to devise a plan after such contact, the utility shall\nnotify the local department of social services of the name and address of the\ncustomer and the date of termination, disconnection or suspension in order that\nsocial services may help to develop a plan for such customers. The utility\nshall continue to provide service for not less than 15 business days from the\ntime it makes the referral, unless notified by the local department of social\nservices that acceptable payment or other arrangements have been made. In any\nsuch case, the customer may seek the assistance of the commission's authorized\ndesignees in developing such a plan. (3)\n\nIn cases where service has been\nterminated, disconnected and suspended and the utility is subsequently notified\nby the customer or a third party on his or her behalf that he or she would be\nentitled to the protections established under this subdivision, the utility\nshall within 24 hours of such notification make a diligent effort to contact by\ntelephone or in person an adult resident at the customer's premises for the\npurpose of devising a plan, as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, that would restore service and arrange for payment of bills. A utility unable\nto contact such person within 24 hours shall make reasonable effort to achieve\ncontact as soon as practicable. Where a utility and such customer are unable to\ndevise such a plan, the utility shall notify the local department of social\nservices of the name and address of the customer and the date of termination, disconnection or suspension in order that social services may help to develop a\nplan for protecting such customer. (4)\n\nIn cases where a utility has terminated, disconnected or suspended service in compliance with the provisions of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, it shall within 10 days following\ntermination, disconnection or suspension make a diligent effort to contact, by\ntelephone or in person, an adult resident at the customer's premises for the\npurpose of determining whether alternative arrangements have been made for the\nprovision of utility service and, if none have been made, attempt to devise a\nplan that would restore service and arrange for payment of bills. (c) Special procedures during cold\nweather periods. (1)\n\nEvery utility shall\ndevelop and maintain methods to identify all residential households in its\nservice territory whose utility service is heat-related. As used in this\nsubdivision, heat-related service means utility service provided under a rate\nclassification applicable to residential space heating or utility service\nnecessary to start or operate the primary heating system. Heat-related service\nshall also include a safe, supplemental electrical heating device, provided the\nresidential customer has informed the utility within the last 12 months in\nwriting that such device is needed because inadequate heat is provided by a\nthird party who controls the primary heating system. In other respects, the\nresidential households covered by this subdivision do not include the dwelling\nunits covered by sections\n33\nand\n34\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law and sections 11.7 and\n11.8\nof this Part (i.e., multiple\ndwellings and residences, and two-family houses) where payment for heat-related\nservice is not the responsibility of the residential customer. (2)\n\nDuring the period beginning November 1st\nof each year and ending April 15th of the following year, every utility shall\nobserve, at a minimum, the following procedures with respect to residential\ncustomers receiving heat-related utility service: (i) A utility shall attempt to contact, by\ntelephone or in person, the customer or an adult resident of the customer's\npremises at least 72 hours before the intended termination, disconnection or\nsuspension, for the purpose of ascertaining whether a resident is likely to\nsuffer a serious impairment to health or safety as a result of termination, disconnection or suspension. At a minimum, a utility shall attempt to make such\ncontact with the customer or other adult resident by telephone (if the customer\nhas one) once during normal business hours, and if unsuccessful, during\nreasonable nonbusiness hours (6 p.m.-9 p.m. on weekdays or 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on\n\nSaturdays and Sundays), and if both telephone contacts are unsuccessful or the\ncustomer does not have a telephone, by an onsite personal visit. At the time of\ntermination, disconnection or suspension, a utility shall also attempt to\ncontact, in person, the customer or other adult resident for the purpose of\nascertaining whether a resident is likely to suffer a serious impairment to\nhealth or safety as a result of termination, disconnection or suspension. During such contacts, the utility's representatives shall fully explain the\nreasons for termination, disconnection or suspension and provide customers with\ninformation on the protections available under this Part. If communication with\nthe person contacted is not possible because of an apparent language barrier, the utility shall take steps to assure communication before termination, disconnection or suspension. (ii)\n\nNo utility shall terminate, disconnect or suspend heat-related service for\nnonpayment where the utility ascertains that a resident is likely to suffer a\nserious impairment to human health or safety as a result of termination, disconnection or suspension, unless it has complied with subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph and: (a) the utility notifies\nthe local social services commissioner orally and within five days in writing, on forms prescribed or accepted by the commission, that a resident is likely to\nsuffer a serious impairment to health or safety as a result of termination, disconnection or suspension; and\n(b) the local social services commissioner, after an investigation, informs the utility that the reported condition is not\nlikely to result in a serious impairment to health or safety, or that an\nalternative means for protecting the person's health or safety has been\ndevised. During any such continuation of service, customers shall\nremain liable for payment of utility service and shall make reasonable efforts\nto pay charges for such service. A utility notifying the local social services\ncommission shall so inform the customer and shall explain the purpose of the\nreferral. A utility may exercise its discretion with respect to terminating, disconnecting or suspending service to the customer in the event it does not\nreceive an oral or written report from the local social services commissioner\nwithin 15 business days after the written referral of the matter by the utility\nto the commissioner. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a\nperson is likely to suffer a serious impairment to health or safety if the\nperson appears to be seriously impaired and may, because of mental or physical\nproblems, be unable to manage his or her own resources, carry out activities of\ndaily living or protect oneself from neglect or hazardous situations without\nassistance from others. Indications of serious impairments include, but are not\nlimited to: (a) age, infirmity or mental\nincapacitation; (b) use of life\nsupport systems, such as dialysis machines or iron lungs; (c) serious illness; (d) physical disability or blindness, as such\nterms are used in subdivision (b) of this section; and\n(e) any other factual circumstances which\nindicate severe or hazardous health situations. The above criteria are general standards and the utility's\nfield personnel must be trained to exercise discretion, sound judgment and\ncommon sense in ascertaining whether a serious impairment to health or safety\nis likely to result. (iv)\n\nIf a utility terminates, disconnects or\nsuspends service to a customer, and the customer or a resident 18 years or\nolder was not personally contacted by the utility before termination, disconnection or suspension of service and the customer has not contacted the\nutility for the purpose of requesting reconnection before 12 noon on the day\nfollowing termination, disconnection or suspension of service, the utility\nshall immediately attempt to determine, by onsite inspection, direct personal\ncontact at the premises with the residential customer or other adult resident, or other reasonable measures, whether there is continuing occupancy and whether\na serious impairment to health or safety is likely to result. If the utility\ndetermines that a serious impairment would result, it shall immediately restore\nservice and comply with the requirements of subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. If the utility is unable to obtain personal contact with the\ncustomer or an adult resident, and does not have reasonable grounds to believe\nthat the customer has vacated the premises, it shall immediately refer the name\nand address of the customer to the local commissioner of social services, in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (v) Every utility shall\ndesignate an employee(s) to serve as a liaison with local social services\ndepartments. (vi)\n\nEvery utility\nshall file with the commission for its review the procedures to be followed by\nthe utility's personnel in complying with these special procedures. (3)\n\nIf a utility decides to\nterminate, disconnect or suspend service to a residential customer because of a\npotential health or safety problem where the meter or service laterals have\nbeen tampered with or a theft of service has occurred, it shall determine, according to the procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2)(i) and (iii) of this\nsubdivision, whether a resident is likely to suffer a serious impairment to\nhealth or safety as a result of termination, disconnection or suspension. If\nthe utility ascertains that a resident is likely to suffer a serious\nimpairment, it shall observe the procedures set forth in subparagraphs (2)(ii)\nand (iv) of this subdivision; provided, however, that the requirement of\ncontinued service shall not apply in the event it is impractical for the\nutility to eliminate an unsafe condition. In any cases where a resident is\nlikely to suffer a serious impairment and the utility terminates, disconnects\nor suspends service to preclude the continuation of an unsafe condition, it\nshall specially notify the local social services commissioner on the same day\nservice is terminated, disconnected or suspended and request an immediate\nconsideration of the case. Comment:If a distribution utility discovers a\nmeter-tampering or theft situation and determines that a resident is likely to\nsuffer a serious impairment, it should continue service, pending review by the\nofficial or agency designated by the Social Services Law, provided that service\ncan be rendered safely. For example, if a distribution utility discovers that\nthe meter of a locked account is advancing, it should, in most circumstances, be able to continue service in a safe manner. In other theft cases, particularly those involving gas service, the need for rendering the condition\nsafe may preclude the continuation of service. For example, if a gas\ndistribution utility discovers unsafe piping, an unsafe meter bypass or\nsubstantial damage to the meter, disconnection may be the best method of\neliminating the unsafe condition. If the distribution utility cannot readily\nrepair the unsafe condition or, in the case of a gas company, cannot obtain\naccess to the pilot lights (which would have to be relit), immediate\nrestoration of service would not be practical. The distribution utility should\nspecifically note, in its referrals pursuant to Social Services Law, those\ncases where heat-related service is not restored or continued so that the\nofficial or agency designated by the Social Services Law may give immediate\nattention to them. (4)\n\nNot\nearlier than September first nor later than November first of each year, every\ndistribution utility shall conduct a survey of all former residential\ncustomers, including qualifying supplemental heating customers whose utility\nservice is heat-related and was disconnected or suspended during the 12-month\nperiod ending on November first of that year, and has not been restored, except\nfor abandoned buildings and customer-requested turnoffs. The purpose of the\nsurvey is to determine whether the former customer or other resident is likely\nto suffer a serious impairment to health or safety from a continued lack of\nservice. If the distribution utility determines that a former customer or other\nresident is likely to suffer a serious impairment, it shall restore service\nimmediately and comply with the requirements of subparagraphs (2)(ii) and (iii)\nof this subdivision, unless the customer refuses to permit service restoration\nor, in theft or tampering situations, unless it is impractical for the\ndistribution utility to eliminate an unsafe condition. If the distribution\nutility is unable to obtain personal contact with the customer or an adult\nresident, or the customer refuses service restoration, it shall immediately\nrefer the name and address of the former customer to the local commissioner of\nsocial services in accordance with the procedures set forth in subparagraph\n(2)(ii) of this subdivision, unless the distribution utility has reasonable\ngrounds to believe that the former customer has permanently vacated the\npremises. (5)\n\nSpecial rule for\ncustomers threatened by neglect or hazardous situations. During the cold\nweather period defined above, every utility shall continue utility service as\nprescribed herein to a residential customer where a serious impairment to\nhealth or safety is likely to result from termination, disconnection or\nsuspension of service and the customer is unable because of mental or physical\nproblems to manage his or her own resources or to protect himself or herself\nfrom neglect or hazardous situations without the assistance of others. Every\nutility shall provide the protections set forth in this paragraph to a\nresidential customer who is identified as likely to suffer a serious\nimpairment, as described in this subdivision, in a response to the annual\nnotification of rights required under section\n11.17\nof this Part; by a local\nsocial services office, office for the aging, board of health, or other\nresponsible agency or person; or by any utility personnel. In such situations, the utility shall transmit an oral or written notification to the local social\nservices commissioner that explains fully the nature of the serious impairment\nto health or safety, including the basis for the determination that the\ncustomer is unable to protect himself or herself from neglect or hazardous\nsituations without assistance from others. The utility shall continue service\nto such customer for a period not less than 15 business days from the date of\nthe oral or written referral, unless notified by the social services office\nthat acceptable payment or other arrangements have been made. Doubts shall be\nresolved in favor of continued service. During any such continuation of\nservice, customers shall remain liable for payment of utility service and shall\nmake reasonable efforts to pay charges for such service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
