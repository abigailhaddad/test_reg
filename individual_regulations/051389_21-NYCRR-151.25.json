  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 151.25 - Clearance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every\ncommercial float shall have a clearance. Clearances may be obtained from the\noperator of the first lock through which the float passes after taking cargo\naboard. No float may proceed beyond the place for which it has clearance or\nunload any article before its arrival there. Float operators must obtain a new\nclearance whenever property is transferred from one float to another. (b) A float operator shall display the\nclearance upon the request of any Canal Corporation employee. Unless the\nclearance has on it the signature of the issuing lock operator, the lock\noperators shall not permit the float to pass. (c) A float whose clearance is lost may be\ndetained until it is recleared or until the operator of the float has procured\na duplicate clearance from the lock where clearance is claimed to have been\nissued. (d) The Canal Corporation, or is representative, may refuse clearance for a float against whose owner\nthere is an unpaid penalty involving such float assessed under this Chapter, or\nagainst whose owner there is an unpaid bill rendered by the Canal Corporation\nfor assistance to such float, or for repairing damage to Canal Corporation\nproperty caused by such float. (e) The Canal Corporation may refuse clearance for any float, or further passage of\nany float already in the canal, when, in the opinion of a Canal Corporation\nemployee, its condition or equipment does not comply with this Chapter or its\ncrew has navigated the float in a careless, reckless or inefficient\nmanner.
