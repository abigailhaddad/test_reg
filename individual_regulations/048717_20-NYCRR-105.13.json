  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 105.13 - Change from accrual to installment method of accounting\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(a)(4)(C)\n(a) General. Where a taxpayer has changed such taxpayer's method of\naccounting from an accrual to an installment method for Federal income tax\npurposes, any installment payments actually received in the year of change or\nin subsequent taxable years (such subsequent year or years being referred to as\n\"adjustment years'), on account of sales or other disposition of property made\nin any taxable year prior to the year of the change, are required to be\nincluded in Federal adjusted gross income and consequently are included in New\n\nYork adjusted gross income. Therefore, profits attributable to installment\nsales which were taxed in the year of sale, because the taxpayer was then on\nthe accrual method of accounting, would also be taxed in the adjustment years\n(\ni.e., during the years the installments are actually received\nafter the change to the installment method of accounting). To avoid such\nduplication of New York State personal income tax, any additional New York\n\nState personal income tax for the adjustment years attributable to the receipt\nof installment payments properly accrued in a prior year must be reduced by an\namount equal to the portion of New York State personal income tax for any year\nor years preceding the year of change attributable to the prior accrual of\nincome from installment sales included in New York gross income in the\nadjustment years. (b) Reduction in New York State personal income tax for adjustment\nyear. To give effect to the foregoing, the New York State personal\nincome tax for an adjustment year must be reduced by the lower of the following\namounts: (1)\nthat proportion of the New York\n\nState personal income tax for the prior year (in which the installment sales\nwere reported on the accrual basis) which the amount of installment sales gross\nprofits reportable in the prior year of the sale and in the adjustment year\nbears to the New York adjusted gross income for such prior year of sales; or\n(2)\nthe excess, if any, of the\namount of New York State personal income tax for the adjustment year on the\nentire New York taxable income over the amount of New York State personal\nincome tax for such year computed without regard to the amount of the\ninstallment sales gross profits reported in both the prior year of accrual and\nin the adjustment year. Where previously reported installments received in an\nadjustment year include installments on sales made in more than one prior year, the reduction allowable with respect to the installments for each prior year\nmust be computed separately. In such a case, the excess New York State personal\nincome tax, calculated under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, computed with\nrespect to the installments from all prior years, must be prorated over the\nseveral prior years in proportion to the amount of the duplicated installment\nsales profits attributable to each such prior year. Example: The determination of the reduction of New York State\npersonal income tax, for a single individual, for adjustment years is\nillustrated by the following example: 1990\n1991\n1992\n\nYear 1\n\nYear 2\n\nYear 3\n(accrual\nbasis)\n(adjustment\nyear)\n(adjustment\nyear)\n\nGross profit from installment sales (receivable\nin five installments)\n50,000\n$10,000 (from year 1 sales)\n$10,000 (from year 1 sales)\n\nOther income\n50,000\n20,000\n17,000\n\nNew York adjusted gross income\n$100,000\n$ 30,000\n$ 27,000\n\nAllowable deductions\n25,000\n10,000\n15,000\n\nNew York taxable income\n$75,000\n$20,000\n$12,000\n\nNew York State personal income tax on New York\ntaxable income\n$ 5,547.50\n$1,216.25\n$ 595.00\n\nComputation of adjustment - year 2. New York State personal income tax attributable to year\n1 installment payments in year 2 (first adjustment year), the year in which the\nchange was made from the accrual basis to the installment basis: New York State personal income tax on New York\ntaxable income, including gross profit from year 1 sales\n$1,216.25\n\nNew York State personal income tax on New York\ntaxable income, excluding such gross profit: New York taxable income as\nabove\n$20,000\n\nLess gross profit from year 1 sales accrued in\nprior year\n10,000\n\nRevised New York taxable income\n$10,000\n\nNew York State personal income tax on revised New\n\nYork taxable income\n465.00\n\nAdditional New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income attributable to prior year installment payments\n($1,216.25 - $465.00)\n$751.25\n\nNew York State personal income tax on New York taxable\nincome attributable to prior inclusion in year 1: $10,000 gross profit from year 1 sales\n/\n$100,000 New York adjusted gross income\n×\n$5,547.50 New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income for year 1\n= $554.75\n\nTherefore, the New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income for year 2 (first adjustment year) may be reduced by\n$554.75, the lesser of $751.25 or $554.75. Computation of adjustment - year 3. New York State personal income tax attributable to year\n1 installment payments in year 3 (second adjustment year): New York State personal income tax on New York\ntaxable income, including gross profit from year 1 sales\n$595.00\n\nNew York State personal income tax on New York\ntaxable income, excluding such gross profit: New York taxable income, as above\n$12,000\n\nLess gross profit from year 1 sales accrued in a\nprior year\n10,000\n\nRevised New York taxable income\n$2,000\n\nNew York State personal income tax on revised New\n\nYork taxable income\n80.00\n\nAdditional New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income attributable to prior year installment payments\n($595.00 - $80.00)\n$515.00\n\nNew York State personal income tax on New York taxable\nincome attributable to prior inclusion in year 1: $10,000 gross profit from year 1 sales\n/\n$100,000 New York adjusted gross income\n×\n$5,547.50 New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income for year 1\n= $554.75\n\nTherefore, the New York State personal income tax on\n\nNew York taxable income for year 3 (second adjustment year) may be reduced by\n$515.00, the lesser of $515.00 or $554.75. (c) Change by a partnership from accrual to\ninstallment method of accounting. In the case of a change by a partnership from\nthe accrual method of accounting to the installment method, partnership income\nincludes for each adjustment year any installment payments actually received in\nsuch year, even though such amounts were included in partnership income for\nprior years under the accrual method. Each partner must determine separately\nsuch partner's distributive share of profits attributable to installment\npayments included in partnership income in the year of sale and in any\nadjustment year, and must compute such partner's New York State personal income\ntax reduction with respect thereto in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection. (d) Statement to be\nattached to New York State personal income tax return. A taxpayer who changes\nfrom the accrual method to the installment method under this section must\nattach a statement to such taxpayer's New York State personal income tax return\nfor each adjustment year. This statement must show: (1)\nthe pertinent facts as to sales in each\nyear preceding the year of change; (2)\nthe number of remaining taxable years\nover which it will be necessary to compute adjustments; and\n(3)\na schedule showing the computation, as\nprescribed in this section, of the adjustment for the taxable year.
