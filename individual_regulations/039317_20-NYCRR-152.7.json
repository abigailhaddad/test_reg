Tit. 20 § 152.7 - New York State income tax return for decedent\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 651(c)\n\nThe due date for filing a New York State income tax\nreturn for a decedent, covering the period which ended with his death, is the\nsame as if he had lived until the end of his normal taxable year. If he\nreported on a calendar-year basis and died during the taxable year, the New\n\nYork State income tax return, covering the period from January first until his\ndeath, is due on April 15th of the succeeding year, regardless of whether his\ndeath occurred early in the taxable year or on the last day of that year. Such\nreturn may be filed at any time after the appointment and qualification of the\nexecutor or administrator and without waiting for the close of the decedent's\nnormal taxable year. If a surviving husband or wife meets the provisions of\nsection\n151.11\n(b) of this Article and properly files a joint New York State personal income tax\nreturn with the deceased spouse, the due date for such joint return is the 15th\nday of the fourth month following the close of the taxable year of the\nsurviving spouse. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n152.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
