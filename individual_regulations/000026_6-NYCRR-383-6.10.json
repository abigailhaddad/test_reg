  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-6.10 - Coverage requirements for third-party compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Proposed coverage requirements. The\napplicant must submit as part of a complete permit application proposed levels\nof coverage for compensation for personal injury and property damage to third\nparties from accidents caused by the operation of the land disposal facility\nduring the operation, closure, post-closure, and institutional control periods\nof the land disposal facility. (1)\n\nThe\napplicant must provide the following documentation: (i) the methodologies employed and a detailed\nexplanation of the rationale used to select the proposed levels; (ii)\nan evaluation of the potential for costs\nof compensation to third parties for personal injury and property damage\nresulting from operation of the land disposal facility including an analysis of\nthe probability and magnitude of these costs and the likelihood of exceedence\nof the proposed costs; and\n(iii)\nevidence that the proposed levels reflect the most recent cost data available, adjusted for inflation, where appropriate. (2)\n\nThe applicant's evaluation of potential\ncosts for compensation of personal injury and property damage to third parties\nmust consider: (i) an analysis of the land\ndisposal facility location including natural site characteristics such as the\ngeologic, geotechnical, hydrologic, meteorologic, climatologic, and biotic\nfeatures of the land disposal facility location and vicinity; (ii)\nan analysis of the demographic site\ncharacteristics including population distribution, sensitive areas (including\nbut not limited to hospitals, parks, and schools), and existing and potential\nland use in the vicinity of the land disposal facility; (iii)\nthe disposal technology including the\nfinal design plans and specifications of the land disposal facility; (iv)\nthe types and concentrations of\nradionuclides and the quantities of waste, and its packaging to be located at\nthe land disposal facility; (v) an\nanalysis of probability and consequences of accidental scenarios including but\nnot limited to, explosion, fire, vehicular accidents, and processing accidents, which may result in costs of compensation to third parties for personal injury\nand/or property damage; (vi)\nan\nanalysis of major natural phenomena which may result in costs of compensation\nto third parties for personal injury and/or property damage; (vii)\nan analysis of impacts due to\ninadvertent intrusion; and\n(viii)\nthe proposed time period of operations. (3)\n\nThe applicant's evaluation of potential\ncosts for compensation of personal injury and property damage to third parties\nmust rely upon: (i) location-specific and\ndisposal technology-specific performance assessment modelling; (ii)\nlocation-specific and disposal\ntechnology-specific dose assessment modelling; (iii)\nrisk assessment of the major events or\nphenomena which may affect cost; (iv)\nan assessment of expected radiological\nexposures and doses due to potential accidents or major events or phenomena or\nwaste processing during the land disposal facility life; (v) an assessment of the potential health\neffects (including stochastic and non-stochastic effects) resulting from such\nexposures and doses which must reflect current data concerning the biological\neffects of ionizing radiation; and\n(vi)\ncomputer-based mathematical models. The\napplicant must submit detailed explanations of all calculations performed and\ndetails of all models used, including all assumptions and algorithms to the\nsatisfaction of the department. (4)\n\nThe applicant must demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the department that the coverage levels reflect due\nconsideration of: the sizes and locations of affected facilities; the nature\nand volume of the low-level radioactive waste involved; the types of facilities\nand the degrees and durations of risk to human health and the environment; and\nthe protection of public health and safety and the environment. (b) Coverage requirements during\nthe operation, closure, and post-closure periods. Every applicant or permittee\nmust establish and maintain financial assurance as required by section\n383-6.3\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart in at least the amount approved by the commissioner pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section to ensure coverage of claims for personal\ninjury and property damage to third parties from accidents caused by the\noperation of the land disposal facility during the operation, the closure, and\nthe post-closure periods of the land disposal facility. Every applicant or\npermittee must submit proof of such financial assurance to the department as\nrequired by section\n383-6.3\n(b)(3) or\n(d) of this Subpart. (c) Coverage requirements during the\ninstitutional control period. Every applicant or permittee must establish and\nmaintain financial assurance as required by section\n383-6.3\n(a)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart in at least the amount approved by the commissioner pursuant to\nsubdivision (a) of this section to ensure coverage of claims for personal\ninjury and property damage to third parties caused by the operation of the land\ndisposal facility during the institutional control period. Every applicant or\npermittee must submit proof of such financial assurance to the department as\nrequired by section\n383-6.3\n(b)(4) or\n(d) of this Subpart. (d) Requirements for reassessing degree and\nduration of risk. (1)\n\nDuring the operation, closure, and post-closure periods of the land disposal facility the permittee\nmust notify the department of any circumstances or events which may impact\nfinancial assurance coverage levels. Within thirty days of the discovery of\nsuch circumstance or occurrence of such event, the permittee must submit to the\ndepartment, in writing, an assessment and report of any changes in the degree\nand duration of risk to human health and the environment created by the\ncircumstance or event. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment may require the permittee to submit any additional information\nnecessary to determine if the amount of financial assurance required for\nthird-party compensation must be adjusted as a result of the circumstance or\nevent. (e) Adjustments\nto the coverage requirements. (1)\n\nDuring the\npre-closure period of the land disposal facility, the department may adjust the\namount of financial assurance the permittee must provide for personal injury\nand property damage to third parties caused by the operation of the land\ndisposal facility if the amount of financial assurance required by subdivision\n(a) or (b) of this section does not reflect the current degree and duration of\nrisk of personal injury and property damage presented by the land disposal\nfacility. (2)\n\nDuring the\npre-closure period, the department may adjust the amount of financial assurance\nrequired for third-party personal injury and property damage to account for\ninflation. Notes\nN.Y.
