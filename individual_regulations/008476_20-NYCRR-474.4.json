  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 474.4 - Permanent permit, plate and sticker\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The highway use permit and plate, or\nomnibus fuel use tax permit and sticker, designed for the purpose of\nidentifying vehicles subject to the truck mileage tax or fuel use tax of the\nhighway use tax and to assist in the enforcement thereof, are merely aids in\nthe administration of the truck mileage tax and fuel use tax imposed by article\n21 of the Tax Law. (b) A\ndistinction must be made between such permit and plate which are issued by the\n\nState Tax Commission and motor vehicle registrations and number plates issued\nby the Department of Motor Vehicles. The latter are valid only for a particular\nyear and are required to be renewed annually. The highway use permit and plate\nare not required to be renewed each year but are valid until revoked, suspended, cancelled, surrendered or superseded by a replacement series of\nhighway use permits and plates. The fee for registration of a motor vehicle\nunder the Vehicle and Traffic Law varies according to the weight of the vehicle\nand applies to all motor vehicles, regardless of weight. The highway use permit\nand plate are issued for a flat fee for all motor vehicles, as defined in the\nstatute (see section\n470.2\nof this Title). The amount of such fee does not depend upon the weight of the\nparticular vehicle. A registration and number plate for a motor vehicle can be\ntransferred from one vehicle to another when the owner disposes of the first\nvehicle, while the highway use permit and plate are not transferable under any\ncircumstances. The registration and number plates for motor vehicles issued by\nthe Department of Motor Vehicles can be suspended or revoked for violations of\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law. The highway use permit and plate cannot be revoked\nfor violations of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, although they can be revoked for\nviolations of article 21 of the Tax Law or regulations promulgated\nthereunder. (c) The permit being an\nadjunct of the tax will not in any way affect reciprocity of motor vehicle\nregistrations in the several states. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n474.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
