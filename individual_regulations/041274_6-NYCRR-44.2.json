  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 44.2 - Crabs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions\n(1)\nA crab pot or trap means a box-like\ndevice, made of any material, which is usually square or pyramid shaped either\nwith sides that fall open to provide ingress, or with sides with openings to\nthe lower of two inner chambers, the upper being reached through a slotted\nbaffle, or, if having only one chamber, sides with openings to that\nchamber. (2)\n\nSinking line means\nnegatively buoyant line which will sink to the bottom of the water column if\nnot supported by a buoy. Braided steel cable shall not be used as sinking\nline. (3)\n'Terrapin Excluder Device'\nmeans a rectangular device not larger than (in either dimension) four and\nthree-quarters inches wide by one and three-quarters inches high attached to\nthe end of the entrance funnel of a crab trap. (4)\n\nCarapace width means the longest straight\nline width of the body shell, including any spines, or spikes, but not\nincluding claws, legs or other appendages. (5)\n'Claw length' is measured along the\nbottom of the claw, from the joint to the lower tip of the claw. (6)\n\nPeeler or shedder blue crab means a hard\nblue crab which has a fully formed soft shell beneath the hard outer shell and\nthe impending shedding process is evidenced by the white sign along the outer\nrim of the paddle-like appendages on the crab's fifth pair of legs. (7)\n'Bycatch' means any incidental harvest of\nnontargeted or otherwise protected species in the course of legal fishing\nactivity. (8)\n'Target species' means\nthose species that are the main subject of fishing effort in a\nfishery. (b) Identification of gear used in taking of crabs. Gear used in taking crabs shall\nbe identified as follows: (1)\n\nIf crab pots or\ntraps are marked on the surface of the water, they shall have attached to them\na floating buoy or identification marker using sinking line as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. Braided steel cable shall not be used as\nsinking line. The floating buoy or identification marker must be constructed\nand placed so as to be clearly visible on the surface of the water. Containers, bottles or jugs originally designed to contain liquids shall not be used as\nbuoys or markers to identify the location of crabs pots or traps. (2)\n\nEach buoy or marker attached to a crab\npot or trap shall be of a distinctive color contrasting sufficiently with the\nbackground water color to be visible in daylight for a minimum distance of 100\nfeet. The number, including any letters, assigned the holder of a crab permit\nfor the current year at the time he or she obtains a crab permit shall be\npainted or otherwise affixed on each buoy or marker in a contrasting color, or\nbranded on each buoy or marker, in clearly visible characters. The same color\nor combination of colors shall be used on all buoys or markers bearing the same\npermit number. In addition, all crab pot buoys shall be marked with fluorescent\nor reflective paint, tape, or other reflective material or\nreflectors. (3)\n\nAll crab pots or\ntraps shall be marked or branded, in characters not less than three- fourths\ninch in height with the number, including any letters, assigned the holder of a\ncrab permit for the current year at the time he or she obtains a crab permit. If the construction of a pot or trap does not allow it to be marked by\nbranding, that pot or trap shall be marked by a tag or other device bearing, in\nclearly visible and legible characters, the same number appearing on a buoy or\nmarker used to identify that pot or trap. This tag or other device shall be of\na material that is not deteriorated by sea water and shall be firmly attached\nto the pot or trap it identifies. (4)\n\nCrab pots shall not be placed within 25\nfeet of designated navigation channels, and all floating buoys or\nidentification markers and lines attached to such pots shall remain outside\ndesignated navigation channels at all times, except that: (i) crab pots which are directly attached to\nthe shoreline or a bulkhead may be placed within 25 feet of a designated\nnavigation channel provided that neither the pot nor any attached lines or\nmarkers are within such channel; and\n(ii)\ncrab pots or traps that are affixed to a\nvessel with at least one person aboard may be placed within 25 feet of a\ndesignated navigation channel. (5)\n\nViolations of any provision of this Part\nshall subject the violator to the penalties fixed by the Environmental\n\nConservation Law and may result in the suspension or revocation of any crab\npermit. (c) Construction\nof escape panels in crab pots or traps. (1)\n\nCrab pots or traps made of any material other than untreated natural wood shall\ncontain on a side of the pot, but not the bottom, an escape panel, which when\nopen, will provide an unobstructed oval or rectangular opening of not less than\nsix by four inches in length and height. If this panel is constructed of wood, it shall be untreated natural wood not more than three-eighths of an inch\nthick. If the panel is constructed of any material other than untreated natural\nwood, it shall be hinged to open. The panel shall be hinged in such a manner\nthat upon degradation of the material keeping the panel closed, the panel is\nreleased to produce an opening which is not blocked or otherwise obstructed by\nthe panel material. Hinged panels shall be held in the closed position with\neither untreated, uncoated ferrous wire not more than three thirty-seconds of\nan inch in diameter or an untreated natural fiber such as cotton, sisal, hemp\nor manila not more than three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter. The door or\nthe side panel (which makes up the door) may serve as the escape panel if the\ndoor or side panel (which makes up the door), including any latching mechanism\nfor the door, is fastened to the pot with the degradable materials listed\nabove. At least three sides of the door or side panel must be unattached when\nthe material degrades. If the pot or trap is constructed of nylon, polypropylene, or any other synthetic fiber mesh netting placed over the frame, the escape panel may be made by having a section of the mesh netting on the\noutside of the parlor section comprised of an untreated natural fiber which\nwhen rotten out or deteriorated will leave an opening of at least the size\nspecified for an escape panel in this subdivision. (2)\n\nNo person shall set or place a crab pot\nor trap in the water of the State unless such pot or trap is equipped with an\nescape panel of the minimum size specified in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, except that no escape panel shall be required for crab pots or\ntraps with sides that fall open to provide ingress. (d) (1)\nA\nterrapin excluder device, as defined in paragraph 44.2(a) (3) of this section, must be used on all non-collapsible, Chesapeake-style crab pots or traps that\nare fished in the areas detailed below: (i) within the bays, harbors, coves, rivers, tributaries and creeks that enter into\n\nLong Island Sound; (ii)\nwithin the\nharbors, coves, ponds, rivers, and creeks that enter into Flanders Bay, Great\n\nPeconic Bay, Cutchogue Harbor, Little Peconic Bay, Hog Neck Bay, Noyack Bay, Southold Bay, Shelter Island Sound, Pipes Cove, Greenport Harbor, Orient\n\nHarbor, Hallock Bay, Northwest Harbor, Gardiners Bay, Napeague Bay and Fort\n\nPond Bay; (iii)\nwithin the rivers, tributaries, creeks and basins that enter into Jamaica Bay, Hempstead Bay, South Oyster Bay, Great South Bay, Moriches Bay and Shinnecock Bay on the south\nshore of Long Island; (iv)\nwithin\nthe creeks and tributaries that enter into Raritan Bay, Arthur Kill and Kill\n\nVan Kull surrounding Staten Island; and\n(v) within the tributaries and creeks of the\n\nHudson River that lie within the marine and coastal district, as defined in\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law 13-0103, including the waterways within Piermont\nmarsh. 6 NYCRR\n44.2\n(d)(2) and (3) are amended to read as\nfollows: (2)\n\nThe terrapin\nexcluder device, as defined in paragraph 44.2(a) (3) of this section, shall be\nsecurely fastened inside each funnel to effectively reduce the size of the\nfunnel opening to no larger than four and three-quarters inches wide and one\nand three-quarters inches high. (3)\n\nIf the department determines that mortality of diamondback terrapin\n('Malaclemys terrapin') in blue crab pots is causing a decline in the terrapin\npopulation of a given water body or area that is not listed in paragraph (d)\n(1) of this Section, the department may by order mandate use of terrapin\nexcluder devices in such areas. The Director, Division of Marine Resources, is\nauthorized to issue orders to designate areas in which terrapin excluders are\nrequired pursuant to this section. (e) Size limits. (1)\n\nBlue crab size limits. No person shall possess or land any blue crab ('Callinectes\nsapidus') with a carapace width less than four and one half inches in length\nfor hard shell blue crabs, three and one half inches in length for soft shall\nblue crabs, and three inches in length for peeler or shedder blue\ncrabs. (2)\n\nJonah crab size\nlimits: No person shall possess or land any whole Jonah crab\n('Cancer borealis') with a carapace width less than four and three quarters\ninches in length. (f) Jonah Crab. (1)\n\nDirected trap fishery. (i) To participate in the Jonah Crab fishery, an individual must either: ('a')\n\nHold a\ncurrent commercial lobster permit with trap tag allocations; or\n('b')\n\nHold a current commercial crab permit\nand prove prior participation in the Jonah Crab fishery before June 2, 2015. ('1')\n\nSubmission of state and/or federal\nvessel trip reports which include Jonah Crab landings prior to the control date\nof June 2, 2015 constitute proof of prior participation in the Jonah Crab\nfishery. ('2')\n\nThose who qualify\nunder the above provision are eligible to receive a 50-trap tag allocation to\nparticipate in the directed Jonah Crab fishery. (ii)\n\nAll traps must conform to specifications\nof the lobster management plan, including the trap tag and escape vent\nrequirements at Part 44.1 of this Title. (2)\n\nBycatch limits. (i) Any person landing Jonah Crab who does\nnot qualify to participate in the directed Jonah Crab fishery pursuant to\n(f)(1), must hold a commercial crab permit and abide by the following bycatch\nlimits. (ii)\n\nThere must be fewer\npounds of Jonah Crab onboard the fishing vessel at all times during a fishing\ntrip than the pounds of the target species the deployed gear is\ntargeting. (iii)\n\nThere is a\n1,000-crab incidental bycatch limit for vessels fishing non-trap gear and\nnon-lobster traps (including but not limited to, fish pots, whelk pots, and\ncrab pots). The 1,000-crab limit applies to trips of any\nlength. (3)\n\nClaw harvest. Permit holders may possess or land whole Jonah Crabs or\nmay remove claws at sea, keeping the claw and returning the crab to the water. If the permit holder is taking more than a five-gallon bucket full of claws, each claw must measure at least two and three-quarters inches long. Claw length\nis measured along the bottom of the claw, from the joint to the lower tip of\nthe claw. Only whole Jonah Crab may be possessed or landed\nrecreationally. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
