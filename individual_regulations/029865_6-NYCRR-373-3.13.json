  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.13 - Land treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that treat or dispose of hazardous waste in land\ntreatment units, except as section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) General operating\nrequirements. (1)\n\nHazardous waste must\nnot be placed in or on a land treatment facility unless the waste can be made\nnonhazardous by biological degradation or chemical reactions occurring in or on\nthe soil. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust design, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of\npreventing flow onto the active portions of the facility during peak discharge\nfrom at least a 25-year storm. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain a runoff\nmanagement system capable of collecting and controlling a water volume at least\nequivalent to a 24-hour, 25-year storm. (4)\n\nCollection and holding facilities\n(\ne.g., tanks or basins) associated with run-on and runoff\ncontrol systems must be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously after storms\nto maintain the design capacity of the system. (5)\n\nIf the treatment zone contains\nparticulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the owner or\noperator must manage the unit to control wind dispersal. (c) Waste analysis. In addition to the waste analyses required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, before placing a hazardous waste in or on a land treatment facility, the owner or operator must: (1)\ndetermine the concentrations in the waste of any substances which equal or\nexceed the maximum concentrations contained in Table 1 of section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle that cause a waste to exhibit the toxicity characteristic; (2)\nfor any waste listed in section\n371.4\nof this Title, determine the\nconcentrations of any substances which caused the waste to be listed as a\nhazardous waste; and\n(3)\nif\nfood-chain crops are grown, determine the concentrations in the waste of each\nof the following constituents-arsenic, cadmium, lead and mercury-unless the\nowner or operator has written, documented data that show that the constituent\nis not present. Note: Part 371 of this Title specifies the substances for which\na waste is listed as a hazardous waste. As required by subdivision\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the waste analysis plan must include analyses needed to comply with\nsubdivisions (h) and (i) of this section. As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must place the results from each waste analysis, or the documented information, in the operating record of the\nfacility. (d) Food-chain crops and agricultural land. (1)\n\nNo land treatment facility shall be\nlocated on agricultural soil groups 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Land Classification System, as certified by the commissioner of the Department of Agriculture and\n\nMarkets). (2)\n\nNo food-chain crops\nmay be grown on any facility that is or has been used as a land treatment\nfacility for hazardous wastes. (3)\n\nAny person receiving a permit to operate a land treatment facility for\nhazardous waste shall, as a condition of such permit, place or cause to be\nplaced a restrictive covenant, which shall run with the land in the deed or\ndeeds to all real property subject to the permit, which prohibits the use of\nsuch real property for the growing of food chain crops. (e) Unsaturated zone (zone of aeration)\nmonitoring. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust have in writing, and must implement, an unsaturated zone monitoring plan\nwhich is designed to: (i) detect the vertical\nmigration of hazardous waste and hazardous waste constituents under the active\nportion of the land treatment facility; and\n(ii)\nprovide information on the background\nconcentrations of the hazardous waste and hazardous waste constituents in\nsimilar but untreated soils nearby; this background monitoring must be\nconducted before or in conjunction with the monitoring required under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nThe unsaturated zone monitoring plan must\ninclude, at a minimum: (i) soil monitoring\nusing soil cores; and\n(ii)\nsoil-pore water monitoring using devices such as lysimeters. (3)\n\nTo comply with subparagraph\n(1)(i) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must demonstrate, in the\nunsaturated zone monitoring plan, that: (i) the depth at which soil and soil-pore water samples are to be taken is below\nthe depth to which the waste is incorporated into the soil; (ii)\nthe number of soil and soil-pore water\nsamples to be taken is based on the variability of: (a) the hazardous waste constituents (as\nidentified in paragraphs [c][1] and [2] of this section) in the waste and in\nthe soil; and\n(b) the soil type(s); and\n(iii)\nthe frequency\nand timing of soil and soil-pore water sampling is based on the frequency, time\nand rate of waste application, proximity to ground water and soil\npermeability. (4)\n\nThe\nowner or operator must keep at the facility the unsaturated zone monitoring\nplan, and the rationale used in developing this plan. (5)\n\nThe owner or operator must analyze the\nsoil and soil-pore water samples for the hazardous waste constituents that were\nfound in the waste during the waste analysis under paragraphs (c)(1) and (2) of\nthis section. Note: As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, all data and information developed by the owner or operator under this\nsection must be placed in the operating record of the\nfacility. (f) Recordkeeping. The owner or operator must include hazardous waste\napplication dates and rates in the operating record required under section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (g) Closure\nand post-closure. (1)\n\nIn the closure\nplan under section\n373-3.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart and the post-closure plan under section\n373-3.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must address the following objectives and\nindicate how they will be achieved: (i) control of the migration of hazardous waste and hazardous waste constituents\nfrom the treated area into the ground water; (ii)\ncontrol of the release of contaminated\nrunoff from the facility into surface water; (iii)\ncontrol of the release of airborne\nparticulate contaminants caused by wind erosion; and\n(iv)\ncompliance with subdivision (d) of this\nsection concerning the growth of food-chain crops. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must consider at\nleast the following factors in addressing the closure and post-closure care\nobjectives of paragraph (1) of this subdivision: (i) type and amount of hazardous waste and\nhazardous waste constituents applied to the land treatment facility; (ii)\nthe mobility and the expected rate of\nmigration of the hazardous waste and hazardous waste constituents; (iii)\nsite location, topography, and\nsurrounding land use with respect to the potential effects of pollutant\nmigration (\ne.g., proximity to ground water, surface water and\ndrinking water sources); (iv)\nclimate, including amount, frequency and pH of precipitation; (v) geological and soil profiles and surface\nand subsurface hydrology of the site, and soil characteristics, including\ncation exchange capacity, total organic carbon, and pH; (vi)\nunsaturated zone monitoring information\nobtained under subdivision (e) of this section; and\n(vii)\ntype, concentration and depth of\nmigration of hazardous waste constituents in the soil as compared to their\nbackground concentrations. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator must consider at\nleast the following methods in addressing the closure and post-closure care\nobjectives of paragraph (1) of this subdivision: (i) removal of contaminated soils; (ii)\nplacement of a final cover, considering: (a) functions of the cover\n(\ne.g., infiltration control, erosion and runoff control, and\nwind erosion control); and\n(b) characteristics of the cover, including material, final surface contours, thickness, porosity and permeability, slope, length of run of slope, and type\nof vegetation on the cover; and\n(iii)\nmonitoring of ground water. (4)\n\nIn addition to the\nrequirements of section\n373-3.7\nof this Subpart, during the\nclosure period the owner or operator of a land treatment facility must: (i) continue unsaturated zone monitoring in a\nmanner and frequency specified in the closure plan, except that soil-pore\nliquid monitoring may be terminated 90 days after the last application of waste\nto the treatment zone; (ii)\nmaintain the run-on control system required under paragraph (b)(2) of this\nsection; (iii)\nmaintain the runoff\nmanagement system required under paragraph (b)(3) of this section; and\n(iv)\ncontrol wind dispersal of\nparticulate matter which may be subject to wind dispersal. (5)\n\nFor the purpose of complying with section\n373-3.7\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart, when closure is completed, the owner or operator may submit to the\ncommissioner certification, both by the owner or operator and by an independent\nqualified soil scientist, in lieu of an independent registered professional\nengineer, that the facility has been closed in accordance with the\nspecifications in the approved closure plan. (6)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of\nsection\n373-3.7\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart, during the post- closure care period the owner or operator of a land\ntreatment unit must: (i) continue soil-pore\nmonitoring by collecting and analyzing samples in a manner and frequency\nspecified in the post-closure plan; (ii)\nrestrict access to the unit as\nappropriate for its post-closure use; (iii)\nassure that growth of food-chain crops\ncomplies with subdivision (d) of this section; and\n(iv)\ncontrol wind dispersal of hazardous\nwaste. (h) Special requirements for ignitable or reactive waste. Ignitable or reactive waste must not be land-treated\nunless the waste and treatment zone meet all applicable requirements of Part\n376 of this Title, and: (1)\nthe waste\nis immediately incorporated into the soil so that: (i) the resulting waste, mixture or\ndissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive\nwaste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(2)\nthe waste is managed in such a way that\nit is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or\nreact. (i) Special\nrequirements for incompatible wastes. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and materials\n(see Appendix 29, of this Title for examples), must not be placed in the same\nland treatment area, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with.
