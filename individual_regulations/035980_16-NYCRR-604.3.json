  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 604.3 - New construction of underground facilities in residential subdivisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part\napplies to the new construction of distribution and feeder facilities within\nresidential subdivisions. Nothing in this Part shall be construed to compromise\nthe ability of a state or local agency to require underground facilities in the\nexercise of its land use or environmental protection authority. (b) Any distribution or feeder facility\nnecessary to furnish permanent telephone service to one or more multiple\noccupancy buildings (including four or more dwelling units) shall be installed\nunderground and any such facility necessary to furnish permanent telephone\nservice within a subdivision in which it is planned to build five or more new\nresidential buildings shall be installed underground if: (1)\nthe subdivision will require no more than\n200 trench feet of facilities per dwelling unit planned within the subdivision; or\n(2)\na utility's tariff provides\nfor such underground service without contribution; or\n(3)\na governmental authority with\njurisdiction to do so has required undergrounding; or\n(4)\nan applicant requests undergrounding. Note:The number of dwelling units is the criterion to be\nused to determine whether installation is required to be underground. In order\nto ascertain the number of dwelling units, it is necessary to consult the\napproved subdivision map to determine how many dwelling units are planned. Each\nlot shown on the map should, in the case of a single family dwelling, be\nconsidered to contain one dwelling unit unless there is sufficient contrary\nevidence to render it unlikely that each lot will contain a separate dwelling\nunit (e.g., a foundation is constructed occupying two lots). The measurement of\ntrench footage should be the shortest distance required to serve the homes\nwithin the subdivision, consistent with the utility's obligation to provide\nsafe and adequate service. (c) Upon receipt of a proper application, the\nutility shall inform the electric company and cable television company serving\nthe area in which the residential subdivision is located of the receipt of such\napplication. Upon compliance by the applicant with the requirements of this\n\nPart, the utility shall install underground telephone distribution facilities\nwith sufficient capacity and suitable material which, in its judgment, will\nassure that the applicant will receive safe and adequate telephone service. Such installation shall be undertaken by the utility as soon as is reasonably\npossible after receipt of a proper application and shall be made at a time\nappropriate to render service. Construction will not be delayed by the utility\nso that the applicant will be delayed in the sale or other disposal of the\nbuildings, or lots, except where such delay is caused by strikes, fire, flood, inclement weather, unavailability of materials, civil disorders, or other\nconditions beyond the control of the utility. (d) After distribution or feeder facilities\nare installed underground in a residential subdivision no overhead circuits\nshall be installed by a utility within such subdivision. (e) The utility's tariff must permit the\napplicant at least to excavate the trench necessary for the underground\ninstallation of distribution or feeder facilities within the subdivision, at\nthe applicant's cost and to the utility's specifications. (f) A utility may install overhead\ndistribution or feeder facilities in a residential subdivision or a section\nthereof otherwise required to have underground distribution facilities in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section when: (1)\nthe developer of the subdivision is not\nprimarily engaged in the construction of dwelling units within the\nsubdivision; (2)\nno governmental\nauthority having jurisdiction to do so has required underground installation; and\n(3)\neither: (i) five years have elapsed from the sale of\nthe first lot within the subdivision to the first application for service and\nthe utility has no indication that there will be other new requests for service\nin the subdivision within six months; (ii)\nfive years have elapsed from the date of\nfinal approval of the subdivision or section thereof, and less than 25 percent\nof the lots have been sold in the subdivision and every section thereof, except\nwhere 10 percent or more of the lots in the subdivision or any section thereof\nhave been sold within the last two years; In cases where overhead installation would be permissible\nin accordance with condition (3) (paragraph [3] of this subdivision) except\nthat less than five years have elapsed and the utility has reason to believe\nthat the subdivision will not be developed sufficiently soon to permit the\norderly utilization of underground facilities installed to serve the initial\nsubscriber(s), the utility may petition the commission to allow overhead\ninstallation, which petition shall set forth the relevant economic, engineering\nand environmental factors. Note:The term final approval refers to authorization of a\nresidential subdivision by governmental authorities having jurisdiction. A\nresidential subdivision is finally approved when all necessary governmental\nconsents have been obtained to allow the developer of the subdivision to sell\nlots and/or build residences. If a subdivision needs only be approved by a\ncounty health department the final approval of that agency, in accordance with\nits regulations, when received is final. If the town planning board must give\nits consent as well, final approval is not obtained until the board and the\nhealth department have completed their processes of authorization. A section of\na subdivision is the smallest unit of a subdivision given final governmental\napproval. If, for example, the developer of a subdivision submits a preliminary\nplan covering 100 lots but initially only 50 are finally approved, the 50 lot\nportion is a section of the subdivision. If the subdivision contains sections, the percentage of lot sales required by condition (3) must be met by every\nsection of the subdivision and not just the section in which the distribution\nfacilities are to be installed. (g) If a utility receives an application for\nservice within a residential subdivision which is governed by the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section and the per-foot cost of installing the\nnecessary distribution or feeder facilities will be greater than two times the\ncost per foot of installing overhead distribution or feeder facilities, the\nutility or applicant may petition the secretary of the commission to allow\noverhead installation. Such petition shall be filed in accordance with the\nrequirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title and set forth\nthe relevant economic, engineering and environmental factors. The petition\nshall be reviewed by staff. The secretary shall notify the petitioner within 60\ndays of receipt of the petition either that the petition is granted or that\nstaff objects to it. If staff objects, the petition shall be referred to the\ncommission for further review. The petition shall be granted or denied based on\neconomic, engineering or environmental factors. If the residential subdivision\nis located within the Adirondack Park, the utility shall send a copy of the\npetition to the Adirondack Park Agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
