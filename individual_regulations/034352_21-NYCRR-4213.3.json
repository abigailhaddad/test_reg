  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4213.3 - Eligible and ineligible enterprises\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To be eligible for assistance from the\nloan fund, an enterprise must be organized on a for-profit basis, must be\nformally authorized to do business in the State, must operate out of a fixed\nbusiness location and must not be operated on an avocational or part-time\nbasis. In addition, to be eligible for assistance from the loan fund, an\nenterprise must have received certification. (1)\n\nWith respect to program assistance other\nthan a government contractor loan, government-sponsored residential\nconstruction loan and loan guarantees for either of these two types of loans, certification must be obtained through the New York State Minority- and\n\nWomen-Owned Business Enterprise Certification Program; provided, however, that\nthis requirement shall be deemed to have been met if the enterprise has had its\napplication for certification rejected by the certifying agency through its\nduly authorized representative on the ground that such enterprise is a start-up\nbusiness and is ineligible for certification until such time as it can document\nbusiness activity and operational control as a minority-owned business\nenterprise or as a women-owned business enterprise as evidenced by the written\ndetermination of the Director of the Governor's Office of Minority and Women's\n\nBusiness Development. Denial of certification on any other ground will make an\napplicant ineligible for program assistance. The corporation shall refer to a\ndetermination that certification is rejected on the ground that a start-up\nbusiness enterprise cannot document business activity and operational control\nas a minority-owned business enterprise or women-owned business enterprise in\nany materials submitted to the president and chief executive officer and/or\ndirectors of the corporation in connection with any request for approval of the\nproposed assistance as a \"postponement of certification determination.\" In any\nsuch instance where financial assistance is approved and certification is\nrejected on the ground that the start-up enterprise cannot document business\nactivity and operational control as an minority-owned business enterprise or\nwomen-owned business enterprise, the corporation will require a completed\napplication for certification to be submitted to the Governor's Office of\n\nMinority and Women's Business Development within one year from the date on\nwhich the corporation makes its first disbursement of funds in connection with\nthe project. The failure to so submit an application for certification, the\nrejection of such application, or denial of certification and the failure of\nthe enterprise to appeal successfully the denial decision in the manner\nauthorized pursuant to the New York State Minority- and Women-Owned Business\n\nCertification Guidelines, shall constitute a default by the enterprise. Such\ndefault shall release the corporation from all obligations with respect to its\nassistance under the program and all amounts disbursed or otherwise paid out or\ndeposited by the corporation in connection with any financial assistance under\nthe program shall become immediately due and payable to the\ncorporation. (2)\n\nWith respect to\nprogram assistance in the form of a government contractor loan, government-sponsored residential construction loan and loan guarantees for\neither of these two types of loan, certification may be obtained through any\nauthorized certification program administered by a public entity within the\n\nState, provided that at the time of application for program assistance the\nbusiness enterprise has applied for certification through the New York State\n\nMinority- and Women-Owned Business Enterprise Certification Program. In\naddition, a recipient of program assistance in the form of a government\ncontractor loan, government-sponsored residential construction loan or loan\nguarantee for either of these two types of loans must diligently pursue\ncertification through the New York State Minority- and Women-Owned Business\n\nEnterprise Certification Program, as set forth in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, and must ultimately receive such certification as set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (b) The following enterprises are ineligible\nfor assistance from the loan fund: (1)\neducational institutions; and\n(2)\nhospitals or residential health care facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
