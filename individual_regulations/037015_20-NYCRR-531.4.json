  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 531.4 - Property used outside of State prior to use in New York\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule. When tangible personal\nproperty is purchased outside of the State by a resident of the State, for use\noutside of the State, and is subsequently used in the State, the compensating\nuse tax is due on the purchase price. Cross reference:Definition of resident, see section\n526.15\nof\nthis Title. (b) Use outside\nthe State in excess of six months. Where a resident affirmatively shows that he\nused such property outside the State for more than six months prior to its\nfirst use in New York, the use tax is based on the current market value of the\nproperty, not to exceed its cost, at the time of first use within New York. Example:A New York State resident, absent from the State\nfor an extended period, purchased a boat outside of this State for $2,000 on\n\nNovember 1, 1974. On August 1, 1975, the resident brought the boat, having a\nfair market value of $1,500, into New York State. The resident is liable for\nthe combined State and local tax on the $1,500 at the rate in effect on August\n1, 1975. (c) Use of\nproperty in performing a contract. (1)\n\nTangible personal property brought into New York State for use in the\nperformance of a contract or subcontract within this State is subject to the\ncompensating use tax based on the purchase price of such property. (2)\n\nWhere the tangible personal property\nbrought into the State will be used for a period of less than six months, the\nuser, at his option may elect to pay the compensating use tax based on the fair\nrental value of the property for the period of use within New York. This\ntreatment is not applicable to tangible personal property completely consumed, or incorporated into real property located in the State. Example:A contractor performing a construction contract in\n\nNew York State purchases a crane for $100,000 outside the State and brings it\ninto this State for temporary (less than six months) use in the contract work. The crane has a fair rental value of $2,500 per month. The contractor is liable\nfor the compensating use tax on the $100,000 purchase price unless he elects to\nreport such tax based on the fair rental value of $2,500 per\nmonth. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n531.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
