(2)\n\nThe\ncapital base is the portion of the corporation's total business capital\napportioned to New York State. (3)\n\nTo compute the tax measured by the capital base, the corporation must multiply\nits capital base by the tax rate specified in section 210(1)(b). (b) (1)\n\nWhere a group of corporations file a\ncombined report, the combined capital base is the measure of the tax if such\ncalculation results in an amount of tax greater than or equal to the combined\nbusiness income base tax and greater than the fixed dollar minimum tax that is\nattributable to the designated agent of the combined group. (2)\n\nThe combined capital base is the combined\ntotal business capital apportioned to New York State. (3)\n\nTo compute the tax measured by the\ncombined capital base, the combined capital base is multiplied by the tax rate\nspecified in section 210(1)(b). (c) The capital base tax does not apply to: (1)\na non-captive RIC; (2)\na non-captive REIT; (3)\nthe first two taxable years of a taxpayer\nthat, for one or both such years, is a small business taxpayer; (4)\na New York S corporation.
