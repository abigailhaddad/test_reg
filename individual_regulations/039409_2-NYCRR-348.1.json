  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 348.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 710 of\nthe Laws of 1989 amended sections\n90\nand\n390\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. As so amended, these sections provide that disability retirement shall\nbecome effective on the day before death where: (1)\nthe member applied for ordinary\ndisability retirement under section\n62\nor\n362\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, accidental disability retirement under section 63 or 363, State Police\ndisability retirement under section 363-b or performance of duty disability\nretirement under section 363-c; and\n(2)\nthe member filed an option election prior\nto death; and\n(3)\nthe member died\nat any time thereafter as the natural and proximate result of the disability\nalleged on the application. Chapter 710 is retroactive so as to apply to otherwise\neligible members who died on or after August 7, 1987. However, under prior law, ordinary death benefits, rather than post-death retirement benefits under a\nretirement option, would have been payable on account of the death of\nindividuals covered by Chapter 710. (b) Under Chapter 710, optional benefits are\nnot payable on account of the death of individuals who died between August 7, 1987 and the July 24, 1989 effective date of Chapter 710, where the\nbeneficiary(ies) are not the same as the beneficiary(ies) of ordinary death\nbenefits which were payable under prior law. The other instances where Chapter\n710 will not be applied retroactively are where retroactive application would\nreduce the amounts payable to the same beneficiary on account of the death of a\nmember. Retroactive application of Chapter 710 under these circumstances would\nbe violative of the State Constitution's prohibition against diminution of\nrights and benefits in a public retirement system. Accordingly, this part is\npromulgated to provide guidelines for the administration of Chapter 710, with\nemphasis on retroactive application. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n348.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
