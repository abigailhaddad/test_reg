(3)\n\nIn the event a student, who would otherwise be entitled to a tuition assistance\nprogram (TAP) award or a supplemental tuition assistance program (STAP) award, does not receive payment of such award due to receipt of educational aid\nconsidered to duplicate the purpose of such award pursuant to section\n145-2.13\nof this Title, such a\nstudent shall not be considered ineligible for a Liberty Scholarship due to the\nprovisions of subparagraph (1)(v) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nIn the event a student, who is entitled\nto a Pell grant award pursuant to section\n1070-a\nof title 20 of the United\n\nStates Code, does not receive payment of such award due to a linear reduction\nof such awards pursuant to paragraph (g) of section 1070-a of the United States\n\nCode, such a student shall not be considered ineligible for a Liberty\n\nScholarship due to the provisions of subparagraphs (1)(v) or (vi) of this\nsubdivision. (b) Amount. Liberty scholarships shall be granted by the president in amounts determined\npursuant to section 610.6 of the Education Law. For purposes of said section, adjusted gross income shall mean federal adjusted gross income as defined in\nsection\n62\nof the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (f) of section\n2200.2\nof this Title, nontuition\ncost of attendance shall be determined solely as prescribed by section\n610.6(a)(4) of the Education Law. Any state or federal scholarship or grant, receipt of which is conditioned upon the student agreeing to perform services\nafter graduation, shall not be considered as requiring repayment pursuant to\nsection 610.6(a) of the Education Law, and shall therefore reduce a student's\nnontuition cost of attendance pursuant to such section. (c) Payment. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nsubdivision (a) of section\n2203.1\nof this Title, the period of\navailability of Liberty Scholarships shall commence with the academic year\nbeginning after the twenty fourth month following the date a student graduates\nfrom secondary school or receives a high school equivalency diploma, or the\nacademic year in which a student first receives payment of a Liberty\n\nScholarship, or the academic year beginning after the student attains the age\nof 22, whichever is first. Such period shall be seven years if a recipient\nreceives payment solely for full-time study, eight years if a recipient\nreceives any payments for part-time study, or ten years if a recipient receives\npayment solely for part-time study in a program normally requiring five years\napproved by the commissioner pursuant to section\n145-2.7\nof the Title. Nothing\nherein shall grant eligibility to students who would otherwise be ineligible\ndue to their having attained the age of 22 as of June 30th prior to the\nacademic year for which an initial award is requested or their having failed to\nenroll in an approved program as defined in section\n601.4\nof the Education Law in a\ndegree-granting institution located in New York State within 24 months of the\ndate that student graduated from secondary school or received a high school\nequivalency diploma. (2)\n\nPrior to\nthe receipt of the first payment of an award, the corporation may grant a leave\nof absence to students who are otherwise eligible but temporarily unable to\navail themselves of a Liberty Scholarship at the time such scholarship is first\navailable, due to causes established in accordance with rules of the Board of\n\nRegents. All such students shall make application for a leave of absence, in\nsuch form as the President shall establish, within 24 months from the date they\nshall have graduated from secondary school or received a high school\nequivalency diploma. The President may, however, for good cause shown, accept a\nlate filing of such application. Such a leave of absence shall not extend the\nseven or eight-year period for which an award is available. In the event a\nstudent has been granted a leave of absence or has obtained an extension of the\nperiod of availability for payment of Liberty Scholarships pursuant to section\n2203.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart, such student shall not be deemed ineligible for payment due to his or her\nhaving attained the age of 22 as of June 30th prior to the academic year for\nwhich the initial award is received, pursuant to section 610.2(c) of the\n\nEducation Law or due to his or her failure to enroll in an approved program in\na degree-granting institution located in New York State within 24 months of the\ndate the student graduated from secondary school, or received a high school\nequivalency diploma, pursuant to section 610.2(d) of the Education\n\nLaw.
