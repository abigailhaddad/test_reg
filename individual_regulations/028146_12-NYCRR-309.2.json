A livery base may temporarily deny access to its\ndispatches for failing to respond to a dispatch in violation of local and State\nlaws or governing taxi and limousine commission rules and regulations regarding\nrefusing dispatches without affecting its ability to be an independent livery\nbase; (5)\nall livery drivers may\naffiliate with one or more other livery bases, except if prohibited by rules or\nregulations of the governing taxi and limousine commission; (6)\neither the livery driver or livery base\nmay terminate their affiliation at any time, except that a livery base must\nterminate its relationship with the livery driver in accordance with any rules\nand regulations of the governing taxi and limousine commission; (7)\nthe livery base is not, directly or\nindirectly, including through any director, shareholder, partner, member or\nofficer, the owner or registrant of more than 50 percent of the liveries\ndispatched by the livery base; (8)\nthe livery base is not, directly or indirectly, including through any director, shareholder, partner, member or officer, paying or participating in paying for\nthe purchase, maintenance, repair, insurance, licensing, or fuel, of more than\n50 percent of the liveries dispatched by the livery base; (9)\nno livery driver dispatched by the livery\nbase receives an Internal Revenue Service form W-2 from such base, or is\nsubject to the withholding of any Federal income taxes by the livery base, except as provided in paragraph (10) of this subdivision; (10)\nif the livery base is the owner or\nregistrant of less than 50 percent of the liveries dispatched by that livery\nbase and it issues an Internal Revenue Service form W-2 to a livery driver or\nlivery drivers, or withholds any Federal income taxes for a livery driver or\nlivery drivers, such livery base must provide workers' compensation coverage\nfor that livery driver or those livery drivers that is separate from the fund; and\n(11)\nthe livery base does not\nimpose any fines or penalties or both on any livery drivers, except the livery\nbase may impose fines or penalties or both on a livery driver for violating the\nrules and regulations of the governing taxi and limousine commission regarding\nthe conduct of livery drivers while performing their duties as livery drivers\nand in order to recover the cost of any fines or penalties or both imposed on\nthe livery base by the governing taxi and limousine commission due to the\nbehavior of that livery driver that violated the rules and regulations of the\ngoverning taxi and limousine commission. (d) Termination of membership in the fund. (1)\n\nNonpayment. If an independent livery base\nfails to pay the annual payment, any additional payment or any part of such\npayments pursuant to an installment agreement to the fund, the fund, its\ninsurance carrier, or other designated agent may terminate the independent\nlivery base's membership in the fund by sending written notice to the livery\nbase that its membership in the fund will be terminated on a date, specified in\nthe notice, that is no less than 10 days after the date the notice was served\non the independent livery base and the chair. The notice must state that upon\nthe termination of its membership in the fund, the livery base will be deemed\nthe employer of all of its livery drivers and must obtain workers' compensation\ncoverage for them. If service is made by mail, the fund must allow five days\nfor delivery. Failure to provide written notice to the livery base that its\nmembership in the fund will be terminated on a date, specified in the notice, that is no less than 10 days after the date the notice was served on the\nindependent livery base, will result in the livery base's membership in the\nfund continuing until such notice can be provided in accordance with this\nparagraph, unless the fund, its insurance carrier, or other designated agent\ncan show actual notice by the livery base of the termination of its membership\nin the fund. A copy of the written notice shall be sent to the governing tax\nand limousine commission on the same date it is sent to the livery base and the\nchair. (2)\n\nDesignation revoked. Before revoking a livery base's designation as an independent livery base, the\nboard will provide written notice of the charges to the independent livery base\nand conduct a hearing to determine the validity of the charges. If the board\nrevokes a livery base's designation as an independent livery base, the board\nwill send a copy of the decision revoking the designation to the fund at the\nsame time it sends the decision to the livery base. The fund upon receiving the\ndecision revoking the designation of the livery base as an independent livery\nbase will send written notice to the livery base, the board and the governing\ntaxi and limousine commission that the livery base will cease to be a member of\nthe fund 30 days after the date of the notice. The notice will also state that\nthe livery base is not entitled to the return of money paid to the fund. Within\n20 days after the board issues its decision revoking a livery base's\ndesignation as an independent livery base, a livery base may appeal that\ndecision to the Third Department of the Appellate Division. Failure to provide\nwritten notice to the livery base that it will cease to be a member of the fund\n30 days after the date in the notice, will result in the livery base's\nmembership in the fund continuing until such notice can be provided in\naccordance with this paragraph, unless the fund, its insurance carrier, or\nother designated agent can show actual notice by the livery base that its\nmembership in the fund ceased. (3)\n\nIf an independent livery base decides to terminate its membership in the fund, it must provide written notice to the fund, chair and governing taxi and\nlimousine commission at least 30 days prior to the date its membership in the\nfund will end. The notice must state the date its membership in the fund will\nterminate, whether it will continue to operate as a livery base, and if it will\ncontinue to operate as a livery base information regarding how it will provide\nworkers' compensation coverage for its livery drivers, including but not\nlimited to, name of provider of workers' compensation coverage, policy number, effective date of coverage and, if applicable, proof that all affiliated\ndrivers will be or have been added to existing workers' compensation coverage. Failure to provide at least 30 days' written notice to the fund, chair and\ngoverning taxi and limousine commission will result in the livery base's\nmembership in the fund continuing until such notice can be provided in\naccordance with this paragraph. (e) Any livery base that is not designated by\nthe board as an independent livery base shall be deemed an employer or purposes\nof the Worker's Compensation Law of any livery driver it dispatches and\ntherefore is responsible for providing workers' compensation coverage for such\nlivery drivers. (f) Any livery base\nthat is designated by the board as an independent livery base and that has\njoined the fund shall not charge any driver for any portion of the cost of\njoining and/or being a member of the fund.
