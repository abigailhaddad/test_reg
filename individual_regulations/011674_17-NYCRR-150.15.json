The hearing officer shall determine whether any evidence is\nimmaterial, irrelevant or unduly cumulative and should therefore be excluded, but such hearing officer shall admit all testimony having reasonable probative\nvalue to determine the matter. Each party shall have the right to present his\ncase or defense by oral or documentary evidence and to submit rebuttal evidence\nand to conduct such cross-examination as may be permitted by the hearing\nofficer in an effort to obtain full and direct disclosure of all relevant\nfacts.
