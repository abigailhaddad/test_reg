Tit. 10 § 710.8 - Requirements during construction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The applicant shall request and must obtain the prior approval of the\ncommissioner for any changes proposed during construction relating to the\ndescription of the program scope or functional space concept of the project, total project costs, total basic costs of construction, increased interest\nrates relating to the financing of any aspect of the project, or major items of\nequipment as approved. The commissioner shall respond in writing within 30 days\nof the receipt of such a request, unless the change constitutes an amendment to\nthe application, in which event the provisions of section\n710.5\nof this Part shall\napply. (b) The applicant may\nauthorize change orders to the construction contract which contribute to the\nnecessary coordination and orderly completion of the project without the need\nfor prior approval of the commissioner if such change orders can be funded\nwithin the approved construction contingency and the changes do not relate to\nchanges in the program scope or functional space concept of the project. Any\nchange order relating to changes in program scope or functional space concept\nmust be submitted for prior approval. If the total value of change orders\nexceeds the budgeted construction contingency, which may constitute an\namendment pursuant to the provisions of section\n710.5\nof this Part, then all\nchange orders, including those previously authorized by the applicant, will be\nreviewed by the commissioner as to acceptability for reimbursement. In such\nevent, only those change orders that have been given prior approval under\nsubdivision (a) of this section, those change orders which are deemed necessary\nby the commissioner for prudent coordination and continuation of the project, and those change orders which are related to unforeseen conditions or which can\ndemonstrate positive financial impact on the project may be considered\nreimbursable. The costs associated with change orders, in excess of those\neffectuated under the approved design and/or construction contingency, made by\nthe applicant, its architects, contractors or agents, will be eligible for\nreimbursement pursuant to the provisions of Part 86 of this Title only to the\nextent that the applicant has not been able to recover such costs from a\nresponsible party, if any, insurance carrier or bonding agency. (c) For projects exceeding $15 million in\ntotal basic cost of construction, an updated functional stack diagram which\nincludes square footages, type of construction and estimated cost of\nconstruction and equipment for each functional area displayed and, where\nappropriate, the relative cost of each area as well as the total construction\ncost for each discrete physical structure involved, and indicating the\npercentage of completion for each functional area, shall be submitted every six\nmonths during construction in accordance with section\n710.2\n(b)(10)(i)(b)\nof this Part.
