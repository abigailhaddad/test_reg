  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.1 - Receipts and net gains from the sale of tangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(2)(a))\n(a) Receipts and net gains (not less than\nzero) from the sale of tangible personal property are included in New York\nreceipts if paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subdivision applies. All\nreceipts and net gains (not less than zero) from the sale of tangible personal\nproperty are included in everywhere receipts. (1)\n\nThe property is shipped via common or\ncontract carrier, irrespective of whether the shipment is arranged by the\ncorporation or the purchaser, or via the corporation's vehicle or other means\nof transportation, to a point in New York State. Where property is so shipped\nto a point outside New York State, the receipts from the sale of such property\nare not included in New York receipts unless the final destination of the\nproperty is a point in New York State. See subdivision (c) of this section\nregarding evidence of destination. (2)\n\nThe possession of the property is\ntransferred to a purchaser or purchaser's designee at a point in New York\n\nState, unless the f i n a l destination of the property is a point outside New\n\nYork State. Where possession of the property is transferred in New York State, it is presumed that the final destination is a point in New York State unless\nthere is sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the final destination is a\npoint outside New York State. See subdivision (c) of this section regarding\nevidence of destination. (3)\n\nThe\npossession of the property is transferred to a purchaser or purchaser's\ndesignee at a point outside New York State, where the final destination of the\nproperty is a point in New York State. Where possession of the property is\ntransferred outside New York State, it is presumed that the final destination\nis a point outside New York State unless there is sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate that the destination is a point in New York State. See subdivision\n(c) of this section regarding evidence of destination. (b) (1)\n\nTo\ncompute a gain or loss from the sale of tangible personal property, the\ncorporation must subtract its adjusted basis in the tangible personal property\nfrom the sale price of the tangible personal property. If the sale price\nexceeds the adjusted basis, the result is a gain. If the sale price is less\nthan the adjusted basis, the result is a loss. (2)\n\nTo determine the amount of net gains from\nsales of tangible personal property to be included in the numerator and\ndenominator of the BAF, the corporation first must subtract the sum of all\nlosses computed under paragraph (1) of this subdivision from the sum of all\ngains computed under such paragraph (1). If the result is equal to or less than\nzero, no amount is included in New York receipts and everywhere receipts. If\nthe total amount of net gains (not less than zero) from sales of tangible\npersonal property located in New York exceeds the net gains (not less than\nzero) from sales of tangible personal property located within and without New\n\nYork State, the amount included in New York receipts is limited to the amount\nincluded in everywhere receipts. (c) Examples of the types of evidence t h a t\nordinarily will be sufficient to demonstrate the final destination of property\ninclude: (1)\na bill of lading or other\nshipping document designating the final destination location, regardless of the\nF.O.B. point, and\n(2)\na purchase\ninvoice designating the final destination location. (d) For rules relating to receipts from sales\nof tangible personal property traded as commodities, see section\n4-2.10\nof this Subpart. (e) Examples. Example 1: Retail Corporation operates an online clothing\nstore that serves the United States. Customers purchase clothing via the\nwebsite and the clothing is shipped to the customer's home. Receipts from the\nsale of clothing shipped to locations within New York State are included in New\n\nYork receipts. Receipts from the sale of clothing shipped to locations within\nand without New York State are included in everywhere receipts. Example 2: Corporation A operates a car rental business\nin New York State and elsewhere in the United States. To keep its inventory\nup-to-date and make room for newer models, Corporation A sells some of its\nfleet of cars every year. The net gain (not less than zero) from these sales, which is properly reported as business income, shall be apportioned to New York\n\nState to the extent that the final destination of the cars sold is in New York. 100% of the net gains (not less than zero) are included in everywhere receipts. However, the amount included in New York receipts is limited to the amount\nincluded in everywhere receipts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
