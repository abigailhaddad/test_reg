Tit. 3 § 501.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nPursuant to the Financial Services Law (\"FSL\"), the New\n\nYork State Banking Department (\"Banking Department\") and the New York State\n\nInsurance Department were consolidated on October 3, 2011 into the Department\nof Financial Services (\"department\"). Prior to the consolidation, assessments\nof institutions subject to the Banking Law (\"BL\") were governed by section 17\nof the BL. Effective October 3, 2011, assessments are governed by section 206\nof the FSL, provided that section 17 of the BL continues to apply to\nassessments for the fiscal year commencing on April 1, 2011. Both section 17 of\nthe BL and section 206 of the FSL provide that all expenses (including, but not\nlimited to, compensation, lease costs and other overhead costs) of the\ndepartment attributable to institutions subject to the BL are to be charged to, and paid by, such regulated institutions. These institutions (\"regulated\nentities\") are now regulated by the banking division of the department. Under\nboth section 17 of the BL and section 206 of the FSL, the superintendent is\nauthorized to assess regulated entities for its total costs in such proportions\nas the superintendent shall deem just and reasonable. The Banking Department\nhas historically funded itself entirely from industry assessments of regulated\nentities. These assessments have covered all direct and indirect expenses of\nthe Banking Department, which are activities that relate to the conduct of\nbanking business and the regulatory concerns of the department, including all\nsalary expenses, fringe benefits, rental and other office expenses and all\nmiscellaneous and overhead costs such as human resource operations, legal and\ntechnology costs. This regulation sets forth the basis for allocating such\nexpenses among regulated entities and the process for making such\nassessments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
