  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 581-4.10 - Discovery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) There shall be\nfull and complete discovery within the guidelines of this section. (b) A party, upon receipt of notice to\nproduce documents and materials from any other party, shall furnish all such\nrequested items relevant to the proceeding within 10 days of the date of such\nnotice, or within such other period as a hearing officer shall\ndirect. (c) Depositions and written\ninterrogatories will only be allowed with permission of the hearing officer\nupon a finding that they are likely to expedite the proceeding. Bills of\nparticulars are not permitted. (d) A party who is served with a notice to produce documents and materials may move\nfor a ruling from the hearing officer denying or modifying such notice within\n10 days of the date of the notice and shall specify his objections thereto. Such ruling may also be made by the hearing officer on his own initiative. Any\nsuch ruling shall be designed to avoid unnecessary delay of the hearing or to\nprevent unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, or prejudice to any\nparty. (e) If a party fails to\ncomply with a discovery demand without having made a timely objection, the\nproponent of the discovery demand may apply to the hearing officer to compel\ndisclosure. If a party fails to comply with the ruling of a hearing officer\ncompelling discovery, the agency may accept as correct the allegations of fact\nmade by the opposing party as to which the undisclosed material would be\nrelevant as evidence. (f) Subpoenas\nmay be issued consistent with article 23 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules as\nfollows: (1)\nany attorney of record in a\nhearing has power to issue subpoenas as provided by that article; (2)\na party not represented by an attorney\nadmitted to practice in New York may request the hearing officer to issue a\nsubpoena, stating the items or witnesses needed by the party to present its\ncase; (3)\nservice of a subpoena is\nthe responsibility of its sponsor; and\n(4)\nall subpoenas shall give notice that the\nhearing officer may quash or modify the subpoena pursuant to the standards set\nforth under that article.
