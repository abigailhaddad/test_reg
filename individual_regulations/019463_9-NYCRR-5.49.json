  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5.49 - Executive order no. 49: establishing procedures to consider, in its proprietary capacity, the utilization of one or more project labor agreements\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, it is in the best interests of the People of the\n\nState of New York to promote the timely completion of public construction\nprojects undertaken by State agencies while at the same time limiting the costs\nof such projects to the greatest extent possible consistent with the law and\nprinciples of fairness and equity; WHEREAS, the New York State Court of Appeals issued a\ndecision in the Matter of New York State Chapter, Inc., Associated General\n\nContractors of America, et. al. v. New York State Thruway Authority, 88 N.Y.2d\n56, 666 N.E.2d 185, 643 N.Y.S.2d 480 (1996), which found that project labor\nagreements are \"neither absolutely prohibited nor absolutely permitted in\npublic construction contracts\"; and\nWHEREAS, it is now clear that project labor agreements are\none of many tools which may be used by management and labor and which may, under certain circumstances, assist in achieving the goals described\nabove; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: Each State agency shall establish procedures to consider, in its proprietary capacity, the utilization of one or more project labor\nagreements with respect to individual public construction projects. The\nutilization of a project labor agreement shall be considered only where the\nstandards established by the Court of Appeals can reasonably be expected to be\nmet. In reaching a determination on the use of a project labor\nagreement with respect to a specific project the agency shall consider whether\nthe utilization of such an agreement is justified because it meets the interest\nunderlying the State's competitive bidding laws of: (1)\nobtaining the best work possible at the\nlowest possible price; and\n(2)\npreventing favoritism, improvidence, fraud and corruption in the awarding of\npublic contracts. In considering whether to proceed with a project labor\nagreement, agencies should be mindful that, in the past, the courts of the\n\nState of New York have struck down any such agreement wherein a contracting\nentity was unable to show a proper business purpose for entering into such\nagreement. No project labor agreement shall be approved by an agency\nunless the decision to enter into the project labor agreement has, both as its\npurpose and likely effect, the advancement of the interests of the State's\ncompetitive bidding statutes. In the event that an agency enters into a project labor\nagreement and lets one or more contracts for work to be performed pursuant to\nsuch agreement, it shall then be forwarded to the Commissioner of Labor. Upon\nreceipt of the project labor agreement, the Commissioner of Labor shall\ndetermine the interaction, if any, between article 8 of the Labor Law and the\nagreement. Signed: George E. PatakiDated: February 12, 1997\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5.49\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
