  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1960.8 - Wastewater service charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Development of user charges for all users. (1)\n\nAll users shall pay and shall be liable to pay to the water board such fees, rates and other charges as the water board may establish from time to time in\naccordance with and pursuant to the authority of the Water Board Act. A\nschedule of such fees, rates and charges are set forth in section\n1950.20\nof this Title. These rates\nshall recover all of the costs associated with the water board's POTW for the\nfiscal year stated in such schedule. The user rates shall be developed using an\nequitable user charge structure which complies with all State and Federal\nregulations. (2)\n\nAs part of the\nuser charge structure, process accounts shall be developed. Process accounts\ncan be considered as cost centers into which all capital, operations, maintenance and other costs of the water board POTW can be allocated. (3)\n\nWater board POTW users shall be divided\ninto three classes: (i) SIU; (ii)\nCSIRU; (iii)\nhauled waste. (4)\n\nThe costs assigned to process accounts\nshall be divided between user classes using allocating parameters which\nreasonably reflect the actual usage of the particular process by each user\nclass as determined by the water board. (b) User charge for commercial/small\nindustrial/residential users (CSIRU). (1)\n\nAny\nperson owning premises accessible to the water board POTW who is classified as\na CSIRU as defined hereinbefore, shall pay a user charge in accordance with a\nschedule to be adopted annually by the water board. This schedule will be\ndeveloped to fully meet the need for income to pay the proportionate share of\nthe costs, including without limitation, cost of operation, maintenance, insurance, renewals, and replacement of all wastewater collection, treatment\nand disposal services provided by the water board for this class of users, and\npayment of the proportionate share of interest on and amortization of, or\npayments of indebtedness for the capital costs of all facilities built to serve\nas part of the water board POTW. The amount of the billing shall be based upon\nthe water consumption on each premises covered by this section determined by\nthe water board, except as provided below. For the purposes of this section, it\nshall be deemed that a cubic foot of water consumed shall constitute a cubic\nfoot of wastewater discharged. In the event that consumptive use precludes the\nuse of water meter readings for determination of user charges, alternate\nmetering may be substituted on a case-by-case basis pursuant to water board\nreview and approval. (2)\n\nFor the\npurpose of billing, the owners of premises covered by this section for the user\ncharges established in subdivision (a) of this section, the water board's\nservice area shall be divided into sewer districts which shall have the same\ngeographic boundaries as those established in section\n1950.8\n(b) of this\n\nTitle, and the billing dates for the three geographic districts shall be as\nestablished in such section, duly adopted by the water board, from time to\ntime. (3)\n\nThe owners of the\npremises covered by this section shall be responsible for the payment of the\nuser charge as determined in accordance with subdivision (a) of this section\nand no reduction in bills rendered shall be allowed for leakage. (4)\n\nAll user charge bills shall be payable\nwhen due. They shall be mailed or delivered by the water board, as a matter of\nconvenience to the property owner or user, as the case may be. Failure of a\nproperty owner or user, as the case may be, to receive a user charge bill shall\nnot release the property owner or user, as the case may be, from the payment of\nsuch bill together with any fee or penalty which may accrue or become existent\nby virtue of non-receipt of such bill. (5)\n\nWhenever a property discharging\nwastewater into the water board POTW is without a meter, the water board will\narrange for installation of a water meter. The water board will then bill the\nproperty owner or user, as the case may be, for an estimated reasonable amount\nof wastewater discharged during the time that the property has been occupied\nwithout a meter. (6)\n\nWhen it is\nimpossible to obtain a regular quarterly reading of any meter for any reason, including a meter found to be registering inaccurately or found to be stopped, the amount of wastewater discharged shall be estimated according to the amount\nof water consumed for the same or similar occupancies and a bill rendered for\nsuch estimated amount of wastewater discharged. The fact that the amount of the\nbill has been estimated shall be indicated on the bill. (7)\n\nAny user charge account of any nature\nremaining unpaid on September 30th of each year shall be placed upon the next\ngeneral city tax roll made up after such date, should the water board be unable\nto make collection in any manner other than by civil action. If placed upon the\ntax roll, a user charge account shall become a part of said tax roll and shall\nbecome due with the same and shall be subject to the same penalties and\ninterest as such city taxes. User charges shall be liens against real property\nwithin the city to the extent set forth in the Water Board Act and General\n\nMunicipal Law of the State. (8)\n\nComplaints of incorrect charges on user charge bills must be made prior to the\ndue date of such bill and all user charge bills against which no claim has been\nmade within the time set forth above shall be considered correct and must be\npaid in the amount rendered. (9)\n\nWhen property becomes vacant, upon receipt of written notice from the owner of\nsame, the water board shall remove the water meter and seal the service in a\nmanner that will prevent any possibility of usage without charge. When the\nwater board is notified that the property is reoccupied, a meter will be\nreinstalled, the shutoff seal removed and the water supply restored. No charge\nshall be made for sewer use during the time that the property remains vacant\nprovided that the foregoing provisions are fully complied with. (10)\n\nThe billing charge on any building\npermanently demolished shall be discontinued when conclusive proof of\ndemolition is presented to the water board, when the water meter is removed by\nthe water board, a licensed plumbing contractor certifies to the water board\nthat the water and sewer service has been properly sealed, and upon payment of\nany existing bills up to the date such certification is provided to the water\nboard. (11)\n\nUser charge bills shall\nnot be rendered, otherwise than quarterly and in the full amount due for all of\nthe wastewater discharged for the full quarter as provided in this section. Persons purchasing property shall make arrangements with the seller or\ntransferor of the same regarding any settlement for the partial payment for the\nuser charge during any portion of any quarter. (12)\n\nFor purposes of the initial billing\npursuant to this section, in any case where the bill for user charge shall\ncover a period less than a full quarter, there shall be an estimated proration\nof the user charge and the bill shall be forwarded based upon such estimate and\nshall be described on the face of the bill as an estimated billing. (13)\n\nThe director shall charge a person\ndischarging waters or water from a motor vehicle, tank truck or any other\nmobile conveyance an amount which adequately represents the cost of testing and\ntreatment. (c) User\ncharge for SIUs. (1)\n\nAny person owning\npremises accessible to the water board POTW and being an SIU defined\nhereinbefore, shall pay a user charge, in accordance with a schedule to be\nadopted annually by the water board. This schedule will be developed to fully\nmeet the need for income to pay the proportionate share of costs including\nwithout limitation, cost of operation maintenance, insurance, renewals, and\nreplacements of all wastewater collection, treatment and disposal services\nprovided by the water board for this class of users, and payment of the\nproportionate share of interest on and amortization of, or payments of\nindebtedness for the capital costs of all facilities built to serve as part of\nthe water board's POTW. (2)\n\nEach\nSIU shall provide facilities for continuous metering of wastewater flow\nquantities and for sampling and monitoring for determination by the water board\nof character and quality of discharge to the water board POTW in accordance\nwith the SIU permit, and as required in section\n1960.6\nof this Part hereinbefore\nexcept that, at the option of the SIU, flows and loadings of TSS and SOC of\nwastewater from office buildings and washrooms of factory spaces may be\nestimated upon a per capita basis if connected separately to the water board\nPOTW. Such flow and loading quantities shall be combined with the industrial\nwaste flow and loading quantities in determining the average quarterly\nquantities upon which user charges are computed. (3)\n\nThe user charges for SIUs shall be at the\nrates as established by the water board, by resolution duly adopted from time\nto time, and shall be payable when due and in accordance with the provisions of\nsuch resolution(s). Failure of an SIU to receive a user charge bill shall not\nrelease the SIU from the payment of such bill together with any fee or penalty\nwhich may accrue or become existent by virtue of non-receipt of bill. (4)\n\nAny user charge account of any nature\nremaining unpaid on September 30th shall be placed upon the next general city\ntax roll made up after such date, should the water board be unable to make\ncollection in any other manner than by civil action. If placed upon the tax\nroll, a user charge account shall become a part of said tax roll and shall\nbecome due with the same and shall be subject to the same penalties and\ninterest as such taxes. User charges shall be liens against real property\nwithin the city to the extent set forth in the Water Board Act and the General\n\nMunicipal Law of the State. (5)\n\nFor\ndetermination of quantity, character and quality of wastewaters, complaints of\nincorrect charges on user charge bills must be submitted in writing to the\ndirector no later than 60 days from the date on which such bills are rendered\nand all user charge bills against which no claim has been made within the time\nset forth above shall be considered correct and must be paid in the amount\nrendered. (d) User charge\nfor hauled waste. (1)\n\nAny person, whether a\ntransporter or generator, shall pay a charge in accordance with paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision to fully meet the need for income to pay the proportionate\nshare of costs including without limitation, cost for operation, maintenance, insurance, renewals, replacements of all wastewater receiving and conveyance\nfacilities, treatment, and disposal services provided by the water board for\nthis class of user, and payment of the proportionate share of interest on an\namortization of, or payments of indebtedness for the capital cost of all\nfacilities built to serve as part of the water board POTW. Each person who\ndesires to discharge hauled waste, including the transporter and the generator, to the water board POTW shall apply for a discharge permit to do so. Such\napplication will supply information pertaining to the pollutant\ncharacterization and volume of waste. No hauled waste shall be accepted without\nformal application and issuance of a permit. (2)\n\nThe user charges for hauled waste shall\nbe billed and payable on a monthly basis. (3)\n\nThe amount of billing shall be based upon\nthe pollutant content and volume of the waste. In addition, administrative and\nanalytical costs shall be billed to and payable by the user. (4)\n\nBills due the water board for sewer use, or any other service, if not paid within 25 days from the date of issue, shall\nbe subject to a fee of 10 percent penalty and 1.5 percent of the current\nbilling amount due in interest for each month overdue, such fee to be collected\ntogether with the amount of the bill. (5)\n\nAny user charge account of any nature\nremaining unpaid on February 1st of the year following rendition, shall be\ncollected through any and all available legal remedies. (6)\n\nComplaints of incorrect user charge bills\nmust be made within the month in which such bills are rendered and all user\ncharge bills against which no claim has been made within the time set forth\nabove shall be considered correct and must be paid in the amount\nrendered. (e) User fees. The water board may adopt fees which may include: (1)\nfees for reimbursement of costs of\nestablishing, operating and maintaining the water board's pretreatment\nprogram; (2)\nfees for monitoring, inspections and surveillance procedures; (3)\nfees for reviewing slug discharge control\nprocedures and corrective action plans; (4)\nfees for permit applications; (5)\nfees for consistent removal (by the water\nboard) of pollutants otherwise subject to categorical pretreatment standards; and\n(6)\nother fees as the water\nboard may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the requirements contained\nherein.
