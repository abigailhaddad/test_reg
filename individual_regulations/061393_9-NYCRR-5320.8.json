  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5320.8 - Progressive controller requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA progressive system shall meet the standards for gaming\ndevices set forth in Part 5319 of this Subchapter. The requirements of this\n\nPart apply equally to one progressive gaming device linked to a progressive\ncontroller or is internally controlled, as well as several progressive gaming\ndevices linked to one progressive controller within one gaming facility or\nmultiple gaming facilities. (a) Progressive controller description. A progressive controller shall calculate\nthe values of the progressives and display the information within a progressive\ngaming device link and the associated progressive meter (if applicable, progressive controllers may be internally controlled by the games control\nprogram). A progressive controller may consist of more than one discrete\ncomponent and include, without limitation, PC-based computers, wiring, interface boards and collection nodes, etc. (b) Setting jackpot amounts. The entry or\nmodification of system jackpot parameter values shall be secure. Any change to\nthe jackpot amount shall conform to the gaming facility's approved system of\ninternal controls. All progressive gaming devices or any progressive system\ncomponent approved by the commission shall be able to display, the following\ninformation for each progressive prize offered (if applicable): (1)\ncurrent value, which is the current prize\namount; (2)\noverflow, which is the\namount exceeding limit to be counted as gross gaming revenue; (3)\nhits, which is the number of times the\nprogressive jackpot was won; (4)\nwins, which is the total value of wins for the progressive jackpot or a history\nof the last 25 progressive hits; (5)\nbase, which is the starting\nvalue; (6)\nlimit, which is the\njackpot limit value (if the jackpot is capped at a maximum limit, this\nsubdivision does not require to add the overflow amounts to the next starting\nvalue and shall be determined on a case-by-case basis); (7)\nincrement, which is the percentage\nincrement rate; (8)\nsecondary\nincrement, which is the percentage increment rate after limit is\nreached; (9)\nhidden increment, which is the percentage increment rate for the reserve pool; (10)\nreset value, which is the amount the\nprogressive resets to after the progressive jackpot is won; and\n(11)\nthe participating gaming\ndevices. (c) Progressive\ncontroller program interruption. After a program interruption (e.g., power\ndown), software shall be able to recover to the state such software was in\nimmediately prior to the interruption occurring. (d) Internal link progressive controller. For\nlink progressives where the progressive controller is part of the game software\n(internal link), all games on such link shall conform to the following\ncriteria: (1)\nrequire a secure method for\nconfiguring each game on the link; (2)\nchanges to progressive settings shall not\nbe made, unless a change involves a secure method; (3)\neach game on the link shall be identified\nuniquely; (4)\nonly one game on the\nlink shall function as the master progressive controller; (5)\nif the game configured as the master\ncontroller becomes inoperative, all games on the link must tilt; (6)\nif any game on the link loses\ncommunication with the master controller, that game must tilt; and\n(7)\nthe progressive link shall be capable of\ndisplaying all progressive parameters (i.e., contribution, reset amount, levels, etc.). (e) Progressive resumption. On program resumption, the following procedures, at a\nminimum, shall be performed: (1)\nany\ncommunications to an external device shall not begin until the program\nresumption routine, including self-tests, is completed successfully; (2)\na progressive system control program\nshall test itself for possible corruption due to failure of the program storage\nmedia. The authentication may use the checksum. It is preferred, however, that\nthe cyclic redundancy check calculations are used at a minimum (at least 16\nbit). Other test methodologies shall be acceptable if at a comparable level of\nintegrity; and\n(3)\nthe integrity\nof all critical memory shall be checked. (f) Communications for jackpot signaling. There shall be a secure, two-way communication protocol between the main game\nprocessor board and the progressive system. In addition, the progressive system\nshall be able to: (1)\nsend to the electronic\ngaming device the amount that was won, for metering purposes; and\n(2)\nupdate constantly the progressive display\nas play on the link is continued. (g) Monitoring of credits bet. During the\nnormal mode of progressive gaming devices, the progressive controller shall\nmonitor continuously each device on the link for the preset rate of progression\nand shall multiply the same by the rate of progression and denomination in\norder to determine the correct amounts to apply to the progressive jackpot. Such monitoring shall be 99.99% accurate. (h) Access to the progressive controller. Each progressive controller used with a progressive gaming device shall be\nhoused in a secure environment that allows access only by authorized personnel. Access to the controller shall conform to the gaming facility's approved system\nof internal controls. (i) Progressive controller required meters. The progressive controller or other\napproved progressive system component shall keep the information described in\nparagraphs (1) through (5) of this subdivision in non-volatile memory, which\nshall be displayed on demand. Such meters shall be 99.99% accurate. (1)\n\nThe number of progressive jackpots won on\neach progressive level if the progressive display has more than one winning\namount. (2)\n\nThe cumulative amounts\npaid on each progressive level if the progressive display has more than one\nwinning amount. (3)\n\nThe maximum\namount of the progressive payout for each level displayed. (4)\n\nThe minimum amount of the progressive\npayout for each level displayed. (5)\n\nThe rate of progression for each level\ndisplayed. (j) Controller and display functions during progressive jackpot win. When a\nprogressive jackpot is recorded on an electronic gaming device that is attached\nto the progressive controller, the progressive controller shall allow for the\nfollowing to occur on the device and/or progressive display: (1)\ndisplay the winning amount; (2)\ndisplay the electronic gaming device\nidentification that caused the progressive meter to activate if more than one\nelectronic gaming device is attached to the controller; (3)\nautomatically reset to the reset amount\nand continue normal play; and\n(4)\ndisplay the new progressive values that are current on the link. (k) Base progressive jackpot\namount. The initial amount of a progressive jackpot shall begin at or above an\naward for that particular gaming device that makes the entire meter payout\ngreater than the minimum percentage requirement. (l) Progressive controller error conditions. When a controller error occurs the gaming device shall alternate displays\nbetween the current amount and an appropriate error message that is visible to\nall players or that can alert the gaming facility to such error condition. The\nprogressive controller shall convey the appropriate signal to disable the games\nusing the progressive, and an error shall be displayed on the progressive\nmeter, or its equivalent, if any of the following events occurs: (1)\nduring a communication failure between\nthe game and the controller or anywhere within the progressive controller\nsystem; (2)\nwhen there have been\nmultiple communication errors; (3)\nwhen a controller checksum or signature has failure; (4)\nwhen a controller's RAM or program\nstorage device mismatch or failure occurs; (5)\nwhen the jackpot configuration is lost or\nis not set; (6)\nif there has been\nan unreasonable amount of credits bet (an unreasonable amount of credits bet is\ndefined by the progressive setup that is based on the number of bets and number\nof gaming devices; or\n(7)\nif the\ngame meters are validated against the controller's meters (via communications\nbetween the game board and controller) and such meters do not\nreconcile. (m) Transferring of progressive jackpot. The\nprogressive controller shall have a secure means of transferring a progressive\njackpot and/or prizes to another progressive controller or other\ncommission-approved progressive system component. Transferring of progressive\njackpots shall meet the gaming facility's approved system of internal\ncontrols. (n) Jackpot limits. The\ncontroller may be configured with a limit on the jackpot of a progressive\ngaming device, if the limit imposed is greater than the jackpot payout on the\ngaming device at the time the limit is imposed. This limit shall be posted on\nor near the device or devices to which the limit applies. (o) Time limits. The progressive controller\nmay have the ability to set time limits that limit the time the progressive is\navailable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
