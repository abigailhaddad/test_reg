Tit. 21 § 3000.4 - Responsibility of applicants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each applicant to the issuer shall submit to the issuer as part of the\napplication an environmental assessment, in form acceptable to the issuer, which describes and analyzes the environmental impact and effects of the\nproposed action in sufficient detail for the issuer to determine: (1)\nwhether the proposed action constitutes\nan exempt act; (2)\nwhether the\nproposed action is a ministerial action; (3)\nwhether the proposed action constitutes a\n\nType II action; (4)\nwhether the\nproposed action may or will not have a significant effect on the environment; and\n(5)\nto the best knowledge of\nthe applicant, which other agencies, including Federal agencies, have\njurisdiction by law, rule or regulation over the proposed action or any part\nthereof and whether or not issuer is the lead agency with respect to the\nproposed action. (b) Where appropriate, the applicant shall, in his environmental assessment of the\nproposed action, include a concise statement of the reasons why, in his\njudgment, the proposed action will (or will not) require the preparation of an\nEIS. (c) If, in the judgment of the\nissuer, the information provided in the environmental assessment is\ninsufficient to permit the issuer to make the determinations enumerated in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, the applicant will be required to furnish such\nadditional information on the proposed action as the issuer shall deem\nnecessary or desirable to permit the making of such determinations. An\napplication shall be deemed incomplete until such information is\nfurnished.

(f) The submission by an applicant of an\napplication shall be deemed the contractual obligation of the applicant to pay\nall fees and costs allocable to such application as are allowable by this Part. No contract, grant, subsidy, loan or other form of funding assistance or\npermit, lease, license, certificate or other action shall be made, granted or\nissued by the issuer until all fees due under this Part from the applicant\nshall have been paid.
