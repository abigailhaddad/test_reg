  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 325-5.5 - General procedure for data-matching\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Format of requests for computer\nsearches. Health insurers participating in the match program shall\nsubmit requests for computer searches in a technological format prescribed by\nthe chair. Such requests for computer searches shall include the claimant's\nsocial security number, if known, last name, initial of first name or first\nname, sex, date of birth, date of treatment, or date of accident, if known, and\nsuch other qualifiers permitted or required by the chair that would establish\nthe identity of the claimant as the person whose payments were covered by the\nhealth insurer. (b) Time limitations. The date of treatment or accident submitted by the health\ninsurer will be matched against the date of accident contained in the board's\nfile. If the date of treatment submitted by the health insurer is within 360\ndays of the date of accident contained in the board file, the health insurer\nwill receive a match on this time limitation criterion. A match on the time\nlimitation criterion is required for all full matches. (c) Full matches. The board will compare all information supplied by the\nhealth insurer against individually identifiable information contained in board\ncase files. When there is an identity of information between the information\nsupplied by the health insurer and the individually identifying information\ncontained in a claimant's case file of a quality and quantity to create a\nreasonable basis for the board to determine that they are the same person, based on criteria set by the chair that would establish the identity of the\nclaimant as the person whose payments were covered by the health insurer, the\nboard shall notify the health insurer that there is a full match with respect\nto the claimant. A match on the time limitation criterion is required for all\nfull matches. (d) Partial matches. The board will compare all information supplied by the\nhealth insurer against individually identifiable information contained in board\ncase files. When there is some identity of information between the information\nsupplied by the health insurer and the individually identifying information\ncontained in the claimant's case file, but such identity of information is not\nof a quality or quantity to create a sufficient reasonable basis for the board\nto determine that they are the same person, based upon criteria set by the\nchair that would establish the identity of the claimant as the person whose\npayments were covered by the health insurer, the board shall notify the health\ninsurer that there is a partial match with respect to the claimant. (e) Match situations. (1)\n\nFull match. When there is a \"full\nmatch,'' the board will provide the health insurer with the following\ninformation: (i) the workers' compensation\ncase number; (ii)\na description of\nthe injury or illness (if and as available in the board's computer\ndatabase); (iii)\nthe workers'\ncompensation carrier's identification number (carrier code); (iv)\nthe workers' compensation carrier's case\nnumber (if and as available in the board's computer database); (v) a designation as to whether the carrier\naccepted the case by filing a C-669 (if and as available in the board's\ncomputer database); (vi)\na\ndesignation as to whether ANCR has been established (if and as available in the\nboard's computer database); and\n(vii)\na designation as to whether the case is\nopen or closed (if and as available in the board's computer database). If there is a full match, the health insurer will be\nplaced on notice for future hearings and decisions. A health insurer will only\nbe placed on notice for future hearings and decisions in cases where there is a\nfull match. (2)\n\nPartial match. When there is a \"partial match,'' the Workers' Compensation\n\nBoard will provide the health insurer with the following information: (i) the workers' compensation carrier's\nidentification number (carrier code); (ii)\nthe workers' compensation carrier's case\nnumber (if and as available in the board's computer database); and\n(iii)\nidentification of the fields that\nfailed the \"full match'' process. In such a situation, the health insurer shall not receive\ncopies of hearing and decision notices and shall not be provided with the\nclaimant's workers' compensation case number, a description of the injury or\nother individually identifiable information. (3)\n\nNo match. A \"no match'' occurs when\nsufficient matching data is not available for either a full match or a partial\nmatch. Where there is a \"no match,'' no information is provided to the health\ninsurer on that record or request. (f) Return of requests for computer\nsearches. The board shall process a health insurer's initial\nrequest for computer searches and notify the health insurer of the information\non \"full'' and \"partial'' matches. The board will make every effort, barring\nunforeseen circumstances, to respond to and return the search request of the\nhealth insurer within 30 days of receipt of the search request. (g) Availability of\ninformation in board files. (1)\n\nWhen a\nhealth insurer has been notified of a \"full match'' pursuant to paragraph\n(e)(1) of this section and the workers' compensation claim has been established\nby a board finding of ANCR or, if technologically feasible, by acceptance of a\nclaim, the health insurer shall be eligible to access the board's electronic\ncase file for such claim. A health insurer or its HIMP agent must execute an\nagreement prescribed by the board to be eligible to access the board's\nelectronic case files. Failure of a health insurer or its HIMP agent to comply\nwith the terms of such agreement or with board rules, regulations, or policies\ngoverning the board's electronic case files shall be grounds, following a\nhearing, for the chair to prohibit access to the board's electronic files. In\naddition, if the files are not available electronically, such health insurer\nmay make a request in writing to the board for any information in the board\nfiles as may be relevant to any bill that has been paid by such insurer or\nhealth benefits plan. Such requests shall be submitted to the Workers'\nCompensation Board at an address designated by the chair. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of a written request by a\nhealth insurer pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the board files\nshall be reviewed by board personnel to determine which, if any, documents, reports, records and/or other materials contained therein are relevant and/or\nnecessary to the request for reimbursement made by the health insurer. The cost\nfor review of board files by board personnel shall be borne by the health\ninsurer in accordance with section\n325-5.6\nof this Subpart. Copies of\nall such documents, reports, records and/or other materials contained therein\ndetermined to be relevant and/or necessary by board personnel shall be made\navailable to the health insurer requesting such information, provided, however, that no copies of such information shall be made available to a health insurer\nwith respect to any compensation claim which has been closed without findings\nof accident, notice and causal relationship. In such cases where the case has\nbeen closed without findings of accident, notice and causal relationship, the\nboard shall so advise the health insurer in writing. The costs of photocopying\ndocuments, reports, records and/or other materials from board files shall be\nborne by the health insurer in accordance with section\n325-5.6\nof this Subpart. (h) Age of claims to be\nsubmitted. Requests for computer searches must be submitted to the\nboard within three years of the date of payment for services rendered by the\nhealth care provider.
