  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 444.23 - Natural classification of expense\n\nState Regulations\n[3300]\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe fifth and sixth digits of the\nhospital's expense accounts are used to record the Natural Classification of\n\nExpense. There are nine major account classification categories with\nsubaccounts. The required level of reporting for the natural classification of\nexpense is the major natural account classification categories ending in zero, except for salaries and wages. Salaries and wages subaccounts must be reported. While the reporting of the remaining subaccounts is not required, they are\nrecommended to achieve greater uniformity in accounting and\nreporting. (2)\n\nThe major categories\nare as follows:.00-.19 Salaries and Wages.20-.29 Employee Benefits.30-.39 Professional Fees.40-.49 Medical and Surgical Supplies.50-.59 Non-Medical and Non-Surgical Supplies.60-.69 Utilities.70-.79 Purchased Services.80-.89 Other Direct Expense.90-.97 Depreciation/Rent/Transfers\n(3)\nA hospital desiring a more detailed\nidentification of expenses may at its option use an additional digit or digits\nto obtain the desired detail. (b).00,.10 Salaries and Wages. [3310]\n(1)\n\nSalaries and wages and\nfull-time equivalent (FTE) employees must be reported by 12 sub-classification\nof salaries and wages for both paid employees and nonpaid workers. The hospital\nis required to report salaries and wages and paid FTE's for all personnel whose\ncompensation is included on the payroll, including exempt personnel, and for\nnonpaid workers. FTE's are computed by dividing total paid hours by 2080. Paid\nhours include both worked and nonworked hours for which employees are\ncompensated. (2)\n\nOvertime hours are\nhours for which an overtime pay rate is used. The actual overtime hours are not\ntreated differently from regular worked hours; it is the rate that\nchanges. (3)\n\nOn-call and/or standby\npay is compensation to an employee for being available to work. During that\nperiod when the employee is on call or on standby, he might or might not\nactually perform work. The Fair Labor Standards Act differentiates between\nrestricted and unrestricted on-call situations. All restricted on-call hours\nare compensable and contribute to the total hours used for determining overtime\npay. Unrestricted on-call hours do not contribute to total hours, but\nunrestricted on-call compensation does contribute to the salary base used for\ncalculating overtime premiums only. Thus all restricted on-call hours must be\naccounted for, but only those hours worked need be accounted for when employees\nare on unrestricted on-call duty. (4)\n\nIn those instances where the hospital has\na policy to pay for a minimum number of hours whenever an employee is called\nback to work, and the employee works less than the minimum number of hours, the\nworked time recorded will include only the number of hours actually worked. For\nexample, a four-hour minimum is guaranteed; the employee works two hours and\nreturns home. The hospital will record only two hours as worked time. (5)\n\nSalaries and wages are defined as (i) all\nremuneration, payable in cash, for services performed by an employee for the\nhospital, and (ii) the fair market value of donated services when there is the\nequivalent of an employer-employee relationship. The value of donated services\nmay be evidenced by a contractual relationship which may provide the basis for\nvaluation. If persons donating the services are not paid (or are paid less than\nfair market value of their services), the lay-equivalent salaries (or the\ndifference between lay-equivalent salaries and salaries paid) must be reported\nas expense with the offsetting amount reported as nonoperating revenue in\naccount 9030, Donated Services. Do not include services rendered by persons\nsuch as candy stripers unless the hospital would actually hire someone to\nperform such services. Reimbursement of independent contractors such as private\nduty nurses must be excluded. (6)\n\nThe classifications of salaries and wages are defined below.
