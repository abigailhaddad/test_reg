  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 2100.2 - Policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The earned\neligibility program is based upon the premise that an incarcerated individual\nwho has successfully participated in appropriate programs will have an\nincreased likelihood of making a successful transition to the community upon\nrelease. The program recognizes that many inmates are motivated to achieve a\npositive change in their lives, that the programs and services offered by the\ndepartment can help individuals to prepare to live law abiding lives in the\ncommunity, and that program plans can assist and guide inmates in preparing for\ntheir release. (b) An eligible\ninmate who successfully participates in appropriate programs prior to his\nscheduled parole board (hereinafter the board) appearance shall be eligible to\nbe issued a certificate of earned eligibility (hereinafter certificate) in the\ndiscretion of the commissioner. An inmate who has been issued a certificate\nshall be granted parole release by the board unless the board determines that\nthere is a reasonable probability that, if the inmate is released, he will not\nlive and remain at liberty without violating the law and that his release is\nnot compatible with the welfare of society. Any action taken by the\ncommissioner pursuant to this Part shall be deemed a judicial function and\nshall not be reviewable if done in accordance with law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7\n§\n2100.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
