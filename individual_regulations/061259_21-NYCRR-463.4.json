Tit. 21 § 463.4 - Prompt payment procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ncontractor shall request payment under a contract by submitting a proper\ninvoice to the authority at its designated payment office at the time and in\nthe manner specified in the contract. (b) The authority shall have 15 calendar days\nafter receipt of an invoice at its designated payment office to notify the\ncontractor of certain facts and conditions, including but not limited to those\nlisted below, which, in the opinion of the controller, justify extension of the\nstatutory payment period: (1)\nthere is a\ndefect in the delivered goods, property or services; (2)\nthere is a defect in the\ninvoice; (3)\nthere are suspected\ndefects or improprieties of any kind, the existence of which prevent the\ncommencement of the statutory payment period; (4)\nprior to payment a statutory or\ncontractual provision requires an inspection period or an audit to determine\nthe resources applied or used by the contractor in fulfilling the contract\nterms; (5)\na proper invoice must be\nexamined by the Federal government prior to payment; (6)\nthe authority is prevented from makng\npayment by reason of filing of a lien, attachment, other legal process or\nrequirement of law. Any time taken to satisfy or rectify any such facts or\nconditions shall extend the date by which contract payment must be made in\norder for the authority not to become liable for interest payments by an equal\nperiod of time. (c) Should the authority fail to notify a\ncontractor of such facts and conditions within 15 calendar days of the invoice\nreceived date, the number of days allowed for payment of the corrected proper\ninvoice will be reduced by the number of days between the 15th day and the day\nthat notification was transmitted to the contractor. Should the authority, in\nsuch situations, fail to provide reasonable grounds for its contention that a\nfact or condition justifying a time extension exists, the date by which\ncontract payment must be made in order for the authority not to become liable\nfor interest payments shall be calculated from the invoice received\ndate. (d) The authority shall make\npayment within 45 calendar days after an invoice received date. Effective July\n1, 1989, the authority shall make payment within 30 calendar days, excluding\nlegal holidays, after an invoice received date occurring after that\ndate. (e) Except for the payments\ndescribed in section 464.5 of this Title, every payment by the authority to a\ncontractor pursuant to a contract is eligible for interest should the authority\nfail to make such payment within 45 days after the invoice received date for\ncontracts entered into between April 30, 1988 and June 30, 1989 and within 30\ndays on or after July 1, 1989. (f) The authority shall not be liable for interest on any retention amounts\nwithheld by the authority in accordance with the terms of the\ncontract. (g) Interest shall be\ncomputed at the rate set by the State Tax Commission for corporate taxes\npursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection (e) of section\n1096\nof the Tax Law.
