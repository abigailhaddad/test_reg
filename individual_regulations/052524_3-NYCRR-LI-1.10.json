  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.10 - Applicability of section 103(1)(a)'s loan limits to letters of credit issued to the commodity credit corporation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Department was asked whether Section 1488.5 of the\n\nRegulations of the Commodity Credit Corporation (\"CCC\") would remove the\nportion of a letter of credit which was issued to CCC by a foreign bank and\nwhich was confirmed by a domestic bank from the loan limitations of Section\n103\n(1)(a)\nof the Banking Law. Section 103 limits\nunsecured loans to individuals and private corporations to 10% of the capital\nstock, surplus fund and undivided profits of the lending bank or trust company. The section requires any extension of credit to a person by means of the issue\nor confirmation of an irrevocable sight letter of credit upon the\nresponsibility of such person to be deemed a loan to such person. Subdivision 1(a) of Section\n103\nof the Banking\n\nLaw excludes certain loans from the limitations on loans. The exclusion\nincludes loans for which an agency or instrumentality of the United States, as\ndesignated by the Banking Board, \"has agreed to pay the principal and interest\nthereof, or has guaranteed payment (by guaranty or commitment to purchase or\notherwise) of such principal and interest, or is committed to supply, by loan, subsidy or otherwise, funds sufficient to pay such principal and interest, or\nhas otherwise pledged its faith and credit for the payment of such principal\nand interest________\"\nThe Banking Board, by General Regulation section 28, §\n28.1\n(a)(3), has\nimplemented Section 103(1)(a) by designating CCC as an instrumentality or\nagency of the United States for the purposes of Section 103(1)(a), but only to\nthe extent that \"a loan or extension of credit is secured by a guaranty, or by\na commitment or agreement to take over or to purchase, made by such\ncorporation, and such guaranty, agreement or commitment is unconditional and\nmust be performed by payment of cash or its equivalent within 60 days after\ndemand.\"\nSection 1488.5 of the CCC's regulations permits a United\n\nStates bank to request a refund of the amounts paid under the confirmed portion\nof the letter of credit if the bank certifies that it is \"unable to recover\nfunds from the foreign bank due to a stipulated political risk which existed on\nthe date payment was made to CCC under the draft. On approval by CCC of such\nrequest, the refund shall be promptly made, together with\ninterest________\"\nSection 1488.2(s)(4) of the regulations defines \"political\nrisk\" to include \"failure of the foreign bank to make payment for any reason if\nit is an instrumentality of or is wholly owned by the foreign\ngovernment.\"\nThe department observed that the CCC's regulations\ncharacterize the application for a refund as a \"request\" and that they appear\nto permit CCC to review the facts and circumstances surrounding the foreign\nbank's failure to make the payment required by the letter of credit and the\nother remedies available to the domestic bank before determining whether to\ngrant the bank's request for a refund. In addition, the regulations do not\nrequire the approval to be given within the 60-day period mandated by General\n\nRegulation, section\n28.1\n(a)(3). The department also observed that CCC owns the entire letter\nof credit and does not assume or purchase the confirmed portion of the letter\nof credit or agree to supply funds to the foreign bank to pay the confirmed\nportion of the letter of credit within the meaning of the Banking Board's\n\nRegulation. In light of the foregoing, the department concluded that the remedy\navailable to the banks under Section 1488.5 of CCC's regulation does not\nconstitute an \"unconditional guaranty\" or other undertaking within the meaning\nof Section\n103\nof the Banking\n\nLaw and section\n28.1\n(a)(3)\nof the\n\nGeneral Regulations of the Banking Board.
