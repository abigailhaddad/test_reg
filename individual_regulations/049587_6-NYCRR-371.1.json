  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 371.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose and scope. This Part establishes the procedures for identifying those\nsolid wastes which are subject to regulation as hazardous wastes under Parts\n370 through 373, and 376 of this Title. However, even though a given material\nis defined as a hazardous waste under this Part, it may be exempt from one or\nmore of the substantive provisions of those Parts, as specified in each\nrespectively. Definitions for terms used in this Part are given in Part 370 of\nthis Title. For the purposes of subdivisions (c) and (g) of this\nsection: (1)\nA material is\naccumulated speculatively\nif it is accumulated before being\nrecycled. A material is not accumulated speculatively, however, if the person\naccumulating it can show that the material is potentially recyclable and has a\nfeasible means of being recycled; and that during the calendar year (commencing\non January 1st) the amount of material that is recycled, or transferred to a\ndifferent site for recycling, equals at least 75 percent by weight or volume of\nthe amount of that material accumulated at the beginning of the period. In\ncalculating the percentage of turnover, the 75-percent requirement is to be\napplied to each material of the same type (\ne.g., slags from a\nsingle smelting process) that is recycled in the same way\n(\ni.e., from which the same material is recovered or that is\nused in the same way). Materials accumulating in units that would be exempt\nfrom regulation under section\n371.1\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Title are not to be included in making the calculation. (Materials that\nare already defined as solid wastes also are not to be included in making the\ncalculation.) Materials are no longer in this category once they are removed\nfrom accumulation by recycling, however. (2)\nA byproduct\nis a\nmaterial that is not one of the primary products of a production process and is\nnot solely or separately produced by the production process. Examples are\nprocess residues such as slags or distillation column bottoms. The term does\nnot include a coproduct that is produced for the general public's use and is\nordinarily used in the same form as produced by the process. (3)\nA material is\nreclaimed\nif it is processed to recover a usable product, or if it is regenerated. Examples are recovery of lead values from spent batteries and regeneration of\nspent solvents. (4)\nA material is\nrecycled\nif it is used, reused or reclaimed. (5)\nA material is\nregenerated\nif it is restored to its original physical and\nchemical properties. (6)\n\nScrap metal\nis bits and pieces of metal parts\n(\ne.g., bars, turnings, rods, sheets, wire) or metal pieces\nthat may be combined together with bolts and soldering (\ne.g., radiators, scrap automobiles, railroad boxcars), which when worn or superfluous\ncan be recycled. (7)\nA\nspent material\nis any material that has been used and as a\nresult of contamination can no longer serve the purpose for which it was\nproduced without processing. (8)\nA\nmaterial is\nused\nor\nreused\nif it is either: (i) employed as an ingredient (including use\nas an intermediate) in an industrial process to make a product (for example, distillation bottoms from one process used as feedstock in another process). However, a material will not satisfy this condition if distinct components of\nthe material are recovered as separate end products (as when metals are\nrecovered from metal containing secondary materials); or\n(ii)\nemployed in a particular function or\napplication as an effective substitute for a commercial product (for example, spent pickle liquor used as phosphorus precipitant and sludge conditioner in\nwastewater treatment). (9)\n\nExcluded scrap metal\nis\nprocessed scrap metal, unprocessed home scrap metal, and unprocessed prompt\nscrap metal. (10)\n\nProcessed\nscrap metal\nis scrap metal which has been manually or physically\naltered to either separate it into distinct materials to enhance economic value\nor to improve the handling of materials. Processed scrap metal includes, but is\nnot limited to scrap metal which has been baled, shredded, sheared, chopped, crushed, flattened, cut, melted, or separated by metal type\n(\ni.e., sorted), and, fines, drosses and related materials\nwhich have been agglomerated. Note: Shredded circuit boards being sent for recycling are not\nconsidered processed scrap metal. They are covered under the exclusion from the\ndefinition of solid waste for shredded circuit boards being recycled (see\nsubparagraph [e][1][xiv] of this section). (11)\n\nHome scrap metal\nis\nscrap metal as generated by steel mills, foundries, and refineries such as\nturnings, cuttings, punchings, and borings. (12)\n\nPrompt scrap metal\nis\nscrap metal as generated by the metal working/fabrication industries and\nincludes such scrap metal as turnings, cuttings, punchings, and borings. Prompt\nscrap is also known as industrial or new scrap metal. (b) Applicability. The identification and listing of hazardous wastes given in\nthis Part supersedes any other definition given in any other Part of this\n\nTitle. (c) Definition\nof solid waste. (1)\nA\nsolid\nwaste\nis any discarded material that is not excluded under paragraph\n(e)(1) of this section or that is not excluded by variance granted under\nsection\n370.3\n(d) and (e)\nof this Title. (2)\nA\ndiscarded material\nis any material which is: (i) abandoned as explained in paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision; or\n(ii)\nrecycled as explained in paragraph (4) of this subdivision; or\n(iii)\nconsidered inherently waste-like as\nexplained in paragraph (5) of this subdivision; or\n(iv)\na military munition identified as a\nsolid waste in section\n374-1.13\n(c) of\nthis Title. (3)\n\nMaterials\nare solid waste if they are abandoned by being: (i) disposed of; or\n(ii)\nburned or incinerated; or\n(iii)\naccumulated, stored or treated (but not\nrecycled) before or in lieu of being abandoned by being disposed of, burned or\nincinerated. (4)\n\nMaterials are solid waste if they are recycled-or accumulated, stored or\ntreated before recycling-as specified in subparagraphs (i)-(iv) of this\nparagraph. (i) Used in a manner constituting\ndisposal. (a) Materials noted with an\nasterisk in column 1 of Table 1 are solid wastes when they are: (1)\napplied to or placed on the land in a\nmanner that constitutes disposal; or\n(2)\ncontained in products that are applied to\nthe land (in which case the product remains a solid waste). (b) Commercial chemical products listed in\nsection\n371.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart are not solid wastes if they are applied to the land and that is their\nordinary manner of use. (ii)\n\nBurning for energy recovery. (a) Materials noted with an asterisk in\ncolumn 2 of Table 1 are solid wastes when they are: (1)\nburned to recover energy; or\n(2)\nused to produce a fuel or are otherwise\ncontained in fuels (in which case the fuel itself remains a solid\nwaste). (b) However, commercial chemical products listed in section\n371.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart are not solid waste if they are fuels. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided under subparagraph\n(e)(1)(xxii) of this section, reclaimed materials noted with an asterisk in\ncolumn 3 of Table 1 are solid wastes when reclaimed. Materials noted with a \"-\"\nin column 3 of Table 1 are not solid wastes when reclaimed. (iv)\n\nMaterials accumulated speculatively\nnoted with an asterisk in column 4 of Table 1 are solid waste when accumulated\nspeculatively. (5)\n\nInherently waste-like materials. The following materials are solid wastes when\nthey are recycled in any manner: (i) Hazardous\nwaste numbers F020, F021 (unless used as an ingredient to make a product at the\nsite of generation), F022, F023, F026 and F028. (ii)\n\nSecondary materials fed to a halogen\nacid furnace that exhibit a characteristic of a hazardous waste or are listed\nas a hazardous waste as defined in section\n371.3\nor\n371.4\nof this Part, except for\nbrominated material that meets the following criteria: (a) the material must contain a bromine\nconcentration of at least 45 percent; (b) the material must contain less than a\ntotal of one percent of toxic organic compounds listed in Appendix 23; and\n(c) the material is processed\ncontinually on-site in the halogen acid furnace via direct conveyance (hard\npiping). (iii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will use the following criteria to add waste to that list: (a) the materials are ordinarily disposed of, burned or incinerated; or\n(b) the\nmaterials contain toxic constituents listed in Appendix 23, infra, and these constituents are not ordinarily found in raw\nmaterials or products for which the materials substitute (or are found in raw\nmaterials or products in smaller concentrations) and are not used or reused\nduring the recycling process; and\n(c) the materials may pose a substantial\nhazard to human health and the environment when\nrecycled. (6)\n\nMaterials that are not solid waste when recycled, though they remain solid\nwaste as defined under section\n360.2\nof this Title. (i) Materials are not solid waste when they\ncan be shown to be recycled by being: (a) used or reused as ingredients in an industrial process to make a product, provided the materials are not being reclaimed; or\n(b) used or reused as effective substitutes\nfor commercial products; or\n(c) returned to the original process from which they are generated, without first\nbeing reclaimed or land disposed. The material must be returned as a substitute\nfor feedstock materials. In cases where the original process to which the\nmaterial is returned is a secondary process, the materials must be managed such\nthat there is no placement on the land. (ii)\n\nThe following materials are solid\nwastes, even if the recycling involves use, reuse, or return to the process as\ndescribed in clauses (i)(\na\n) through (\nc\n) of\nthis paragraph: (a) materials used in a manner\nconstituting disposal, or used to produce products that are applied to the\nland; or\n(b) materials burned for\nenergy recovery, used to produce fuel, or contained in fuels; or\n(c) materials accumulated speculatively; or\n(d) materials listed in\nsubparagraphs (5)(i) and (ii) of this subdivision. (7)\n(i) Parties who raise a claim that a material\nintended to be reclaimed, recycled or reused is not a solid or hazardous waste, or who raise a claim that such material is exempt or conditionally exempt from\nregulation, must notify the department, in writing, before utilizing the\nexemption or exclusion. Such notification shall give the names and locations of\nthe generating and receiving facilities, identify all exemptions or exclusions\nthat the party is claiming, and describe the activity or activities which are\nbelieved to qualify for such exemptions or exclusions. Claims of exemption or\nexclusion are subject to subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. The requirement\nto submit notification to the department does not apply to: (a) dental amalgam as defined and regulated\nunder Subpart 374-4 of this Title; (b) precious metals regulated under section\n374-1.6\nof this Title; (c) used lead acid batteries regulated under\nsection\n374-1.7\nor Subpart 374-3 of this\n\nTitle; or\n(d) used electronics\ndirected for dismantling and recycling, meeting the conditions of clause\n371.1(g)(1)(iii)(\nb\n) or subparagraph (e)(1)(xxi) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nDocumentation of claims that materials are not solid wastes or are exempt or\nconditionally exempt from regulation. Parties who raise a claim that a material\nintended to be reclaimed, recycled or reused is not a solid or hazardous waste, or who raise a claim that such material is exempt or conditionally exempt from\nregulation, must maintain documentation on-site of the basis for this\nexemption. Respondents in actions to enforce regulations, implementing ECL\narticle 27, who raise a claim that a certain material is not a solid or\nhazardous waste, or is exempt or conditionally exempt from regulation must\ndemonstrate: (a) that there is a known market\nor disposition for the material; (b) that the owner or operator of the\nreceiving facility has the necessary equipment and capacity to process the\nentire volume of material offered; and\n(c) through appropriate documentation, such\nas contracts, that the receiving party will reclaim, recycle, use, or reuse the\nmaterial in such a manner as to qualify it for the exemption or exclusion.

(d) Definition of hazardous\nwaste. (1)\nA solid waste, as defined\nin subdivision (c) of this section, is a hazardous waste if: (i) it is not excluded from regulation as a\nhazardous waste under paragraph (e)(2) of this section; and\n(ii)\nit meets any of the following criteria: (a) it exhibits any of the characteristics of\nhazardous waste identified in section\n371.3\nof this Part. However, any\nmixture of a waste from the extraction, beneficiation, and processing of ores\nand minerals excluded under subdivision (e)(2)(vi) of this section and any\nother solid waste exhibiting a characteristic of hazardous waste under section\n371.3\nof this Part is a hazardous\nwaste only if it exhibits a characteristic that would not have been exhibited\nby the excluded waste alone if such mixture had not occurred, or if it\ncontinues to exhibit any of the characteristics exhibited by the nonexcluded\nwastes prior to mixture. Further, for the purposes of applying the toxicity\ncharacteristic to such mixtures, the mixture is also a hazardous waste if it\nexceeds the maximum concentration for any contaminant listed in table 1 in\nsection\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nPart that would not have been exceeded by the excluded waste alone if the\nmixture had not occurred or if it continues to exceed the maximum concentration\nfor any contaminant exceeded by the nonexempt waste prior to mixture. (b) It is listed in section\n371.4\nof this Part and has not been\nexcluded from the lists in section\n371.4\nunder the provisions of\nsection\n370.3\n(a) and (c)\nof this Title. (c) [\nReserved\n]\n(d) It\nis a mixture of solid waste and one or more hazardous wastes listed in section\n371.4\nof this Part and has not been\nexcluded from this subparagraph under section\n370.3\n(a) and (c)\nof this Title, or paragraph (6) or (7) of this subdivision; however, the\nfollowing mixtures of solid wastes and hazardous wastes listed in section\n371.4\nof this Part are not\nhazardous wastes (except by application of clause (\na\n) or\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph) if the generator can demonstrate\nthat the mixture consists of wastewater the discharge of which is subject to\nregulation under either section 402 or section 307(b) of the Clean Water Act\n(see section\n370.1\n[e][7][iii]\nof this Title) (including wastewater at facilities which have eliminated the\ndischarge of wastewater) and: (1)\none or more\nof the following spent solvents listed in section\n371.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart-benzene, carbon tetrachloride, tetrachloroethylene, trichloroethylene or\nthe scrubber waters derived from the combustion of these spent\nsolvents-provided that the maximum total weekly usage of these solvents (other\nthan the amounts that can be demonstrated not to be discharged to wastewater), divided by the average weekly flow of wastewater into the headworks of the\nfacility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment system does not exceed 1 part\nper million, or that the total measured concentration of these solvents\nentering the headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment system (at\nfacilities subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, as amended at 40 CFR\nparts\n60, 61, or\n63, as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\nof this Title, or at\nfacilities subject to an enforceable limit in a State operating permit that\nminimizes fugitive emissions), does not exceed 1 part per million on an average\nweekly basis. Any facility that uses benzene as a solvent and claims this\nexemption must use an aerated biological wastewater treatment system and must\nuse only lined surface impoundments or tanks prior to secondary clarification\nin the wastewater treatment system. Facilities that choose to monitor\nconcentration levels must file a copy of their quality assurance project plan\nwith the department at least 60 days prior to operating under this exemption. A\nfacility must file a copy of a revised quality assurance project plan only if\nthe initial plan is rendered inaccurate by changes in the facility's\noperations. A facility must file a copy of a revised quality assurance project\nplan to the department at least 30 days prior to modifying facility operations. The quality assurance project plan must include the monitoring point location\n(headworks), the sampling frequency and methodology, and a list of constituents\nto be monitored. A facility is eligible for the direct monitoring option once\nit receives confirmation that its quality assurance project plan has been\nreceived by the department. The department may reject the quality assurance\nproject plan if the department finds that the quality assurance project plan\nfails to include the above information; or the plan parameters would not enable\nthe facility to calculate the weekly average concentration of these chemicals\naccurately. If the department rejects the quality assurance project plan or if\nthe department finds that the facility is not following the quality assurance\nproject plan, the department shall notify the facility to cease the use of the\ndirect monitoring option until such time as the bases for rejection are\ncorrected; or\n(2)\none or more of\nthe following spent solvents listed in section\n371.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart-methylene chloride, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, chlorobenzene, o-dichlorobenzene, cresols, cresylic acid, nitrobenzene, toluene, methyl ethyl\nketone, carbon disulfide, isobutanol, pyridine, spent chlorofluorocarbon\nsolvents, 2-ethoxyethanol, or scrubber waters derived-from the combustion of\nthese spent solvents-provided that the maximum total weekly usage of these\nsolvents (other than the amounts that can be demonstrated not be discharged to\nwastewater), divided by the average weekly flow of wastewater into the\nheadworks of the facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment system does\nnot exceed 25 parts per million or the total measured concentration of these\nsolvents entering the headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment system\n(at facilities subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act, as amended at 40\nCFR parts\n60, 61, or\n63, as incorporated by reference and implemented by\nsection\n200.10\nof this Title, or at\nfacilities subject to an enforceable limit in a State operating permit that\nminimizes fugitive emissions), does not exceed 25 parts per million on an\naverage weekly basis. Facilities that choose to monitor concentration levels\nmust file a copy of their quality assurance project plan with the department at\nleast 60 days prior to operating under this exemption. A facility must file a\ncopy of a revised quality assurance project plan only if the initial plan is\nrendered inaccurate by changes in the facility's operations. A facility must\nfile a copy of a revised quality assurance project plan to the department at\nleast 30 days prior to modifying facility operations. The quality assurance\nproject plan must include the monitoring point location (headworks), the\nsampling frequency and methodology, and a list of constituents to be monitored. A facility is eligible for the direct monitoring option once it receives\nconfirmation that the quality assurance project plan has been received by the\ndepartment. The department may reject the quality assurance project plan if the\ndepartment finds that the quality assurance project plan fails to include the\nabove information; or the plan parameters would not enable the facility to\ncalculate the weekly average concentration of these chemicals accurately. If\nthe department rejects the quality assurance project plan or if the department\nfinds that the facility is not following the quality assurance project plan, the department shall notify the facility to cease the use of the direct\nmonitoring option until such time as the bases for rejection are corrected; or\n(3)\none of the following wastes\nlisted in section\n371.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart, provided that the wastes are discharged to the refinery oil recovery\nsewer before primary oil/water/solids separation-heat exchanger bundle cleaning\nsludge from the petroleum refining industry (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K050), crude oil storage tank sediment from petroleum refining operations (EPA\nHazardous Waste No. K169), clarified slurry oil tank sediment and/or in-line\nfilter/separation solids from petroleum refining operations (EPA hazardous\nwaste No. K170), spent hydrotreating catalyst, (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K171), and spent hydrorefining catalyst (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K172); or\n(4)\na discarded hazardous waste, commercial\nchemical product, or chemical intermediate listed in section\n371.4\n(b) through\n(d) of this Part arising from\nde\nminimis\nlosses of these materials. For purposes of this subclause\n(\n4\n) of this clause, de minimis\nlosses are\ninadvertent releases to a wastewater treatment system. De\nminimis\nlosses include minor losses resulting from normal material\nhandling operations (\ne.g., spills from the unloading or\ntransfer of materials from bins or other containers, leaks from pipes, valves\nor other devices used to transfer materials); minor leaks of process equipment, storage tanks or containers; leaks from well-maintained pump packings and\nseals; sample purgings; relief device discharges; discharges from safety\nshowers and rinsing and cleaning of personal safety equipment; and rinsate from\nempty containers or from containers that are rendered empty by that rinsing. Any manufacturing facility that claims an exemption for\nde\nminimis\nquantities of wastes listed in sections\n371.4\n(b) through\n371.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart, or any nonmanufacturing facility that claims an exemption for\nde\nminimis\nquantities of wastes listed in section\n371.4\nof this Part must either have\neliminated the discharge of wastewaters or have included in its State Pollutant\n\nDischarge Elimination System (SPDES) permit application, pursuant to Part 750\nof this Title, or submission to its pretreatment control authority, the\nconstituents for which each waste was listed (in Part 371 Appendix 22 of this\n\nPart) and the constituents in the table Treatment Standards for Hazardous\n\nWastes in Part 376.4 of this Title for which each waste has a treatment\nstandard (\ni.e., Land Disposal Restriction constituents). A\nfacility is eligible to claim the exemption once the permit writer or the\ncontrol authority has been notified of possible\nde minimis\nreleases via the SPDES permit application or the pretreatment control authority\nsubmission. A copy of the SPDES permit application or the submission to the\npretreatment control authority must be placed in the facility's on-site files; or\n(5)\nwastewater resulting from\nlaboratory operations containing any toxic (T) wastes listed in section\n371.4\nof this Part, provided that\nthe annualized average flow of laboratory wastewater does not exceed one\npercent of total wastewater flow into the headworks of the facility's\nwastewater treatment or pretreatment system, or provided the wastes' combined\nannualized average concentration does not exceed one mg/l in the headworks of\nthe facility's wastewater treatment or pretreatment facility. The annualized\naverage flow means the total flow registered for the calendar year divided by\nthe number of operating days of the laboratory. The combined annualized average\nconcentration means the weight of the combination of wastes divided by the\nannualized average flow. Toxic (T) wastes used in laboratories that are\ndemonstrated not to be discharged to wastewater are not to be included in this\ncalculation; or\n(6)\none or more of\nthe following wastes listed in section\n371.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart-wastewaters from the production of carbamates and carbamoyl oximes (EPA\nHazardous Waste No. K157)-provided that the maximum weekly usage of\nformaldehyde, methyl chloride, methylene chloride, and triethylamine (including\nall amounts that cannot be demonstrated to be reacted in the process, destroyed\nthrough treatment, or is recovered, i.e., what is discharged\nor volatilized) divided by the average weekly flow of process wastewater prior\nto any dilution into the headworks of the facility's wastewater treatment\nsystem does not exceed a total of five parts per million by weight or the total\nmeasured concentration of these chemicals entering the headworks of the\nfacility's wastewater treatment system (at facilities subject to regulation\nunder the Clean Air Act as amended, at 40 CFR Parts\n60, 61\nor\n63\nas\nincorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\nof this Title, or at\nfacilities subject to an enforceable limit in a State operating permit that\nminimizes fugitive emissions), does not exceed five parts per million on an\naverage weekly basis. Facilities that choose to monitor concentration levels\nmust file a copy of their quality assurance project plan with the department at\nleast 60 days prior to operating under this exemption. A facility must file a\ncopy of a revised quality assurance project plan only if the initial plan is\nrendered inaccurate by changes in the facility's operations. A facility must\nfile a copy of a revised quality assurance project plan to the department at\nleast 30 days prior to modifying facility operations. The quality assurance\nproject plan must include the monitoring point location (headworks), the\nsampling frequency and methodology, and a list of constituents to be monitored. A facility is eligible for the direct monitoring option once it receives\nconfirmation that the quality assurance project plan has been received by the\ndepartment. The department may reject the quality assurance project plan if the\ndepartment finds that the quality assurance project plan fails to include the\nabove information; or the plan parameters would not enable the facility to\ncalculate the weekly average concentration of these chemicals accurately. If\nthe department rejects the quality assurance project plan or if the department\nfinds that the facility is not following the quality assurance project plan, the department shall notify the facility to cease the use of the direct\nmonitoring option until such time as the bases for rejection are corrected; or\n(7)\nwastewaters derived from the\ntreatment of one or more of the following wastes listed in section\n371.4\n(c) of this\n\nPart-organic waste (including heavy ends, still bottoms, light ends, spent\nsolvents, filtrates, and decantates) from the production of carbamates and\ncarbamoyl oximes (EPA Hazardous Waste No. K156)-provided, that the maximum\nconcentration of formaldehyde, methyl chloride, methylene chloride, and\ntriethylamine prior to any dilutions into the headworks of the facility's\nwastewater treatment system does not exceed a total of five milligrams per\nliter or the total measured concentration of these chemicals entering the\nheadworks of the facility's wastewater treatment system (at facilities subject\nto regulation under the Clean Air Act as amended, at 40 CFR parts\n60, 61, or\n63\nas incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\nof this Title, or at\nfacilities subject to an enforceable limit in a State operating permit that\nminimizes fugitive emissions), does not exceed 5 milligrams per liter on an\naverage weekly basis. Facilities that choose to monitor concentration levels\nmust file a copy of their quality assurance project plan with the department at\nleast 60 days prior to operating under this exemption. A facility must file a\ncopy of a revised quality assurance project plan only if the initial plan is\nrendered inaccurate by changes in the facility's operations. A facility must\nfile a copy of a revised quality assurance project plan to the department at\nleast 30 days prior to modifying facility operations. The quality assurance\nproject plan must include the monitoring point location (headworks), the\nsampling frequency and methodology, and a list of constituents to be monitored. A facility is eligible for the direct monitoring option once it receives\nconfirmation that the quality assurance project plan has been received by the\ndepartment. The department may reject the quality assurance project plan if the\ndepartment finds that the quality assurance project plan fails to include the\nabove information; or the plan parameters would not enable the facility to\ncalculate the weekly average concentration of these chemicals accurately. If\nthe department rejects the quality assurance project plan or if the department\nfinds that the facility is not following the quality assurance project plan, the department shall notify the facility to cease the use of the direct\nmonitoring option until such time as the bases for rejection are\ncorrected. (e) Rebuttable\npresumption for used oil. Used oil containing more than 1,000 ppm total\nhalogens is presumed to be a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with\nhalogenated hazardous waste listed in section\n371.4. Persons may rebut this\npresumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain hazardous waste\n(for example, by demonstrating that the used oil does not contain significant\nconcentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents listed in Appendix 23). (1)\n\nThe rebuttable presumption does not apply\nto metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are\nprocessed, through a tolling agreement, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply to metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are\nrecycled in any other manner, or disposed. (2)\n\nThe rebuttable presumption does not apply\nto used oils contaminated with chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from\nrefrigeration units where the CFCs are destined for reclamation. The rebuttable\npresumption does apply to used oils contaminated with CFCs that have been mixed\nwith used oil from sources other than refrigeration\nunits. (2)\nA solid waste which is not excluded from\nregulation under subparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision becomes a hazardous\nwaste when any of the following events occur: (i) In the case of a waste listed in section\n371.4, when the waste first meets\nthe listing description therein. (ii)\n\nIn the case of a mixture of solid waste\nand one or more listed hazardous wastes, when a hazardous waste listed in\nsection\n371.4\nis first added to the solid\nwaste. (iii)\n\nIn the case of any\nother waste (including a waste mixture), when the waste exhibits any of the\ncharacteristics identified in section\n371.3. (3)\n\nUnless and until it meets the criteria of\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision: (i) A\nhazardous waste will remain a hazardous waste. (ii)\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in clause (\nb\n) of this\nsubparagraph, paragraph (6) or (7) of this subdivision, any solid waste\ngenerated from the treatment, storage or disposal of a hazardous waste, including any sludge, spill residue, ash, emission control dust or leachate\n(but not including precipitation runoff), is a hazardous waste. (However, materials that are reclaimed from solid waste and used beneficially are not\nsolid waste and hence are not hazardous waste under this provision unless the\nreclaimed material is burned for energy recovery or used in a manner\nconstituting disposal.)\n(b) The\nfollowing solid waste is not hazardous even though it is generated from the\ntreatment, storage, or disposal of a hazardous waste, unless it exhibits one or\nmore of the characteristics of hazardous waste: (1)\n\nWaste pickle liquor sludge generated by\nlime stabilization of spent pickle liquor from the iron and steel industry (SIC\ncodes 331 and 332).

The notification and certification that is placed\nin the generator's or treater's files must be updated if the process or\noperation generating the waste changes and/or if the solid waste management\nfacility receiving the waste changes. However, the generator or treater need\nonly notify the department on an annual basis if such changes occur. Such\nnotification and certification should be sent to the department no later than\nthe end of the calendar year. The notification must include the following\ninformation: the name and address of the solid waste management facility\nreceiving the waste shipments; the EPA hazardous waste number(s) and\ntractability group(s) at the initial point of generation; and, the treatment\nstandards applicable to the waste at the initial point of generation. The\ncertification must be signed by an authorized representative and must state as\nfollows: \"I certify under penalty of law that the generic exclusion\nlevels for all constituents have been met without impermissible dilution and\nthat no characteristic of hazardous waste is exhibited.

This exclusion is\nconditioned on there being no land disposal of the wastes from the point they\nare generated to the point they are recycled to coke ovens or tar recovery or\nrefining processes, or mixed with coal tar; and\n(xi)\nnonwastewater splash condenser dross\nresidue from the treatment of K061 in high temperature metals recovery units, provided it is shipped in drums (if shipped) and not land disposed before\nrecovery; (xii)\n(a) oil-bearing hazardous secondary materials\n(\ni.e., sludges, byproducts, or spent materials) that are\ngenerated at a petroleum refinery (SIC code 2911) and are inserted into the\npetroleum refining process (SIC code 2911 - including, but not limited to, distillation, catalytic cracking, fractionation, or thermal cracking units\n[\ni.e., cokers]) unless the material is placed on the land, or\nspeculatively accumulated before being so recycled. Materials inserted into\nthermal cracking units are excluded under this paragraph, provided that the\ncoke product also does not exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste. Oil-bearing hazardous secondary materials may be inserted into the same\npetroleum refinery where they are generated, or sent directly to another\npetroleum refinery, and still be excluded under this provision. Except as\nprovided in clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, oil-bearing\nhazardous secondary materials generated elsewhere in the petroleum industry\n(\ni.e., from sources other than petroleum refineries) are not\nexcluded under this section. Residuals generated from processing or recycling\nmaterials excluded under this paragraph, where such materials as generated\nwould have otherwise met a listing under section\n371.4\nof this Part, are designated\nas F037 listed wastes when disposed of or intended for disposal; (b) recovered oil that is recycled in the\nsame manner and with the same conditions as described in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph.
