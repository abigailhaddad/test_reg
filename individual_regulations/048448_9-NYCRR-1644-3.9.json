  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1644-3.9 - Periodic provision for amortization\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payments of amortization on housing bonds\nare made in equal annual installments, the first payment being, ordinarily, made two years from the date of issue, and the last payment 50 years from the\ndate of issue. The indicated amount of each installment of amortization is, therefore, one forty-ninth of the principal amount of the bond issue. The\n\nComptroller, however, reserves some discretion over the date the first equal\nannual payment of amortization is payable, as article XVIII of the State\n\nConstitution (the housing amendment) merely states that the first such payment\nshall be payable not more than three years from the date of issue of the bonds. In making provision for the amortization, the local agency will be guided by a\nschedule of amortization payments, provided by the division, subsequent to the\nissuance of bonds, in which the amount of each installment to be made over the\nlife of the bonds will be listed. (b) The provision for amortization will\nordinarily be made at the end of each quarter beginning with the date of\nsubstantial completion or the date of issue of the bonds, whichever is later. No provision for amortization shall be made prior to the date of substantial\ncompletion, even though bonds may have been issued prior to that date. Quarterly provision for the first installment of amortization shall be made by\ndistributing the amount of the installment evenly over the period between the\ndate of substantial completion, or the date of issue of the bonds, whichever is\nlater, and the date the amortization is due to be paid to the bondholders. Thus, if bonds were issued December 1, 1948 and the project was declared\nsubstantially completed on January 1, 1949, the quarterly provision would\ncommence with January, 1949, in an amount equal to three twenty- thirds of the\nfirst amortization payment which would, normally, be due on December 1, 1950. If the date of substantial completion was July 1, 1949, the quarterly provision\nwould commence with July, 1949, at the rate of three seventeenths of the first\namortizations payment, and so on. Thereafter, the quarterly provision for\namortization will be three twelfths of the annual amortization payment next to\nbe made, etc. The provision for a fractional part of a month is computed on the\nbasis of a 30-day month, exactly as is the provision for interest on the bonds\n(see §\n1644-3.3, supra). The entry for the\nquarterly provision for amortization is made at the end of each quarter, by\njournal voucher, as follows: Entry (4): Debit: Account 4717, Amortization of Indebtedness\n$XXX\nCredit: Account 2600, Accumulated Amortization\n$XXX\nExplanation:To record quarterly provision for\namortization on housing bond issue no. ________. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1644-3.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
