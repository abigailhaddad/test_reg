  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 495-1.7 - Calculating GIE Emissions\n\nState Regulations\nGIE owners must use the following equation to calculate\ntheir rolling 3-year average GIE emissions. Click\nto view image\nwhere: CO2eavg is the GIE owner's 3-year rolling average\nemissions of total covered insulation gas emissions in metric tons CO2e; and\n\nExCO2ei is the GIE owner's annual GIE emissions excluding\nemergency events or total covered insulating gas emissions in metric tons CO2e\nin current reporting data year i. (b) GIE owners must use the following equation to calculate their annual GIE\nemissions. Click\nto view image\nwhere: CO2ei is the GIE owner's annual GIE emissions or total\ncovered insulating gas emissions in metric tons CO2e in data year i; n is the number of covered insulating gases j; GWPj is the GWP20 of covered insulating gas j; Emissionsj,i is the annual emissions in pounds of covered\ninsulating gas j in data year i calculated pursuant to\ntitle 17\nof the\n\nCalifornia Code of Regulations section 95354.1(a) incorporated by reference\nherein, per section 495-1.15 of this Part; and\n2204.62 is the number of pounds in a metric ton. (c) Annual GIE Emissions Excluding\n\nEmergency Events. GIE owners may calculate annual GIE emissions excluding\nemergency events pursuant to section 495-1.11 of this Part. This calculation is\nsubject to review by the department per section 495-1.8 of this Part. Click\nto view image\nwhere: ExCO2ei is the GIE owner's annual GIE emissions or total\ncovered insulating gas emissions in data year i, excluding emissions from\nemergency events for data year i, in metric tons CO2e; n is the number of covered insulating gases j; GWPj is the GWP20 of covered insulating gas j released\nduring events, number may be zero if no events have occurred during data year\ni; E.E. Emissionsj,i is the annual emissions of gas j in\npounds from all emergency event exemptions during data year i; and\n2204.62 is the number of pounds in a metric ton. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
