  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 328.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subparagraphs\n(b) and (d) of section\n41\n(i)(1)\nand\n341\n(i)(1)\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, hereinafter referred to as subparagraphs (b) and subparagraphs (d), provide that time during which a member of the Retirement System is on an\nofficial leave of absence without pay from his or her position may be included\nin the computation of member service and final average salary. Subparagraphs\n(b) provide that the time spent on such a leave may be so included only if the\nhead of the department in which such member is employed, and the State\n\nComptroller, allow such time for retirement purposes at the time such leave is\ngranted. Subparagraphs (d) provide that the time spent on certain specified\ntypes of such leave may be so included only if: (1)\nthe leave is granted for not more than\ntwo years; (2)\nthe State\n\nComptroller allows inclusion of such time for retirement purposes at the time\nsuch leave is granted; and\n(3)\ncertain required payments are made to the Retirement System. (b) The purpose of these\nprovisions of law is to permit Retirement System members, under certain\ncircumstances and with the express prior approvals noted above, to leave the\nservice of the State or a participating employer temporarily, and continue to\naccrue retirement credit during such leave, since the experience and training\ngained as a result thereof will be of benefit to the State or participating\nemployer upon the employee member's return to public service. The granting of\nsuch credits during the time spent on such leaves is contingent upon the\nemployee member's actual return to service with the State or the participating\nemployer and to the actual performance of the duties of his or her\nposition. (c) This regulation is\npromulgated to establish the guidelines applicable in granting credit for\nservice and final average salary for the period of an authorized leave of\nabsence without pay.
