Tit. 9 § 4550.11 - Penalties\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll penalties imposed by the commission, and all license\nsuspensions, fines, exclusions and other sanctions imposed by the commission\nupon any person charged shall continue in full force and effect until the\ndetermination of the commission is rendered, unless otherwise directed in\nwriting by the commission. In this regard, the commission may reduce, increase, modify, or substitute any penalty, license suspension, fine, exclusion, or\nother sanction after review of the record of the administrative proceeding. In\naddition, the commission may assess an additional penalty, upon notice and\nopportunity to be heard at a hearing, if the commission finds that any appeal\ntaken from a ruling was frivolous. A frivolous appeal is one commenced in bad\nfaith or for purposes of delay or is one that is unreasonable and without\nsubstance or merit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4550.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
