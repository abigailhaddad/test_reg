(3)\n\nFailure to call witness. The fact that a witness' name is on a list of expected or\nintended witnesses provided to an opposing party, whether required by this\nsubdivision or not, is not ground for comment upon a failure to call the\nwitness.

If the military judge grants relief after\nsuch an ex parte showing, the entire text of the party's statement must be\nsealed and attached to the record of trial as an appellate exhibit. Such\nmaterial may be examined by reviewing authorities in closed proceedings for the\npurpose of reviewing the determination of the military judge. (iii)\n\nFailure to comply. If at any time\nduring the court-martial it is brought to the attention of the military judge\nthat a party has failed to comply with this subdivision, the military judge may\ntake one or more of the following actions: (a) order the party to permit\ndiscovery; (b) grant a\ncontinuance; (c) prohibit the party\nfrom introducing evidence or raising a defense not disclosed; and\n(d) enter such other order as is just under\nthe circumstances. This subdivision does not limit the right of the accused to\ntestify in the accused's behalf. (8)\n\nInspect. As used in this subdivision\ninspect\nincludes the right to photograph and copy.

(c) Notification of decision. The authority\nwho acts on the request must promptly inform the requesting party of the action\non the request and, if the request is denied, the reasons for denial. (d) Waiver. Failure to renew before the\nmilitary judge a request for a deposition denied by a convening authority\nwaives further consideration of the request.

(b) Examination of witnesses. Each witness giving an oral disposition must be\nexamined under oath. The scope and manner of examination and cross-examination\nmust be such as would be allowed in the trial itself. The government must make\navailable to each accused for examination and use at the taking of the\ndeposition any statement of the witness which is in the possession of the State\nor other document and to which the accused would be entitled at the\ntrial.

The testimony of the witness must be\nrecorded on videotape, audiotape, or similar material or must be transcribed. When the testimony is transcribed, the deposition must, except when\nimpracticable, be submitted to the witness for examination. The deposition\nofficer may enter additional matters then stated by the witness under oath. The\ndeposition must be signed by the witness if the witness is available. If the\ndeposition is not signed by the witness, the deposition officers must record\nthe reason. The certificate of authentication must then be executed. (iii)\n\nHow recorded. In the\ndiscretion of the authority who ordered the deposition, a deposition may be\nrecorded by a reporter or by other means including videotape, audiotape, or\nsound film. In the discretion of the military judge, depositions recorded\nvideotape, audiotape, or sound film may be played for the court-martial or may\nbe transcribed and read to the court-martial. (8)\n\nObjections. (i) In general. A failure to object prior to\nthe deposition to the taking of the deposition on grounds which may be\ncorrected if the objection is made prior to the deposition waives such\nobjection. (ii)\n\nOral depositions. Objections to questions, testimony, or evidence at an oral deposition and the\ngrounds for such objection must be stated at the time of taking such\ndeposition. If an objection relates to a matter which could have been corrected\nif the objection had been made during the deposition, the objection is waived\nif not made at the deposition.

Subject to 130.49(d), ML, nothing in this rule precludes the use\nof a deposition at the court-martial by agreement of the parties unless the\nmilitary judge forbids its use for good cause. (c) Production of witnesses\nand evidence. (1)\n\nIn general. The prosecution and defense and the court-martial are to\nhave equal opportunity to obtain witnesses and evidence, including the benefit\nof compulsory process. Compulsory process runs to any part of the State and to\nany other state in which the court-martial may be sitting (see 130.46, ML). Military courts are empowered to issue all process and mandates necessary and\nproper to carry into full force and effect the powers vested in them (ML, 131.7[a]). (2)\n\nRight to\nwitnesses. (i) On the merits or on\ninterlocutory questions. Each party is entitled to the production of any\nwitness whose testimony on a matter in issue on the merits or on an\ninterlocutory question would be relevant and necessary. (ii)\n\nOn sentencing. Each party is entitled to\nthe production of witness whose testimony on sentencing is required under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 1001(e). (iii)\n\nUnavailable witness. Notwithstanding subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph, a party is not entitled to the presence of a witness who is\nunavailable within the meaning of Mil. R. Evid. 804(a). However, if the\ntestimony of a witness who is unavailable is of such central importance to an\nissue that it is essential to a fair trial, and if there is no adequate\nsubstitute for such testimony, the military judge must grant a continuance or\nother relief in order to attempt to secure the witness' presence or must abate\nthe proceedings, unless the unavailability of the witness is the fault of or\ncould have been prevented by the requesting party. (3)\n\nDetermining which witness will be\nproduced. (i) Witnesses for the prosecution. The trial counsel must obtain the presence of witnesses whose testimony the\ntrial counsel considers relevant and necessary for the prosecution. (ii)\n\nWitnesses for the defense. (a) Request. The defense must submit to the\ntrial counsel a written list of witnesses whose production by the State the\ndefense requests. (b) Contents of\nrequest. (1)\n\nWitnesses on merits or\ninterlocutory questions. A list of witnesses whose testimony the defense\nconsiders relevant and necessary on the merits or on an interlocutory question\nmust include the name, telephone number, if known, an address or location of\nthe witness such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of due\ndiligence and a synopsis of the expected testimony sufficient to show its\nrelevance and necessity. (2)\n\nWitnesses on sentencing. A list of witnesses wanted for presentencing\nproceedings must include the name, telephone number, if known, and address or\nlocation of the witness such that the witness can be found upon the exercise of\ndue diligence, a synopsis of the testimony that it is expected the witness will\ngive, and the reasons why the witness' personal appearance will be necessary\nunder the standards set forth in N.Y.R.C.M. 1001(e). (c) Time of request. A list of witnesses\nunder this subsection must be submitted in time reasonably to allow production\nof each witness on the date when the witness' presence will be necessary. The\nmilitary judge may set a specific date by which such lists must be submitted. Failure to submit the name of a witness in a timely manner permits denial of a\nmotion for production of the witness, but relief from such denial may be\ngranted for good cause shown. (d) Determination. The trial counsel must arrange for the presence of any witness\nlisted by the defense unless the trial counsel contends that the witness'\nproduction is not required under this subdivision. If the trial counsel\ncontends that the witness' production is not required by this subdivision, the\nmatter may be submitted to the military judge. If the military judge grants a\nmotion for a witness, the trial counsel must produce the witness or the\nproceedings will be abated. (4)\n\nEmployment of expert witnesses. When the employment at State expense of an expert is\nconsidered necessary by a party, the party must, in advance of employment of\nthe expert, and with notice to the opposing part, submit a request to the\n\nAdjutant General of the State to authorize the employment and to fix the\ncompensation for the expert. The request must include a complete statement of\nreasons why employment of the expert is necessary and the estimated cost of\nemployment. A request denied by the Adjutant General of the State may be\nrenewed before the military judge who must determine whether the testimony of\nthe expert is relevant and necessary, and if so, whether the State has provided\nor will provide an adequate substitute. If the military judge grants a motion\nfor employment of an expert or finds that the State is required to provide a\nsubstitute, the proceedings will be abated if the State fails to comply with\nthe ruling. In the absence of advance authorization, an expert witness may not\nbe paid fees other than those to which entitled under clause (5)(ii)(\nd\n) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nProcedures for production of witnesses. (i) Military witnesses. The attendance of a\nmilitary witness may be obtained by notifying the commander of the witness of\nthe time, place, and date the witness' presence is required and requesting the\ncommander to issue any necessary orders to the witness.

A subpoena must state the command by which the proceding is directed, and the\ntitle, if any, of the proceeding. A subpoena must command each person to whom\nit is directed to attend and give testimony at the time and place specified\ntherein. A subpoena may also command the person to whom it is directed to\nproduce books, papers, documents or other objects designated therein at the\nproceeding or at an earlier time for inspection by the parties. (c) Who may issue. A subpoena may be issued\nby the summary court-martial, provost courts, and the military judge or\npresident of other military courts to secure witnesses or evidence for that\ncourt-martial. (d) Service. A\nsubpoena may be served by any person at least 18 years of age; the marshals of\nthe military court or any peace officer as defined in section\n2.10\nof the Criminal Procedure Law, when\nacting pursuant to his special duties, or any police officer. Service is made\nby delivering a copy of the subpoena to the person named and by tendering to\nthe person named the fees and mileage of a witness at the rates allowed to\nwitnesses attending the Supreme Court of the State (See CPLR 8001). (See\n\nAppendices 4 and 5 for format.)\n(e) Place for service. (1)\n\nIn general. A subpoena\nrequiring the attendance of a witness at a deposition, court-martial, or court\nof inquiry may be served at any place within the State or within any other\nstate in which the court-martial may be sitting. (2)\n\nForeign territory. In foreign territory, the attendance of civilian witnesses may be obtained in accordance with\nexisting agreements or, in the absence of agreements, with principles of\ninternational law.

(2)\n\nIssuance of warrant of attachment. The\nmilitary judge or, if there is no military judge, the convening authority may, in accordance with this subdivision, issue a warrant of attachment to compel\nthe attendance of a witness or production of documents (ML, 131.7[a]). (3)\n\nRequirements. A\nwarrant of attachment be issued only upon probable cause to believe that the\nwitness was duly served with a subpoena, that the subpoena was issued in\naccordance with these rules, that appropriate fees and mileage were tendered to\nthe witness, that the witness is material, that the witness refused or\nwillfully neglected to appear at the time and place specified on the subpoena, and that no valid excuse reasonably appear; for the witness' failure to\nappear.

Notwithstanding\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a party is not entitled to the production\nof evidence which is destroyed, lost, or otherwise not subject to compulsory\nprocess. However, if such evidence is of such central importance to an issue\nthat it is essential to a fair trial, and if there is no adequate substitute\nfor such evidence, military judge must grant a continuance or other relief in\norder to produce the evidence or must abate the proceedings, unless the\nunavailability of the evidence is the fault of or could have been prevented by\nthe requesting party. (iii)\n\nDetermining what evidence will be produced.

Subject to Mil. R. Evid. 505 and 506, the military judge may direct that the\nevidence be submitted to the military judge for an in camera inspection in\norder to determine whether such relief should be granted. (d) Immunity. (1)\n\nTypes of immunity. Two types of immunity\nmay be granted under this rule. (i) Transactional immunity.

A grant of immunity must be written and signed by the\nconvening authority who issues it. The grant must include a statement of the\nauthority under which it is made and must identify the matters to which it\nextends. (5)\n\nDecision to\ngrant immunity. Unless limited by superior competent authority, the\ndecision whether to grant immunity is a matter within the sole discretion of\nthe appropriate general court-martial convening authority However, if a defense\nrequest to immunize a witness has been denied, the military judge may, upon\nmotion by the defense, grant appropriate relief directing that either an\nappropriate convening authority grant testimonial immunity to a defense witness\nor, as to the affected charges and specifications, the proceedings against the\naccused be abated, upon findings that: (i) the witness' testimony would be of such\ncentral importance to the defense case that it is essential to a fair trial; and\n(ii)\nthe witness intends to\ninvoke the right against self-incrimination to the extent permitted by law if\ncalled to testify. (e) Pretrial agreements. (1)\n\nIn general. Subject to such limitations as the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor may prescribe, an accused and the convening authority may enter into a\npretrial agreement in accordance with this subdivision. (2)\n\nNature of agreement. A pretrial agreement may include: (i) a promise by the accused to plead guilty\nto, or to enter a confessional stipulation as to one or more charges and\nspecifications, and to fulfill such additional terms or conditions which may be\nincluded in the agreement and which are not prohibited under this subdivision; and\n(ii)\na promise by the convening\nauthority to do one or more of the following: (a) refer the charges to a certain type of\ncourt-martial; (b) refer a capital\noffense as noncapital; (c) withdraw\none or more charges or specifications from the court-martial; (d) have the trial counsel present no\nevidence as to one or more specifications or portions thereof; and\n(e) take specified action on the sentence\nadjudged by the court-martial. (3)\n\nTerms and conditions. (i) Prohibited terms or conditions. (a) Not voluntary. A term or condition in a\npretrial agreement cannot be enforced if the accused did not freely and\nvoluntarily agree to it. (b) Deprivation of certain rights. A term or condition in a pretrial agreement\ncannot be enforced if it deprives the accused of: the right to counsel; the\nright to due process; the right to challenge the jurisdiction of the\ncourt-martial; the right to a speedy trial; the right to complete sentencing\nproceedings; the complete and effective exercise of post-trial and appellate\nrights. (ii)\n\nPermissible\nterms or conditions.

(4)\n\nProcedure. (i) Offer. An offer to plead guilty or to\nenter a confessional stipulation must originate with the accused and defense\ncounsel, if any. (ii)\n\nNegotiation. Upon the initiation of the defense, the convening authority, the staff judge\nadvocate, or the trial counsel may negotiate the terms and conditions of a\npretrial agreement with the defense. All negotiations are to be with defense\ncounsel unless the accused is not represented. (iii)\n\nFormal submission. After negotiation, if any, under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, if the accused elects to\npropose a pretrial agreement, the defense must submit a written offer. All\nterms, conditions, and promises between the parties must be written. The\nproposed agreement must be signed by the accused and defense counsel, if any. If the agreement contains any specified action on the adjudged sentence, such\naction must be set forth on a page separate from the other portion of the\nagreement. (iv)\n\nAcceptance. The\nconvening authority may either accept or reject an offer of the accused to\nenter into a pretrial agreement. The decision is within the sole discretion of\nthe convening authority. When the convening authority has accepted a pretrial\nagreement, the agreement must be signed by the convening authority or by a\nperson, such as the staff judge advocate or trial counsel, who has been\nauthorized by the convening authority to sign. (v) Withdrawal. (a) By accused.

(b) By convening authority. The convening\nauthority may withdraw from a pretrial agreement at any time before the accused\nbegins performance of promises contained in the agreement, or upon the failure\nby the accused to fulfill any material promise or condition in the agreement, or when inquiry by the military judge discloses a disagreement as to a material\nterm in the agreement, or if findings are set aside because a plea of guilty\nentered pursuant to the agreement is held improvident on appellate\nreview. (5)\n\nNondisclosure of existence of agreement. Except in a special court-martial without a military judge, no member of a court-martial is to be informed of the existence of a pretrial\nagreement. In addition, except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 410, the fact that\nan accused offered to enter into a pretrial agreement, and any statements made\nby an accused in connection therewith, whether during negotiations or during a\nprovidence inquiry, must not be otherwise disclosed to the\nmembers. (f) Inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the\naccused. (1)\n\nInitial action. If it appears to any commander who considers the\ndisposition of charges, or to any investigating officer, trial counsel, defense\ncounsel, military judge, or member that there is reason to believe that the\naccused lacked mental responsibility for any offense charged or lacks capacity\nto stand trial, that fact and the basis of the belief or observation must be\ntransmitted through appropriate channels to the officer authorized to order an\ninquiry into the mental condition of the accused. The submission may be\naccompanied by an application for a mental examination under this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nOrdering an\ninquiry. (i) Before referral. Before referral\nof charges an inquiry into the mental capacity or mental responsibility of the\naccused may be ordered by the convening authority before whom the charges are\npending for disposition. (ii)\n\nAfter\nreferral. After referral of charges, an inquiry into the mental capacity or\nmental responsibility of the accused may be ordered by the military judge. The\nconvening authority may order such an inquiry after referral of charges but\nbefore beginning of the first session of the court-martial (including any\nsession under 130.39[a], ML) when the military judge is not reasonably\navailable. The military judge may order a mental examination of the accused\nregardless of any earlier determination by the convening authority. (3)\n\nInquiry. (i) By whom conducted. When a mental\nexamination is ordered under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the matter must\nbe referred to a board consisting of one or more persons. Each member of the\nboard shall be either a physician or a clinical psychologist. Normally at least\none member of the board shall be either a psychiatrist or clinical\npsychologist. The Board shall report as to the mental capacity or mental\nresponsibility or both of the accused. (ii)\n\nMatters in inquiry. When a mental\nexamination is ordered under this subdivision, the order must contain the\nreasons for doubting the mental capacity or mental responsibility, or both, of\nthe accused, or other reasons for requesting the examination. In addition to\nother requirements, the order must require the board to make separate and\ndistinct findings as to each of the following questions: (a) At the time of the alleged criminal\nconduct, did the accused have a severe mental disease or defect? (The term\n\"severe mental disease or defect\" does not include an abnormality manifested\nonly by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, or minor disorders\nsuch as nonpsychotic behavior disorders and personality defects.)\n(b) What is the clinical psychiatric\ndiagnosis?\n(c) Was the accused, at\nthe time of the alleged criminal conduct and as a result of such severe mental\ndisease or defect, unable to appreciate the nature and quality or wrongfulness\nof his or her conduct?\n(d) Did the\naccused, at the time of the alleged criminal conduct and as a result of such\nmental disease or defect, lack substantial capacity to conform the accused's\nconduct to the requirements of law?\n(e) Does the accused have sufficient mental\ncapacity to understand the nature of the proceedings and to conduct or\ncooperate intelligently in the defense?\nOther appropriate questions may also be\nincluded. (iii)\n\nDirections to board. In addition to the requirements specified in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, the order of the board must specify: (a) that upon completion of the board's\ninvestigation, a statement consisting only of the board's ultimate conclusions\nas to all questions specified in the order is to be submitted to the officer\nordering the examination, the accused's commanding officer, the investigating\nofficer, if any, appointed pursuant to 130.32, ML and to all counsel in the\ncase, the convening authority, and, after referral, to the military\njudge; (b) that the full report of\nthe board may be released by the board or other medical personnel only to other\nmedical personnel for medical purposes, unless otherwise authorized by the\nconvening authority or, after referral of charges, by the military judge, except that a copy of the full report is to be furnished to the defense and, upon request, to the commanding officer of the accused; and\n(c) that neither the contents of the full\nreport nor any matter considered by the board during its investigation is to be\nreleased by the board or other medical personnel to any person not authorized\nto receive the full report, except pursuant to an order by the military\njudge. (iv)\n\nAdditional\nexaminations. Additional examinations may be directed under this subdivision at\nany stage of the proceedings as circumstances may require. (v) Disclosure to trial counsel. No person, other than the defense counsel, accused, or, after referral of charges, the\nmilitary judge may disclose to the trial counsel any statement made by the\naccused to the board or any evidence derived from such statement. (g) Speedy\ntrial. (1)\n\nIn general. The accused shall be brought to trial within 120 days after\nnotice to the accused of preferral of charges under N.Y.R.C.M. 308 or the\nimposition of restraint under N.Y.R.C.M. 304, whichever is\nearlier. (2)\n\nAccountability. (i) In general. The date on which the accused\nis notified of the preferral of charges or the date on which pretrial restraint\nis imposed does not count for the purpose of computing the time under paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision. The date on which the accused is brought to trial\ncounts. (ii)\n\nInception. If charges\nare dismissed, if a mistrial is granted, or - when no charges are pending - if\nthe accused is released from pretrial restraint for a significant period, the\ntime under this rule runs only from the date on which charges or restraint are\nreinstituted. (iii)\n\nTermination. An\naccused is brought to trial within the meaning of this subdivision when: (a) a plea of guilty is entered to an\noffense; or\n(b) presentation to the\nfactfinder of evidence on the merits begins. (iv)\n\nMultiple charges. When charges are\npreferred at different times, the inception for each is to be determined from\nthe date on which the accused was notified of preferral or on which restraint\nwas imposed on the basis of that offense. (3)\n\nExclusions. The following periods are to be excluded when determining\nwhether the period in paragraph (1) of this subdivision has run: (i) Any periods of delay resulting from other\nproceedings in the case including: (a) any\nexamination into the mental capacity or responsibility of the\naccused; (b) any hearing on the\ncapacity of the accused to stand trial and any time during which the accused\nlacks capacity to stand trial; (c) any session on pretrial motions; (d) any petition for extraordinary relief by\neither party. (ii)\n\nAny\nperiod of delay resulting from unavailability of a military judge when the\nunavailability results from extraordinary circumstances. (iii)\n\nAny period of delay resulting from a\ndelay in a proceeding or a continuance in the court-martial granted at the\nrequest or with the consent of the defense. (iv)\n\nAny period of delay resulting from a\nfailure of the defense to provide notice, make a request, or submit any matter\nin a timely manner as otherwise required by this Chapter. (v) Any period of delay resulting from a\ndelay in the hearing under ML, 130.32 or a continuance in the court-martial at\nthe request of the prosecution if: (a) the\ndelay or continuance is granted because of unavailability of substantial\nevidence relevant and necessary to the prosecution's case when the State has\nexercised due diligence to obtain such evidence and there exists at the time of\nthe delay grounds to believe that such evidence would be available within a\nreasonable time; or\n(b) the\ncontinuance is granted to allow the trial counsel additional time to prepare\nthe prosecution's case and additional time is justified because of the\nexceptional circumstances of the case. (vi)\n\nAny period of delay resulting from the\nabsence or unavailability of the accused. (vii)\n\nAny reasonable period of delay when the\naccused is joined for trial with a co-accused as to whom the time for trial has\nnot yet run and there is no good cause for not granting a severance. (viii)\n\nAny other period of delay for good\ncause, including unusual operational requirements and military\nexigencies. (4)\n\nArrest or\nconfinement. When the accused is in pretrial arrest or confinement under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 304 or 305, immediate steps shall be taken to bring the accused to\ntrial (ML, 130.10). No accused is to be held in pretrial arrest of confinement\nin excess of 90 days for the same or related charges. Except for any periods\nunder subparagraph (3)(vii) of this subdivision, the periods described in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision are to be excluded for the purpose of\ncomputing when 90 days has run. The military judge may, upon a showing of\nextraordinary circumstances, extend the period by 10 days. (5)\n\nRemedy. Failure to comply with this subdivision results in\ndismissal of the affected charges upon timely motion by the\naccused. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
