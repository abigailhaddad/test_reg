  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 620.4 - Project planning\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The development\nof a comprehensive service delivery system to meet the needs of persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities begins with the identification of those needs and\nthe types of programs with the service capability to meet such needs. This\nshall be done through joint planning efforts on a county, regional and\nstatewide basis by OPWDD, local governmental units and local health systems\nagencies. The local governmental units and local health systems agencies shall\nbe given the opportunity to review operational planning documents developed by\nOPWDD, and to make recommendations to the commissioner. (1)\nOPWDD shall project the number of persons\nwith developmental disabilities in need, as identified by a data based system, on no less than a triennial basis. (2)\nOPWDD shall develop a proposal for an\nideal service/program mix to meet the needs of the identified population and\nprovide this information to the following planning bodies on no less than a\ntriennial basis: (i) B/DDSO-for the services\narea under each B/DDSO's coordination; (ii)\nlocal governmental unit-for each\ncounty; (iii)\nhealth systems\nagency-for the locale within each agency's jurisdictional area. (3)\n\nThe appropriate B/DDSO, representing OPWDD at the local level, shall collaborate with the local\ngovernmental units and the health system agencies in its service area and\nassist them to the extent necessary in the development of local and regional\nplans. (4)\nOPWDD, utilizing input\nfrom local and regional planning bodies, shall develop a statewide plan and\noperational planning documents. (5)\n\nAppropriate operational planning documents, reflecting specific program\ndevelopment needs, shall be reviewed by the appropriate local governmental\nunits and health systems agencies which shall be given the opportunity to\ncomment upon such documents prior to actualization. It is at this time in the\nplanning process that both the local governmental units and the health systems\nagencies are to consider and comment upon: (i) the availability of facilities or services which may serve as alternatives or\nsubstitutes for the whole or any part of the proposed program and/or\nconstruction; (ii)\nthe adequacy of\nfinancial resources and sources of future revenue; and\n(iii)\nthe public need for the facility or\nservices at the time and place and under the circumstances proposed. (6)\n\nWhile planning bodies will\nhave the opportunity for review of applications for certification of need at a\nsubsequent time, it is at the point in the project planning process that OPWDD\nallocates funds for program development and/or construction that input from the\nlocal governmental units and the health systems agencies is of primary\nsignificance. (b) Prior\nto formal submission of an application for certification of need, and as early\nas possible, it is required that the applicant consult with applicable local\nauthorities, local governmental units and the appropriate health systems agency\nto ensure, to the extent possible, that the proposed project is needed and\nappropriate. In order to avoid unnecessary expenditures for the development of\nthe application, and the more complex or expensive the anticipated project, the\nmore attention must be paid to early and extensive contact with county, regional, and B/DDSO planning authorities. (c) If either an administrative review or\nsubstantial review project should, at the time it moves forward to completion, result in an increase in cost or in client capacity or change in the class of\noperating certificate approved at the time of certification of need, it shall\nbe necessary to submit an amended application for certification of need to\naddress the change(s). If, for an administrative review project, costs exceed\n$600,000 or certified capacity is exceeded by 10 percent or five persons\n(whichever is greater), or there is a change in the operating certificate, section\n620.6\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part shall apply.
