  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.455 - External corrosion control: buried or submerged pipelines installed after july 31, 1971\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nprovided in subdivisions (b), (c) and (f) of this section, each buried or\nsubmerged pipeline installed after July 31, 1971, must be protected against\nexternal corrosion. (1)\n\nIt must have an\nexternal protective coating meeting the requirements of section\n255.461\nof this Part. (2)\n\nIt must have a cathodic protection system\ndesigned to protect the pipeline in its entirety, installed and placed in\noperation within one year after completion of construction. (b) An operator need not comply\nwith subdivision (a) of this section, if the operator can demonstrate by tests, investigation, or experience in the area of application, including, as a\nminimum, soil resistivity measurements and tests for corrosion accelerating\nbacteria, that a corrosive environment does not exist. (1)\n\nHowever, within six months after an\ninstallation made pursuant to the preceding sentence, the operator shall\nconduct tests, including pipe-to-soil potential measurements with respect to\neither a continuous reference electrode or an electrode using close spacing, not to exceed 20 feet (6.1 meters), and soil resistivity measurement at all\npotential profile peak locations, to adequately evaluate the potential profile\nalong the entire pipeline. (2)\n\nIf\nthe tests made indicate that a corrosive condition exists, the pipeline must be\ncathodically protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this\nsection. (c) An operator\nneed not comply with subdivision (a) of this section, if the operator can\ndemonstrate by tests, investigation or experience that: (1)\nfor a copper pipeline, a corrosive\nenvironment does not exist; or\n(2)\nfor a temporary pipeline with an operating period of service not to exceed five\nyears beyond installation, corrosion during the five-year period of service of\nthe pipeline will not be detrimental to public safety. (d) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) or (c) of this section, if a pipeline is externally coated, it\nmust be cathodically protected in accordance with paragraph (a)(2) of this\nsection. (e) Aluminum may not be\ninstalled in a buried or submerged pipeline if that aluminum is exposed to an\nenvironment with a natural pH in excess of eight. For lower values of pH\naluminum may not be installed unless tests or experience indicate its\nsuitability in the particular environment involved. (f) This section does not apply to\nelectrically isolated, metal alloy fittings in plastic pipelines, if; (1)\nfor the size fitting to be used, an\noperator can show by tests, investigation, or experience in the area of\napplication that adequate corrosion control is provided by alloyage; and\n(2)\nthe fitting is designed to\nprevent leakage caused by localized corrosion pitting. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.455\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
