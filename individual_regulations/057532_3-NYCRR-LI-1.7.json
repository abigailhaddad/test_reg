  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.7 - Charitable contributions by credit card\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked by a charitable organization whether\ncredit cards issued by State banks could be used by the holders to make\ncharitable contributions. Section\n96\n(1)\nof the Banking Law empowers such banks to\n\"discount, purchase and negotiate ________ obligations in writing to pay in\ninstallments or otherwise all or part of the price of personal property or that\nof the performance of services ________\" Retail installment credit agreements, the type commonly entered into between credit card holders and issuing banks, are defined in section\n401\n(8)\nof the Personal Property Law as those\n\"pursuant to which the buyer promises to pay, in installments, his outstanding\nindebtedness from time to time to a retail seller ________ for one or more\nitems of goods or services ________\" (emphasis supplied). Similar references to\nsuch agreements as intended for purchases or leases of property or services\nfrom retail sellers are found in section 413(11) of the same law. The department observed that credit card transactions, other\nthan those effecting cash borrowings, which do not discharge an enforceable\nindebtedness for goods or services would be improper under the quoted statutes. However, the department also noted that courts in this State have held that\npromises to contribute to charity may be enforceable--for example, where the\ncharity has incurred liability in reliance on the promise; thus payments by\ncredit card in respect of such obligations could be regarded as discharging\nindebtedness. Moreover, for purposes of the Personal Property Law, the\ndepartment could see no grounds for opposing the further view, if the relevant\nparties in interest chose to adopt it, that consideration for the promise to\ncontribute included not only reliance by the charity on receiving the amount\npledged but also the rendering of goods or services or both by the charity to\nthe objects of its beneficence, even if the same did not include the donor. It\nwas a persuasive analogy between such a characterization and the\nenforceability, never questioned to its knowledge, of credit card obligations\nincurred by one person, in advance, for a gift of goods or services to\nanother. Thus the department concluded that it would interpose no\nregulatory objection to the practice in question insofar as legally enforceable\npromises to contribute to the rendering by charities of goods, services or both\nwere concerned.
