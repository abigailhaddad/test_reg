  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-10.5 - Determination of adjusted base proportions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The legislative body of each homestead\nassessing unit shall establish adjusted base proportions to be applied in the\nlevy of taxes pursuant to section\n1903\nof the Real Property Tax Law. For each\nclass in the homestead assessing unit or portion thereof, the adjusted base\nproportion shall be the current base proportion adjusted for physical or\nquantity changes, changes in exemption or changes in class designations that\nhave occurred subsequent to the taxable status date of the reference roll as\nprovided herein. (b) The\nlegislative body may establish a procedure, subject to the approval of ORPTS, for making these adjustments. Where no locally applicable procedure has been\nestablished or approved when the adjusted base proportions are determined, the\nlegislative body shall adjust the current base proportions in the following\nmanner: (1)\nA change in level of assessment\nfactor shall be computed for each class and each portion class as follows: (i) Determine the physical or quantity\ndecrease for the class or portion class by summing the decreases due to\nphysical or quantity changes in the class or portion class, excluding special\nfranchise properties in the nonhomestead class, from the reference roll to the\nlevy roll. (ii)\n\nDetermine the\nsurviving total assessed value of the class or portion class by subtracting the\nphysical or quantity decrease so determined from the total assessed value of\nthe class or portion class, excluding special franchise properties in the\nnonhomestead class, on the reference roll. (iii)\n\nDetermine the net equalization change\nof the class or portion class by separately summing the increases and decreases\nfor equalization, excluding special franchise properties in the nonhomestead\nclass, and subtracting the sum of the decreases from the sum of the\nincreases. (iv)\n\nDetermine the\nchange in level of assessment factor by dividing the net equalization change by\nthe surviving total assessed value of the class or portion class, expressing\nthe quotient to at least four places to the right of the decimal point, and\nadding one to the quotient so determined. (2)\n\nThe taxable assessed value of the\nproperty on the levy roll, at the reference roll level of assessment, shall be\ncomputed for each class and portion class as follows: (i) Divide the taxable assessed value of the\nproperty in the class or portion class on the levy roll, excluding special\nfranchise properties in the nonhomestead class, by the appropriate change in\nlevel of assessment factor. (ii)\n\nFor the nonhomestead class, add to the quotient so determined the taxable\nassessed value of any special franchise properties in the class or portion\nclass on the levy roll, at the reference roll level of assessment. Such taxable\nassessed value shall be computed by ORPTS and provided to the legislative body\nof the homestead assessing unit no later than five days before the last date\nprovided by law for the filing of the levy roll or 30 days prior to the last\ndate provided by law for the levy of taxes, whichever is sooner. The provisions\nof Part 8197 of this Title shall apply to the extent practicable to the\ncomputation of such taxable assessed value; provided, however, that the\ninventory to be valued shall be the inventory applicable to the levy roll, but\nthe valuation standard and State equalization rate to be applied shall be the\nsame as if the property were being assessed for the reference roll. (3)\n\nAn adjustment factor for class\nquantity changes shall be computed for each class and portion class by dividing\n(i) the taxable assessed value of the class or portion class on the levy roll, at the reference roll level of assessment (i.e., the taxable assessed value\ndetermined pursuant to the preceding paragraph), by (ii) the taxable assessed\nvalue of the class or portion class on the reference roll, including special\nfranchise properties in the nonhomestead class. (4)\n\nThe adjusted base proportions for the\nhomestead assessing unit and each portion thereof shall be determined as\nfollows: (i) Multiply the current base\nproportion of each class or portion class by the appropriate adjustment\nfactor. (ii)\n\nSum the products so\ndetermined. If the sum is not 1.0000 for the homestead assessing unit or\nportion thereof, divide each class product by such sum. (c) The sum of the adjusted base\nproportions for the homestead assessing unit or portion thereof must equal one\nand each adjusted base proportion must be expressed as a percentage to at least\nfour places to the right of the decimal point.
