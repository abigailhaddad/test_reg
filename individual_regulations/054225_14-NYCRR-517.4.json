Such certification shall be made on forms approved by the Office of\n\nMental Health. (i) The certification of need, completed by the sending hospital, shall include a written attestation of the\nfollowing: (a) ambulatory care resources\navailable in the community do not meet the treatment needs of the\npatient; (b) proper treatment of\nthe patient's psychiatric condition requires services on an inpatient basis\nunder the direction of a physician; and\n(c) continued inpatient treatment can\nreasonably be expected to improve the patient's condition or prevent further\nregression so that the services will no longer be needed. (ii)\n\nThe certification of need form shall be\ncompleted by a team of two or more individuals who are independent of the\nreceiving hospital or related agency. Such team, which has knowledge of the\nindividual's situation, and has competence in the diagnosis and treatment of\nmental illness, preferably in child psychiatry, shall include a\nphysician. (iii)\n\nIf the sending\nhospital applied for medical assistance on behalf of the patient, but the\npatient's status as a recipient of medical assistance is not confirmed at the\ntime of transfer, the application for an order of transfer shall also include a\ncopy of any certification of need form completed by the sending hospital during\nthe process of applying for medical assistance. (iv)\n\nIf it is determined that the transfer of\na patient is necessary in order to prevent serious impairment or deterioration\nof the health of the patient, or to prevent immediate serious physical harm to\nthe patient or others, the sending hospital is not required to complete a\ncertification of need form. In such cases, the receiving hospital shall\ncomplete the certification of need form within 14 days after the patient's\nadmission to the receiving hospital. (4)\n\nIf the receiving hospital is a\nfree-standing psychiatric hospitalother than a State-operated psychiatric\ncenter, and the sending hospital is a State-operated psychiatric center, the\nsending hospital shall include a certification of need in the application for\nan order of transfer of a patient who is under 21 years of age and is a\nrecipient of medical assistance.

(2)\n\nMinor voluntary patients. A voluntary patient under 18 years of age who was\nadmitted on the patient's own application must provide written consent to the\ntransfer. In the case of a voluntary patient under 18 years of age who was not\nadmitted on the patient's own application, that patient's parent or guardian\nmust provide written consent to the transfer. (3)\n\nInvoluntary patients. An order of\ntransfer may be requested for any involuntary patient. The proposed transfer\nshall first be discussed with the patient. No request for the transfer of an\nobjecting patient shall be made by the sending hospital until such patient has\nbeen given an opportunity to appeal such request to the sending hospital's\ndirector. (i) Appeal. The director of the\nsending hospital may designate the clinical director, any unit chief or\npsychiatrist not of the unit where the patient receives or has received care, or any supervisor of such unit chief or psychiatrist, to hear an appeal. The\npatient may elect to have a person represent him or her. The appeal may be\nconducted informally, without adhering to the rules of evidence and\nrecord-keeping. The director or the designee thereof shall: (a) review the patient's clinical\nhistory; (b) give the patient, the\n\nMental Hygiene Legal Service and any patient representative an opportunity to\ndiscuss the patient's objections to the transfer with the director or the\ndesignee thereof; and\n(c) consider\nthe criteria for transfer described in subdivision (d) of this section and\ndetermine whether, on balance, the patient's best interests would be served by\ntransfer to another hospital. (ii)\n\nUpon completion of the appeal, the\ndirector or the designee thereof shall inform the patient, the MHLS and any\npatient representative of the results. If the patient is still to be\ntransferred, the sending hospital may request an order of transfer and shall\ninform the patient, the MHLS and any patient representative of the anticipated\ndate of transfer, when known. (d) Criteria for transfer. (1)\n\nSuitability of the hospital. Transfer of\na patient between hospitals shall be authorized when it is determined to be in\nthe best interests of the patient.

The patient shall be transferred as soon as possible to\nthe receiving hospital along with a certified copy of such patient's admission\npaper and case record, in accordance with the order.
