  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5000.6 - Hearings on suspension or revocation of lottery sales agent license\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A lottery sales\nagent is entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard before suspension or\nrevocation of the licensed provided that the lottery sales agent requests such\na hearing within 20 days from the date of notice of the suspension or\nrevocation. If the commission or the commission's designee finds that the\npublic health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action, and\nincorporates a finding to that effect in a written order, summary suspension of\na lottery sales agent license may be temporarily ordered, pending proceedings\nfor license suspension or revocation. (b) A petition requesting a hearing shall be\nin writing signed by the petitioner or an attorney on behalf of the petitioner\nand shall include the petitioner's mailing address. (c) Upon receipt of a petition requesting a\nhearing, the commission shall issue a notice of hearing fixing the date, time\nand place at which the hearing shall be held, stating the legal authority and\njurisdiction under which the hearing is to be held, referring to the particular\nsections of the statutes and rules involved, where possible setting forth a\nshort and plain statement of matters asserted, and stating that interpreter\nservices shall be made available, at no charge, pursuant to section 301 of the\n\nState Administrative Procedure Act provided that such interpreter services are\nrequested a reasonable time in advance of the hearing. Upon the written\napplication of any party, a more definite and detailed statement of the matters\nasserted shall be furnished whenever the director or the director's designee\nfinds that the statement in the notice of hearing is not sufficiently definite\nor not sufficiently detailed. Any more definite and detailed statement so\nfurnished shall be deemed to be a part of the notice of hearing. A notice of\nhearing shall give at least 10 days' notice to the petitioner and other parties\nand shall be served either in person or by certified mail. (d) The hearing officer shall be a person\ndesignated by the commission. Upon the filing in good faith by a party of a\ntimely and sufficient affidavit of personal bias or disqualification of a\nhearing officer, the commission shall determine the matter as part of the\nrecord of the proceedings. Whenever a hearing officer is disqualified or it\nbecomes impractical for him or her to continue, another hearing officer may be\ndesignated to continue the proceedings unless it is shown that substantial\nprejudice would result. The hearing officer's written report of the hearing\ncontaining findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommended decisions\nshall be filed with the commission and mailed to the parties of record, and all\nparties of record shall have 10 days in which to file exceptions, objections, and replies thereto, after which the commission shall adopt, reverse, or modify\nthe report and recommended decision. (e) A party shall be required to make\ndisclosures prior to a hearing only as provided by this subdivision. When the\nrevocation of a lottery sales agent license is sought, any party shall, upon\nwritten demand and at least seven days prior to the date of the hearing, disclose the evidence that the party intends to introduce at the hearing, including documentary evidence and identification of witnesses who may testify\nat the hearing, except material protected by law from disclosure, including\nprivileged or confidential information. If after making such disclosure, a\nparty decides to rely on other witnesses or documents, the party shall, as soon\nas practicable, supplement such party's disclosure by providing the names of\nsuch witnesses or copies of such documents. (f) The hearing officer shall rule on matters\nof procedure and evidence, and shall conduct the hearing in such manner as, in\nthe hearing officer's discretion, will best serve the attainment of justice. The hearing officer may direct questions to any party or witness. (g) (1)\n\nThe\norder of proof shall be as follows: (i) testimony by witnesses in support of the matters asserted against the\nlicensee; (ii)\ncross-examination of\nsuch witnesses; (iii)\ntestimony by\nthe licensee and witnesses produced by the licensee; and\n(iv)\ncross-examination of the licensee and\nthe licensee's witnesses. The hearing officer may, in the hearing officer's\ndiscretion, change the order of proof. (2)\n\nObjections or exceptions may be made to\nthe rulings of the hearing officer and the reasons therefor shall be stated, but such objections or exceptions will not be deemed to have been made unless\nduly noted on the record. (3)\n\nThe\nformal rules of evidence shall not be rigidly enforced in the hearing. Unless\nobjection or exception is made, sustained, and duly noted on the record, all\nevidence appearing in the record shall be deemed to have been properly admitted\nfor consideration by the commission. (4)\n\nThe introduction of cumulative evidence\nshall be avoided, and the hearing officer may limit the testimony of any\nwitness that the hearing officer deems to be merely cumulative; however, the\nparty offering such testimony may make a short avowal of the testimony that\nwould have been given and if the witness asserts that such avowal is true, the\navowal shall be made part of the record. (5)\n\nThe hearing officer shall have the\nauthority upon application of any party to reopen an adjourned hearing for the\npresentation of new or additional evidence. Such application shall be in\nwriting and shall set forth a brief description of the new or additional\nevidence to be presented. (6)\n\nOral\nargument may be made only before the hearing officer. Within the discretion of\nthe hearing officer, such oral argument may be curtailed or limited. (h) (1)\n\nThe record shall include: (i) all notices, pleadings, motions, and\nintermediate rulings; (ii)\nevidence\npresented; (iii)\na statement of\nmatters officially noticed except matters so obvious that a statement of them\nwould serve no useful purpose; (iv)\nquestions and offers of proof, objections thereto, and rulings\nthereon; (v) proposed findings and\nexceptions, if any; (vi)\nfindings\nof fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations made by the hearing officer; and\n(vii)\nthe decision, determination, opinion, order, or report rendered in the matter by the\ncommission. (2)\n\nThe\nhearing shall be recorded by either stenographic or electronic means. (3)\n\nUpon application made by a licensee, a\ncopy of the record shall be furnished to the licensee. If the stenographic or\nelectronic recording of the hearing has not been transcribed, that portion of\nthe record shall be furnished to the licensee only upon payment of the cost of\ntranscription.
