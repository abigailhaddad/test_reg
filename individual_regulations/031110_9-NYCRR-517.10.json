  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 517.10 - Contents of writings, recordings, and photographs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section\nthe following definitions are applicable: (1)\n\nWritings and recordings consist of letters, words, or numbers, or their\nequivalent, set down by handwriting, typewriting, printing, photostating, photographing, magnetic impulse, mechanical or electronic recording, or other\nform of data compilation. (2)\n\nPhotographs include still photographs, X-ray films, video tapes, and motion\npictures. (3)\n\nAn original of a\nwriting or recording is the writing or recording itself or any counterpart\nintended to have the same effect by a person executing or issuing it. An\n\"original\" of a photograph includes the negative or any print therefrom. If\ndata are stored in a computer or similar device, any printout or other output\nreadable by sight, shown to reflect the data accurately, is an\n\"original\". (4)\nA duplicate is a\ncounterpart produced by the same impression as the original, or from the same\nmatrix, or by means of photography, including enlargements and miniatures, or\nby mechanical or electronic recording, or by chemical reproduction, or by other\nequivalent techniques which accurately reproduce the original. (b) Requirement of an original. To\nprove the content of a writing, recording, or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required, except as otherwise provided in the\nrules, this Chapter, or by Act of Congress. (c) Admissibility of duplicates. A duplicate\nis admissible to the same extent as an original unless: (1)\na genuine question is raised as to the\nauthenticity of the original; or\n(2)\nin the circumstances it would be unfair\nto admit the duplicate in lieu of the original. (d) Admissibility of other evidence of\ncontents. The original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a\nwriting, recording, or photograph is admissible if: (1)\n\nOriginals lost or destroyed. All\noriginals are lost or have been destroyed, unless the proponent lost or\ndestroyed them in bad faith. (2)\n\nOriginals not obtainable. No original can be obtained by any available judicial\nprocess or procedure. (3)\n\nOriginals\nnot obtainable. At a time when an original was under the control of the party\nagainst whom offered, the party was put on notice, by the pleadings or\notherwise, that the contents would be a subject of proof at the hearing, and\nthe party does not produce the original at the hearing. (4)\n\nCollateral matters. The writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to a controlling\nissue. (e) Public\nrecords. The contents of an official record, or of a document authorized to be\nrecorded or filed and actually recorded or filed, including data compilations\nin any form, if otherwise admissible, may be proved by copy, certified as\ncorrect or attested to in accordance with Mil. R. Evid. 902 or testified to be\ncorrect by a witness who has compared it with the original. If a copy which\ncomplies with the foregoing cannot be obtained by the exercise of reasonable\ndiligence, then other evidence of the contents may be given. (f) Summaries. The contents of voluminous\nwritings, records, or photographs which cannot conveniently be examined in\ncourt may be presented in the form of a chart, summary, or calculation. The\noriginals, or duplicates, shall be made available for examination or copying, or both, by other parties at a reasonable time and place. The military judge\nmay order that they be produced in court. (g) Testimony on written admission of party. Contents of writings, recordings, or photo graphs may be proved by the\ntestimony or deposition of the party against whom offered or by the party's\nwritten admission, without accounting for the nonproduction of the\noriginal. (h) Functions of military\njudge and members. When the admissibility of other evidence of contents of\nwritings, recordings, or photographs under these rules depends upon the\nfulfillment of a condition of fact, the question whether the condition has been\nfulfilled is ordinarily for the military judge to determine in accordance with\nthe provisions of Mil. R. Evid. 104. However, when an issue is raised: (1)\nwhether the asserted writing ever\nexisted; or\n(2)\nwhether another\nwriting, recording, or photograph produced at trial is the original; or\n(3)\nwhether other evidence of\ncontents correctly reflects the contents, the issue is for the trier of fact to\ndetermine as in the case of other issues of fact.
