  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1630-1.3 - Where immediate coverage is required\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn authority may occasionally find it necessary to\nobtain immediate insurance coverage. In such cases, wherever possible, coverage\nshould be placed under binder, with a company that has previously been\nsuccessful in receiving some other item of insurance under bidding procedure. Company issuing binder should be requested to allow coverage to remain in such\nform without issuing a policy until division can be consulted and approval\nobtained for permanent coverage. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1630-1.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
