  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 544.4 - Charges for installing, repairing, servicing and maintaining mobile homes and factory manufactured homes\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(c)(3)\n(a) Mobile homes. (1)\n\nThe charge for installing a mobile home\non real property is excluded from the sales and use taxes. However, tangible\npersonal property purchased and used for the installation of a mobile home is\nsubject to the sales and use tax. Such tangible personal property includes but\nis not limited to: concrete blocks, water and sewer pipes, steps, wind anchors, electric cables, oil tanks and stands. (i) Where a contractor, subcontractor or repairman in installing a mobile home uses\nitems of tangible personal property belonging to the mobile homeowner, the\ninstallation charge (labor) is not subject to the sales and use tax. (ii)\n\nWhere a contractor, subcontractor or\nrepairman installing a mobile home, uses items of tangible personal property\npurchased by him for such installation, the charge to the owner of the mobile\nhome for the service of installing the mobile home (including materials used in\nsuch installation and transferred to the owner in conjunction with the\nperformance of the service) is not subject to sales and use tax. The\ncontractor, subcontractor or repairman must pay tax on the materials at the\ntime of purchase. (iii)\n\nWhere a\ndealer also acts as a contractor, subcontractor or repairman in the\ninstallation of a mobile home, its charge to the purchaser of the mobile home\nfor such installation (including materials used in such installation and\ntransferred to the owner in conjunction with the performance of the service) is\nnot subject to sales and use tax. However, the dealer is liable for payment of\nuse tax on all materials it uses in such installation. (2)\n(i) The\ncharge to a purchaser for installing tangible personal property on a mobile\nhome or maintaining, servicing or repairing a mobile home (including labor and\nmaterials), is subject to the sales and use tax. (a) Where a contractor, subcontractor or\nrepairman installs items of tangible personal property belonging to the mobile\nhome owner, the installation charge (labor) is subject to the sales and use\ntax. (b) Where a contractor, subcontractor or repairman installs items of tangible personal property\npurchased by him for such installation, the charge to the owner of the mobile\nhome for both the labor and materials is subject to the sales and use tax. The\ncontractor, subcontractor or repairman must pay tax on the materials at the\ntime of purchase. Upon the installation of such materials, the contractor, subcontractor or repairman may apply for a refund or claim a credit on the\ncontractor's, subcontractor's or repairman's next sales tax return for such tax\npaid in respect of any property so transferred to the owner of the mobile home. Alternatively, a contractor, subcontractor or repairman registered as a vendor\nwho is under contract to maintain, service or otherwise repair a mobile home\nmay purchase materials specifically for use in performing such contract without\npayment of tax by issuing a properly completed contractor exempt purchase\ncertificate. Contractors, subcontractors or repairmen performing taxable\nservices are vendors required to register pursuant to section\n1134\nof\nthe Tax Law. (c) Where a dealer\nalso acts as a contractor, subcontractor or repairman in the installation of\ntangible personal property for a mobile homeowner, its total charge for such\nservices (labor and materials) is subject to sales and use tax. However, the\ndealer may purchase tangible personal property used in such installations\nwithout payment of tax by issuing a properly completed resale certificate. Alternatively, a dealer who so acts may pay tax on such tangible personal\nproperty at the time of purchase and, upon the installation of such property, the dealer may apply for a refund or claim a credit on the dealer's next sales\ntax return for such tax paid in respect of any property so transferred to the\nowner of the mobile home. (3)\n\nRegardless of the nature of its\ninstallation on real property, a mobile home does not constitute an addition or\ncapital improvement to real property, property or land for purposes of the\nsales and use tax imposed by article 28 and pursuant to the authority of\narticle 29 of the Tax Law. Thus, excluding the service of installing a mobile\nhome onto real property, the receipts including all charges for both labor and\nmaterials from the service of installing tangible personal property in or onto\na mobile home and the services of maintaining, servicing or repairing a mobile\nhome are subject to the sales and use tax. Example: Installing a new roof on a mobile home; repairing or\nreplacing a furnace in a mobile home; repairing broken windows and faulty\nfaucets in a mobile home; and painting interior or exterior walls of a mobile\nhome are examples of taxable services. The total charge (labor and materials)\nfor such services is subject to tax.

For refunds and credits, see section\n534.5\nof this Title. For contractors' regulations, see Part 541 of this\n\nTitle. (b) Factory manufactured homes. (1)\n\nIf the installation of a factory manufactured home results in a capital\nimprovement, charges for the installation of such factory manufactured home are\nnot subject to the sales tax, and the installer is liable for the sales and use\ntax on any materials used or consumed in such installation. (2)\n\nIf a factory manufactured home is\ninstalled upon real property under such circumstances that the installation\ndoes not constitute a capital improvement, the charges for such installation\nincluding labor and materials (including the charge for the factory\nmanufactured home if applicable) is subject to tax. In such event, a contractor\nmay claim a refund or credit of the sales and compensating use tax it paid upon\nits purchase of those materials which were subsequently resold.
