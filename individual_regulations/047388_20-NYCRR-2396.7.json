  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2396.7 - EFT and filing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Choice of\npayment option. Taxpayers who are mandatory participants can elect one of the\nfour options available to make payments to the program. Taxpayers may elect to\nmake payments by ACH debit, ACH credit, fedwire, or certified check. Where any\nof the methods require or allow electronic filing, that filing will serve as a\nsubstitute for the filing on a paper New York State employer's return of tax\nwithheld (NYS-1). (b) Taxpayers\nelecting ACH debit\n(1)\n\nTaxpayers who are\nparticipating in the program who elect the ACH debit payment option must, on or\nbefore 6:00 p.m. (Eastern time) on the last business day before the applicable\ndue date, report their tax payment for the applicable period by telephone or\nthrough the program's website to the electronic payment reporting system. (This\nis the case because there is a one-day lag between the date on which payment is\nauthorized and the date on which the transfer is executed, i.e., funds are\ndeducted from the taxpayer's bank account and transferred to the department's\ndepository bank.) The electronic payment reporting system can be accessed using\nthe toll-free number or through the program's website. Information on both\nmethods of accessing the system will be provided to taxpayers as part of the\nnotification and enrollment process. (2)\n(i) Prior to making its first payment of tax by ACH debit, a taxpayer must have\nfurnished the department with the banking information necessary to generate ACH\ndebits against its designated account. If a taxpayer's banking information\nchanges after the first payment, the taxpayer must immediately inform the\ndepartment of the changes to ensure timely payments. The method of changing\nbank information will be described in the program materials. (ii)\n\nUpon reaching the electronic payment\nreporting system, the taxpayer will be asked for the unique password and access\ncode provided to the taxpayer as part of the notification and enrollment\nprocess. The password, access code, identity of the taxpayer and choice of\npayment option will be verified, and after approval, the taxpayer will be\ngranted access to the electronic payment reporting system. Upon accessing such\nsystem, the taxpayer will be asked to report the following information: (a) the reporting period; (b) New York State liability; (c) City of New York liability; (d) City of Yonkers liability; (e) payment amount; (f) final payment indicator; and\n(g) any other information the department\ndeems necessary for filing and payment reporting purposes. If the above-enumerated information is reported by telephone, the information will be verified over the telephone. If the information is\nreported using the program's website, it will be verified by the taxpayer\nonline. Once the taxpayer agrees that all information reported is correct, the\ntaxpayer will be given a confirmation number for the transaction. This number\nwill serve as proof that the taxpayer has filed its withholding return for the\napplicable payroll or payrolls and has complied with the signature requirements\nof Part 153 of this Title. (c) Taxpayers electing ACH credit or fedwire. (1)\n\nParticipating taxpayers who elect the ACH\ncredit or fedwire payment option must initiate each payment of tax by\ncontacting their own financial institution and requesting such institution to\ntransfer both the appropriate payment of tax and the necessary addenda record\ninformation to the department's depository bank via an ACH credit or fedwire\ntransfer, as applicable. An ACH credit taxpayer must initiate each payment\ntransaction with its financial institution on or before the last business day\nbefore the applicable due date at such time as designated by its bank to assure\nthat the department's depository bank receives the payment and accompanying\naddenda record information on or before the applicable due date. A fedwire\ntaxpayer must initiate each payment transaction on or before the applicable due\ndate at such time as designated by its bank to assure that the department's\ndepository bank receives the payment and accompanying addenda record\ninformation on or before the applicable due date. (2)\n\nTaxpayers electing to use ACH credit or\nfedwire transfer must provide the filing information prescribed by the\ndepartment with their ACH credit or fedwire transfer, as applicable. These\ntaxpayers need not report their withholding tax liability for applicable\npayroll or payrolls by telephone or through the program's website to the\nelectronic payment reporting system. (d) Certified check taxpayers. (1)\n\nGeneral rule. Taxpayers, other than\neducational organizations, that are required to participate in the program and\nwho elect to make payments by certified check, are required to file paper\nwithholding tax returns and make payments of tax by certified check in\naccordance with the provisions of this subdivision. (i) Required mailing date. In order to comply\nwith the requirements of the program and to timely file such withholding tax\nreturn and pay the tax, a taxpayer that chooses the certified check payment\noption must either mail the paper return and a certified check for the amount\nof the tax liability on or before the second business day before the otherwise\napplicable due date or assure that the department's depository bank receives\nthe certified check and the paper return on or before the otherwise applicable\ndue date. (ii)\n\nElectronic filing\nnot applicable. Because taxpayers choosing the certified check payment option\nare required to file paper withholding tax returns, the provisions in this\nsection for electronic filing are not applicable to those taxpayers. (e) Acknowledgement of\npayment. To provide an acknowledgement of payment, the department will post a\nrecord of deposits to the taxpaper's online account which can be accessed\nthrough the program's website. Taxpayers may also request that the department\nmail an advice of deposit or payment. Information will be provided by the\nprogram to participating taxpayers at the time of enrollment about how\ntaxpayers may choose to have an advice of deposit or payment mailed to\nthem. (f) Correcting mistakes. If a\ntaxpayer does not make a correct payment of tax for a particular period or\nreports the wrong amount, the taxpayer must, on the nearest business day to the\ndate on which the error is discovered, make proper adjustment for such period. Information will be provided by the program about how to make this adjustment. If the taxpayer error involves an underpayment of tax, interest will be charged\nand penalties may apply. (g) Changing payment option. (1)\n\nTaxpayers may\nelect to change their payment option at any time during the program period. The\ndepartment will make the methods of electing to change payment option available\nto taxpayers in the printed program description or on the program's\nwebsite. (2)\n\nPayment contingency\noptions for use in emergency situations. If a taxpayer is unable to utilize its\nchosen payment option for a particular payroll or payrolls due to circumstances\nbeyond its control, such taxpayer may utilize any of the other payment options, excluding ACH debit, as an alternative payment mechanism for such payroll or\npayrolls. The procedures specified in subdivision (c) or (d) of this section, as applicable, will govern in such cases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
