  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-3.20 - Reimbursement and trust agreement\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn insurer may request that an applicant assign to the insurer such applicant's right to commence an action, pursuant to section\n5104 (b)\nof the Insurance Law, before two years after the accrual thereof; provided, however, that such request must be accompanied by a clear, detailed explanation that the applicant has the right to refuse such request and that such refusal will not prejudice the applicant's eligibility for the payment of any first-party benefits to which the applicant is entitled. If, as a result of such assignment, the insurer recovers an amount in excess of the amount paid or payable to the applicant in first-party benefits, such excess amount shall be remitted to the applicant less a pro rata share of collection costs. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n65-3.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
