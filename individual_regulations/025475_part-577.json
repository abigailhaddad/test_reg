E, art. 2, pt. 577 - Instructions-water Plant Accounts\n\nState Regulations\n§ 577.1 - Water plant to be recorded at original cost\n§ 577.2 - Additions and retirements of water plant\n§ 577.3 - Components of construction cost\n§ 577.4 - Work order system required (class c utilities only)\n§ 577.5 - Transfers of property\n§ 577.6 - Expenditures on property leased for use in water operations\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, ch. V, subch. E, art. 2, pt. 577\n\nAmounts received for construction which are ultimately to\nbe refunded, wholly or in part, shall be credited to account 1241, Customer\n\nAdvances for Construction. When the amount to be refunded has been finally\ndetermined, the balance, if any, remaining in account 1241 shall be debited\nthereto and credited to the water plant accounts to which the cost of the\nproperty was charged. The cost of property includes the cost of preliminary\nsurveys and studies and the cost of preparing plans and specifications at the\ntime of construction for construction projects which are undertaken, and also\nthe cost of keeping the construction accounts during the construction period, together with the cost of maps, books, files and other systems employed and\npermanently preserved in support of such construction costs. The cost of\nproperty does not include the cost incurred subsequent to the construction\nperiod of preparing, installing or maintaining maps, inventories, accounting\nand other financial records of property for use in the operation of a\nconstructed plant, the cost of the preparation of inventories, appraisals, or\nother studies, nor costs incurred in the establishment or revision of\naccounting routine. Requirement of the use of the work order system here\noutlined may be suspended by order of the commission in the case of a utility\nwhich satisfies the commission that the system which it has in use for\nrecording changes in water plant accounts gives the equivalent detail by\naccounts in substantially the same form. The identification of expenditures\nwith property must be complete and clear, and the detail of the cost of each\nproject or job must be readily\navailable. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
