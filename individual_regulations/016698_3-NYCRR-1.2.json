  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 1.2 - Offer of free personal checking account to persons who maintain minimum savings deposits\n\nState Regulations\nA State bank inquired whether the following offer would\nviolate Banking Board General Regulation Part 20, which limits the interest\nrate which a bank may pay. The bank would offer a free personal checking account to any\nperson who either purchases a $1000 certificate of deposit or maintains a\nminimum balance of $1000 in a savings account with the bank. Interest would be\npaid on the certificates of deposit and on the savings accounts at the highest\nrate permitted by law. The department observed that absorption by a bank of all or\npart of its cost in servicing a checking account of its depositor has not been\ndeemed the payment of interest thereon in violation of the regulation which\nprohibits the payment of interest on demand deposit accounts. Applying the foregoing principle, the department concluded\nthat the bank's cost of the free personal checking account would not be\nregarded as interest within the meaning of Part 20 of the General Regulations\nand that the offer, therefore, did not violate the regulations. DATED: March 25, 1970\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
