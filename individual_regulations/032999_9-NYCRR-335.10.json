  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 335.10 - Distribution of contributions and pledges among participating organizations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Contributions\nand pledges that have been designated to specific participant charitable\norganizations and received by a federated community campaign must first be\ndistributed to those organizations, minus only the deduction for the SEFA\ncampaign's administrative costs. (b) In all campaign areas, undesignated\ncontributions and pledges to the campaign shall be distributed in accordance\nwith the following steps: (1)\n\nThe percentage\nof the total amount of contributions and pledges to the campaign that were\ndesignated to each specific participating organization shall be\ncomputed. (2)\n\nEach participating\ncharity shall be allotted the same percentage of total undesignated funds as it\nreceived as designated funds, minus only the deduction for the SEFA campaign's\nadministrative costs. (3)\n\nThe\ncalculation of the distribution of funds by the local SEFA committee shall be\nconclusive and binding on all participants. (c) For the purposes of the calculations\nunder the preceding subdivision, each constituent of a federation of charitable\norganizations shall be counted as a separate participant, but the federation of\ncharitable organizations to which the constituent belongs shall receive that\nconstituent's share, to be distributed in accordance with the federation's\narrangement with its members, if any. (d) Administrative costs. (1)\n\nNo later than May 1st of every year, each\nlocal SEFA committee shall review the financial report of the campaign for the\nprevious year and proposed annual budget. Based upon such review, the local\nSEFA committee shall determine a fixed administration cost percentage, equally\napplicable to all participants, for the calculation of their respective\ncontributions and pledges to the administrative costs for the next\ncampaign. (2)\n\nThe administration\ncost percentage so determined shall not exceed 15 percent of the sum of SEFA\ncontributions received in the prior calendar year, less pass through\ncontributions received in such year. A higher percentage may be permitted\npursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The statewide SEFA council shall\nhave the right to review the administrative expenses of each federated\ncommunity campaign, and to lower the percentage determined by the local SEFA\ncommittee if such percentage is deemed to be excessive. Such determination\nshall be made no later than June 15th of each year. (3)\n\nIf a local SEFA committee believes that a\nfederated community campaign should receive more than 15 percent of the\ncontributions received in the next SEFA campaign, such committee shall submit\nan application to the statewide SEFA council no later than May 15th, setting\nforth the percentage recommended and the reasons for such determination, as\nwell as such data and documentation as the statewide SEFA council may require. The statewide SEFA council may permit a higher percentage amount only if it\nfinds compelling reasons to believe that the reasonable and necessary costs of\nthe next succeeding campaign must exceed 15 percent. Such determination, with\nthe amount approved, shall be made by June 15th of each year. (4)\n\nNo later than May 15th, each federated\ncommunity campaign will report its campaign's administration cost percentage\nand the planned time, or times, of distribution set out in its approved budget\nto the federated community campaign retained by the statewide SEFA\ncouncil. (5)\n\nBeginning in 2008, the\nfederated community campaign retained by the SEFA council will provide notice\nof the administration cost percentage and planned distribution dates of each\ncampaign, to each of the participants on the list provided under section\n335.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Part. The method of notice will be determined by the statewide SEFA\ncouncil. The method of notice may be limited to an electronic means such as web\nposting or e-mail, or limited to U.S. mail, or any other method reasonably\ndetermined to provide adequate notice. If the method of notice is limited to\nelectronic means, the requirements of the State Technology Law will apply to\nsuch notice. (6)\n\nEach participant\nshall remit the participant's share of the campaign costs from its distribution\nof funds. This amount shall be calculated by multiplying the sum of designated\nfunds plus undesignated funds to be received by the participant by the\npercentage for administrative costs determined pursuant to this\nparagraph.
