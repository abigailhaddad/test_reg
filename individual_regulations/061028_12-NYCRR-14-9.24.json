  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.24 - Stop valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nEach steam-discharge outlet, except\nsafety-valve or safety relief valves, or reheater inlet or outlet connections, shall be fitted with a stop valve located at an accessible point in the steam\ndelivery line and as near to the boiler nozzle as convenient and practicable. When such outlets are over two inch pipe size, the valve or valves used on the\nconnection shall be of the outside-screw-and-yoke rising-stem type so as to\nindicate from a distance by the position of its stem whether it is closed or\nopen and the wheel may be carried either on the yoke or attached to the stem. A\nplug cock type valve may be used provided the plug is held in place by a guard\nor gland, the valve is equipped to indicate from a distance whether it is\nclosed or open, and the valve is equipped with a slow-opening\nmechanism. (2)\n\nIf a shutoff valve\nis used between the boiler and its superheater, the safety valve capacity on\nthe boiler proper must comply with ASME requirements. In a separately fired\nsuperheater installation, a stop valve is not required at the inlet or the\noutlet of the superheater. (b) (1)\n\nAll\nstop valves and the fittings between them and the boiler shall be equal at\nleast to the requirements of the American National Standards given in the ASME\nCode except where heavier construction is specifically required. (2)\n\nIn all cases the valves and fittings\nshall be equal at least to the American National Standard for 100\npsi. (3)\n\nValves and fittings made\nof any material permitted by ASME for pressure ratings of 100 pounds or more, and marked as required, may be used for saturated steam service up to the rated\npressure, except that in no case shall they be used for temperatures exceeding\nthose permitted by ASME. (4)\n\nThe\nnearest steam stop valve or valves to the boiler drum or superheater inlet\nshall have a pressure rating at least equal to the minimum set pressure of any\nsafety valve on the boiler drum at the corresponding saturated steam\ntemperature. (5)\n\nThe nearest stop\nvalve or valves to the superheater outlet shall have a pressure rating at least\nequal to the minimum set pressure of any safety valve on the superheater and at\nthe expected superheated steam temperature; or at least equal to 85 percent of\nthe lowest set pressure of any safety valve on the boiler drum at the expected\nsteam temperature of the superheater outlet, whichever is greater. (c) (1)\n\nWhen boilers are connected to a common\nsteam main, the steam connection from each boiler having a manhole opening\nshall be fitted with two stop valves having an ample free-blow drain between\nthem. The discharge of this drain shall be visible to the operator while\nmanipulating the valve. The stop valves shall consist preferably of one\nautomatic nonreturn valve (set next to the boiler) and a second valve of the\noutside-screw-and-yoke type; or, two valves of the outside-screw-and-yoke type\nshall be used. (2)\n\nWhen a second\nsteam stop valve or valves is required, it shall have a pressure rating at\nleast equal to that required for the expected steam temperature and pressure at\nthe valve, or the pressure rating shall be not less than 85 percent of the\nlowest set pressure of any safety valve on the boiler drum and for the expected\ntemperature of the steam at the valve, whichever is greater. (d) When a stop valve is so\nlocated that water can accumulate, ample drains shall be provided. All drain\nlines, including pipe, fittings, and valves, shall comply with the requirements\nfor steam piping or water piping according to the service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.24\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
