  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.5 - Exhibit 5: electric system effects\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 5 shall contain: (a) A system reliability impact study, performed in accordance with the open access transmission tariff of the New\n\nYork Independent System Operator, Inc. (NYISO) approved by the Federal Energy\n\nRegulatory Commission, that shows expected flows on the system under normal, peak and emergency conditions and effects on stability of the interconnected\nsystem, including the necessary technical analyses (thermal, voltage, short\ncircuit and stability) to evaluate the impact of the interconnection. The study\nshall include the new electric interconnection between the facility and the\npoint of interconnection, as well as any other system upgrades\nrequired. (b) An evaluation of the\npotential significant impacts of the facility and its interconnection to\ntransmission system reliability at a level of detail that reflects the\nmagnitude of the impacts. (c) A\ndiscussion of the benefits and detriments of the facility on ancillary services\nand the electric transmission system, including impacts associated with\nreinforcements and new construction necessary as a result of the\nfacility. (d) An analysis of any\nreasonable alternatives that would mitigate adverse reliability impacts and\nmaintain voltage, stability, thermal limitations, and short circuit capability\nat adequate levels. (e) An estimate\nof the increase or decrease in the total transfer capacity across each affected\ninterface, and if a forecasted reduction in transfer capability across affected\ninterfaces violates reliability requirements, an evaluation of reasonable\ncorrective measures that could be employed to mitigate or eliminate said\nreduction. (f) A description of\ncriteria, plans, and protocols for generation and ancillary facilities design, construction, commissioning, and operation, including as appropriate to\ngeneration technology: (1)\nengineering codes, standards, guidelines and practices that apply; (2)\ngeneration facility type\ncertification; (3)\nprocedures and\ncontrols for facility inspection, testing and commissioning; and\n(4)\nmaintenance and management plans, procedures and criteria. (g) If there is a thermal component to the\nfacility the applicant is to provide heat balance diagrams at various load\nlevels and generation configurations demonstrating that the facility is\nutilizing the best use of heat from the facility. (h) For wind power and other facilities where\nit is contemplated that a portion of a new interconnection substation to be\nbuilt will be transferred to the transmission owner: (1)\ndescribe the substation facilities to be\ntransferred and the contemplated future transaction, including a timetable for\nthe future transfer; (2)\ndescribe\nhow the substation-interconnection design will meet the transmission owner's\nrequirements; and\n(3)\ndefine the\noperational and maintenance responsibilities for the substation and how they\nwill meet the transmission owner's standards. (i) Facility maintenance and management\nplans, procedures and criteria, specifically addressing the following topics: (1)\nturbine maintenance, safety inspections, and tower integrity; and\n(2)\nelectric transmission, gathering and interconnect line inspections, maintenance, and repairs, including: (i) vegetation clearance requirements; (ii)\nvegetation management plans and\nprocedures; (iii)\ninspection and\nmaintenance schedules; (iv)\nnotification and public relations for work in public right-of-way; and\n(v) minimization of\ninterference with electric and communications distribution systems. (j) Vegetation\nmanagement practices for switchyard and substation yards, and for danger trees\n(trees that due to location and condition are a particular threat to fall on\nand damage electrical equipment) around stations, specifications for\nclearances, inspection and treatment schedules, and environmental controls to\navoid off-site effects. (k) If the\napplicant will entertain proposals for sharing above ground facilities with\nother utilities (communications, cable, phone, cell phone relays, and similar\nfacilities), criteria and procedures for review of such proposals. (l) A status report on equipment availability\nand expected delivery dates for major components including heat recovery steam\ngenerators, towers, turbines, transformers, and related major\nequipment. (m) A description of the\ngenerating facility's blackstart capabilities, if any. (n) After consultation with DPS, NYISO, and\nthe local transmission owners to identify applicable requirements, an\nidentification and demonstration of the degree of compliance with all relevant\napplicable reliability criteria of the Northeast Power Coordinating Council\n\nInc., New York State Reliability Council, and the local interconnecting\ntransmission utility, including any criteria regarding blackstart and fuel\nswitching capabilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
