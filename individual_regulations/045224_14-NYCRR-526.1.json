  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 526.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthis Part is to set forth standards for the quality care and treatment of\npersons receiving services in facilities operated or licensed by the Office of\n\nMental Health. (b) Restraint\nand seclusion. Included within this Part are conditions and procedures for\nrestraint and seclusion utilized for the purpose of managing violent or\nself-destructive behavior, as well as the use of restraints for medical and\npost-surgical care. (1)\n\nConsistent\nwith its statutory mandates, among the goals of the Office of Mental Health for\nthe provision of care to persons with mental illness are the assurance of a\nsafe and therapeutic environment, the reduction of danger, and the prevention\nof violent behavior. (2)\n\nRestraint\nand seclusion historically have been used in psychiatric facilities to manage\nepisodes of violent or dangerous patient behavior. Statistically, these\nemergency interventions are associated with increased risk of injury to not\nonly patients, but also to staff who utilize these interventions. Restraint and\nseclusion also may have deleterious effects on patients, including survivors of\nsexual trauma and/or physical abuse, and patients with hearing impairments who\nare unable to communicate without the use of their hands. Physical risks\ninclude serious injury or even death, and psychological injuries include\nre-traumatization for individuals with histories of abuse. (3)\n\nThe use of restraint and seclusion to\nmanage violent or self-destructive behavior can be significantly reduced\nthrough the creation and maintenance of an environment which promotes the\nempowerment of patients, identifies and implements strategies to advance\npositive behavior management and restraint reduction efforts, is strength-based\nand trauma informed, incorporates strategies in hiring or workforce development\npractices to advance these efforts, and emphasizes the education and\nsensitization of staff regarding the appropriate use of restraint and\nseclusion. (4)\n\nIt is the policy of\nthe Office of Mental Health to achieve an ongoing reduction in the use of\nrestraint and seclusion in facilities operated, certified, or monitored by the\noffice, with the goal of reducing restraint and seclusion to the status of rare\nevents, to reduce the behavioral emergencies that have prompted their use, and, wherever possible, to entirely eliminate the use of restraint and\nseclusion.
