  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 224.4 - Continuous stack monitoring\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Existing\nemission sources. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator\nof any nitric acid plant with a production capacity greater than 300 tons per\nday (expressed as 100 percent nitric acid), located in an area of the State\nwhere any applicable ambient air quality standard for nitrogen dioxide is not\nbeing attained, must install, calibrate, maintain and operate a continuous\nstack monitoring system for the measurement of nitrogen oxides (expressed as\nnitrogren dioxide) from each nitric acid producing emission source. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of any sulfuric\nacid plant with a production capacity of greater than 300 tons per day\n(expressed as 100 percent sulfuric acid) must install, calibrate, maintain and\noperate a continuous stack monitoring system for the measurement of sulfur\ndioxide from each sulfuric acid producing emission source. (b) New emission sources and modifications. A\ncontinuous monitoring system for the measurement of nitrogen oxides (expressed\nas nitrogen dioxide) from each nitric acid production source, or sulfur dioxide\nfrom each sulfuric acid production source, must be installed, calibrated, maintained and operated by the owner or operator of any new emission source or\nmodification subject to this Part. (c) Emission data reduction, record\nmaintenance and reporting. Any owner or operator subject to the provisions of\nsubdivision (a) or (b) of this section must: (1)\nsubmit a written report to the\ncommissioner for each calendar quarter. This report must include: (i) emission averages for periods of excess\nemissions (a period of excess emissions is any three-hour period during which\nthe arithmetic average of emissions for three consecutive one-hour periods\nexceeds any applicable emission standard); (ii)\nthe time and date of each period during\nwhich the continuous monitoring system was inoperative except for zero and span\nchecks, and the nature of system repairs or adjustments; or\n(iii)\ninformation that no excess emissions\nhave occurred and the continuous monitoring system has not been inoperative, repaired or adjusted, if such is the case; (2)\nestablish a conversion factor for\nconverting stack monitoring data into units of the applicable emission\nstandard. For sulfur dioxide continuous monitoring systems, the conversion\nfactor will be established at least three times daily by measuring the\nconcentration of sulfur dioxide entering the converter, using suitable methods\n(e.g., the Reich test, National Air Pollution Control Administration\n\nPublication No. 999-AP-13) and calculating the appropriate conversion factor\nfor each eight-hour period as follows: CF = k(1.000-0.015r/r-s)\nwhere: CF = conversion factor (kg/metric ton per ppm, lb/short ton\nper ppm). k = constant derived from material balance. For determining\nCF in metric units. k = 0.0653. For determining CF in English units, k =\n0.1306. r = percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume entering the gas\nconverter. Appropriate corrections must be made for air injection\nplants, subject to the commissioner's approval. s = percentage of sulfur dioxide by volume in the emissions\nto the atmosphere, determined by the continuous monitoring system. for nitrogen oxide continuous stack monitoring systems, the\nconversion factor will be established by measuring emissions with the\ncontinuous monitoring system concurrent with measuring emissions with the\napplicable reference method tests. Using only that portion of the continuous\nmonitoring emission data that represents emission measurements concurrent with\nthe reference method test periods, the conversion factor shall be determined by\ndividing the reference method test data averages by the monitoring data\naverages to obtain a ratio expressed in units of the applicable standard to\nunits of the monitoring data, i.e., kg/metric ton per ppm (lb/short ton per\nppm); (3)\nmaintain records\nof quarterly summaries, including daily production rates, hours of operation\nand all other data collected either by the continuous stack monitoring system\nor as necessary to convert stack monitoring data to the units of the applicable\nemission standards, for a period of three years from the date of collection of\nsuch data; and\n(4)\nmake such\nrecords available for inspection during normal business hours by the\ncommissioner or his representative and furnish copies of such records to the\ncommissioner or his representative upon request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n224.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
