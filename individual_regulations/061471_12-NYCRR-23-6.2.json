Only wire rope of the improved plow steel classification\nor equivalent having a safety factor of not less than six shall be used with\npower-driven hoisting machinery, except for winchheads or capstan hoists where\nfibre rope may be used. (2)\n\nFibre rope. (i) Fibre rope shall be first\ngrade manila hemp or synthetic fibre. Means to prevent chafing shall be\nprovided where necessary. Proper size blocks to accommodate the rope shall be\nused. Fibre rope shall be protected where acid or any other harmful or\ncorrosive agent or chemical is used. All fibre rope shall be stored in a dry\ncondition and in a dry place protected from the elements. (ii)\n\nFibre rope that is unsound in any way or\nthat shows the effects of severe wear, deterioration or abrasion shall not be\nused and shall be removed from the job site. Frozen rope shall be thawed before\nbeing used. (3)\n\nWire\nrope. (i) Wire rope shall be so handled and\nstored as to prevent kinks and shall be maintained lubricated to prevent\ncorrosion. Wire rope that is kinked shall not be used on any material hoist. Wire rope shall be discarded and replaced when more than 10 percent of the\ntotal wires of any lay are broken. A rope lay is that distance measured along\nthe rope in which one strand makes a complete revolution around the rope axis. Wire rope shall be discarded and replaced when the wires on the crown of the\nstrand are worn down to less than 60 percent of their original cross-sectional\narea, when visual inspection indicates marked signs of corrosion, deterioration\nor abrasion and when any combination of broken wires and abrasion has reduced\nthe original strength of the rope to 80 percent or less. (ii)\n\nThe ends of wire rope shall be securely\nattached to the hoist drums and at least four turns of rope shall remain on\neach drum at all times. Exception: Attachment of the rope to the hoist drum shall not be\nrequired on traction type hoists. (iii)\n\nMeans shall be provided to prevent\naccidental contact with or damage to any hoisting rope. Such means shall\nconsist of substantial covering, fencing or guarding by location. (4)\n\nWire rope fastenings. (i) Wire rope fastenings shall consist of\nzinc-filled sockets, wedge sockets with at least one rope clip above each\nsocket, eye-splices with pear-shaped thimbles to fit the rope, proper size\nthimbles with rope clips or other approved fastenings. (ii)\n\nWhere clips are used as fastenings, the\nnumber used shall be in accordance with Table XVI of this Subpart. (iii)\n\nThe spacing between clips shall be at\nleast six times the diameter of the rope. The U-bolts of clips shall be placed\nover the short ends of the ropes. TABLE XVI ROPE CLIP REQUIREMENTS\nRope diameter\n\nMinimum number of\nclips\n\nUp to and including 7/16 inch\n2\n\nUp to and including 5/8 inch\n3\n\nUp to and including 1 inch\n4\n\nUp to and including 1 1/4 inches\n5\n\nUp to and including 1 5/8 inches\n6\n\nUp to and including 1 3/4 inches\n7\n\nUp to and including 2 1/2 inches\n8\n\nUp to and including 3 inches\n9\n(b) Sheaves. Load-bearing sheaves for wire rope shall be of proper\ndiameter and grooving to accommodate the rope but in no case shall such\ndiameter be less than 20 times the diameter of the rope. Sheaves shall be\nmaintained properly lubricated. Sheaves and blocks that are so excessively\nworn, damaged, deteriorated or otherwise defective as to cause or threaten to\ncause failure of the equipment shall not be used. Sheaves intended for use with\nfibre rope shall not be used with wire rope. (c) Fittings. All hooks, shackles and other fittings subject to tension\nor shear shall be drop-forged. The use of deformed or damaged hooks, shackles, chains or other fittings is prohibited. All suspended pulley blocks, sheaves, well wheels or similar devices shall be moused or securely fastened or safety\nhooks shall be used. (d) Use of chains. (1)\n\nChains shall\nnot be used as slings in hoisting operations except for the raising or lowering\nof wooden piles, large timbers, large pieces of masonry or large\nstones. (2)\n\nChains shall not be\nknotted nor shall they be shortened or spliced by the use of nails or\nbolts. (3)\n\nDefective chains shall\nnot be used. (e) Heat treating of chains. The annealing or normalizing of chains shall be performed\nonly by the manufacturer or his authorized agent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
