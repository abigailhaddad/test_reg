  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 457.7 - Coordination and utilization of community resources\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provision of PSA shall not be viewed\nas a single agency responsibility but rather as a community-based service\nresponsibility. (b) As such, the\nlocal social services agency must make known and, to the extent possible, secure the active participation and cooperation of those community resources\nproviding specific services for adults. (c) Community resources to be involved will\ninclude personnel from medical, psychiatric, nursing and legal resources, law\nenforcement groups, public service agencies, advocacy groups, church councils\nand those other public and private service agencies of the particular\ncommunity. These resources shall constitute a PSA delivery network. (d) Meetings shall be held with\nrepresentative community agencies for the purpose of establishing specific\nagency roles and areas of responsibility in the provision of PSA. The social\nservices district shall initiate such efforts directed at establishing this\ncommunity-based responsibility unless such action has been initiated by other\nagencies. (e) In addition to the\ninvolvement of other community agencies in the provision of services to PSA\nclients, the other divisions/units of the local social services department, such as legal, accounting, medical assistance, income maintenance and services, shall be effectively integrated into the PSA service delivery\nnetwork. (f) Social services\ndistricts must educate the general public, service providers, advocacy groups\nand other appropriate agencies about the scope of PSA and how to obtain\nservices. Public education and outreach activities must: (1)\nbe sufficient to ensure access to\nPSA; (2)\nbe conducted on an\non-going basis; and\n(3)\nuse any\ninformational materials provided by the department.
