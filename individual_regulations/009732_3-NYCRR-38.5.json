  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 38.5 - Prevailing rate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Disclosures. A licensee or exempt organization may issue a \"prevailing rate\"\ncommitment only in compliance with this section. Prior to acceptance of a\ncommitment fee, points or other discounts, the licensee or exempt organization\nmust issue a commitment which discloses the following: (1)\n\nAll disclosures required by section\n38.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart excluding information concerning the initial interest rate, and the\ninitial monthly payment of principal and interest. (2)\n(i) Index and margin. The index and margin, if any, upon which the rate for that\nmortgage loan will be based. The index must be independently verifiable by the\nborrower and identification of a source for such verification shall be\nprovided. The commitment must also disclose any points or other discounts; or\n(ii)\n\nBase rate and deviation. A\nbase rate and the maximum interest rate at which the loan may close. The\ninterest rate at closing may never exceed one percentage point above the base\nrate. The interest rate may be adjusted downward at any time. For example, if\nthe commitment sets a base rate of 9.5 percent, the rate may float no higher\nthan 10.5 percent. A mortgage banker or exempt organization which offers\nprevailing rate commitments in accordance with this paragraph shall make\navailable for inspection a list which identifies specific products and the rate\nat which such products are available on any day (\"rate sheet\"). Such rate sheet\nshall be maintained for two years. (b) Procedures. (1)\n\nIn connection with a prevailing rate\ncommitment for which a commitment fee is accepted prior to closing, a lender\nmay offer a lower initial or introductory rate to a borrower as long as the\nindex and any margin or the description for the adjusted rate is provided in\naccordance with this section. (2)\nA\nlicensee or exempt organization may issue a commitment which specifies that a\nrate will be determined at or prior to the closing date without disclosing the\nindex and margin or base rate and deviation as provided above, only if no\ncommitment fee, origination fee, points or other discounts are accepted prior\nto the fixing of the rate. A prevailing rate offered pursuant to this section\nmust be reasonably related to market conditions at the time of the fixing of\nthe rate. (3)\n\nNothing contained\nherein shall relieve the licensee or exempt organization from disclosing in the\ncommitment any other item required by section\n38.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, including fees, points or other discounts or settlement costs.
