  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2B.06 - STOP Sign Applications\n\nState Regulations\nINSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 00A STOP signs shall be used on the flashing red approaches\nto intersections controlled by flashing signals, except where a green arrow is\ndisplayed in conjunction with the flashing red indication. STOP signs shall not\nbe used on approaches where green arrows are displayed. They also shall not be\nused on flashing yellow approaches. 00B Any STOP sign installed at a railroad grade crossing\nshall be approved by the Commissioner of Transportation, as per Section 1685 of\nthe New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law. Option: 02A Figure 2B-101 may be used as a reference to help\ndetermine whether a STOP or YIELD sign is most appropriate for use at an\nintersection where control has been deemed necessary and intersection sight\ndistance is a consideration. Support: 02B Sight distances across the corners of an intersection\nand the prevailing approach speeds on the major and minor roadways are\nsignificant in determining whether a STOP or YIELD sign should be used. Figure\n2B-101 is based on AASHTO research indicating that the clear triangular areas\nproduced by the values in the table will permit the vehicles on either road to\nstop, if necessary, before reaching the intersection. Where control is desired, a YIELD sign may be used where the clear sight triangle can be provided; a STOP\nsign should be used where the necessary clear sight triangle does not\nexist. Guidance: 02C Where the grade along an intersection approach exceeds\nthree percent, the leg of the clear sight triangle along that approach should\nbe adjusted in accordance with the values shown in Exhibit 9-53 in A Policy on\n\nGeometric Design of Highways and Streets, 2004 Edition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2B.06\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
