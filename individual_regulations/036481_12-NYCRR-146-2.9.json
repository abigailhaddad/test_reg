Tit. 12 §§ 146-2.9 - Working at tipped and non-tipped occupations on the same day\n\nState Regulations\n\nOn any day that a service employee or food service worker\nworks at a non-tipped occupation: (a) for two hours or more; or\n(b) for\nmore than 20 percent of his or her shift, whichever is less, the wages of the\nemployee shall be subject to no tip credit for that day. Example: An employee has a daily schedule as follows: 8 a.m. to\n9:45 a.m., food preparation; 9:45 a.m. to 1:30 p.m., serving food in the\nrestaurant; takes 1/2 hour meal period; 2:00 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. serving food in\nthe restaurant. That employee has worked 8 hours total, consisting of 6 hours, 15 minutes as a food service worker and 1 hour, 45 minutes in a non-tipped\noccupation. Twenty percent of an 8 hour shift is 1 hour, 36 minutes. Although\nthe employee worked for less than two hours at the non-tipped occupation, he/she has worked for more than 20 percent of his/her shift at the non-tipped\noccupation. Therefore, the employee is subject to no tip credit for that\nday. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
