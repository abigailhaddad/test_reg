  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 380-2.5 - Employees Who Acquire Eligibility During Employment\n\nState Regulations\na. An employee of a covered employer whose\nregular employment schedule is 20 or more hours per week will become eligible\nto take family leave during his or her employment with such employer, provided\nthe employee has been either: 1. In\nemployment, as defined in this Title, of the covered employer for at least 26\nconsecutive work weeks preceding the first full day family leave begins; or\n2. In employment, as defined in\nthis Title, of the covered employer during the work period usual to and\navailable during the entirety of such 26 consecutive weeks preceding the first\nfull day the leave begins in any trade or business in which he or she is\nregularly employed and in which hiring from day to day of such employees is the\nusual employment practice; or\n3. In employment, as defined in this Title, of the covered employer for at least\n26 consecutive weeks, such consecutive weeks may be tolled during periods of\nabsence that are due to the nature of that employment, such as semester breaks, and when employment is not terminated during those periods of\nabsence. b. An employee\nof a covered employer whose regular employment schedule is less than 20 hours\nper week will become eligible to take family leave from such employment after\nworking 175 days in such employment preceding the first full day the leave\nbegins. c. Maximum family leave for\nall employees. 1. Weekly leave. Any employee\ntaking family leave in weekly increments will be eligible for the maximum\nnumber of weeks of leave in any 52 consecutive week period. Weekly benefits are\npayable in accordance with subdivision 2 of section\n204\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. 2. Daily leave. When any employee takes\nfamily leave in daily increments, the employee's maximum number of days of paid\nfamily leave is calculated based on the average number of days worked per week\nmultiplied by 12 as of January 1, 2021. 3. Computing the average daily rate for daily\nleave. i. When an employee requests family\nleave in daily increments (eg. every Monday for six weeks), rather than as a\nweekly benefit, the daily benefit shall be calculated based on the employee's\naverage weekly wage (computed in the same manner as set forth in section\n355.9\n) divided by the average\nnumber of days the employee worked per week. ii. In arriving at the average number of days\nthe employee worked per week for the purpose of determining the employee's wage\nfor one day, the employer shall average the number of days the employee worked\nper week over the same eight weeks used in calculating the employee's average\nweekly wage under section\n355.9\n(2). The\naverage number of days worked may be fractional in order to accurately convert\nthe average weekly wage to an equivalent daily wage. d. In order to determine\neligibility for family leave under this section, the use of scheduled vacation\ntime; the use of personal, sick or other time away from work that has been\napproved by the employer; or other periods where the employee is away from work\nbut is still considered to be an employee by the employer, shall be counted as\nconsecutive weeks or consecutive work weeks, or days worked, as long as the\ncontributions to the cost of family leave benefits, pursuant to section\n209\nof the Workers' Compensation Law and required by the employer of like\nemployees, have been paid for such periods of time\ne. In order to determine eligibility for\nfamily leave under this section, periods of temporary disability taken pursuant\nto Article 9 of the Workers' Compensation Law shall not be counted as weeks of\nemployment or days worked for determining eligibility for paid family\nleave. f. An employee who is\neligible for both disability benefits and family leave during the same period\nof 52 consecutive calendar weeks shall not receive more than 26 total weeks of\ndisability and family leave benefits during that period of time. No employee\nshall receive more than the maximum duration of family leave benefits, pursuant\nto section\n204\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, in any 52 consecutive calendar week period as\nsuch is defined in section\n355.9\nof this Subchapter. g. 1. In the event that a period of family leave\nbenefits received by an eligible employee under this Title is concurrently\ndesignated as leave pursuant to 29 U.S. Code Chapter\n28\n(the Family and Medical\n\nLeave Act or \"FMLA\") by an employer subject to FMLA, the employer shall notify\nthe eligible employee of such designation and shall also provide the employee\nwith the notice required under\n29 CFR\n825.301\nand\n825.305. 2. If an employer fails to provide\nthe notice required by this section, the employer will be deemed to have\npermitted the eligible employee to receive family leave benefits without\nconcurrently using the benefits available under FMLA, as permitted under\nsection\n206\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. 3. If an employer designates a period of\nfamily leave to be covered by the FMLA for a reason also covered under section\n201\n(15)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, and if\nthe employer informs the employee of their eligibility for family leave\nbenefits and the employee declines to apply for payment under section\n380-5.1\nof this Part, the employer\nand its insurance carrier may count the leave against the employee's maximum\nduration of family leave in a 52 week period under section 204(2)(a). 4. FMLA designated leave taken by an employee\ndue to his or her own serious health condition is not family leave under\nsection\n201\n(15)\nof the Workers' Compensation Law and\ndoes not reduce the amount of paid family leave an employee is eligible for\nunder section 204(2)(a). 5. The\nemployer may elect to track hours taken for FMLA for any day in which the\nemployee is paid, works at least part of the day, and is thus not eligible for\npaid family leave pursuant to paragraph (d) of subdivision (3) of section\n206\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. When the total hours taken for FMLA in less\nthan full day increments reaches the number of hours in an employee's usual\nwork day, the employer may deduct one day of paid family leave benefits from an\nemployee's annual available family leave benefit. The employer shall not be\nentitled to reimbursement from its carrier for such paid FMLA hours. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
