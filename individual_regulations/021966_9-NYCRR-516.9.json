Unless it appears that there is\ngood cause to believe no conflict of interest is likely to arise, the military\njudge must take appropriate measures to protect each accused's right to\ncounsel; and\n(e) ascertain from the\naccused by whom the accused chooses to be represented. (v) Unsworn counsel. The military judge must\nadminister the oath to any counsel not sworn. (5)\n\nPresence of members.

(iv)\n\nWhere the military judge is not eligible to act because the military judge is\nnot qualified under N.Y.R.C.M. 502(c) or not detailed under N.Y.R.C.M. 503(b). (v) Where the military\njudge, the military judge's spouse, or a person within the third degree of\nrelationship to either of them or a spouse of such person: (a) is a party to the proceeding; (b) is known by the military judge to have an\ninterest, financial or otherwise, that could be substantially affected by the\noutcome of the proceeding; or\n(c) is to the military judge's knowledge likely to be a material witness in the\nproceeding. (3)\n\nDefinitions.

(ii)\nthe degree of relationship is calculated\naccording to the civil law system. (iii)\n\"military judge\" does not include the\npresident of a special court-martial without a military judge. (4)\n\nProcedure. (i) The military judge must, upon motion of\nany party or sua sponte, decide whether he is disqualified. (ii)\n\nEach party may question the military\njudge and present evidence regarding a possible ground for disqualification\nbefore the military judge decides the matter. (iii)\n\nExcept as provided under paragraph (5)\nof this subdivision, if the military judge rules that he is disqualified, he\nmust excuse himself. (5)\n\nWaiver. No military judge is to accept from the parties to the proceeding a\nwaiver of any ground for disqualification enumerated in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. Where the ground for disqualification arises only under paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, waiver may be accepted provided it is preceded by a\nfull disclosure on the record of the basis for disqualification. (c) Accused's elections on\ncomposition of court-martial. (1)\n\nTime of\nelections. (i) Request for enlisted members. Before the end of the initial session under 130.39(a), ML or, in the absence of\nsuch a session, before assembly, the military judge must ascertain, as\napplicable, whether an enlisted accused elects to be tried by a court-martial\nincluding enlisted members (130.25[c][1], ML). The military judge may, as a\nmatter of discretion permit the accused to defer requesting enlisted members\nuntil any time before assembly, which time may be determined by the military\njudge. (ii)\n\nRequest for trial by\nmilitary judge alone. Before the end of the initial session under 130.39(a), ML\nor, in the absence of such a session, before assembly, the military judge must\nascertain, as applicable, whether in a noncapital case, the accused requests\ntrial by the military judge alone (130.16 [1][B], [2][c], ML). The accused may\ndefer requesting trial by military judge alone until any time before\nassembly. (2)\n\nForm of\nelection. (i) Request for enlisted members. A\nrequest for membership of the court-martial to include enlisted persons must be\nin writing and signed by the accused or shall be made orally on the\nrecord. (ii)\n\nRequest for trial by\nmilitary judge alone. A request for trial by military judge alone must either\nbe in writing and signed by the accused or be made orally on the\nrecord. (3)\n\nAction on\nelection. (i) Request for enlisted members. Upon notice of a timely written request for enlisted members by an enlisted\naccused, the convening authority shall detail enlisted members to the\ncourt-martial in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 503 or prepare a detailed written\nstatement explaining why physical conditions or military exigencies prevented\nthis. The trial of the general issue cannot proceed until this is\ndone. (ii)\n\nRequest for military\njudge alone. Upon receipt of a timely request for trial by military judge alone\nthe military judge must: (a) ascertain whether\nthe accused has consulted with defense counsel and has been informed of the\nidentity of the military judge and of the right to trial by members; and\n(b) approve or disapprove the\nrequest, in the military judge's discretion. (iii)\n\nOther. In the absence of a request for\nenlisted members or a request for trial by military judge alone, trial must be\nby a court-martial composed of officers. (4)\n\nRight to withdraw request. (i) Enlisted members. A request for enlisted\nmembers may be withdrawn, by the accused as a matter of right any time before\nthe end of the initial session under 130.39(a), ML or, in the absence of such a\nsession, before assembly. (ii)\n\nMilitary judge. A request for trial by military judge alone may be withdrawn by\nthe accused as a matter of right any time before it is approved, or, even after\napproval, if there is a change of the military judge. (5)\n\nUntimely requests. Failure to request, or\nfailure to withdraw a request for enlisted members or trial by military judge\nalone in a timely manner waives the right to submit or to withdraw such a\nrequest. However, the military judge may until the beginning of the\nintroduction of evidence on the merits, as a matter of discretion, approve an\nuntimely request or withdrawal of a request. (6)\n\nScope. For purposes of this subdivision, military judge does not include the president of a special court-martial\nwithout a military judge. (d) Arraignment. Arraignment must be\nconducted in a court-martial session and consists of reading the charges and\nspecification to the accused and calling on the accused to plead. The accused\nmay waive the reading. (e) Motions\ngenerally. (1)\n\nDefinitions and form. A motion\nis an application to the military judge for particular relief. Motions may be\noral or, at the discretion of the military judge, written. A motion must state\nthe grounds upon which it is made and must set forth the ruling or relief\nsought. The substance of a motion, not its form or designation, controls. (2)\n\nPretrial motions. Any\ndefense, objection, or request which is capable of determination without the\ntrial of the general issue of guilt may be raised before trial. The following\nmust be raised before a plea is entered: (i) defenses or objections based on defects (other than jurisdictional defects) in\nthe preferral, forwarding, investigation, or referral of charges; (ii)\ndefenses or objections based on defects\nin the charges and specifications (other than any failure to show jurisdiction\nor to charge an offense, which objections must be resolved by the military\njudge at any time during the pendency of the proceedings); (iii)\nmotions to suppress evidence; (iv)\nmotions for discovery under N.Y.R.C.M. 701 or for production of witnesses or evidence; (v) motions for severance of charges or\naccused; or\n(vi)\nobjections based\non denial of request for individual military counsel or for retention of\ndetailed defense counsel when individual military counsel has been\ngranted. (3)\n\nBurden of\nproof. (i) Standard. Unless otherwise\nprovided in this Chapter, the burden of proof on any factual issue the\nresolution of which is necessary to decide a motion is by a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (ii)\n\nAssignment. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this\n\nChapter the burden of persuasion on any factual issue the resolution of which\nis necessary to decide a motion is on the moving party. (b) In the case of a motion to dismiss for\nlack of jurisdiction, denial of the right to speedy trial under N.Y.R.C.M. 707\nor the running of the statute of limitations, the burden of persuasion upon the\n\nState. (4)\n\nRuling on motions. A motion made before pleas are entered must be determined\nbefore pleas are entered unless, if otherwise not prohibited by this Chapter, the military judge for good cause orders that determination be deferred until\ntrial of the general issue or after findings, but no such determination be\ndeferred if a party's right to review or appeal is adversely affected. Where\nfactual issues are involved in determining a motion, the military judge must\nstate the essential findings on the record. (5)\n\nEffect of failure to raise defenses or\nobjections. Failure by a party to raise defenses or objections or to make\nrequests which must be made before pleas are entered under paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision constitutes waiver. The military judge for good cause shown\nmay grant relief from the waiver. Other requests, defenses, or objections, except lack of jurisdiction or failure of a charge to allege an offense, must\nbe raised before the court-martial is finally adjourned for that case and, unless otherwise provided in this Chapter, failure to do so constitutes\nwaiver. (6)\n\nReconsideration. On\nrequest of any party or sua sponte, the military judge may reconsider any\nruling, other than one amounting to a finding of not guilty, made by the\nmilitary judge. (7)\n\nEffect of final\ndeterminations. Any matter put in issue and finally determined by a\ncourt-martial, reviewing authority, or appellate court which had jurisdiction\nto determine the matter may not be disputed by the State in any other\ncourt-martial of the same accused, except that, when the offenses charged at\none court-martial did not arise out of the same transaction as charged at the\ncourt-martial at which the determination was made, a determination of law and\nthe application of law to the facts may be disputed by the State. This\nsubdivision also applies to matters which were put in issue and finally\ndetermined in any other judicial proceeding in which the accused and the State\nwere parties. (8)\n\nWritten motions. Written motions may be submitted to the military judge after referral and when\nappropriate they may be supported by affidavits, with service and opportunity\nto reply to the opposing party. Such motions may be disposed of before\narraignment and without a session. Upon request, either party is entitled to a\nsession under 130.39(a), ML to present oral argument or have an evidentiary\nhearing concerning the disposition of written motions. (9)\n\nService. Written motions are to be served\non all other parties. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, the\nservice is to be made upon counsel for each party. (10)\n\nApplications to convening authority. Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, any matters which may be resolved\nupon motion without trial of the general issue of guilt may be submitted by a\nparty to the convening authority before trial for decision. Submissions of such\nmatter to the convening authority is not, except as otherwise provided in this\n\nChapter, required, and is, in any event, without prejudice to the renewal of\nthe issue by timely motion before the military judge. (11)\n\nProduction of statements on motion to\nsuppress. Except as provided in this paragraph N.Y.R.C.M. 914 applies at a\nhearing on a motion to suppress evidence under subparagraph (2)(iii) of this\nsubdivision. For purposes of this paragraph, a law enforcement officer is\ndeemed a witness called by the State, and upon a claim of privilege the\nmilitary judge must excise portions of the statement containing privileged\nmatter. (f) Motions for\nappropriate relief. (1)\n\nIn general. A motion\nfor appropriate relief is a request for a ruling to cure a defect which\ndeprives a party of a right or hinders a party from preparing for trial or\npresenting its case. (2)\n\nGrounds\nfor appropriate relief. The following may be requested by motion for\nappropriate relief. This list is not exclusive. (i) Continuances. A continuance may be\ngranted only by the military judge. (ii)\n\nRecord of denial of individual military\ncounsel or of denial of request to retain detailed counsel when a request for\nindividual military counsel was granted. If a request for military counsel was\ndenied, which denial was upheld on appeal (if available) or if a request to\nretain detailed counsel was denied when the accused is represented by\nindividual military counsel, and if the accused so requests, the military judge\nmust ensure that a record of the matter is included in the record of trial, and\nmay make a finding. The trial counsel may request a continuance to inform the\nconvening authority of those findings. The military judge may not dismiss the\ncharges or otherwise effectively prevent further proceedings based on this\nissue. However, the military judge may grant reasonable continuances until the\nrequested military counsel can be made available if the unavailability results\nfrom temporary conditions or if the decision of unavailability is in the\nprocess of review in administrative channels. (iii)\n\nCorrection of defects in the\ninvestigation under 130.32, ML or pretrial advice. (iv)\n\nAmendment of charges or specifications. A charge or specification may not be amended over the accused's objection\nunless the amendment is minor within the meaning of N.Y.R.C.M. 603(a). (v) Severance of a\nduplicious specification into two or more specifications. (vi)\n\nBill of particulars. A bill of\nparticulars may be amended at any time, subject to such conditions as justice\npermits. (vii)\n\nDiscovery and\nproduction of evidence and witnesses. (viii)\n\nRelief from pretrial confinement in\nviolation of N.Y.R.C.M. 305. (ix)\n\nSeverance of multiple accused, if it appears than an accused or the State is\nprejudiced by a joint or common trial. In a common trial, a severance must be\ngranted whenever any accused, other than the moving accused, faces charges\nunrelated to those charged against the moving accused. (x) Severance of offenses, but only to\nprevent manifest injustice. (xi)\n\nChange of place of trial. The place of trial may be changed when necessary to\nprevent prejudice to the rights of the accused or for the convenience of the\n\nState if the rights of the accused are not prejudiced thereby. (xii)\n\nDetermination of multiplicity of\noffenses for sentencing purposes. (xiii)\n\nPreliminary ruling on admissibility of\nevidence. (xiv)\n\nMotions relating to\nmental capacity or responsibility of the accused. (g) Motions to dismiss. (1)\n\nIn general. A motion to dismiss is a\nrequest to terminate further proceedings as to one or more charges and\nspecifications on grounds capable of resolution without trial of the general\nissue of guilt. (2)\n\nGrounds for\ndismissal. Grounds for dismissal include the following: (i) Nonwaivable grounds. A charge or\nspecification must be dismissed at any stage of the proceedings if: (a) The court-martial lacks jurisdiction to\ntry the accused for the offense; or\n(b) The specification fails to state an\noffense. (ii)\n\nWaivable\ngrounds. A charge or specification must be dismissed upon motion made by the\naccused before the final adjournment of the court-martial in that case if: (a) dismissal is required under N.Y.R.C.M. 707; (b) the statute of limitations\n(ML, 130.43) has run, provided that if it appears that the accused is unaware\nof the right to assert the statute of limitations in bar of trial, the military\njudge shall inform the accused of this right; (c) the accused has previously been tried by\ncourt-martial under the code or State civilian court for the same offense, provided that: (1)\nno court-martial proceeding\nis a trial in the sense of this rule unless presentation of evidence on the\ngeneral issue of guilty has begun; (2)\nno court-martial proceeding which has\nbeen terminated under N.Y.R.C.M. 604(b) or N.Y.R.C.M. 915 bars later\nprosecution for the same offense or offenses, if so provided in those\nrules; (3)\nno court-martial\nproceeding in which an accused has been found guilty of any charge or\nspecification is a trial in the sense of this subdivision until the finding of\nguilty has become final after review of the case has been fully completed; and\n(4)\nno court-martial proceeding\nwhich lacked jurisdiction to try the accused for the offense is a trial in the\nsense of this subdivision; (d) prosecution is barred by: (1)\na pardon issued by the\n\nGovernor; (2)\nimmunity from\nprosecution granted by a person authorized to do so; (3)\nconstructive condonation of desertion\nestablished by unconditional restoration to duty without trial of a deserter by\na general court-martial convening authority who knew of the desertion; or\n(4)\nprior punishment under\n130.13 or 130.15, ML for the same offense, if that offense was minor. (iii)\n\nPermissible\ngrounds. A specification may be dismissed upon timely motion by the accused if: (a) the specification is so defective that it\nsubstantially mislead the accused, and the military judge finds that, in the\ninterest of justice, trial should proceed on remaining charges and\nspecifications without undue delay; or\n(b) the specification is multiplicious with\nanother specification, is unnecessary to enable the prosecution to meet the\nexigencies of proof through trial, review, and appellate action, and should be\ndismissed in the interest of justice. (h) [Reserved ]\n(i) Capacity of the accused to stand trial by\ncourt-martial. (1)\n\nIn general. No person may\nbe brought to trial by court-martial unless that person possesses sufficient\nmental capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings against that person\nand to conduct or cooperate intelligently in the defense of the case. (2)\n\nPresumption of capacity. A person is\npresumed to have the capacity to stand trial unless the contrary\nappears. (3)\n\nDetermination at\ntrial. (i) Nature of issue. The mental\ncapacity of the accused is an interlocutory question of fact. (ii)\n\nStandard. Trial may proceed unless it is\nestablished by a preponderance of the evidence that the accused is presently\nsuffering from a mental disease or defect rendering him or her mentally\nincompetent to the extent that he or she is unable to understand the nature of\nthe proceedings against the accused or conduct or cooperate intelligently in\nthe defense of the case. (j) Pleas. (1)\n\nAlternatives. (i) In general. An accused may plead not\nguilty or guilty (130.45, ML). An accused may plead, by exceptions or by\nexceptions and substitutions, not guilty to an offense as charged, but guilty\nto an offense included in that offense. A plea of guilty may not be received as\nto an offense for which the death penalty may be adjudged by the\ncourt-martial. (ii)\n\nConditional\npleas. With the approval of the military judge and the consent of the State, an\naccused may enter a conditional plea of guilty, reserving in writing the right, of further review or appeal, to review of the adverse determination of any\nspecified pretrial motion. If the accused prevails on further review or appeal, the accused must be allowed to withdraw the plea of guilty. The trial counsel\nmay consent on behalf of the State. (2)\n\nRefusal to plead; irregular plea. If an\naccused fails or refuses to plead, or makes an irregular plea, the military\njudge must enter a plea of not guilty for the accused. (3)\n\nAdvice to accused. Before accepting a\nplea of guilty, the military judge must address the accused personally and\ninform the accused of, and determine that the accused understands, the\nfollowing: (i) the nature of the offense to\nwhich the plea is offered, the mandatory minimum penalty, if any, provided by\nlaw, and the maximum possible penalty provided by law; (ii)\nin a general or special court-martial, if the accused is not represented by counsel, the accused has the right to be\nrepresented by counsel at every state of the proceedings; (iii)\nthat the accused has the right to plead\nnot guilty or to persists in that plea if already made, and that the accused\nhas the right to be tried by a court-martial, and that at such trial the\naccused has the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses against the\naccused, and the right against self- incrimination; (iv)\nthat if the accused pleads guilty, there\nwill not be a trial of any kind as to those offenses to which the accused has\nso pleaded, so that by pleading guilty the accused waived the rights described\nin subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph; and\n(v) that if the accused pleads guilty, the\nmilitary judge will question the accused about the offenses to which the\naccused has pleaded guilty, and, if the accused answers these questions under\noath, on the record, and in the presence of counsel, the accused's answers may\nlater be used against the accused in a prosecution for perjury or false\nstatement. (4)\n\nEnsuring\nthat the plea is voluntary. The military judge cannot accept a plea of guilty\nwithout first, by addressing the accused personally, determining that the plea\nis voluntary and not the result of force or threats or of promises apart from a\nplea agreement under N.Y.R.C.M. 705. The military judge must also inquire\nwhether the accused's willingness to plead guilty results from prior\ndiscussions between the convening authority, a representative of the convening\nauthority, or trial counsel, and the accused or defense counsel. (5)\n\nDetermining accuracy of plea. The\nmilitary judge cannot accept a plea of guilty without making such inquiry of\nthe accused as will satisfy the military judge that there is a factual basis\nfor the plea. The accused must be questioned under oath about the\noffenses. (6)\n\nPlea agreement\ninquiry. (i) In general. A plea agreement may\nnot be accepted if it does not comply with N.Y.R.C.M. 705. (ii)\n\nNotice. The parties must inform the\nmilitary judge if a plea agreement exists. (iii)\n\nDisclosure. If a plea agreement exists, the military judge must require disclosure of the entire agreement before the\nplea is accepted, provided that in trial before military judge alone the\nmilitary judge ordinarily cannot examine any sentence limitation contained in\nthe agreement until after the sentence of the court-martial has been\nannounced. (iv)\n\nInquiry. The\nmilitary judge must inquire to ensure: (a) that the accused understands the agreement; and\n(b) that the parties agree to the terms of\nthe agreement. (7)\n\nFindings. Findings based on a plea of\nguilty may be entered immediately upon acceptance of the plea at a session\nunder ML, 130.39(a), unless: (i) the plea is\nto a lesser included offense and the State intends to proceed to trial on the\noffense as charged; or\n(ii)\ntrial\nis by a special court-martial without a military judge, in which case the\npresident of the court-martial may enter findings based on the pleas without a\nformal vote except when this subparagraph applies. (8)\n\nLater action. (i) Withdrawal by accused. If after\nacceptance of the plea but before the sentence is announced the accused\nrequests to withdraw a plea of guilty and substitute a plea of not guilty or a\nplea of guilty to a lesser included offense, the military judge may as a matter\nof discretion permit the accused to do so. (ii)\n\nStatements by accused inconsistent with\nplea. If after findings but before the sentence is announced the accused makes\na statement to the court-martial, in testimony or otherwise, or presents\nevidence which is inconsistent with a plea of guilty on which a finding is\nbased, the military judge must inquire into the providence of the plea. If, following such inquiry, it appears that the accused entered the plea\nimprovidently or through lack of understanding of its meaning and effect a plea\nof not guilty must be entered as to the affected charges and\nspecification. (iii)\n\nPretrial\nagreement inquiry. After sentence is announced the military judge must inquire\ninto any parts of a pretrial agreement which were not previously examined by\nthe military judge. If the military judge determines that the accused does not\nunderstand the material terms of the agreement, or that the parties disagree as\nto such terms, the military judge must conform, with the consent of the State, the agreement to the accused's under standing or permit the accused to withdraw\nthe plea. (9)\n\nRecord of\nproceedings. Verbatim record of the guilty plea proceedings must be made in\ncases in which a verbatim record is required under N.Y.C.R.M. 1103. In other\nspecial courts- martial, a summary of the explanation and replies shall be\nincluded in the record of trial. As to summary courts-martial, see N.Y.R.C.M. 1305. (10)\n\nWaiver. Except as\nprovided in subparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, a plea of guilty which\nresults in a finding of guilty waives any objection, whether or not previously\nraised, insofar as the objection relates to the factual issue of guilt of the\noffense(s) to which the plea was made. (k) Assembly of the court-martial. (1)\n\nThe military judge must announce the\nassembly of the court-martial. (l) Challenge of selection of members; examination and challenges of members. (1)\n\nPretrial matters. (i) Questionnaires. Before\ntrial the trial counsel may, and must upon request of the defense counsel, submit to each member written questions requesting the following information: (a) date of birth; (b) sex; (c) race; (d) marital status and sex, age, and number\nof dependents; (e) home of\nrecord; (f) civilian and military\neducation, including, when available, major areas of study, name of school or\ninstitution, years of education, and degrees received; (g) current unit to which assigned; (h) past duty assignments; (i) awards and decorations\nreceived; (j) date of rank; and\n(k) whether the member has\nacted as accuser, counsel, investigating officer, convening authority, or legal\nofficer or staff judge advocate for the convening authority in the case, or has\nforwarded the charges with a recommendation as to disposition. Additional information may be requested with the approval\nof the military judge. Each member's responses to the questions must be written\nand signed the by member. (ii)\n\nOther materials. A copy of any written\nmaterials considered by the convening authority in selecting the members\ndetailed to the court-martial must be provided to any party upon request, except that such materials pertaining solely to persons who were not selected\nfor detail as members need not be provided unless the military judge, for good\ncause, so directs. (2)\n\nChallenge of selection of members. (i) Motion. Before the examination of members under paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision begins, or at the next session after a party discovered or could\nhave discovered by the exercise of diligence, the grounds therefor, whichever\nis earlier, that party may move to stay the proceedings on the ground that\nmembers were selected improperly. (ii)\n\nProcedure. Upon a motion under\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph containing an offer of proof of matters\nwhich, if true, would constitute improper selection of members, the moving\nparty is entitled to present evidence, including any written materials\nconsidered by the convening authority in selecting the members. Any other party\nmay also present evidence on the matter. If the military judge determines that\nthe members have been selected improperly, the military judge must stay any\nproceedings requiring the presence of members until members are properly\nselected. (iii)\n\nWaiver. Failure to\nmake a timely motion under this paragraph waives the improper selection unless\nit constitutes a violation of N.Y.R.C.M. 501(a), 502(a)(1), or\n503(a)(2). (3)\n\nStating\ngrounds for challenge. The trial counsel must state any ground for challenge\nfor cause against any member of which the trial counsel is aware. (4)\n\nExamination of members. The military\njudge may permit the parties to conduct the examination of members or may\npersonally conduct the examination. In the latter event the military judge is\nto permit the parties to supplement the examination by such further inquiry as\nthe military judge deems proper or the military judge must submit to the\nmembers such additional questions by the parties as the military judge deems\nproper. A member may be questioned outside the presence of other members when\nthe military judge so directs. (5)\n\nEvidence. Any party may present evidence relating to whether grounds for\nchallenge exist against a member. (6)\n\nChallenges and removal for cause (see ML, 130.42). (i) Grounds. A member must be\nexcused for cause whenever it appears that the member: (a) is not competent to serve as a member\nunder ML, 130.25(a), (b) or (c); (b) has not been properly detailed as a\nmember of the court-martial; (c) is\nan accuser as to any offense charged; (d) will be a witness in the\ncourt-martial; (e) has acted as\ncounsel for any party as to any offense charged; (f) has been an investigating officer as to\nany offense charged; (g) has acted\nin the same case as convening authority or as the legal officer or staff judge\nadvocate to the convening authority; (h) will act in the same case as reviewing\nauthority or as the legal officer or staff judge advocate to the reviewing\nauthority; (i) has forwarded\ncharges in the case with a personal recommendation as to disposition; (j) upon a rehearing or new or other trial of\nthe case, was a member of the court-martial which heard the case\nbefore; (k) is junior to the\naccused in grade or rank, unless it is established that this could not be\navoided; (l) is in arrest or\nconfinement; (m) has informed or\nexpressed a definite opinion as to the guilt or innocence of the accused as to\nany offense charged; (n) should not\nsit as a member in the interest of having the court-martial free from\nsubstantial doubt as to legality, fairness, and impartiality. (ii)\n\nWhen made. (a) Upon completion of examination. Upon\ncompletion of any examination under paragraph (4) of this subdivision and the\npresentation of evidence, if any, on the matter, each party must state any\nchallenges for cause it elects to make. (b) Other times. A challenge for cause may be\nmade at any other time during trial when it becomes apparent that a ground for\nchallenge may exist. Such examination of the member and presentation of\nevidence as may be necessary may be made in order to resolve the\nmatter. (iii)\n\nProcedure. Each party may make challenges outside the presence of the members. The party\nmaking a challenge must state the grounds for it. Ordinarily the trial counsel\nenters any challenges for cause before the defense counsel. The military judge\nrules finally on each challenge. When a challenge for cause is granted, the\nmember concerned is excused. The burden of establishing that grounds for a\nchallenge exist is upon the party making the challenge. A member successfully\nchallenged must be excused. (iv)\n\nWaiver. The grounds for challenge is clause (i)(a) of this paragraph may not be\nwaived except that membership of enlisted members in the same unit as the\naccused may be waived. Membership of enlisted members in the same unit as the\naccused and any other ground for challenge is waived if the party knew of or\ncould have discovered by the exercise of diligence the ground for challenge and\nfailed to raise it in a timely manner. Notwithstanding the absence of a\nchallenge or waiver of challenge by the parties, the military judge may, in the\ninterest of justice, excuse a member against whom a challenge for cause would\nlie. When a challenge for cause has been denied, failure by the challenging\nparty to exercise a peremptory challenge against any member constitutes waiver\nof further consideration of the challenge upon later review. However, when a\nchallenge for cause is denied, a peremptory challenge by the challenging party\nagainst any member preserves the issue for later review, provided that when the\nmember who was unsuccessfully challenged for cause is peremptorily challenged\nby the same party, that party must state that it would have exercised its\nperemptory challenge against another member is the challenge for cause had been\ngranted. (7)\n\nPeremptory\nchallenges. (i) Procedure. Each party may\nchallenge one member peremptorily (130.41[b], ML). Any member so challenged\nmust be excused. No party may be required to exercise a peremptory challenge\nbefore the examination of members and determination of any challenges for cause\nhas been completed. Ordinarily the trial counsel enters any peremptory\nchallenge before the defense. (ii)\n\nWaiver. Failure to exercise a peremptory challenge when properly called upon to\ndo so waives the right to make such a challenge. The military judge may, for\ngood cause shown, grant relief from the waiver, but a peremptory challenge may\nnot be made after the presentation of evidence before the members has begun. However, nothing in this paragraph bars the exercise of a previously\nunexercised peremptory challenge against a member newly detailed under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 505(c)(2)(B), even if presentation of evidence on the merits has\nbegun. (8)\n\nSpecial\ncourts-martial without a military judge. In a special court-martial without a\nmilitary judge, the procedures in this subdivision apply, except that\nchallenges must be made in the presence of the members and a ruling on any\nchallenge for cause must be decided by a majority vote of the members upon\nsecret written ballot in closed session. The challenged member cannot be\npresent at the closed session at which the challenge is decided. A tie vote on\na challenge disqualifies the member challenged. Before closing, the president\nmust give such instructions as may be necessary to resolve the challenge. Each\nchallenge must be decided separately, and all unexcused members except the\nchallenged member must participate. When only three members are present and one\nis challenged, the remaining two may decide the challenge. When the president\nis challenged, the next senior member acts as president for purposes of\ndeciding the challenge. (9)\n\nDefinitions. (i) For purposes of this\nsubdivision, military judge does not include the president of a special\ncourt-martial without a military judge. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision witness\nincludes one who testifies at a court-martial and anyone whose declaration is\nreceived in evidence for any purpose, including written declarations made by\naffidavit or otherwise. (iii)\n\nFor\npurpose of this subdivision, investigating officer includes any person who has\ninvestigated charges under N.Y.R.C.M. 405 and any person who as counsel for a\nmember of a court of inquiry, or otherwise personally has conducted an\ninvestigation of the general matter involving the offenses charged. (m) Presentation of the\ncase on the merits. (1)\n\nPreliminary\ninstructions. The military judge may give such preliminary instructions as may\nbe appropriate. (2)\n\nOpening\nstatements. Each party may make one opening statement to the court-martial\nbefore presentation of evidence has begun. The defense may elect to make its\nstatement after the prosecution has rested, before the presentation of evidence\nfor the defense. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the\nparties to address the court-martial at other times. (3)\n\nPresentation of evidence. Each party has\nfull opportunity to present evidence. (i) Order of presentation. Ordinarily the following sequence is followed: (a) presentation of evidence for the\nprosecution; (b) presentation of\nevidence for the defense; (c) presentation of prosecution evidence in rebuttal; (d) presentation of defense evidence in\nsurrebuttal; (e) additional\nrebuttal evidence in the discretion of the military judge; and\n(f) presentation of evidence requested by the\nmilitary judge or members. (ii)\n\nTaking testimony. The testimony of\nwitnesses is taken orally in open session, unless otherwise provided in this\n\nChapter. (iii)\n\nViews and\ninspections. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit the\ncourt-martial to view or inspect premises or a place or an article or object. Such a view or inspection may take place only in the presence of all parties, the members (if any), and the military judge. A person familiar with the scene\nmay be designated by the military judge to escort the court-martial. Such\nperson must perform the duties of escort under oath. The escort cannot testify, but may point out particular features prescribed by the military judge. Any\nstatement made at the view or inspection by the escort, a party, the military\njudge, or any member must be made part of the record. (iv)\n\nEvidence subject to exclusion. When\noffered evidence would be subject to exclusion upon objection, the military\njudge may, as a matter of discretion, bring the matter to the attention of the\nparties and may, in the interest of justice, exclude the evidence without an\nobjection by a party. (v) Reopening\ncase. The military judge may, as a matter of discretion, permit a party to\nreopen its case after it has rested. (n) Production of statements of witnesses. (1)\n\nMotion for production. After a witness\nother than the accused has testified on direct examination, the military judge, on motion of a party who did not call the witness, must order the party who\ncalled the witness to produce, for examination and use by the moving party, any\nstatement of the witness that relates to the subject matter concerning which\nthe witness has testified, and that is: (i) in the case of a witness called by the trial counsel, in the possession of the\n\nState; or\n(ii)\nin the case of a\nwitness called by the defense, in the possession of the accused or defense\ncounsel. (2)\n\nProduction\nof entire statement. If the entire contents of the statement relate to the\nsubject matter concerning which the witness has testified, the military judge\nmust order that the statement be delivered to the moving party. (3)\n\nProduction of excised statement. If the\nparty who called the witness claims that the statement contains matter that\ndoes not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness has\ntestified, the military judge must order that it be delivered to the military\njudge. Upon inspection, the military judge must excise the portions of the\nstatement that do not relate to the subject matter concerning which the witness\nhas testified, and must order that the statement, with such material excised, be delivered to the moving party. Any portion of a statement that is withheld\nfrom an accused over objection must be preserved by the trial counsel, and, in\nthe event of a conviction, must be made available to the reviewing authorities\nfor the purpose of determining the correctness of the decision to excise the\nportion of the statement. (4)\n\nRecess for examination of the statement. Upon delivery of the statement to the\nmoving party, the military judge may recess the trial for the examination of\nthe statement and preparation for its use in the trial. (5)\n\nRemedy for failure to produce statement. If the other party elects not to comply with an order to deliver a statement to\nthe moving party, the military judge must order that the testimony of the\nwitness be disregarded by the trier of fact and that the trial proceed, or, if\nit is the trial counsel who elects not to comply, must declare a mistrial if\nrequired in the interest of justice. (6)\n\nDefinition. As used in this Part, a\nstatement of a witness means: (i) a written\nstatement made by the witness that is signed or otherwise adopted or approved\nby the witness; (ii)\na\nsubstantially verbatim recital of an oral statement made by the witness that is\nrecorded contemporaneously with the making of the oral statement and contained\nin a stenographic, mechanical, electrical, or other recording or a\ntranscription thereof; or\n(iii)\na\nstatement, however taken or recorded, or a transcription thereof, made by the\nwitness to a State grand jury. (o) Mistrial. (1)\n\nIn general. The military judge may, as a\nmatter of discretion, declare a mistrial when such action is manifestly\nnecessary in the interest of justice because of circumstances arising during\nthe proceedings which cast substantial doubt upon the fairness of the\nproceedings. A mistrial may be declared as to some or all charges, and as to\nthe entire proceedings or as to only the proceedings after findings. (2)\n\nProcedure. On motion for a mistrial or\nwhen it otherwise appears that grounds for a mistrial may exist, the military\njudge must inquire into the views of the parties on the matter and then decide\nthe matter as an interlocutory question. (3)\n\nEffect of declaration of mistrial. (i) Withdrawal of charges. A declaration of a\nmistrial has the effect of withdrawing the affected charges and specifications\nfrom the court-martial. (ii)\n\nFurther proceedings. A declaration of a mistrial does not prevent trial by\nanother court-martial on the affected charges and specifications except when\nthe mistrial was declared after jeopardy attached and before findings, and the\ndeclaration was: (a) an abuse of discretion\nand without the consent of the defense; or\n(b) the direct result of intentional\nprosecutorial misconduct designed to necessitate a mistrial. (p) Defenses. (1)\n\nIn general. As used in this\nsubdivision defenses includes any special defense which, although not denying\nthat the accused committed the objective acts constituting the offense charged, denies, wholly or partially, criminal responsibility for those acts. (2)\n\nBurden of proof. Except for the defense\nof lack of mental responsibility, once a defense under this subdivision is\nplaced in issue by some evidence, the prosecution shall have the burden of\nproving beyond a reasonable doubt that the defense did not exist. The accused\nhas the burden of proving the defense of lack of mental responsibility by clear\nand convincing evidence. (3)\n\nJustification. A death, injury, or other act caused or done in the proper\nperformance of a legal duty is justified and not unlawful. (4)\n\nObedience to orders. It is a defense to\nany offense that the accused was acting pursuant to orders unless the accused\nknew the orders to be unlawful or a person of ordinary sense and understanding\nwould have known the orders to be unlawful. (5)\n\nSelf-defense. (i) Certain assaults. It is a defense to any\nassault punishable under ML, 130.86 or 130.87 that the accused: (a) apprehended, upon reasonable grounds, that bodily harm was about to be inflicted wrongfully on the accused; and\n(b) believed that the force the\naccused used was necessary for protection against bodily harm. (ii)\n\nLoss of right to\nself-defense. The right to self-defense is lost and the defense described in\nsubparagraph (i)(1) of this paragraph does not apply if the accused was an\naggressor, engaged in mutual combat, or provoked the attack which gave rise to\nthe apprehension, unless the accused had withdrawn in good faith after the\naggression, combat, or provocation and before the offense alleged\noccurred. (iii)\n\nDefense of another. The principle of self-defense under subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph apply to defense of another. It is a defense to any assault under ML, 130.86 or 130.87 that the accused acted in defense of another, provided that\nthe accused may not use more force than the person defended was lawfully\nentitled to use under the circumstances. (6)\n\nAccident. A death, injury, or other event\nwhich occurs as the unintentional and unexpected result of doing a lawful act\nin a lawful manner is an accident and excusable. (7)\n\nEntrapment. It is a defense that the\ncriminal design or suggestion to commit the offense originated in the State and\nthe accused had no predisposition to commit the offense. (8)\n\nCoercion or duress. It is a defense to\nany offense under the code that the accused's participation in the offense was\ncaused by a reasonable apprehension that the accused or another innocent person\nwould be immediately killed or would immediately suffer serious bodily injury\nif the accused did not commit the act. The apprehension must reasonably\ncontinue throughout the commission of the act. If the accused has any\nreasonable opportunity to avoid committing the act without subjecting the\naccused or another innocent person to the harm threatened, this defense does\nnot apply. (9)\n\nInability. It is a\ndefense to refusal or failure to perform a duty that the accused was, through\nno fault of the accused, not physically or financially able to perform the\nduty. (10)\n\nIgnorance or mistake of\nfact. Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, it is a defense to an\noffense that the accused held, as a result of ignorance or mistake, an\nincorrect belief of the true circumstances such that, if the circumstances were\nas the accused believed them, the accused would not be guilty of the offense. If the ignorance or mistake goes to an element requiring premeditation, specific intent, willfulness, or knowledge of a particular fact, the ignorance\nor mistake need only have existed in the mind of the accused. If the ignorance\nor mistake goes to any other element requiring only general intent or\nknowledge, the ignorance or mistake must have existed in the mind of the\naccused and must have been reasonable under all the circumstances. However, if\nthe accused's knowledge or intent is immaterial as to an element, then\nignorance or mistake is not a defense. (11)\n\nLack of mental responsibility. (i) Lack of mental responsibility. It is an\naffirmative defense to any offense that, at the time of the commission of the\nacts constituting the offense, the accused, as a result of a severe mental\ndisease or defect, was unable to appreciate the nature and quality or the\nwrongfulness of his or her acts. Mental disease or defect does not otherwise\nconstitute a defense. (ii)\n\nPartial\nmental responsibility. A mental condition not amounting to a general lack of\nmental responsibility under subparagraph (i) of this paragraph but which\nproduces a lack of mental ability at the time of the offense to possess actual\nknowledge or to entertain a specific intent or a premeditated design to kill is\na defense to an offense having one of these states of mind as an\nelement. (iii)\n\nProcedure. (a) Presumption. The accused is presumed to\nhave been mentally responsible at the time of the alleged offense. This\npresumption continues until some evidence to the contrary is\nadmitted. (b) Inquiry. If a\nquestion is raised concerning the mental responsibility of the accused, the\nmilitary judge shall rule finally whether to direct an inquiry under N.Y.R.C.M. 706. In a special court-martial without a military judge, the president must\nrule finally except to the extent that the question is one of fact, in which\ncase the president rules subject to objection by any member. (c) Determination. The issue or mental\nresponsibility is not an interlocutory question. (12)\n\nState civilian defenses. Where an appellate court of this State has made a final determination affecting\nthe criminal law of this State with respect to matters of substantive law\nrelating to any of the defenses contained in this section; that determination\nis, if applicable to the particular case, binding upon the\ncourt-martial. (13)\n\nNot defenses\ngenerally. (i) Ignorance or mistake of law. Ignorance or mistake of law, including general orders or regulations, ordinarily is not a defense. (ii)\n\nVoluntary intoxication. Voluntary intoxication, whether caused by alcohol or\ndrugs, is not a defense. However, evidence of any degree of voluntary\nintoxication may be introduced for the purpose of raising a reasonable doubt as\nto the existence of actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or a\npremeditated design to kill, if actual knowledge, specific intent, willfulness, or premeditated design to kill is an element of the offense. (q) Motion for a\nfinding of not guilty. (1)\n\nIn general. The\nmilitary judge, on motion by the accused or sua sponte,must enter a finding of\nnot guilty of one or more offenses charged after the evidence on either side is\nclosed and before findings on the general issue of guilt are announced if the\nevidence is insufficient to sustain a conviction of the offense affected. If a\nmotion for a finding of not guilty at the close of the State's case is denied, the defense may offer evidence on that offense without having reserved the\nright to do so. (2)\n\nForm of motion. The motion must specifically indicate wherein the evidence is\ninsufficient. (3)\n\nProcedure. Before\nruling on a motion for a finding of not guilty, whether made by counsel or sua\nsponte, the military judge must give each party an opportunity to be heard on\nthe matter. (4)\n\nStandard. A motion\nfor a finding of not guilty is granted only in the absence of some evidence\nwhich, together with all reasonable inferences and applicable presumptions, could reasonably rend to establish every essential element of an offense\ncharged. The evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the State, without an evaluation of the credibility of witnesses. (5)\n\nMotion as to greater offense. A motion\nfor a finding of not guilty may be granted as to part of a specification and, if appropriate, the corresponding charge, as long as a lesser offense charged\nis alleged in the portion of the specification as to which the motion is not\ngranted. In such cases, the military judge must announce that a finding of not\nguilty has been granted as to specified language in the specification and, if\nappropriate, corresponding charge. In cases before members, the military judge\nmust instruct the members accordingly, so that any findings later announced\nwill not be inconsistent with the granting of the motion. (6)\n\nEffect of ruling. A ruling granting a\nmotion for a finding of not guilty is final when announced and may not be\nreconsidered. Such a ruling is a finding of not guilty of the affected\nspecification, or affected portion thereof, and, when appropriate, of the\ncorresponding charge. A ruling denying a motion for a finding of not guilty may\nbe reconsidered at any time before findings on the general issue of guilt are\nannounced. (7)\n\nEffect of denial on\nreview. If all the evidence admitted before findings, regardless by whom\noffered, is sufficient to sustain findings of guilty, the findings need not be\nset aside upon review solely because the motion for finding of not guilty\nshould have been granted upon the state of the evidence when it was\nmade. (r) Findings. (1)\n\nGeneral findings. The general findings of\na court-martial state whether the accused is guilty of each offense charged\n(ML, 130.53). If two or more accused are tried together, separate findings as\nto each must be made (ML, 130.51). (i) As to\na specification. General findings as to a specification may be: guilty; guilty\nwith exceptions, with or without substitutions, not guilty of the exceptions\nbut guilty of any substitutions; not guilty only by reason of lack of mental\nresponsibility; or not guilty. Exceptions and substitution may not be used to\nsubstantially change the nature of the offense or to increase the seriousness\nof the offense or the maximum punishment for it. (ii)\n\nAs to a charge. General findings as to a\ncharge may be: guilty; not guilty, but guilty of a violation of section ______; not guilty only by reason of lack of mental responsibility; or not\nguilty. (2)\n\nSpecial\nfindings. In a trial by court-martial composed of military judge alone, the\nmilitary judge must make special findings upon request by any party (ML, 130.51). Special findings may be requested only as to matters of fact\nreasonably in issue as to an offense and need be made only as to offenses of\nwhich the accused was found guilty. Special findings may be requested at any\ntime before general findings are announced. Only one set of special findings\nmay be requested by a party in a case. If the request is for findings on\nspecific matters, the military judge may require that the request be written. Special findings may be entered orally on the record at the court-martial or in\nwriting during or after the court-martial, but in any event shall be made\nbefore authentication and included in the record of trial. (3)\n\nBasis of findings. Findings may be based\non direct or circumstantial evidence. Only matters properly before the\ncourt-martial on the merits of the case may be considered. A finding of guilty\nof any offense may be reached only when the factfinder is satisfied that guilt\nhas been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. (s) Argument by counsel on findings. (1)\n\nIn general. After the closing the\nevidence, trial counsel must be permitted to open the argument. The defense\ncounsel must be permitted to reply. Trial counsel may reply in\nrebuttal. (2)\n\nContents. Arguments\nmay properly include reasonable comment on the evidence in the case, including\ninferences to be drawn therefrom, in support of a party's theory of the\ncase. (3)\n\nWaiver of objection to\nimproper argument. Failure to object to improper argument before the military\njudge begins to instruct the members on findings waives the\nobjection. (t) Instructions on findings. (1)\n\nIn general. The\nmilitary judge must give the members appropriate instructions on findings (ML, 130.51). (2)\n\nWhen given. Instructions on findings must be given after arguments by counsel and before\nthe members close to deliberate on findings, but the military judge may, upon\nrequest of the members, any party, or sua sponte, give additional instructions\nat a later time. (3)\n\nRequests for\ninstructions. At the close of the evidence or at such other time as the\nmilitary judge may permit, any party may request that the military judge\ninstruct the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military judge\nmay require the requested instruction to be written. Each party must be given\nthe opportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on findings before it\nis given. The military judge must inform the parties of the proposed action on\nsuch requests before their closing arguments. (4)\n\nHow given. Instructions on findings must\nbe given orally on the record in the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions, or, unless a party objects, portions of\nthem, may also be given to the members for their use during\ndeliberations. (5)\n\nRequired\ninstructions. Instructions on findings must include: (i) a description of the elements of each\noffense charged, unless findings on such offenses are unnecessary because they\nhave been entered pursuant to a plea of guilty; (ii)\na description of the elements of each\nlesser included offense in issue; (iii)\na description of any special defense\nunder N.Y.R.C.M. 915 in issue; (iv)\na direction that only matters properly before the court-martial may be\nconsidered; (v) a charge that: (a) the accused must be presumed to be\ninnocent until the accused's guilt is established by legal and competent\nevidence beyond reasonable doubt; (b) in the case being considered, if there is\na reasonable doubt as to the guilt of the accused, the doubt must be resolved\nin favor of the accused and the accused must be acquitted; (c) if, when a lesser included offense is in\nissue, there is a reasonable doubt as to the degree of guilt of the accused, the finding must be in a lower degree as to which there is no reasonable doubt; and\n(d) the burden of proof to\nestablish the guilt of the accused is upon the State. [When the issue of lack\nof mental responsibility is raised, at:] however, the burden of proving the\ndefense of lack of mental responsibility by clear and convincing evidence is\nupon the accused; (vi)\ndirections on the procedures under N.Y.R.C.M. 920 for deliberations and voting; and\n(vii)\nsuch other explanations, descriptions, or directions as may be necessary and which are properly\nrequested by a party or which the military judge determines, sua sponte, should\nbe given. (6)\n\nWaiver. Failure to object to an instruction or to omission of an instruction before the\nmembers close to deliberate waives the objection in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require the party objecting to specify in what respect\nthe instructions given were improper. The parties must be given the opportunity\nto be heard on any objection outside the presence of the members. (u) Deliberations and voting on\nfindings. (1)\n\nIn general. After the military\njudge instructs the members on findings, the members must deliberate and vote\nin a closed session. Only the members shall be present during deliberations and\nvoting. Superiority in rank cannot be used in any manner in an attempt to\ncontrol the independence of members in the exercise of their judgement (ML, 130.37, 130.51 and 130.52). (2)\n\nDeliberations. Deliberations properly include full and free discussion of the\nmerits of the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, members\nmay take with them in deliberations their notes, if any, any exhibits admitted\nin evidence, and any written instructions. Members may request that the\ncourt-martial be reopened and that portions of the record be read to them or\nadditional evidence introduced. The military judge may, in the exercise of\ndiscretion, grant such request. (3)\n\nVoting. (i) Secret bills. Voting on the\nfindings for each charge and specification must be by secret written ballot. All members present must vote. (ii)\n\nNumber or votes required to convict. A finding of guilty results only if at\nleast two-thirds of the members present vote for a finding of guilty. (iii)\n\nAcquittal. If fewer than two-thirds of\nthe members present vote for a finding of guilty, a finding of not guilty has\nresulted as to the charge or specification on which the vote was\ntaken. (iv)\n\nNot guilty only by\nreason of lack of mental responsibility. When the defense of lack of mental\nresponsibility is an issue under N.Y.R.C.M. 916(k)(1), the members shall first\nvote on whether the prosecution has proven the elements of the offense beyond a\nreasonable doubt. If at least two-thirds of the members present vote for a\nfinding of guilty, then the members shall vote on whether the accused has\nproven lack of mental responsibility. If a majority of the members present\nconcur that the accused has proven lack of mental responsibility by clear and\nconvincing evidence, a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental\nresponsibility results. If the vote on lack of mental responsibility does not\nresult in a finding of not guilty only by reason of lack of mental\nresponsibility, then the defense of lack of mental responsibility has been\nrejected and the finding of guilty stands. (v) Included offenses. Members cannot vote on\na lesser included offense unless a finding of not guilty of the offense charged\nhas been reached. If a finding of not guilty of an offense charged has been\nreached the members must vote on each included offense on which they have been\ninstructed, in order of severity beginning with the most severe. The members\nmust continue to vote on each included offense on which they have been\ninstructed until a finding of guilty results or findings of not guilty have\nbeen reached as to each such offense. (vi)\n\nProcedure for voting. (a) Order. Each specification must be voted\non separately before the corresponding charge. The order of voting on several\nspecifications under a charge or on several charges is determined by the\npresident unless a majority of the members object. (b) Counting votes. The junior member\ncollects the ballots and counts the votes. The president checks the count and\ninforms the other members of the result. (4)\n\nAction after findings are reached. After\nthe members have reached findings on each charge and specification before them, the court-martial must be opened and the president shall inform the military\njudge that findings have been reached. The military judge may, in the presence\nof the parties, examine any writing which the president intends to read to\nannounce the sentence and may assist the members in putting the findings in\nproper form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification or\ndiscussion concerning it constitutes announcement of the findings. (v) Announcement of findings. (1)\n\nIn general. Findings shall be announced\nin the presence of all parties promptly after they have been determined (ML, 130.53). (2)\n\nFindings by members. The president must announce the findings by the members. If a finding is based\non a plea of guilty, the president must so state. (3)\n\nFindings by military judge. The military\njudge must announce the findings when trial is by military judge alone or when\nfindings may be entered under N.Y.R.C.M. 910(g). (4)\n\nErroneous announcement. If an error was\nmade in the announcement of the findings of the court-martial, the error may be\ncorrected by a new announcement in accordance with this subdivision. The error\nmust be discovered and the new announcement made before the final adjournment\nof the court-martial in the case. (5)\n\nPolling prohibited. Except as provided in\n\nMil. R. Evid. 606, members may not be questioned about their deliberations and\nvoting. (w) Impeachment\nof findings.
