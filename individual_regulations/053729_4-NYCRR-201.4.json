(b) In determining\nwhether the evidence submitted to establish a showing of interest is timely, the director shall accept evidence of current membership. The director shall\nalso accept dues deduction authorizations, original designation cards, or\npetitions on a form prescribed by the board, all of which were signed and dated\nwithin one year of their submission. A showing of interest may consist of any\ncombination of the foregoing evidence, membership lists, dues deduction\nauthorizations. Designation cards shall be submitted in alphabetical order. The\ndirector may require that an alphabetized listing of the names of the\nsignatories on individually signed and dated petitions be filed within a\nreasonable period of time after submission of the showing of interest\npetitions. If such an alphabetized listing is required, the person or persons\nfiling the listing shall simultaneously file with the director a signed\nattestation that the listing sets forth only the names of the signatories on\nthe showing of interest petitions. (c) A determination by the director that a\nshowing of interest is timely and that it is numerically sufficient is a\nministerial act and cannot be reviewed by the board. (d) A declaration of authenticity, signed and\nsworn to before any person authorized to administer oaths, shall be filed by\nthe petitioner or, in the case of a motion to intervene, the movant, with the\ndirector simultaneously with the filing of the showing of interest.
