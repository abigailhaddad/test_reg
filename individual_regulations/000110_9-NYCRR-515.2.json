  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.2 - The military justice system\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The military justice system is comprised of judicial proceedings known\nas courts-martial and nonjudicial proceedings commonly referred to as article\n15 proceedings (referring to article 15 of the UCMJ or section\n130.15\nof the\n\nNew York State Military Law). (b) The courts-martial system. The goal of the courts-martial system is to achieve\njustice. As in American criminal courts, special and general courts-martial are\nadversary proceedings. That is, lawyers representing the government and the\naccused vigorously present the facts, law and arguments most favorable to each\nside following the rules of procedure and evidence. Based upon these\npresentations the military judge decides questions of law. The court-martial\napplies the law and decides questions of fact. Only a court-martial can\ndetermine the ultimate question of innocence or guilt. Any general or special\ncourt-martial conviction is a state court conviction. (1)\n\nThere are three types of courts-martial: (i) a general courts-martial; (ii)\na special courts-martial (including bad\nconduct discharge [BCD] special court-martial); or\n(iii)\na summary courts-martial. (c) General\ncourts-martial (GCM). The general court-martial tries the most serious offenses\nand may adjudge the most severe sentences authorized by law. It consists of at\nleast five members, as well as a military judge. A GCM may consist of a\nmilitary judge alone where the judge approves a written request from the\naccused for such trial. (1)\n\nGeneral\ncourts-martial shall have the power to sentence to: confinement with hard labor\nfor not exceeding 200 days; fines not exceeding $200; confinement with hard\nlabor in lieu of fines imposed not exceeding one day for each dollar of fine\nimposed; forfeiture of pay and allowances, not exceeding $200; dismissal; dishonorable discharge; bad conduct discharge; reprimand; reduction of\nnoncommissioned officers to an inferior grade; and to combine any two or more\nof such punishments in the sentences imposed. (2)\n\nIn both general and special\ncourts-martial, an enlisted member may request that at least one-third of the\ntotal membership of the court be enlisted personnel. (3)\n\nGeneral courts-martial may be convened by\norder of the Chief of Staff to the Governor, the commanding officer of a force\nof the organized militia, the commanding officer of a division or corresponding\nunit of the Army National Guard or the commanding officer of a wing or\ncorresponding unit of the Air National Guard. A sample format for an Order\n\nConvening Courts-Martial is contained in Appendix L-2. NOTE:The selection of\ncourt members is the sole responsibility of the convening authority and this\nresponsibility cannot be delegated. (d) Actions after forwarding charges in\ngeneral courts-martial. (1)\n\nThe section\n130.32 investigation which is an investigation under section\n130.32\nof the\n\nMilitary Law, may be ordered by any convening authority, and is required before\nany charge or specification is referred to a general court-martial by the\nconvening authority for such court. The offenses investigated by the\nappropriate commander and forwarded as charges to the convening authority are\nthe basis of this investigation. The officer appointed to conduct the\ninvestigation pursuant to section 130.32 must inquire into the truth of the\nmatter set forth in the charges and make a recommendation regarding disposition\nof the charges in the interest of justice and discipline. For guidance on\nconducting such investigations, see DA Pam 27-17, modifying its advice for\nstate use where appropriate. A sample Investigating Officer's Report (DMNA form\n1051) is contained in Appendix L-2. (2)\n\nAt the section 130.32 investigation, the\naccused shall be advised of the charges against him and his right to counsel. He is entitled to be represented by civilian counsel, at his own expense, or by\nmilitary counsel of his selection, if reasonably available. At such\ninvestigation, the accused shall have the full opportunity to examine and\ncross-examine witnesses as well as present anything he may desire on his own\nbehalf. The investigating officer shall examine all available witnesses\nrequested by the accused. (3)\n\nIf, after such investigation, the charges are forwarded to the convening authority, they shall be accompanied by a statement summarizing the testimony taken on\nboth sides. A copy of this summary shall be given to the accused. NOTE: Where\nan investigation is conducted prior to the time the accused is charged, a\nfurther investigation after charging will not be required unless: (i) the accused was not present at the\ninvestigation and given the opportunity for representation, examination and\npresentation; or\n(ii)\nthe accused\nafter being informed of the charges demands a further investigation. Even in\nsuch cases where the accused participated in the investigation, he is entitled\nto demand a further investigation if at the time of the initial investigation\nhe had not been charged. (4)\n\nCertain time limitations. Where a person\nis ordered into arrest or confinement when being held for trail by a general\ncourts-martial, the charges, together with the investigation and all other\npapers shall be forwarded to the general courts-martial, convening authority\nwithin eight days. (5)\n\nRole of\nstate judge advocate. No matter shall be referred by the general courts-martial\nconvening authority to trial by general court-martial without the consideration\nand advice of the state judge advocate. The state judge advocate shall review\nthe charges and specifications as to legal and factual sufficiency. He may make\nsuch formal changes to the charges as are necessary to have them conform to the\nevidence. (6)\n\nService of charges. The trial counsel to whom court-martial charges are referred shall have a copy\nof the charge served upon the accused. In peacetime no person shall be brought\nto trial by general courts-martial within five days after service of charges, or in the case of a special courts-martial, within three days. (e) Special courts-martial (SPCM). (1)\n\nThe special courts-martial is the\nintermediate court in our military justice system. A special courts-martial may\nnot try a commissioned officer, but may try warrant officers. The membership of\nnon-BCD special courts-martial may take any of three forms. It may consist of: (i) at least three members; (ii)\nat least three members and a military\njudge; or\n(iii)\nsolely of a\nmilitary judge if the accused so requests in writing. If an enlisted accused requests in writing that the court\nhave enlisted membership, then at least one-third of the membership of the\ncourt must be enlisted personnel. (2)\n\nSpecial courts-martial shall have the\npower to sentence to: confinement with hard labor for not exceeding 100 days; fines not exceeding $100; confinement with hard labor in lieu of fines imposed; forfeiture of pay and allowances not exceeding $100; bad conduct discharge; reprimand; reduction of noncommissioned officers to an inferior grade; and to\ncombine any two or more of such punishments in the sentences imposed. (3)\n\nThe military judge of a special\ncourt-martial is detailed by the convening authority, and he must be a\ncommissioned officer of a force of the organized militia or a person on the\nstate reserve list or state retired list who is a member of the bar of New York\nand who is certified to be qualified for duty as a military judge by the state\njudge advocate. The convening authority shall appoint a trial counsel and\ndefense counsel, together with such assistants as he deems necessary or\nappropriate. (4)\n\nCharges are\nreferred for trial by a special court-martial by means of completing the\nendorsement on Part V of the charge sheet, DMNA form 1050 (see Appendix\nL-2). (5)\nA special courts-martial\nmay be convened by: (i) any person who may\nconvene a general courts-martial; (ii)\nthe commanding officer of a force of the\norganized militia, or of a garrison, fort, camp, station, air base or other\nplace where members of a force of the organized militia are on duty; (iii)\nthe commanding officer of a division, brigade, regiment, detached or separate battalion, or corresponding unit of the\n\nArmy National Guard, the New York Guard or of any other land force of the\norganized militia; (iv)\nthe\ncommanding officer of a wing, group, detached or separate squadron or\ncorresponding unit of the Air National Guard; (v) the commanding officer of any naval\nvessel, and the commanding officer of any area, brigade, battalion, division, marine battalion or separate marine company of the naval militia; (vi)\nthe commanding officer of any separate\nor detached command or group of detached units of any of the forces of\norganized militia placed under a single commander; or\n(vii)\nthe commanding officer or officer in\ncharge of any other command when empowered by the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor. See Appendix L-2 for form for Order Convening Courts-Martial. When any such officer is an accuser, the court shall be\nconvened by superior competent authority, and may in any case be convened by\nsuch authority when deemed advisable by him. (6)\n\nHow a special courts-martial works. A\nspecial courts-martial, like a general or summary court-martial, is put into\nmotion by the preparation of charges. Any person subject to the state code may\nprefer charges. That person must sign the charges and specifications under oath\nbefore a commissioned officer, and state that he or she has personal knowledge\nof or has investigated the matter set forth in the charges and specifications\nand that they are true to the best of that person's knowledge and belief. The\nimmediate commander shall cause the accused to be informed of the charges\npreferred against him. See Appendix L-2 for form of charge sheet, DMNA form\n1050; and see FM 27-1 Legal Guide for Commanders for guidance in preparing and\nforwarding charges. Upon receiving the charges, the convening authority\ndetermines their disposition. The convening authority can dismiss any or all of\nthe charges, forward them to another commander for disposition, or refer any or\nall of them to a court-martial. If the convening authority decides to refer the\ncharges to a special courts-martial (or any other court-martial for which he is\nthe convening authority), he or she will cause a convening order to be drawn up\ndesignating the type of court-martial and detailing the members. Where the\ncourt-martial will meet may also be designated. (7)\n\nOnce charges have been preferred against\nan accused, they are forwarded to the appropriate commander exercising special\ncourt-martial convening authority. This authority reviews the options\napplicable (See N.Y.R.C.M. 401-405). If it is determined that the matter should\nbe tried by a special court-martial, the convening authority then refers the\nmatter to such court. Consequently, referral is the order of the convening\nauthority that charges against an accused will be tried by a specified\ncourt-martial. (8)\n\nConsultation\nwith a judge advocate as to the appropriate disposition of the charges is\nessential. If the convening authority finds or is advised by a judge advocate\nthat there are reasonable grounds to believe an offense triable by\ncourt-martial was committed, that the accused committed it and that the\nspecification alleges an offense, then the case will be referred to trial. After referral, the trial counsel serves a copy of the charge sheet on the\naccused. The accused cannot be brought to trial before a special court-martial\nover his objection within three days after service of the charges. (9)\n\nBesides forwarding and referring charges\nto court-martial, the convening authority has additional responsibilities. The\nconvening authority must detail properly qualified trial and defense counsel to\nthe court-martial. If the proceeding is to be a BCD special court-martial, the\nconvening authority must cause a reporter to be detailed so that a verbatim\nrecord can be prepared. One of the most important responsibilities of the\nconvening authority is the detail of the members to the court-martial. Members\nshould be those persons who in the opinion of the convening authority are best\nsuited to the duty by reason of age, training, experience and temperament. The\nmembers shall be commissioned officers. However, if the accused has so\nrequested, there may be an enlisted person designated to serve as one of the\ncourt members. (10)\n\nOnce the\ncourt-martial has taken place, the convening authority has certain\nresponsibilities concerning the findings and sentence of the court-martial. See\n\nAppendix L-2 for Forms of Sentences. Findings and sentence should be reported\nto the convening authority without delay. The accused is entitled to submit\nmatters for consideration to the convening authority regarding the findings and\nsentence adjudged. The convening authority may modify the findings and sentence\nof a court-martial as a command prerogative. He or she may approve, disapprove, commute or suspend the sentence in whole or in part. In taking action on the\nfindings, the convening authority can dismiss a charge by setting aside the\nfindings of guilty or change a finding of guilty to a finding of guilty to a\nlesser included offense. The convening authority cannot increase the punishment\nor add additional findings of guilty. Before taking action, the convening\nauthority should seek the advice and recommendations of the staff judge\nadvocate. (11)\n\nOnce the convening\nauthority has acted on the findings and sentence, an approved sentence of a bad\nconduct discharge or any confinement is referred by the state judge advocate to\na Board of Military Review. Such sentences are not executed until the appeal\nprocess is exhausted. Further any sentence of dismissal or dishonorable\ndischarge must be approved by the Governor. (12)\nA special court-martial proceeding is\ncomplicated and time consuming. It should be reserved for offenses which cannot\nbe handled either by summary court-martial or nonjudicial punishment. The above\ninformation is an overview of how the special court-martial works; it is by no\nmeans complete and exhaustive. Before taking steps to convene a special\ncourt-martial, judge advocate assistance should be requested. (13)\n\"BCD special\" courts-martial (BCDSPCM). In some instances a special courts-martial is authorized by the convening\nauthority to adjudge a bad conduct discharge as part of its maximum sentence. This proceeding differs from an ordinary special courts-martial in that a\nverbatim (word-for-word transcript) court record is required and a military\njudge must be detailed. In the case of persons charged with AWOL under section\n130.82\nof the Military Law, personal jurisdiction of BCD special courts-martial\ncan be obtained over such persons by means of substituted service under the\nprovisions of section\n308\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules provided that\ndiligent efforts have been made to deliver the charges to the accused. See\n\nAppendix L-2 for form of Affidavits of Service. However, if personal\njurisdiction is obtained in this manner, the BCD special courts-martial shall\nnot have the power to adjudge confinement. (See N.Y.R.C.M. 804[c] and Military\n\nLaw, section\n130.3\n[d]\n). (14)\n\nIf\ncourt-martial charges have been referenced against an enlisted member and the\npossible punishment for any of those charges include a bad conduct or\ndishonorable discharge, the member may submit a request for discharge for the\ngood of the service (chapter 10, AR 635-200). (f) Summary courts-martial (SCM). The summary\ncourts-martial is a court composed of one officer, who may be either a lawyer\nor a nonlawyer. However, staff judge advocates shall preside over summary\ncourts, whenever practicable. It is designed to handle relatively minor crimes. The summary courts-martial has simplified procedures which are outlined in\n\nAppendix L-2, Guide for Summary Courts-Martial. (1)\nA summary courts-martial may be convened\nby: (i) Any person who may convene a general\nor special court-martial. (ii)\n\nThe\nfield grade commander of any organization authorized a commander in the grade\nof Lieutenant Colonel or equivalent, or higher. (iii)\n\nThe commanding officer or officer in\ncharge of any other command when empowered by the Chief of Staff to the\n\nGovernor. (iv)\nA superior competent\nauthority to any of the above. (2)\n\nSummary courts-martial shall have the\npower to sentence to: confinement with hard labor for not exceeding 25 days; fines not exceeding $25; confinement with hard labor in lieu of fines imposed\nnot exceeding one day for each dollar or fine imposed; forfeiture of pay and\nallowances not exceeding $25; reprimand; reduction of noncommissioned officers\nto an inferior grade; and to combine any two or more of such punishments in the\nsentences imposed. (3)\nNOTE: That\nunder the New York State Military Law only enlisted personnel may be tried by a\nsummary court-martial. Therefore, commissioned officers and warrant officers\nare not subject to summary court-martial. (4)\n\nAn accused may not be tried by summary\ncourt-martial over objection to such a trial. Prior to trial an accused should\nindicate in writing an acceptance of disciplinary action under summary\ncourt-martial. If the accused objects to trial by summary court-martial, the\nsummary court officer will return the charge sheet to the convening authority\nfor disposition. If the accused consents to trial by SCM the summary court\nofficer will proceed to trial. (5)\n\nTroops performing duty outside the United States may be subject to the laws of\nthe foreign jurisdiction, the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the status\nof forces agreement (SOFA) of treaties with the foreign government. In all such\ninstances a judge advocate should be consulted to clarify the issues of\njurisdiction. (g) Summary courts-martial conducted by judge advocate officer. (1)\n\nIn order to avoid the common criticism of\nthe traditional summary court-martial as being \"a one man prosecutor, judge and\njury\" and to avoid the appearance and accusation of \"command influence\", judge\nadvocate officers shall, where practicable, serve as the summary court-martial\nofficer. (2)\n\nJudge advocate\nofficers are attorneys familiar with military law and military procedure as\nwell as the rules of evidence. Their professional training in examining facts\nand applying the law to come to a judgment will expedite, \"the military justice\nsystem\". (3)\n\nSince most judge\nadvocate officers would be objective disinterested parties who are assigned to\na general or flag staff or attached to a brigade, squadron or wing, the\nappearance of possible command influence will be greatly minimized if not\ncompletely eliminated. (4)\n\nBy\nutilization of judge advocate officers as summary court-martial officers, the\nrights of the accused will be further safeguarded by ensuring that the\nproceeding is conducted under due process of law. (5)\n\nWhile it is not mandatory that a judge\nadvocate serve as the summary court-martial, it is encouraged where\npracticable. If a judge advocate (regardless of rank) is not utilized as a\nsummary court-martial officer, a disinterested field grade officer should be\ndetailed on orders to serve as the summary court-martial. (6)\n\nRegardless of whether a judge advocate or\nfield grade officer serves as a summary court-martial, the procedures to be\nfollowed are outlined in Appendix L-2 (A9 and A10 and DA Pam 27-7 (where\nappropriate to a state summary court-martial). (h) How a summary court-martial works (see\n\nChapters 2 and 4, FM 27-1, Legal Guide for Commanders). (1)\n\nOnce an offense is committed it should be\ninvestigated by the C.O. of the accused to the extent deemed necessary to\nobtain all pertinent facts, witnesses, documents, etc. If charges are\npreferred, the accused is served with a copy and notation is made thereof on\nthe charge sheet (see Part III, para 12 on the charge sheet, DMNA form 1050). The charge sheet is then forwarded to the proper SCM convening authority (see\npara 2-6a). Receipt of the charges should be noted in Part IV, para 13 of the\ncharge sheet. Thereafter, if the convening authority determines that the\ncharges should be referred to a summary court-martial, the convening order may\nbe by notation signed by the convening authority in Part V of the charge\nsheet. (2)\n\nIn due course the trial\nis held (see Appendix L-2 [A9]) and the record of trial is prepared, (see\n\nAppendix L-2 [A10], DMNA form 1056) and is returned to the convening authority\nfor action. The action taken by the convening authority is shown in para 13 on\nall copies of the record of trial and is thereafter signed by the convening\nauthority. This endorsement to the record of trial formalizes the convening\nauthority's action in the case and operates as the order promulgating that\naction. A formal promulgating order is not required. (3)\n\nThe record of trial is forwarded to the\njudge advocate of the supervisory authority, where the record is legally\nreviewed by a judge advocate. Once the review is done, the judge advocate\n\"signs off\" on the record indicating that it is legally sufficient; or, if\ncorrective action is necessary to cure errors in the record, the judge advocate\neither initiates corrective action to be taken by the supervisory authority or\nsends it back for corrective action by the convening authority. (4)\n\nWhen the legal review (and corrective\naction, if any) is completed, the record of trial is filed in the member's MPRJ\nby forwarding a copy to DMNA, ATTN: MNPA-PSC. A sample completed record of\ntrial can be found in Appendix L-2 (A10). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
