  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.17 - Chemical, physical and biological treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The regulations in this section apply to\nowners and operators of facilities subject to this Subpart which treat\nhazardous waste by chemical, physical or biological methods in other than\ntanks, surface impoundments and land treatment facilities. Chemical, physical\nand biological treatment of hazardous waste in tanks, surface impoundments and\nland treatment facilities must be conducted in accordance with sections\n373-3.10, 373-3.11\nand\n373-3.13\nof this Subpart. (b) General operating\nrequirements. (1)\n\nChemical, physical\nor biological treatment of hazardous waste must comply with section\n373-3.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nHazardous wastes or\ntreatment reagents must not be placed in the treatment process or equipment if\nthey could cause the treatment process or equipment to rupture, leak, corrode\nor otherwise fail before the end of its intended life. (3)\n\nWhere hazardous waste is continuously fed\ninto a treatment process or equipment, the process or equipment must be\nequipped with a means to stop this inflow (\ne.g., a waste feed\ncutoff system or bypass system to a standby containment device). (c) Waste analysis and trial\ntests. (1)\n\nIn addition to the waste\nanalysis required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, whenever: (i) a hazardous waste\nwhich is substantially different from waste previously treated in a treatment\nprocess or equipment at the facility is to be treated in that process or\nequipment; or\n(ii)\na substantially\ndifferent process than any previously used at the facility is to be used to\nchemically treat hazardous waste: the owner or operator must, before treating\nthe different waste or using the different process or equipment: (a) conduct waste analysis and trial\ntreatment tests (\ne.g., bench scale or pilot plant scale\ntests); or\n(b) obtain written, documented information on similar treatment of similar waste under similar\noperating conditions; to show that this proposed treatment will meet all\napplicable requirements of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. (d) Inspections. (1)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of a treatment facility must inspect, where present: (i) discharge control and safety equipment\n(\ne.g., waste feed cutoff systems, bypass systems, drainage\nsystems and pressure relief systems), at least once each operating day, to\nensure that it is in good working order; (ii)\ndata gathered from monitoring equipment\n(\ne.g., pressure and temperature gauges), at least once each\noperating day, to ensure that the treatment process or equipment is being\noperated according to its design; (iii)\nthe construction materials of the\ntreatment process or equipment, at least weekly, to detect corrosion or leaking\nof fixtures or seams; and\n(iv)\nthe\nconstruction materials of, and the area immediately surrounding, discharge\nconfinement structures (\ne.g., dikes), at least weekly, to\ndetect erosion or obvious signs of leakage (\ne.g., wet spots or\ndead vegetation). (e) Closure. At closure, all hazardous waste and hazardous waste\nresidues must be removed from treatment processes or equipment, discharge\ncontrol equipment and discharge confinement structures. (f) Special requirements for ignitable\nor reactive wastes. (1)\n\nIgnitable or\nreactive waste must not be placed in a treatment process or equipment unless: (i) the waste is treated, rendered or mixed\nbefore or immediately after placement in the treatment process or equipment so\nthat: (a) the resulting waste mixture, or\ndissolution of material, no longer meets the definition of ignitable or\nreactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(b) section\n373-3.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart is complied with; or\n(ii)\nthe waste is treated in such a way that\nit is protected from any material or conditions which may cause the waste to\nignite or react. (g) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible\nwastes, or incompatible wastes and materials (see Appendix 29, infra, for examples), must not be placed in the same treatment\nprocess or equipment unless section\n373-3.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart is complied with. (2)\n\nHazardous waste must not be placed in unwashed treatment equipment which\npreviously held an incompatible waste or material, unless section\n373-3.2\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart is complied with.
