  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-3.8 - Wastewater Treatment System Design in the Lake George Basin\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll new and replacement Wastewater Treatment Systems\nconstructed in the Lake George basin shall comply with the standards of DOH 75-A or\nthe DEC Design Standards, as applicable, with additional standards noted\nherein: (a) The reduction in absorption\narea and trench length allowed by DOH 75-A or the DEC Design Standards for Enhanced\n\nTreatment Units (10 NYCRR Appendix 75A.6(b)(6)(ii)(d)) as well as Open-Bottom\n\nGravelless Chambers (10 NYCRR Appendix 75-A.8(c)(3)(i)) shall not apply to\n\nWastewater Treatment Systems in the Lake George basin; (b) The soil absorption area for Wastewater\n\nTreatment Systems constructed in the Lake George basin shall be located a minimum of\n36 inches above seasonal high groundwater and bedrock; (c) The soil absorption area for Wastewater\n\nTreatment Systems constructed in the Lake George basin shall be located a minimum of\n100 feet from any stream, lake, or wetland; (d) Redevelopment projects shall not utilize\nexisting Wastewater Treatment Systems that are noncompliant with the design\nstandards at the time of construction. Upon redevelopment, the Wastewater Treatment\n\nSystem servicing that structure shall be brought into compliance with the applicable\ndesign standards; (e) A variance or\nwaiver, as applicable, shall be required from the Review Authority when standards\nfor wastewater treatment system design at subdivisions (a), (b), or (c) of this\nsection cannot be met. Waivers and variances shall be processed in accordance with\nthe administrative standards of the Review Authority. (f) Any Wastewater Treatment System that requires\na variance, waiver, or deviation from the design standards at subdivisions (a), (b), or (c) of this section, or from DOH 75-A or DEC Design Standards for the sizing of\nan absorption area or septic tank shall employ additional methods, measures, and/or\npractices determined to be the most practical and effective for reducing the\nintroduction of phosphorus to the environment. Such measures shall be appropriate\nfor the site and commensurate with the variance, waiver, or deviation requested, and\nmay include but shall not be limited to enhanced treatment units, absorption area\ndosing, phosphorus filters, filtration media, enhanced absorption area\ncharacteristics (e.g. soil depth), and holding tanks. Any such measure must be\nconsistent with generally accepted engineering practices, and shall be supported by\ncertified third party testing and/or research published in professional, peer\nreviewed journals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n646-3.8\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 5, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 14, eff. 4/5/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
