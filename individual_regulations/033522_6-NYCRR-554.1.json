  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 554.1 - Prevention of pollution and migration\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The drilling, casing and completion\nprogram adopted for any well shall be such as to prevent pollution. (b) Pollution of the land and/or of surface\nor ground fresh water resulting from exploration or drilling is\nprohibited. (c) (1)\n\nPrior to the issuance of a well-drilling\npermit for any operation in which the probability exists that brine, salt water\nor other polluting fluids will be produced or obtained during drilling\noperations in sufficient quantities to be deleterious to the surrounding\nenvironment, the operator must submit and receive approval for a plan for the\nenvironmentally safe and proper ultimate disposal of such fluids. For purposes\nof this subdivision, drilling muds are not considered to be polluting fluids. Before requesting a plan for disposal of such fluids, the department will take\ninto consideration the known geology of the area, the sensitivity of the\nsurrounding environment to the polluting fluids and the history of any other\ndrilling operations in the area. Depending on the method of disposal chosen by\nthe applicant, a permit for discharge and/or disposal may be required by the\ndepartment in addition to the well-drilling permit. An applicant may also be\nrequired to submit an acceptable contingency plan, the use of which shall be\nrequired if the primary plan is unsafe or impracticable at the time of\ndisposal. (2)\n\nBrine or salt water\nmay be temporarily stored prior to disposal in any water-tight tank, container\nor an earthen pit which is underlaid by soil such as heavy clay or hardpan. Impounding of brine or salt water in an earthen pit is prohibited where the\nsoil underlying the pit is porous and/or is closely underlaid by a gravel, rock\nor sand stratum unless the pit is lined with watertight material. The tank, container or earthen pit shall be constructed and maintained so as to prevent\nescape of any fluids therefrom, including any amounts that may be added by\nnatural precipitation. (3)\n\nStorage\nof brine, salt water or other polluting fluids in such watertight tanks or\nearthen pits, prior to disposal, shall be for a maximum of 45 days after\ncessation of drilling operations, unless the department approves an extension\nbased on circumstances beyond the operator's control. The department may also\napprove an extension if the fluid is to be used in subsequent operations\naccording to the submitted plan, and the department has inspected and approved\nthe storage facilities. (d) Except as hereinafter provided, sufficient surface casing shall be run in all wells to extend below the deepest\npotable fresh water level. (e) The\ndrilling, casing and completion program adopted for any well shall be such as\nto prevent the migration of oil, gas or other fluids from one pool or stratum\nto another. (f) The drilling, casing and completion program adopted for any well shall be such as to exclude\noil, gas or other fluids from any underground mining properties or rights and\nto protect them in accordance with prudent operations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n554.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
