(Perform this test for 1 minute on single and/or combination\nvehicles.)\n(vi) Air pressure safety relief valve, governor cut\nout and compressor drive belts\n(vi)\n\nAir pressure safety relief\nvalve is not present or does not operate on a system which can be checked (some\nvalves designed with a lead plug cannot be tested). - Brake system operating pressure exceeds 135\nPSI. - Compressor drive belt(s) is missing, badly worn, frayed, slipping or loose, or bolts, pulleys, brackets, braces or adapters are\ncracked, broken, loose or missing. (vii) Inverting relay spring brake control valve or\ninversion valve (on vehicles so equipped). (vii)\n\nIf valve falls\nto function properly. (viii) Air brake adjustment\n\nEquipment: Steel scale and feeler gauge\nor equivalent.)\n(a) On vehicles equipped with Cam brakes, mark each\nbrake chamber pushrod at the face of the brake chamber with the brakes\nreleased. (a) Cam brakes, push-rod travel of any chamber\nexceeds the maximum stroke listed in Table A (See Appendix I). Apply the air brakes fully with reservoir pressure\nat 100 PSI or delivery pressure between 80-90 PSI, and measure the distance the\npush rod length travels from the face of the chamber to the mark previously\nmade when the brakes were released. (Fig. 1 See Appendix III) This measurement\nin the push-rod stroke table in Table A (See Appendix I). There is a mismatch on any axle of: 1. Air chamber size\n2. Slack adjustor\n(b) On vehicles equipped with wedge brakes, remove\nthe inspection hole cover at each dust shield and with the brakes released, scribe a line on the edge of the brake lining. Apply the air brakes fully with\nreservoir pressure at 100 PSI or delivery pressure between 80 and 90 PSI. Measure the distances the brake lining travels. (Fig. 2 See Appendix\nIV)\n(b) Any brake shoe, has more than\n1\n/\n16\ntravel. (c) On vehicles equipped with disc brakes use Table\nB (See Appendix II). (c) Pushrod travel of any chamber exceeds\nthe maximum stroke listed in Table B (See Appendix II). 1. System performance of the power unit (must be\nthe last brake test done). This test must be done on a hard level surface, free\nfrom loose material (indoors or outdoors)\n1. The truck, tractor or bus\nfails to stop within 35 feet or stops with significant pull when tested from a\nspeed of 20 MPH. (o) Parking brake systems. Inspect\nfor: Reject\nif: 1. Parking brake\nNOTE 7: On 1962 and\nolder vehicles not originally equipped with a parking brake, disregard this\nsection. A. Presence\nA. The vehicle is not\nequipped with a parking brake. B. Condition of the parking brake\ncomponents\nB. There are any of the following missing or\ndefective: - cotter pins\n- retracting springs; - worn rods or couplings; - cable(s) are visibly frayed or frozen. - The ratchet, pawl, lever control, or other\nlocking device does not hold the brake in the applied position or cannot be\nproper operated or released. - any non-manufactured holes or cracks are found in\nthe spring brake housing section of a parking brake. C. Operation\nC. The parking brake\ndoes not operate separate from the service brakes. - Failure of either system leaves the vehicle\nwithout brakes. - There is no reserve travel in the lever or pedal\nwhen the brake is fully applied. - The control is not within easy reach of the\ndriver. - The parking brake does not hold the vehicle\nstationary with transmission in gear (whether automatic or manual) with\nmoderate engine power applied. 2. Emergency breakaway systems\nA. Presence\n(i) Trailers\n(i) The trailer is not\nequipped with an emergency breakaway system. (ii) Towing vehicles manufactured after\n1953. (ii)\n\nThe vehicle is not equipped with an automatic\nbreakaway system (tractor protection valve) so that the service brakes on the\ntowing vehicle remain operational if the trailer separates. Where manual operation is permitted, this control\nshall be within easy reach of the driver. B. Operation\n(i) All trailers (air, vacuum, or\nelectric)\n(i) Trailer is not equipped with an emergency system\nwhich automatically applies the brakes upon separation from the towing vehicle\nand stays applied for a minimum of 15 minutes. Trailer with batteries that\ncannot be recharged must only be capable making a brake application. The 15\nminutes will be waived. (ii) Towing vehicles\n\nThe test must be conducted with a fully charged\nsystem\nSINGLE AIR BRAKE SYSTEMS (Pre FMVSS 121 Brake\n\nSystems) manually operate the dash control valve. (tractor protection control\nvalve)\n\nThe trailer emergency brake system cannot be applied\nand released with this valve. DUAL AIR BRAKE SYSTEMS (FMVSS 121 Systems) manually\noperate the tractor protection control valve. (Normally marked trailer supply\nvalve)\n\nThe trailer brakes do not apply and release as knob\nis pulled out and pushed in. Manually operate park control valve\n\nAll\nparking brakes do not apply and release as knob is pulled out and pushed\nin. (p) Seat belts. Inspect\nfor: Reject\nif: 1. Presence\n1. A 1965 and\nnewer vehicle is not equipped with a seat belt at the driver seat and the right\nfront outboard seat. A 1971 or newer vehicle is not equipped with a seat belt\nat each seating position, except that a bus needs to be equipped with a seat\nbelt at least at the driver seat. 2. Operation\n2. Any seat\nbelt: - cannot be buckled or unbuckled; - can be pulled out of its anchors or was not\nanchored at the start of the inspection\n- comes unbuckled when tugged upon. - has an automatic adjuster which does not operate\nproperly. (q) Fuel leaks. Procedure: Reject if: 1. Check the fuel system, including the\nfuel tank and lines, for leaks, including auxiliary heating or refrigeration\nunits. 1. Any leak is found in any fuel system, tank or lines\nto such a degree as to cause dripping or pooling of fuel. A fuel tank is not securely attached to the\nvehicle. Note: Some fuel tanks use spring\nor rubber bushings to permit movement. Compressed natural gas (CNG), liquefied petroleum\ngas (LPG) or liquefied natural gas (LNG) fuel systems\n\nAny fuel leakage\nfrom the CNG, LPG or LNG system detected audibly, visually or by smell. Note: Some brief fuel\nleakage, water vapor at the fittings, or decompression may occur during\nrefueling, causing temporary frosting of CNG of LPG fuel system parts. If the\nvehicle has been refueled shortly before inspection, care must be taken to\ndistinguish these temporary frosting occurrences from actual leaks. Also, in\nhot weather some condensation on the system is normal. Click\nto View Image\n\nClick to\n\nView Image\n\nClick to\n\nView Image\n\nClick to\n\nView Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp.
