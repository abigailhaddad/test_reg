Codes\nR. & Regs. tit. 1, ch. IV, subch. B\nBy order of the commissioner, the amended rules and\nregulations in this Subchapter, filed Oct. 1, 1980, shall take effect on\n\nJanuary 1, 1981. However, existing stocks of labeled containers for maple syrup\nmay be used for direct sales to consumers at the place of production or the\nproducer's roadside stand until January 1, 1982. Since the labeling\nrequirements of these revised regulations have already gone into effect under\n\nFederal regulations, the voluntary use of maple syrup containers labeled in\naccordance with these revised New York State regulations is permitted prior to\n\nJanuary 1, 1981. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
