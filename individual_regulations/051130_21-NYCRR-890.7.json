  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 890.7 - Retail water pricing to encourage conservation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Policy. It shall be the policy of the\n\nDelaware River Basin Commission to promote and support retail water pricing\nthat encourages conservation. (b) Definitions. (1)\nA water conserving pricing\nstructure is an important demand management tool that provides incentives to\nconsumers to reduce average or peak water use, or both. Conservation pricing\nreflects the fact that water is a precious resource that should be used in an\neconomically efficient manner. Such pricing includes: (i) rates designed to recover the full cost\nof providing service, including a reasonable rate of return on investment; and\n(ii)\ntimely billing based on\nmetered usage. Such pricing is also characterized by one or more of the\nfollowing components: (iii)\nrates in which the unit price of water per class of customer (residential, industrial, etc.) is constant within each class regardless of the quantity of\nwater used (uniform rates) or increases as the quantity of water used increases\n(increasing block rates); (iv)\nseasonal rates or excess-use surcharges to reduce peak water demands during\nsummer months; or\n(v) rates based\non the long-run marginal cost or the cost of adding the next unit of water\nsupply to the system. (2)\nA nonconserving pricing structure is one\nthat provides no incentives or disincentives to consumers to reduce water use. Such pricing may be characterized by one or more of the following components: (i) rates in which the unit price of water\nwithin any one class of customer decreases as the quantity of water used\nincreases (decreasing block rates); (ii)\nrates that involve charging customers a\nset fee per unit of time regardless of the quantity of water used (flat\nrates); (iii)\npricing that does not\nreflect the full cost of providing services; or\n(iv)\npricing in which the typical bill is\ndetermined mainly by a minimum charge and metered usage has little impact on\nthe total bill. (c) Criteria\n(1)\n\nAll purveyors are encouraged to evaluate\nalternative pricing structures with the objective of adopting a water\nconserving pricing structure. (2)\nA\npurveyor seeking approval under section\n3.8\nof the compact for a new or\nexpanded water withdrawal and whose proposed total withdrawal equals or exceeds\nan average of one million gallons of water per day shall include in its water\nconservation plan submitted as part of the application, an evaluation of the\nfeasibility of implementing a water conserving pricing structure and billing\nprogram. A purveyor may limit the evaluation to less than its entire system\nupon application and a determination that a review of its entire system is not\nnecessary. The evaluation shall, at a minimum, consider: (i) the potential change in the quantity of\nwater demanded for customer classes and their end uses of water during both\npeak and non-peak periods stemming from alternative water conservation pricing\nstructures; (ii)\nthe potential\nrevenue effects of the alternative pricing structures; (iii)\nany legal or institutional changes\nnecessary or desirable to implement a water conservation pricing structure; and\n(iv)\nhow conservation pricing\ncould be coordinated with other conservation programs and measures to reduce\nboth average and peak water use. (3)\n\nThe requirement set forth in paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision shall be waived if the purveyor either documents it has\nadopted a water conserving pricing structure or is in the process of\nimplementing such a pricing structure in accordance with a commission schedule\nor a schedule established by the appropriate state public utility\ncommission. (4)\n\nThe Executive\n\nDirector, on or before June 30, 1993 and annually thereafter, shall review the\neffectiveness of the retail water pricing activities hereunder to determine\ntheir adequacy in promoting and supporting water pricing that encourages water\nconservation. The results of such review and recommendations, if any, shall be\nsubmitted to the commission for its consideration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n890.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
