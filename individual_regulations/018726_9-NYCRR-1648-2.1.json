Tit. 9 §§ 1648-2.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of local subsidies, like that of State\nsubsidies, is to assist in achieving and maintaining the low rent character of\na project. All or part of a local subsidy may be in the form of tax exemption\n(see §\n1648-2.2, below) but the aggregate\nlocal subsidy for a given year, whether in the form of tax exemption or cash, or both, must at least equal the State subsidy, as where the value of tax\nexemption is in excess of the amount required to match the State subsidy or\nwhere the operating deficit is in excess of the maximum State subsidy, or where\nthe municipality is bound by special provisions of the loan and subsidy\ncontract, to pay a minimum annual cash subsidy. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
