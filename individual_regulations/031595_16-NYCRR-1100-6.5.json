(iv)\n\nIf the permittee cannot meet the\ntimelines for implementation of mitigation measures set forth in subparagraphs\n(ii) and (iii) of this paragraph, permittee shall cease operation of the\nturbines of the facility that caused the non-compliance or siting permit\nviolation until the operational or physical minimization measures that are\npresented and approved by the NYSDPS and the Office have been implemented. Once\nimplemented, the permittee shall not operate the facility without the\nmitigation measures presented and approved by the NYSDPS and the\n\nOffice. (v) Test, document and\npresent results of any minimization measures and compliance with all siting\npermit conditions on noise, no later than ninety (90) days after the\nminimization measures are implemented. (4)\n\nNoise and Vibration Complaints\nfrom Wind Facilities. The permittee shall adhere to the following\nconditions regarding noise complaints: (i) The permittee is required to maintain a log of complaints received relating to\nnoise and vibrations caused by the operation of the facility. The log shall\ninclude name and contact information of the person that lodges the complaint, name of the property owner(s), address of the residence where the complaint was\noriginated, the date and time of the day underlying the event complained of, and a summary of the complaint. (ii)\n\nThe permittee shall provide the host\nmunicipalities with a phone number, email address, and mailing address where\ncomplaints can be notified. (iii)\n\nAll complaints received shall be reported to the NYSDPS staff, with a copy to\nthe Office, monthly during the first year of commercial operations and\nquarterly thereafter, by filing during the first ten (10) days of each month\n(or the first ten (10) days of each quarter after the first year). Reports\nshall include copies of the complaints and, if available, a description of the\nprobable cause (e.g., outdoor or indoor noise, tones, low frequency noise, amplitude modulation, vibrations, rumbles, rattles, etc., if known); the status\nof the investigation, summary of findings and whether the facility has been\ntested and found in compliance with applicable siting permit conditions on\nnoise or minimization measures have been implemented. If no noise or vibration\ncomplaints are received, the permittee shall submit a letter indicating that no\ncomplaints were received during the reporting period. (iv)\n\nShould complaints related to excessive\nand persistent amplitude modulation occur at any non-participating residence\nexisting as of the issuance date of the siting permit, with measured or modeled\nsound levels exceeding forty (40) dBA Leq (1-hour), the permittee shall\ninvestigate and measure amplitude modulation at the affected receptors during\nthe time frame when the worst conditions are known, or, if not known, expected\nto occur. If the L90-10-minute noise levels (dBA), including any amplitude\nmodulation and prominent tone penalties exceed a noise level of forty-five (45)\ndBA and amplitude modulation is in excess of a five (5) dB modulation depth at\nthe evaluated receptor(s) for more than five (5) percent of the time during the\nidentified time frame of evaluation (which shall not exceed eight consecutive\nhours), the permittee shall continue with the investigation, identify frequency\nof occurrence and the conditions that may be favorable for its occurrence, and\npropose minimization measures to avoid or minimize the impacts. Minimization\nmeasures that avoid, minimize, resolve, or mitigate the amplitude modulation\nimpacts shall be identified and reported by filing the identified minimization\nmeasures and implementing such measures after, and consistent with, review and\napproval. Compliance with this requirement shall be finally demonstrated by\nconducting a test that shows that the L90-10-minute sound levels (dBA), including a five (5)-dBA penalty for amplitude modulation (if amplitude\nmodulation depth is in excess of five (5) dB for more than five (5) percent of\nthe time in any eight (8) consecutive hours) at that particular location and\nany additional prominent tone penalties, are lower than or equal to forty-five\n(45) dBA. For any complaints that do not exceed the limits established in the\nforegoing, the permittee shall handle those complaints under the complaint\nresolution protocol approved by the Office. Amplitude Modulation depth will be\nevaluated as indicated in the document entitled \"A Method for Rating Amplitude\n\nModulation in Wind Turbine Noise\", 09 August 2016, Version 1 (see section\n1100-15.1(c)(1)(i) of this Part).
