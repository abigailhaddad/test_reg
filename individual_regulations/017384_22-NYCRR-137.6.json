Tit. 22 § 137.6 - Arbitration procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nExcept as set forth in paragraph (2), where the attorney and client cannot agree as to the attorney's fee or where\nthe attorney seeks to commence an action against the client for attorney's\nfees, the attorney shall forward a written notice to the client, entitled\n\nNotice of Client's Right to Arbitrate, by certified mail or by personal\nservice. The notice\n(i) shall be in a form\napproved by the board of governors; (ii)\nshall contain a statement of the\nclient's right to arbitrate; (iii)\nshall advise that the client has 30 days from receipt of the notice in which to\nelect to resolve the dispute under this Part; (iv)\nshall be accompanied by the written\ninstructions and procedures for the arbitral body having jurisdiction over the\nfee dispute, which explain how to commence a fee arbitration proceeding; and\n(v) shall be accompanied by a\ncopy of the \"request for arbitration\" form necessary to commence the\narbitration proceeding. (2)\n\nWhere the client has consented in advance\nto submit fee disputes to arbitration as set forth in section\n137.2\n(b) and (c)\nof this Part, and where the attorney and client cannot agree as to the\nattorney's fee, the attorney shall forward to the client, by certified mail or\nby personal service, a copy of the request for arbitration form necessary to\ncommence the arbitration proceeding along with such notice and instructions as\nshall be required by the rules and guidelines of the board of governors, and\nthe provisions of subdivision (b) of this section shall not apply. (b) If the attorney\nforwards to the client by certified mail or personal service a notice of the\nclient's right to arbitrate, and the client does not file a request for\narbitration within 30 days after the notice was received or served, the\nattorney may commence an action in a court of competent jurisdiction to recover\nthe fee and the client no longer shall have the right to request arbitration\npursuant to this Part with respect to the fee dispute at issue. An attorney who\ninstitutes an action to recover a fee must allege in the complaint: (1)\nthat the client received\nnotice under this Part of the client's right to pursue arbitration and did not\nfile a timely request for arbitration; or\n(2)\nthat the dispute is not otherwise\ncovered by this Part. (c) In the event the client determines\nto pursue arbitration on the client's own initiative, the client may directly\ncontact the arbitral body having jurisdiction over the fee dispute. Alternatively, the client may contact the attorney, who shall be under an\nobligation to refer the client to the arbitral body having jurisdiction over\nthe dispute. The arbitral body then shall forward to the client the appropriate\npapers set forth in subdivision (a) of this section necessary for commencement\nof the arbitration. (d) If the client elects to submit the\ndispute to arbitration, the client shall file the request for arbitration form\nwith the appropriate arbitral body, and the arbitral body shall mail a copy of\nthe request for arbitration to the named attorney together with an attorney fee\nresponse to be completed by the attorney and returned to the arbitral body\nwithin 15 days of mailing. The attorney shall include with the attorney fee\nresponse a certification that a copy of the response was served upon the\nclient. (e) Upon\nreceipt of the attorney's response, the arbitral body shall designate the\narbitrator or arbitrators who will hear the dispute and shall expeditiously\nschedule a hearing. The parties must receive at least 15 days notice in writing\nof the time and place of the hearing and of the identify of the arbitrator or\narbitrators. (f) Either party may request the removal of an arbitrator based upon the\narbitrator's personal or professional relationship to a party or counsel. A\nrequest for removal must be made to the arbitral body no later than five days\nprior to the scheduled date of the hearing. The arbitral body shall have the\nfinal decision concerning the removal of an arbitrator. (g) The client may not\nwithdraw from the process after the arbitral body has received the attorney fee\nresponse. If the client seeks to withdraw at any time thereafter, the\narbitration will proceed as scheduled whether or not the client appears, and a\ndecision will be made on the basis of the evidence presented. (h) If the attorney without\ngood cause fails to respond to a request for arbitration or otherwise does not\nparticipate in the arbitration, the arbitration will proceed as scheduled and a\ndecision will be made on the basis of the evidence presented. (i) Any party may participate\nin the arbitration hearing without a personal appearance by submitting to the\narbitrator testimony and exhibits by written declaration under penalty of\nperjury.
