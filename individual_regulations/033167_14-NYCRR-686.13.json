The\nprovider shall maintain such records for four years. Such records shall be\nsubject to audit and review by OPWDD and any other Federal or State agencies\nwhich regulate the provider or the food stamp benefit program. (4)\n\nAll such financial records and\nany related records shall be subject to audit by the commissioner and the\n\nOffice of the State Comptroller or their agent. (b) Allowable costs. (1)\n\nGeneral conditions. (i) Allowable costs shall be determined from\neither a budget or cost report submitted in accordance with the reporting\nrequirements of subdivision (a) of this section. (ii)\n\nTo be considered allowable, costs must\nbe properly chargeable to necessary care for individuals rendered in accordance\nwith the requirements of this section and sections\n635-10.4\nand\n671.5\nof this Title. (a) The commissioner shall determine\nallowable costs pursuant to Subpart 635-6 of this Title and pursuant to this\nparagraph. Subpart 635-6 of this Title shall govern except where this paragraph\nis inconsistent with Subpart 635-6 of this Title. (b) Except where specific rules concerning\nallowability of costs are stated herein, or in Subpart 635-6 of this Title, the\ncommissioner shall determine allowability of costs based on reasonableness and\nrelationship to individual care and generally accepted accounting\nprinciples. (c) As determined by\nthe commissioner, expenses or portions of expenses reported by an individual\ncommunity residence, that are not reasonably related to the efficient and\neconomical provision of care in accordance with the certification standards in\n\nPart 86 of this Title because of either the nature or amount of the item, shall\nnot be allowed. (d) Except where\nspecific rules concerning allowability of costs are stated herein, or in\n\nSubpart 635-6 of this Title, the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement\n\nManual, commonly referred to as HIM-15 shall be used to determine the\nallowability of costs as to nature and amount. Said guidelines are published by\nthe U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Health Care Financing\n\nAdministration (HCFA). (1)\n\nThe HIM-15 document\nis available from: Health Care Financing Administration\n\nDivision of Communication Services\n\nProduction and Distribution Branch\n\nRoom 577, East High Rise Building\n6325 Security Boulevard\n\nBaltimore, MD 21207\n(2)\n\nIt may be reviewed in person during\nregular business hours: (i) at the New York\n\nState Department of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12231; or\n(ii)\nby appointment at the New York State\n\nOffice for People With Developmental Disabilities, Division of Revenue\n\nManagement, 30 Russell Road, Albany, NY 12206. (iii)\n\nThe OPWDD shall reduce a community\nresidence's reported costs or estimated costs for price calculation purposes by\nthe cost of services and activities that are not chargeable to the care of the\nindividuals receiving services in accordance with this subdivision and\nsubdivision (d) of this section. In the event that the commissioner determines\nthat it is not practical to establish the costs of such services and\nactivities, and if there is income derived therefrom, the income shall be\nsubstituted. (iv)\n\nIncome\nshall mean those revenues received by a provider\nincidental to the operation of a community residence. Income shall include, but\nnot be limited to: (a) revenues received from\nother units of State, local or Federal government in consideration for the\nprovision of care to a person with developmental disabilities, excluding that\nportion of such revenue specifically intended to offset capital costs; and\n(b) monies received from\npersons in residence or on their behalf from third-party insurers or medical\nassistance programs. (v) Notwithstanding the above, income shall not include: (a) the value of food stamps received by\nindividuals or a provider on behalf of individuals; and\n(b) unrestricted grants, gifts or income from\nendowments. (vi)\n\nRestricted funds\nare funds expended by the community residence\nwhich include grants, gifts and income from endowments, whether cash or\notherwise, which must be used only for a specific purpose as designated by the\ndonor or grant instrument. Restricted funds are to be deducted from the\ndesignated costs when determining allowable costs. Such restricted funds shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, lower income housing assistance under section 8\nof the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended ( 42 USC\n1337\n[f]). The\ncommissioner may waive the provisions of this subparagraph at his discretion\nonly in those instances where the provider makes a reasonable demonstration\nthat the imposition of the requirements of this subparagraph would cause undue\nfinancial harm to the existence of the community residence. (vii)\n\nWhen regional comparisons are involved\nin determining the allowable costs, the geographic regions which OPWDD will\nconsider are: New York City (Region I); New York City Suburban (Region II); and\n\nUpstate New York (Region III).

(2)\n\nOperating costs. (i) As determined by the commissioner, costs\nwhich are not properly related to individual care or treatment, and which\nprincipally afford diversion, entertainment or amusement to owners, operators\nor employees of the community residence, shall not be allowed. (ii)\n\nAs determined by the commissioner, costs\nof contributions or other payments to political parties, candidates or\norganizations shall not be allowed. (iii)\n\nAs determined by the commissioner, only\nthat portion of the dues paid to any professional association which has been\ndemonstrated to be attributable to expenditures other than for lobbying or\npolitical contributions shall be allowed. (iv)\n\nAs determined by the commissioner, costs\nfor any interest expense related to funding expenses in excess of an approved\nprice, except as provided for in subparagraph (3)(iv) of this subdivision, or\npenalty imposed by governmental agencies or courts and the costs of insurance\npolicies obtained solely to insure against such penalty, shall not be allowed. OPWDD shall not pay interest on the final dollar amount resulting from the\nretrospective impact of price adjustments. (v) Allowable respite care costs include the\ncost of the following services in accordance with section\n686.15\n(a)(1)(i)\n(\nb\n) of this Part: (a) basic\n24-hour supervision of activities for persons living in the community\nresidence; (b) assistance in health\ncare and self-care services, including overseeing routine medical care and\nmanaging any medical emergency; (c) coordination of the established treatment program; and\n(d) room and board. (vi)\n\nSupervised community residences shall be\nresponsible for the cost of services which: (a) are necessary to meet the needs of\nindividuals while in residence; and\n(b) prior to August 1, 2004 could have been\nmet by home health aide or personal care services separately billed to\n\nMedicaid. (3)\n\nCapital costs. (i) The provisions of this\nparagraph shall only apply where costs of ownership of real property under\nsection\n635-6.4\nof this Title are limited\nto depreciation, interest, costs of alteration, construction, rehabilitation\nand/or renovation to real property, and costs attributable to the negotiation\nor settlement of sale or purchase of real property. (ii)\n\nFor construction or acquisition of a new\ncommunity residence, or acquisition of an interest in real property manifested\nby cooperative shares, which was first issued an operating certificate pursuant\nto article 16 of the Mental Hygiene Law on or after February 1, 1985, the\nestimated useful life of the building, for purposes of determining\ndepreciation, or the interest in real property manifested by cooperative\nshares, shall be the greater of the term of the mortgage or 15 years. Community\nresidences in operation prior to July 1, 1985 may apply to the commissioner to\nhave the useful life of the building changed to the guidelines pursuant to this\nparagraph. Such application shall be granted at the discretion of the\ncommissioner upon a showing that such change is necessary to the financial\nviability of the community residence and will not impede the community\nresidence's efficient and economical operation. All amortization of cooperative\nshares shall be 15 years or the life of the mortgage, whichever is\nlonger. (iii)\n\nDepreciation and\ninterest expense related to a real or personal depreciable property acquired\nprior to the bridge contract period (10/1/82 for some community residences and\n1/1/83 for the remaining community residences), are not allowable, except for\nthose assets where the community residence can document that the purchase was\nmade using funds of, or assets donated to, the sponsoring not-for-profit\ncorporation. (4)\n\nStart-up costs\nare those costs which are incurred from the\nperiod the provider receives approval pursuant to Part 53 of this Title to\nbecome a community residence to the date the first person is admitted. However, costs incurred during the period from the first admission to the effective date\nof the initial provider agreement shall not be considered as start-up costs. (i) OPWDD may, at the discretion of the\ncommissioner, reimburse a community residence for all allowable start-up costs\nincurred in the preparation of the community residence during that six-month\nperiod prior to the date of the first admission. A community residence may\napply to the commissioner for an extension of the six-month reimbursable\nstart-up period, provided that the community residence can demonstrate why such\nan extension is necessary. However, under no circumstances shall a community\nresidence be allowed reimbursement of start-up costs for any period of time\nexceeding 18 months prior to the date of the first admission. (ii)\n\nAllowable start-up costs must be cost\nefficient and may include, but not be limited to: (a) personal service expenses; (b) utility expenses; (c) taxes; (d) insurance expenses; (e) employee training expenses; (f) housekeeping expenses; (g) repair and maintenance expenses; and\n(h) administrative\nexpenses. (iii)\n\nAny costs that are\nproperly identifiable as organization costs or construction costs shall be\nclassified as such and excluded from start-up costs. (iv)\n\nRevenues from community residence\ndevelopment grants will offset allowable start-up costs, organization costs or\nconstruction costs for legal fees, initial staffing, rent, furniture and minor\nrehabilitation costs. (v) If all\nportions of the community residence are prepared at the same time, start-up\ncosts for all portions of the community residence shall be accumulated in a\nsingle deferred account and shall be amortized from the date of the first\nadmission. However, if only portions of the community residence are prepared\n(\ne.g., preparation of a floor or wing), start- up costs shall\nbe capitalized and amortized separately. In either case, unless reimbursed as\ndescribed in section\n635-6.4\n(i) of\nthis Title, start-up costs shall be amortized over a period not to exceed 60\nmonths from the date of the first admission. (5)\n\nRoom and board costs associated with\nsupervised or supportive community residences shall be reimbursed in accordance\nwith section\n671.7\nof this\n\nTitle. (c) Rent\ncharged to individuals. (1)\n\nRent\nshall mean the amount of the income and assets which may\nbe used on a monthly basis in payment to the community residence for the goods\nand services the community residence is required to provide to the individual, or used by the individual in direct payment to someone other than the community\nresidence for maintenance costs such as housing, utilities and transportation. Rent shall not include payment for food under section\n686.17\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor any individual eligible for SSI, the\nrent for other than respite services is equal to the monthly SSI payment as the\nstandard of monthly need for persons in residential care less the monthly\npersonal allowance for individuals in residential care. SSI\nshall mean supplemental security income benefits and additional State payments\nmade pursuant to title XVI of the Federal Social Security Act and title 6 of\narticle 5 of the New York Social Services Law. For respite services, the rent\nis equal to one half of the daily SSI level at congregate care level II less\none half of the daily personal allowance for individuals in residential\ncare. (3)\n\nFor individuals who are\nnot SSI-eligible, but who are authorized to receive a home relief grant from\nthe local social services district, rent shall be equal to the amount of the\nhome relief grant less the amount of personal allowance for individuals in\nresidential care. (4)\n\nFor\nindividuals who are not SSI-eligible and who are not authorized to receive a\nhome relief grant from the local social services district, rent shall be\ndetermined in accordance with the following guidelines. (i) General principles. (a) The maximum monthly rent charged to a\nperson who does not have SSI shall not exceed the amount of the provider\npayment established for individuals who have SSI in accordance with paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision. (b) Current monthly income shall be used according to the guidelines which follow\nbefore principal assets are considered as a source of payment in any given\nmonth. (c) In no case shall\nprincipal assets be considered a source of payment if the total principal\nassets are less than the current SSI asset limit. (d) Individuals who do not have SSI with\nprincipal assets shall use those assets as described in subparagraph (iii) of\nthis paragraph until the assets are reduced to the current SSI asset limit, unless either of the following conditions exists: (1)\nthe Social Security Administration has\nalready determined lack of a disabling medical condition; or\n(2)\nthe individual's unsubsidized gross\nearnings exceed $300 per month. (e) If either condition in clause\n(\nd\n) of this subparagraph applies, the individual who does not\nhave SSI, who has principal assets shall use those assets as described in\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph until the assets are reduced to the\ncurrent Medicaid asset limit. (ii)\n\nUse of monthly income. The amount of an\nindividual income available for contribution to the maximum monthly rent is\ndetermined by subtracting the following deductions, exemptions and allowances\nfrom gross monthly unearned, or earned income, or both. (a) Unearned income only. (1)\nA $20 income disregard. (2)\n\nThe personal allowance for individuals in\nresidential care, rounded to the next highest exact dollar amount, if the\nstipulated amount is not an exact dollar amount. (b) Earned income only. (1)\n\nThe first $20 as an income\ndisregard. (2)\n\nThe next $65 as a\nwork-related exemption. (3)\n\nOne\nhalf of the remainder after subclauses (\n1\n) and\n(\n2\n) of this clause are applied. This is also a work-related\nexemption. (4)\n\nThe personal\nallowance for individuals in residential care, rounded to the next highest\nexact dollar amount, if the stipulated amount is not an exact dollar\namount. (c) Earned and\nunearned income. (1)\n$20 of the unearned\nincome as an income disregard. (2)\n\nThe first $65 of earned income as a work-related exemption. (3)\n\nOne half of the remaining earnings after\nsubclause (\n2\n) of this clause is applied. This is also a\nwork-related exemption. (4)\n\nThe\npersonal allowance for individuals in residential care, rounded to the next\nhighest exact dollar amount, if the stipulated amount is not an exact dollar\namount. (iii)\n\nUse of principal assets. If the amount of available income as determined by the\n\nSocial Security Administration is less than the SSI maximum monthly rent, principal assets shall be used to make up the full amount of the shortfall if\neither set of the following conditions exists: (a) There is no existing written\ndocumentation from the Social Security Administration that the individual lacks\na disabling medical condition and the individual's unsubsidized gross earnings\nare less than $300, and total principal assets are more than the SSI asset\nlimit. (b) There is written\ndocumentation from the Social Security Administration that the individual lacks\na disabling medical condition or the unsubsidized gross earnings are greater\nthan $300, and total principal assets are more than the current asset limit for\na single- person household under the Medicaid program.

(i) In order for an individual to be\nconsidered in residence, that person shall be present between the census-taking\nhours of the community residence on two successive days; the day of admission\nas well as the day of discharge shall be counted. An individual shall be\nconsidered in residence if that person is discharged on the same day as\nadmitted, providing there was an expectation that the admission would have had\nat least a 24-hour duration. (ii)\nA\nrespite day\nshall mean a period of at least 10 hours within\nthe 24-hour period between the census-taking hours of the community residence\non two successive days, during which a person living with family or in family\ncare receives overnight lodging, at least one meal, and services according to\nsubparagraph (b)(2)(v) of this section. (iii)\nA\ntemporary transfer\nday\nshall mean a 24-hour period between the census-taking hours of the\ncommunity residence on two successive days during which an individual on\ntherapeutic leave from his or her permanent residence receives lodging and\nservices.

(v) Emergency housing day\nshall mean a 24-hour period between the census-taking hours of the community\nresidence on two successive days during which a person who requires alternative\nhousing due to natural disaster which rendered the individual's existing\nresidence temporarily uninhabitable (\ne.g., due to fire, extended power failure, etc.) receives lodging and services. (2)\n\nFor a community residence that\nprovides respite services to individuals who do not reside in it, reimbursement\nof those services is in accordance with section\n635-10.5\n(h) of\nthis Title. A community residence may provide respite services to individuals\nwho do not reside in it by utilizing temporary use beds and/or vacant certified\nbeds. (e) [\nReserved\n]\n(f) [\nReserved\n]\n(g) Funded depreciation. (1)\n\nApplicability. This paragraph shall apply to all community residences except\nthose for which the provider is receiving or has a commitment to receive HUD\nfunding. HUD funding\nshall mean lower income housing\nassistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937, as amended\n(42 USC\n1437\n[f]), and/or a loan or loans pursuant to\nsection 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as amended (12 USC\n1701\n[q]). (2)\n\nEffective July 1, 1986, for any price\nperiod during which the reimbursement attributable to depreciation on a\ncommunity residence's real property, excluding equipment, exceeds the\nprovider's principal repayment obligations on indebtedness attributable to such\nreal property, such provider shall fund depreciation by depositing such\ndifference in an interest-bearing checking account or other secure investment. If the provider operates more than one community residence governed by this\nparagraph, the provider may maintain one funded depreciation account for two or\nmore community residences. The provider shall not commingle such funded\ndepreciation account(s) with other monies of the provider. The provider shall\nnot be required to fund depreciation attributable to the provider's equity in\nsuch real property. The provider may expend the funds in such account, including accrued interest, to retire all or a portion of the indebtedness\nattributable to such real property, or for building improvements and/or fixed\nequipment necessary to the community residence. (h) Price corrections for service\nperiods beginning on or after July 1, 2011. (1)\n\nThe commissioner will correct prices in\ninstances where there are material errors in the information submitted by the\nprovider which OPWDD used to establish the price or where there are material\nerrors in the price computation and only in instances which would result in an\nannual increase of $5,000 or more in a provider's allowable costs. (2)\n\nIn order to request a price correction in\naccordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the provider must send to\nOPWDD its request by certified mail, return receipt requested, within 90 days\nof the provider receiving the price computation or within 90 days of the first\nday of the price period in question, whichever is later. (i) Appeals to prices determined\npursuant to sections 635-10.5 and\n671.7\nof this Title. (1)\n\nThreshold. For price periods before July\n1, 2011, the commissioner will consider only appeals for adjustment to the\nprices which would result in an annual increase of $1,000 or more in the\nallowable costs of the program or service being appealed. For price periods\nbeginning on or after July 1, 2011, the threshold is $5,000. (2)\n\nThe bases for appeals. For price periods\nbefore July 1, 2011, appeals that shall be considered are those that are: (i) needed because of changes in the\nstatistical information used to calculate the staffing or utilization standards\nincluded in the program or service; or\n(ii)\nappeals for adjustments needed because\nof material errors in the information submitted by the provider which OPWDD\nused to establish the price or material errors in the price computation; or\n(iii)\nappeals for significant\nincreases or decreases in the overall operating costs of the program or service\nbeing appealed due to implementation of new programs, changes in staff or\nservices, changes in the characteristics or number of individuals receiving\nservices, changes in a lease agreement so as not to involve a related party, capital renovations, expansions or replacements; which have been either\nmandated or approved by the commissioner and, except in life-threatening\nsituations, approved in advance. (3)\n\nFor all price periods, the bases for\nappeals shall also include: (i) rent appeals\nfor any month during the price period that an individual is unable to pay an\namount, whether from SSI, other benefits or earnings, equal to the rent charged\neach individual and this affects the efficient and economical operation of the\nresidence; or\n(ii)\nboard appeals\nfor any month during the price period that a person is unable to pay an amount, whether from benefits, earnings or other assets, equal to the amount charged\neach person for food under section\n686.17\nof this Part and this\naffects the efficient and economical operation of the residence; or\n(ii)\nvacancy appeals. (4)\n\nNotification of first level appeal. (i) In order to appeal a price in accordance\nwith subparagraph (2)(ii) of this subdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD\na first level appeal application by certified mail, return receipt requested, within either 90 days of the provider receiving the price computation or 90\ndays of the first day of the price period in question, whichever is\nlater. (ii)\n\nIn order to appeal a\nprice in accordance with subparagraphs (2)(i) and (iii) and (3)(i), (ii) and\n(iii) of this subdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD within one year of\nthe close of the price period in question, a first level appeal application by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested. (5)\n\nFirst level price appeal applications\nshall be made in writing to the commissioner. (i) The application shall set forth the basis\nfor the first level appeal and the issues of fact. Appropriate documentation\nshall accompany the application and OPWDD may request such additional\ndocumentation as it deems necessary. (ii)\n\nActions on first level price appeal\napplications will be processed without unjustifiable delay. (6)\n\nThe burden of proof on first\nlevel appeal shall be on the provider to demonstrate that the price requested\nin the first level appeal is necessary to ensure efficient and economical\noperation of the program or service. In first level rent or board appeals, the\nburden of proof shall be on the provider to demonstrate that an individual who\nhas been admitted to the individualized residential alternative or community\nresidence is not able to pay the rent or board charged him or her. (7)\nA price revised by OPWDD pursuant to an\nappeal shall not be considered final unless and until approved by the State\n\nDivision of the Budget. (8)\n\nAt no\npoint in the first level appeal process shall the provider have a right to an\ninterim report of any determinations made by any of the parties to the appeal. At the conclusion of the first level appeal process OPWDD shall notify the\nprovider of any proposed revised price, board or rent, or denial of same. OPWDD\nshall inform the provider that it may either accept the proposed revised price, board or rent or request a second level appeal in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n602.9\nof this Title, in the event\nthat the proposed revised price, board or rent fails to grant some or all of\nthe relief requested. (9)\n\nAt the\nconclusion of the first level appeal process, OPWDD shall notify the provider\nof any revised price or denial of the request. Once OPWDD has informed the\nprovider of the appeal outcome, a provider which submits a revised cost report\nfor the period reviewed shall not be entitled to an increase in the award\ndetermination based on that resubmission. (10)\n\nIf OPWDD approves the revision to the\nprice and the State Division of the Budget denies the revision, the provider\nshall have no further right to administrative review pursuant to this\nsection. (11)\n\nIf at the conclusion\nof a first or second level rent appeal or board appeal, OPWDD has revised the\nrent or board, and if the individual whose inability to pay was the basis for\nthe appeal is subsequently able to pay the rent or board or other charges, the\nprovider shall pay OPWDD the amount of additional payment OPWDD made for such\nindividual or the amount of rent or board or charges the individual was able to\npay the provider, whichever is less. (12)\n\nAny price revised in accordance with\nthis subdivision shall be effective according to the dates indicated in the\napproval of the price appeal notification, and adjustments to subsequent period\nprices shall be made accordingly. (13)\n\nAny additional reimbursement received by\nthe facility pursuant to a price revised in accordance with this subdivision\nshall be restricted to the specific purpose set forth in the first or second\nlevel appeal decision. If the provider does not spend such reimbursement on\nsuch specific purpose, OPWDD shall be entitled to recover such\nreimbursement. (14)\n\nSecond level\nappeals to prices. (i) OPWDD's denial of the\nfirst level appeal of any or all of the relief requested in the appeals\nprovided for in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision shall be final, unless the provider requests a second level appeal to the commissioner in\nwriting within 30 days of service of notification of denial or proposed revised\nprice. (ii)\n\nSecond level appeals\nshall be brought and determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of\n\nPart 602 of this Title. (j) Audits. (1)\n\nAfter administrative review pursuant to\nsection\n635-4.6\nof this Title, the\ncommunity residence shall be notified in writing of the determination of those\nitems to which the community residence objected, including a statement of the\nreasons therefor. Audit findings pertaining to allowable costs and offsetting\nrevenues for funding under this section shall be final, unless the community\nresidence requests a hearing pursuant to Part 602 of this Title. (2)\n\nAudit findings which are final, as\ndefined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, shall, where appropriate, constitute grounds for the recoupment of overpayments and the reimbursement of\nunderpayments. Such adjustments shall be made at the discretion of the\ncommissioner, and shall result in corresponding adjustments to\nprices. (3)\n\nThe foregoing\nnotwithstanding, when a hearing has been requested pursuant to this paragraph, audit findings shall also constitute grounds for recoupment to the extent that\nthe audit findings are not matters in dispute for the purposes of the\nhearing. (k) Computation of the reimbursable costs for the facility class known as the\nindividualized residential alternative (IRA). (1)\n\nFor reimbursement of residential\nhabilitation provided for residents by an IRA with a certified capacity which\ndoes not consist of only temporary use beds, see section\n635-10.5\n(b) of\nthis Title. (2)\n\nIn addition to the\nIRA price for residential habilitation, another portion of the price for an IRA\nwith a certified capacity which does not consist of only temporary use beds\nincludes allowable room, board and protective oversight costs. This portion of\nthe price shall be determined by taking into account total allowable room, board and protective oversight costs. The price shall be net of income and\nlower income housing assistance. (i) For the\nmonthly supervised IRA price the total allowable net annual costs for all IRAs\nand community residences included in the monthly supervised IRA price shall be\ndivided by 12, and then divided by the total certified capacities less any\ncertified temporary use bed(s). Payment for these costs shall be contingent on\nmeeting the enrollment and services requirements in section\n635-10.5\n(b) of\nthis Title. (ii)\n\nFor the monthly\nsupportive IRA price the total allowable net annual costs for all IRAs and\ncommunity residences included in the monthly supportive IRA price shall be\ndivided by 12, and then divided by the total certified capacities less any\ncertified temporary use bed(s). Payment for these costs shall be contingent on\nmeeting the enrollment and services requirements in section\n635-10.5\n(b) of\nthis Title. (iii)\n\nFor a monthly\nsite-specific IRA price (see section\n635-10.5\n[b][10]\nof this Title) the total allowable net annual costs shall be divided by 12, and\nthen divided by the total certified capacity less any certified temporary use\nbed(s). Payment for these costs will be contingent on meeting the enrollment\nand services requirements in section\n635-10.5\n(b) of\nthis Title. (iv)\n\nThe total budgeted\ncosts for the IRA facility shall be compared to the actual costs of other\nexisting facilities serving persons with comparable needs including those\noperated by the provider. The submitted budget costs may be adjusted to be\ncomparable to the costs of such programs. (v) Total allowable room, board and\nprotective oversight costs shall be determined pursuant to subdivision (b) of\nthis section. Total reimbursable room, board, and protective oversight costs\nshall be the allowable room, board and protective oversight costs net of rent\ndetermined pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section and net of the offsets\nspecified in section\n671.7\n(a)(9) and\n(10)\nof this Title, both times the certified\ncapacity minus temporary use beds (TUBS). Room, board and protective oversight\ncosts shall include, but not be limited to the following: capital and start-up\ncosts, administrative personal service costs for protective oversight, building\nmaintenance, cooking or housekeeping, where such functions cannot be integrated\nas part of the person's residential habilitation services portion of the ISP, as defined in section\n635-10.4\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title and associated fringe benefits, food, repairs, utilities, equipment\nother than adaptive technologies, household supplies, linen, clothing and\nprorated administration and overhead costs. (vi)\n\nTotal reimbursable capital costs\nincluding related administrative costs, shall mean the IRA facility's budget\ncosts as determined by subdivision (b) of this section, or by Subpart 635-6 of\nthis Title, or an amount agreed to by the provider and OPWDD. (vii)\n\nTotal reimbursable non-capital IRA\nroom, board and protective oversight costs shall be equal to the least of the\nbudget costs, the reimbursable costs determined through the application of\nsubdivision (b) of this section and Subpart 635-6 of this Title; or costs\nagreed to by the provider and OPWDD. With prior approval of OPWDD and upon\nsubmission of supporting documentation substantiating programmatic necessity, certain reasonable additional non-capital IRA room, board and protective\noversight budgeted costs in excess of the recommendations from the budget\nreview process may be reimbursed. (viii)\n\nThe total reimbursable operating costs\nderived through the application of the above methodology shall be trended as\nappropriate. Reimbursable capital costs shall be added to the trended\nreimbursable costs. For the IRA facility, the OPWDD shall apply trend factor\ncomponents in accordance with section\n635-10.5\n(i) of\nthis Title. (ix)\n\nThe total\nreimbursable operating costs derived through the application of the above\nmethodology shall be subject to efficiency adjustments in section\n635-10.5\n(b)(18)\nof this Title. (x) Unless otherwise\nagreed to by the provider, the price determined through the application of this\nsubdivision may be appealed. Such appeal shall be pursuant to subdivision (i)\nof this section, except that the determination following such first level\nappeal shall be the commissioner's final decision. (xi)\n\nThe price determined in accordance with\nthis subdivision shall not be considered final unless approved by the director\nof the Division of the Budget. (3)\n\nFor an IRA that provides respite services\nto individuals who do not reside in it, reimbursement of those services is in\naccordance with section\n635-10.5\n(h) of\nthis Title. (i) An IRA, other than a\nfree-standing respite center, may provide respite services to individuals who\ndo not reside in it by utilizing temporary use beds and/or vacant certified\nbeds. (ii)\n\nRespite services may\nalso be provided in IRAs which are free-standing respite centers. These\nfacilities have a certified capacity which consists only of temporary use\nbeds. (l) Employee health care enhancement (HCE). (1)\n\nProviders are eligible to have additional\nfunding included in their rate if they submitted a completed 2005 OPWDD survey\non health care benefits for all full- and part-time employees. (2)\n\nBased on a survey of providers, OPWDD\ndetermined a benchmark of health care benefits offered to employees by\nproviders. In September 2005, OPWDD notified those providers if their health\ncare benefits were at, above, or below the benchmark. (3)\n\nProviders whose employee health care\nbenefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for additional funding to\nbe effective January 1, 2006 as follows: (i) For providers which reported on the survey that no health care benefits are\noffered, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the total\nnumber of employees reported multiplied by $2,500, except that if there are any\nemployees who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not\nto offer this funding, the allocation based on the total number of employees\nreported will be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported\nmultiplied by $2,500. These funds must be used to establish employee health\ncare benefits or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health-related\nexpenses. (ii)\n\nFor providers which\nreported on the survey that employee health care benefits are offered to some\nor all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the\ntotal number of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are\nany employees who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses\nnot to offer this funding, the allocation based on the total number of\nemployees reported will be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported\nmultiplied by $325. These funds must be used to enhance employee health care\nbenefits or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health-related expenses. (4)\n\nEffective January 1, 2006, providers may receive additional funding that would have been received during\nthe period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 if the funding described\nin paragraph (3) of this subdivision had been paid. Providers whose employee\nhealth care benefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for additional\nfunding as follows: (i) For providers which\nreported on the survey that no employee health care benefits are offered, no\nadditional funding for the period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 is\navailable. (ii)\n\nFor providers which\nreported on the survey that employee health care benefits are offered to some\nor all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the\ntotal number of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are\nany employees who were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses\nnot to offer this funding, the allocation based on the total number of\nemployees reported will be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported\nmultiplied by $325. The annual allocation of $325 will be adjusted for the\n21-month period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. These funds must be\nused to reimburse health care expenses paid by employees. (5)\n\nIn order to receive an allocation\ndescribed in paragraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision, the provider must send\nto OPWDD a completed written application submitted in the form and format\nspecified by the commissioner. (6)\n\nFunding is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD will base\nits decision on whether the application is complete; whether it complies with\nthe requirements of this subdivision; and whether the application recognizes\nthe provider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD may request additional information\nand/or documentation as needed before approving the application. (7)\n\nPayment of the allocation described in\nparagraph (3) or (4) of this subdivision shall be subject to the provider\nsubmitting a resolution by its governing body that funds received will be used\nto implement the plans described in the provider's approved application. To\nreceive the allocation, the provider must submit the resolution and the\ncommissioner may approve it. (8)\nA\nrate revised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered\nfinal unless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (m) Employee health care\nenhancement II. (1)\n\nEffective January\n1, 2007 providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care\nenhancement II (HCE II). Provides must use these funds to establish or enhance\nemployee health care benefits or to reduce employee out of pocket health care\nexpenses. (2)\n\nIn order to receive\nfunding described in this subdivision, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a\ncompleted written application by July 31, 2006, unless this deadline was\nextended by the commissioner. (3)\n\nFunding is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD shall\ndecide whether to approve the application based on whether the application is\ncomplete; whether it complies with the requirements of this subdivision; and\nwhether the application recognizes the provider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD\nmay request additional information and/or documentation, or revisions to an\napplication, before approving the application. (4)\n\nFunding for HCE II is available at either\n$2,500 per employee or $425 per employee, as follows: (i) The annual allocation at the $2,500 level\nis determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the\nprovider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $2,500. Funding at the\n$2,500 level is available to providers which: (a) submitted an application for HCE II\nfunding at the $2,500 level; and\n(b) do not offer health care benefits; and\n(c) were insufficiently funded\nfor health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by\nOPWDD of this determination. (ii)\n\nThe annual allocation at the $425 level\nis determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the\nprovider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $425. Funding at the $425\nlevel is available to providers which: (a) offer health care benefits to some or all employees and submitted an\napplication for HCE II funding at the $425 level; or\n(b) applied for HCE II funding at the $2,500\nlevel but received funding at the $2,500 per employee level pursuant to\nsubdivision (l) of this section; or\n(c) submitted an application at the $2,500\nlevel but have sufficient funding for health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by OPWDD of this determination. (5)\n\nThe application\nsubmitted to OPWDD shall include plans for the expenditure of the HCE II\nallocation in conformance with this subdivision. Such HCE II plans shall assure\nthat all employees included in the application are entitled to some benefit\nfrom HCE II, although the value per employee may be lesser or greater than\n$2,500 or $425 per employee. Higher paid employees whose earnings exceed a\nsalary cap established by the provider may be excluded from receipt of any HCE\nII funds if these funds are reallocated to lower paid staff. (6)\nA provide approved to receive HCE II\nfunding pursuant to subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision shall receive an\namount that would have been paid if the HCE II initiative had been implemented\n\nApril 1, 2006. (7)\n\nPayment of the\nHCE II funding shall be subject to the provider submitting a resolution by its\ngoverning body that funds received shall be used to implement the plans\ndescribed in the provider's approved application. To receive the allocation the\nprovider must submit the resolution and the commissioner must approve\nit. (8)\nA rate revised by OPWDD\npursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and until\napproved by the State Division of the Budget. (n) Employee health care enhancement\nIII. (1)\n\nEffective January 1, 2008\nproviders may be eligible to receive funding for the health care enhancement\nIII (HCE III) included in their price. (2)\n\nFunding. Based on a survey of providers'\nhistorical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health\ncare benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to September 30, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible for HCE III at below\nthe benchmark level. Providers deemed eligible for HCE III funding below the\nbenchmark level were mailed applications with instructions. (i) Providers deemed eligible for HCE III\nfunding at the benchmark level shall receive an amount equaling 1.0 percent of\nthe operating costs exclusive of any HCE III component contained in the fee in\neffect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided pursuant to subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. Providers which also operate programs and services\neligible for the 3.0 percent funding level increase under this Chapter may not\nreceive this 1.0 percent funding level increase unless they have declined the\n3.0 percent funding level increase in the eligible programs and services. Providers which receive this 1.0 percent funding level increase may not apply\nfor employee health care funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nProviders deemed\neligible for HCE III funding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to\nreceive an amount equaling 1.0 percent of the operating costs exclusive of any\nHCE III component contained in the fee in effect on January 1, 2008 net of any\nfunding provided pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (a) Providers shall use these funds to\nestablish or enhance employee health care benefits and/or to reduce employee\nout-of-pocket health care expenses and/or to offset the portion of premium\nincreases paid by the provider which exceeds the portion of the trend factor or\nCOLA applicable to those premium increases. Providers shall assure that\nbenefits resulting from this additional funding recognize their lower paid\nemployees. (b) In order to receive\nthe funding described in this subparagraph, the provider must have sent to\nOPWDD a completed application and attestation received or postmarked by October\n1, 2007, unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the\napplication and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use\nof the funds; agreed to obtain a resolution by December 31, 2007 from its\ngoverning body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the\nresolution as well as records detailing the distribution of HCE III\nfunds. (c) Funding is contingent\nupon OPWDD's approval of the application and attestation. OPWDD shall decide\nwhether to approve the application and attestation based on whether it is\ncomplete and conforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may\nrequest additional information or documentation before approving the\napplication and attestation. (iii)\nA provider approved to receive HCE III\nfunding pursuant to subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph shall receive an\namount that would have been paid if the HCE III initiative had been implemented\n\nApril 1, 2007. (3)\nA fee\nrevised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final\nunless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (o) Health care adjustments\n(HCA) IV and V. (1)\n\nEffective November\n1, 2009, providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care\nadjustments (HCA) IV and V included in their fees. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark\nproviders. Based on a survey of providers' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health care related benefits offered to\nemployees by providers. Prior to October 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those\nproviders which OPWDD deemed eligible for HCE III funding at the benchmark\nlevel. Providers eligible for HCE III funding at the benchmark level are\neligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding at the benchmark level. All other\nproviders are eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding below the benchmark\nlevel. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA IV and HCA V\nfunding at the benchmark level. (a) The HCA IV\nand HCA V funding levels for benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent of the\nallowable operating costs used in establishing the provider specific fees. Each\nadjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect compounding of the\nadjustments. (b) Providers which\nalso operate programs and services eligible for the 3.0 percent funding level\nincrease under this Chapter may not receive this 1.0 percent funding level\nincrease unless they have declined the 3.0 percent funding level increase in\nthe eligible programs and services. Providers which receive this 1.0 percent\nfunding level increase may not apply for employee health care funding described\nin subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA IV and HCA V\nfunding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA IV and HCA V funding levels for\nproviders eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding below the benchmark level shall\nbe 1.0 percent of the allowable operating costs used in establishing the\nprovider specific fees. Each adjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect\ncompounding of the adjustments. (b) Providers shall use these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care\nrelated benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related\nexpenses. (c) In order to receive\nHCA IV and HCA V funds, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed\napplication and attestation received or postmarked no later than September 11, 2009 unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application\nand attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the\nfunds; agreed to obtain a resolution by October 31, 2009 from its governing\nbody authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as\nwell as records detailing the distribution of HCA IV and HCA V funds. (d) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's\napproval of the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and\nconforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional\ninformation or documentation before approving the application and\nattestation. (4)\n\nCatch-up provisions. Effective November\n1, 2009, benchmark providers which do not receive any HCA funding at the 3.0\npercent level and non-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be\neligible to receive additional funding for HCA IV in an amount that would have\nbeen received for the period of April 1, 2008 through October 31, 2009 if the\n1.0 percent increment had been implemented on April 1, 2008. Effective November\n1, 2009 benchmark providers which do not receive any HCA funding at the 3.0\npercent level and non-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be\neligible to receive additional funding for HCA V in an amount that would have\nbeen received for the period of April 1, 2009 through October 31, 2009 if the\n1.0 percent increment had been implemented on April 1, 2009. Nothing in this\nparagraph shall entitle a provider to receive payment for services which have\nnot been provided. (5)\n\nConsolidation of HCE and HCA funds effective January 1, 2010. (i) Effective January 1, 2010, the HCE I\nthrough III and HCA IV and HCA V components included in the price shall be\nconsolidated into a single discrete amount. For purposes of determining this\namount, OPWDD shall combine the HCE I through III and HCA IV and HCA V\ncomponents contained in the initial fee in effect on January 1, 2010. OPWDD\nshall use this fixed amount as the HCA payment for the fee periods beginning on\nor after January 1, 2010. (ii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, with the consolidation of the health care\nadjustments, non-benchmark providers shall use HCE I, II and III funds first to\neither offset health care premium increases and/or to maintain benefits that\nwere established and funded with previous HCE I, II and III receipts. Remaining\nfunds shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care related\nbenefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Non-benchmark providers shall continue to use HCA IV and V funds first to\noffset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to\nestablish or enhance employee health care related benefits and/or to reduce\nemployee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Health care\nenhancement/adjustment funds included in prices for services delivered on or\nafter July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for the purposes\ndescribed in this subparagraph and/or for any other options that continue\nand/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the recruitment\nand/or retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using\nthese funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which priorities\nserve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care\nenhancement/adjustment funding shall be included in the reimbursable cost\ncategory of fringe benefits in the price. (6)\n\nProvider's distribution of HCA IV and HCA\nV funds is subject to audit to ensure conformity with the requirements of this\nparagraph and distribution of funds consistent with the provider's approved\napplication. (p) Health care adjustment (HCA) VI. (1)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, providers may\nbe eligible to receive funding for the health care adjustments (HCA) VI\nincluded in their prices. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark providers. Based on a survey of\nproviders' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark\nof health care related benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to\n\nOctober 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible\nfor health care enhancement (HCE) III funding at the benchmark level. These\nproviders are \"benchmark providers\" and are eligible for HCA VI funding at the\nbenchmark level. All other providers (\"non-benchmark providers\") are eligible\nfor HCA VI funding below the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA VI funding at\nthe benchmark level. (a) The HCA VI funding\nlevel for benchmark providers shall be 3.0 percent of the allowable operating\ncosts used in establishing the provider specific prices in effect on April 1, 2010. (b) Alternatively, a provider\neligible for HCA VI funding at the benchmark level shall receive a 1.0 percent\nfunding increase in all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter\nif the provider notified OPWDD by August 13, 2010 in writing that it was\ndeclining the 3.0 percent funding level increase and electing instead to\nreceive a 1.0 percent funding level increase in all its programs and services\neligible under this Chapter. (c) Providers eligible for funding at the benchmark level may not apply for HCA VI\nfunding described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA VI funding\nbelow the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA VI funding level for providers\neligible for HCA VI funding below the benchmark level shall be 1.0 percent of\nthe allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider specific prices\nin effect on April 1, 2010. (b) Providers shall use these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance employee health care\nrelated benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related\nexpenses. Health care adjustment funds included in prices for services\ndelivered on or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for\nthe purposes described in this clause and/or for any other options that\ncontinue and/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the\nrecruitment and/or retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which\npriorities serve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care adjustment funding shall be included in the reimbursable cost\ncategory of fringe benefits in the price. (c) In order to receive HCA VI funds, the\nprovider must have sent to OPWDD a completed application and attestation\nreceived or postmarked no later than August 13, 2010 unless the deadline was\nextended by the commissioner. In the application and attestation, the provider\nmust have indicated its intended use of the funds; agreed to obtain a\nresolution by September 30, 2010 from its governing body authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as well as records detailing the\ndistribution of HCA VI funds. (d) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application and attestation\nbased on whether it is complete and conforms to the requirements of this\nsubdivision. OPWDD may request additional information or documentation before\napproving the application and attestation. (iii)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, benchmark\nproviders shall be eligible and non-benchmark providers with approved\napplications shall be eligible to receive additional funding for HCA VI in an\namount that they would have received if the health care adjustment VI had been\nin effect for the period from April 1, 2010 through September 30, 2010. Nothing\nin this subparagraph shall entitle a provider to receive payment for services\nwhich have not been provided. (4)\n\nProviders' distribution of HCA VI funds\nis subject to audit to ensure conformity with the requirements of this\nsubdivision and distribution of funds consistent with the provider's approved\napplication.
