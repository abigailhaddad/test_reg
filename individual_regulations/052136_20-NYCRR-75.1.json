Such return must show: (1)\nthe number\nof untaxed cigarettes which were: (i) on hand\nat the beginning of the preceding calendar month; (ii)\npurchased or acquired during such\nmonth; (iii)\non hand at the end of\nsuch month; (iv)\nlawfully sold or\ndisposed of during such month; (v) otherwise accountable for during such month, including those cigarettes which\nrequired cigarette tax stamps; and\n(2)\nthe number of cigarette tax stamps which\nwere: (i) on hand at the beginning of such\nmonth; (ii)\npurchased during such\nmonth; (iii)\non hand at the end of\nsuch month; (iv)\naffixed or\notherwise disposed of during such month. The return must also contain a\ndetailed explanation of any discrepancy which might exist between the number of\nuntaxed cigarettes which required stamps and the appropriate number of\ncigarette tax stamps which were affixed during the period covered by the\nreturn. In the event that such a discrepancy cannot be satisfactorily\nexplained, any cigarette tax due the State which is attributable to the\ndiscrepancy shall be deemed payable with the filing of the return and the rules\ngoverning payment of the use tax as described in section\n75.3\nof this Title shall apply in pertinent part to such tax due.

(c) Every return filed by or on behalf of a\ncigarette agent must contain a certification to the effect that the statements\nin the return are true, correct and complete.
