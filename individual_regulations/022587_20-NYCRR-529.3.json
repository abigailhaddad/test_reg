  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 529.3 - United States of America, agencies and instrumentalities thereof\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1116(a)(2)\n(a) Governmental entities. (1)\n\nAgencies and instrumentalities of\nthe United States\nas used in this section means any authority, commission or independent board created by an act of Congress for a public\npurpose, and which is immune from state taxation. (2)\n\nStates of the United States and their\npolitical subdivisions, the District of Columbia, territories and possessions\nof the United States are not exempt from the tax. (3)\n\nSome entities, although created by an act\nof Congress, are not governmental entities and are not exempt from the sales\nand use taxes. (b) As purchaser. (1)\n\nThe United\n\nStates of America, and any of its agencies and instrumentalities immune from\ntaxation (hereinafter referred to as United States governmental entities) are\nnot subject to the sales or use tax when they are the purchaser, user or\nconsumer of tangible personal property or services or when they are the\noccupant of hotel rooms or a patron at a place of amusement, club, roof garden, cabaret or similar place. Example 1: The purchase of goods and services that will be used in\ncongressional offices and paid for out of appropriated congressional funds are\npurchases by the United States government when the appropriate exemption\ndocument is submitted. Example 2: Where a governmental employee receives a uniform allowance\nand the employee subsequently uses that allowance to purchase uniforms, such\npurchases are not purchases by the United States government. (2)\n\nUnited States governmental entities as\npurchasers, users, consumers, occupants or patrons must exercise their right to\nexemption through the issuance of governmental purchase orders or the\nappropriate exemption document. (c) As vendor. (1)\n\nSales by United States governmental\nentities of tangible personal property or services of a kind not ordinarily\nsold by private persons, are exempt from the sales and use tax. Example 1: Sales of pamphlets, booklets and documents by the Federal\n\nGovernment Printing Office are not subject to the sales or use\ntax. (2)\n\nSales by United\n\nStates governmental entities of tangible personal property or services of a\nkind ordinarily sold by private persons are subject to the sales and use tax. Example 2: Proof sets of coins sold by the U.S. Mint are subject to\ntax. Example 3: Sales of gifts and souvenirs by the United States or one of\nits agencies at a Federal park or monument are subject to tax. Example 4: A United States governmental agency operates a hotel; since\nhotel services are ordinarily provided by private persons, such services are\nsubject to the appropriate tax. (3)\n\nFailure by United States governmental\nentities to collect sales tax on transactions which are subject to tax does not\nrelieve the purchaser from the payment of tax. The purchaser must pay the tax\ndirectly to the Department of Taxation and Finance. See Part 532 of this Title\nfor payment of the tax. (d) Waiver of immunity. Where the Congress has waived immunity from taxation such\nas in the case of national banks (12 USC, §\n548\n) or with respect to other\ninstrumentalities or agencies of the United States, no exemption from the\npayment or collection of sales or use tax exists.
