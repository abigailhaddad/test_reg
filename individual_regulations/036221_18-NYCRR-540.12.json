  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 540.12 - Advance payments to hospitals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Criteria for eligibility. The department is authorized to make advance payments to\nhospitals which meet the following criteria: (1)\n\nThe hospital is a voluntary\nnot-for-profit hospital. (2)\n\nPrior\nto January 1, 1978, the hospital received regular periodic advances from a\nlocal government unit, which advances were based on anticipated medical\nassistance claims payments. (3)\n\nThat, historically, 10 percent or 5,000 patient days of hospital inpatient\nservices must have been provided to Medicaid recipients who reside in a\ndistrict for which the Medicaid Management Information System (MMIS) has taken\nover payment responsibility. (b) Methods of advances. Advance payments of medical assistance funds shall be\nmade to hospitals in the following manner: (1)\n\nAdvance payments will be made for the\nperiod from June 1, 1978 to November 30, 1978, which period shall be known as\nthe advance phase. (2)\n\nAdvance\npayments will be computed on the basis of a comparison of actual monthly\npayments for medical assistance to the hospital with the estimated normal\nmonthly payments for medical assistance services. This estimate shall be\nprepared by the department. The department shall advance funds to account for a\npercentage of the difference between the actual payments made and the estimated\nmonthly claim at the following rates: Month\n\nPercent\n\nJune\n90%\nJuly\n80%\nAugust\n70%\nSeptember\n60%\nOctober\n50%\nNovember\n40%\nThese rates are subject to the discretion of the\ncommissioner. In no case shall the percentage of monies advanced ever exceed 90\npercent of the difference between the estimated claim and total payments\nreceived by the hospital. (3)\n\nThe only payments to be considered in\ndeveloping the comparison referred to in paragraph (2) of this subdivision\nshall be payments for claims submitted to MMIS or to those local social\nservices districts in whose behalf it is operating. (4)\n\nThe hospital shall certify as to the\namount of inpatient services provided to Medicaid recipients, for which it has\nnot yet billed, in the month for which advance payments are to be received. This certification must be sufficient to account for the entire difference\nbetween payments actually received and the estimate developed by the department\nof the normal month's payment. In the event that such unbilled services are\nless than this difference, the State will advance only a percentage of the\nlesser amount. (5)\n\nIn the event\nthat at any time during the advance phase, the actual monthly payments to a\nhospital exceed 100 percent of its estimated normal month's payment, the\ndepartment may: (i) withhold from its next\nmonthly advance to that hospital the amount by which the previous month's\npayment exceeded the estimated normal month's payment; or\n(ii)\nwithhold from the regular monthly\npayment the amount by which the actual payment exceeds the estimated normal\nmonth's payment. Monies withheld under this option shall be applied towards the\nliquidation of any outstanding advances. (c) Performance criteria. In order for a facility to continue to qualify for\nadvances, it must meet the following performance criteria: (1)\n\nFor any month during which an advance is\nsought, the facility's claim submissions must equal at least 90 percent of its\naverage monthly submissions (trended). Of these, a reasonable percentage will\nhave to pass MMIS edits. (2)\n\"Clean\" claims must be submitted within 15 days of the discharge date in 95\npercent of the cases. \"Clean\" claims are those which do not require submission\nto other third-party payors, and which do not require eligibility or disability\ndetermination. (3)\n\nWhere the\nhospital's claiming pattern clearly indicates that the facility has\ndeliberately withheld claims in order to qualify for the advance, the State may\nrecoup its advance by withholding any payments over 100 percent of the\nhospital's estimated claiming levels until the amount of the advance is\nrecouped. (d) Method of recoupment. The department shall recoup all advance payments under\nthe following procedures: (1)\n\nAt the\nclose of the last payment cycle of November, each hospital's outstanding\nadvances shall be totalled. (2)\n\nAdvances shall be recouped in equal installments over a period of 12 months\nbeginning with the month of December, 1978. The department shall deduct each\nmonth from payments made to hospitals participating in this advancing system an\namount equal to one twelfth of all advance payments. The recoupment period may\nbe extended to 18 months at the discretion of the commissioner. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding any of the foregoing\nprovisions of this section, the department shall be authorized to modify the\nschedule of recoupments set out in paragraph (2) of this subdivision upon\ncertification by the State Commissioner of Health of the need for such\nmodification made pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n86-1.36\n[\ncontinued\n] (e)\nprovided, however, that any such modification shall not extend the total period\nof recoupment beyond 18 months. (e) Notwithstanding any of the foregoing\nprovisions of this section, the department may, in its discretion, make\nadvances on either a monthly, semimonthly or weekly basis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n540.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
