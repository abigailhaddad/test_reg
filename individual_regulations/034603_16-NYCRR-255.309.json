Tit. 16 § 255.309 - Repair of steel pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nimperfection or damage that impairs the serviceability of the length of steel\npipe must be repaired or removed. (b) If a repair is made by grinding, the\nremaining wall thickness must at least be equal to either: (1)\nthe minimum thickness required by the\ntolerances in the specification to which the pipe was manufactured; or\n(2)\nthe nominal wall thickness\nrequired for the design pressure of the pipeline. (c) Each of the following dents must be\nremoved from steel pipe to be operated at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or\nmore, unless the dent is repaired by a method that reliable engineering tests\nand analyses show can permanently restore the serviceability of the pipe: (1)\na dent that contains a stress\nconcentrator such as a scratch, gouge, groove or arc burn; (2)\na dent that affects a longitudinal weld\nor a circumferential weld; (3)\na\ndent that has a depth of more than one-quarter inch in pipe 123/4 inches (324\nmillimeters) or less in outer diameter; or\n(4)\na dent that has a depth of more than two\npercent of the nominal pipe diameter in pipe over 123/4 inches (324\nmillimeters) in outer diameter. (d) For the purpose of this section, a dent\nis a depression that produces a gross disturbance in the curvature of the pipe\nwall without reducing the pipewall thickness. The depth of a dent is measured\nas the gap between the lowest point of the dent and a prolongation of the\noriginal contour of the pipe. (e) Each arc burn on steel pipe to be operated at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa)\nor more must be repaired or removed. If a repair is made by grinding, the arc\nburn must be completely removed. (f) Complete removal of the metallurgical\nnotch created by an arc burn can be determined by grinding away the visible\nevidence of the arc burn and then swabbing the ground area with a 20 percent\nsolution of ammonium persulfate. A blackened spot is evidence of a\nmetallurgical notch and indicates that additional grinding is\nnecessary. (g) A gouge, groove, arc\nburn or dent may not be repaired by insert patching or by pounding\nout. (h) Each gouge, groove, arc\nburn or dent that is removed from a length of pipe must be removed by cutting\nout the damaged portion as a cylinder. (i) Notches or laminations on pipe ends shall\nnot be repaired on pipe to be operated at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or\nmore. The damaged portion shall be removed as a cylinder and the pipe end\nrebeveled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.309\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
