  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.12 - Need methodology for acquisition of magnetic resonance imagers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nmethodology will be utilized to evaluate certificate of need applications, submitted by facilities other than general hospitals, involving the acquisition\nof magnetic resonance imagers (MRI). It is the intent of the State Hospital\n\nReview and Planning Council that this methodology, when used in conjunction\nwith the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decisionmaking tools for directing the\ndistribution of magnetic resonance imagers. The goals and objectives of the\nmethodology expressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate number of\nMRI units available to provide access to care and avoid the unnecessary\nduplication of resources. (b) The\nfactors and methodology for determining the public need for MRI units shall\ninclude, but not be limited to the following: (1)\n\nThe need for MRI units will be planned\nfor on a Health Systems Agency (HSA) region basis using a formula based on the\nnumber of CT scans performed in the region as follows: (i) The total CT scans performed in an HSA\nregion is reduced by 15 percent to account for patients that are not suitable\nfor MRI studies due to the presence of pacemakers and motion\nproblems. (ii)\n\nOf the remaining\nnumber of CT scans, 60 percent will be deemed to be studies of the central\nnervous system (CNS). (iii)\n55\npercent of the patients that receive CT scans of the CNS will be deemed to be\ncandidates for an MRI scan. (iv)\n\nThe resulting number is increased by 30 percent to account for MRI studies of\nareas other than the CNS. (v) Each\nMRI has an annual capacity for 3,200 scans. (vi)\n\nThe estimated number of MRI scans for\nthe HSA region is divided by 3,200 to determine the number of MRI units which\nare needed. (2)\n\nIn\naddition, each applicant applying to acquire an MRI unit must meet the\nfollowing standards: (i) Each applicant must\ndemonstrate the availability of appropriate equipment in the areas of computed\ntomography, ultrasound, angiography, conventional radiography and nuclear\nmedicine. (ii)\n\nEach applicant must\ndemonstrate the availability of neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedists, oncologists and radiologists who meet the definition of qualified\nspecialists. (iii)\n\nEach applicant\nmust submit a plan to develop referral agreements with all facilities in the\nrelevant service area. (3)\n\nWhen public need is established, priority\nconsideration will be given to applicants who agree to serve the medically\nindigent and patients regardless of source of payment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n709.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
