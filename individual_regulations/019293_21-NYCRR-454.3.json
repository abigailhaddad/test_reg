  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 454.3 - Liability, limitations and conditions of service\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authority will endeavor at all times to\nprovide a regular and uninterrupted supply of service, or such other character\nof service as specified in the application for electric service, the applicable\nservice tariff, or other contract documents, but in case the supply of service\nshall be interrupted, or irregular or defective or fail from interruptions or\nreductions as such terms are described in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this\nsection, or through ordinary negligence of employees, servants or agents, authority will not be liable therefor. (b) Continuity of electric service to be\nfurnished. (1)\n\nThe electric service, except as\notherwise specified in the application for electric service, the applicable\nservice tariff or other contract documents will be furnished continuously\nexcept: (i) for interruptions or reductions\ndue to uncontrollable forces, as defined in this section; (ii)\nfor temporary interruptions or\nreductions which, in the opinion of the authority, are required for power\nsystem protection or for providing temporary emergency assistance to\ninterconnecting systems; and\n(iii)\nfor temporary interruptions or reductions, which, in the opinion of authority, are necessary or desirable for the purpose of maintenance, repairs, replacements, installation of equipment, or investigation and inspection. Authority, except in case of emergency as determined by it, will give the customer reasonable advance notice of such temporary\ninterruptions or reductions and will exercise due diligence to remove the cause\nthereof. (2)\n\nThe\nauthority operates its generating and transmission facilities as a system and\nto the extent it determines feasible will utilize power and energy produced at\nany of its generating plants or purchased from others to satisfy its\nobligations to any of its customers. This provision shall not be construed to\nrequire the authority to utilize such power and energy referred to in the\npreceding sentence to avoid interruptions of service of the types referred to\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision unless the customer agrees to pay the\ndifference between the rate charged for the power and energy interrupted and\nthe rate charged by authority for the charges incurred by authority, including\nany transmission. (c) Uncontrollable forces. Neither customer nor authority shall be considered to be\nin default in respect to any obligation under any accepted application for\nelectric service, service tariff, or other contract document, if prevented from\nfulfilling such obligation by reason of uncontrollable forces, the term being\ndeemed to mean any cause beyond the control of the party affected, including\nbut not limited to failure of facilities, flood, earthquake, storm, lightning, fire, epidemic, war, riot, civil disturbance, strike and sabotage or restraint\nby court or public authority, which by exercise of due diligence and foresight\nsuch party could not reasonably have been expected to avoid. The party rendered\nunable to fulfill any obligation by reason of uncontrollable forces shall\nexercise due diligence to remove such inability with all reasonable\ndispatch. (d) Service beyond\nauthority obligation. Customer may from time to time, in the absence of\nobjection by authority, take power under any service tariff or other contract\ndocument at rates of power delivery greater than the contract demand in effect\nfor such service or take energy in amounts greater than the amounts which\nauthority is obligated to supply, but such greater takings shall not be deemed\nto establish in customer any right thereto and customer shall cease such\ngreater takings whenever and for the periods of time requested by\nauthority. (e) Transmission by\nauthority over the facilities of others. Where authority transmits power and\nenergy to customer over the facilities of others, the obligation of authority\nto furnish the power and energy shall be subject to and contingent on the\nexistence of an arrangement granting authority the right to use such\nfacilities. The power and energy will be provided at the voltage available and\nunder the conditions which exist from time to time on the system or systems\nover whose facilities the power and energy are transmitted. The points on the\ncustomer's system to which the power and energy are to be transmitted shall be\nagreed upon by customer and authority. Authority will endeavor to inform\ncustomer from to time to time of any significant changes contemplated on a\nsystem over which transmission is made if not authority's, and the added costs\nto customer resulting from such changes, but the costs of any changes made\nnecessary in customer's system because of changes or conditions on such system\nshall not be a charge against or a liability of authority, provided, that if\ncustomer, because of changes or conditions on a system over which transmission\nis made if not authority's, is subjected to the necessity of making changes on\nits system at its own expense in order to continue receiving service, or if the\nelectric service requirements of customer, to the extent that authority is\nobligated or determines that it can become obligated to furnish such\nrequirements, are not being met, or if authority advises customer that such\nrequirements cannot be met, because of an insufficiency of transmission\ncapacity available to authority under its transmission arrangement in the\nfacilities of others over which power and energy are supplied, then customer\nmay terminate service as provided in the applicable service tariff or other\ncontract documents. (f) Delivery and\nservice over the facilities of others. Where delivery of power and energy (as\ndistinguished from transmission) is carried out through the systems of others, the utility which makes delivery will receive the power and energy from the\nauthority at connecting points agreed upon by authority and the utility. The\nutility will use its system to make delivery in the same manner it uses such\nsystem to make delivery to its own customers. It will also provide service in\nconnection with such delivery as mutually agreed upon by the utility and the\nauthority. The obligation of authority to furnish power and energy shall be\nsubject to and contingent on the existence of an arrangement between authority\nand the utility. The power and energy will be provided to customer at the\nvoltage available and under the conditions which exist from time to time on the\nsystem from whose facilities the power and energy are delivered. Authority will\nendeavor to inform customer from time to time of any significant changes\ncontemplated on the system from which delivery is made, but the costs of any\nchanges made necessary in customer's system, because of changes or conditions\non that system, shall not be a charge against or a liability of authority. However, if changes are necessitated in the utility's system for the benefit of\nthe authority's customers, it will be done at the customer's expense or a\ncompensating increase in the rate charged by the utility for delivery, and\nservice will be made as provided for under the terms of authority's agreement\nwith the utility providing delivery and service. If customer, because of\nchanges or conditions in the system from which delivery is made, is subjected\nto the necessity of making changes in its facilities at its own expense in\norder to continue receiving delivery and service, or if the electric service\nrequirements of customer to the extent that authority is obligated, or\ndetermines that it can become obligated to furnish such requirements are not\nbeing met, or if authority advised customer that such requirements cannot be\nmet because of an insufficiency of system capacity of the utility providing\ndelivery and service to authority under its arrangement with the utility, then\ncustomer may terminate or obtain modification of its agreement with\nauthority. (g) Applicable laws, licenses and directives. All applicable provisions of licenses, permits, approvals or orders issued to the authority by any State or Federal agency and\nall applicable provisions of Federal and State statutes, including Federal\n\nPower Act, Atomic Energy Act, National Environmental Policy Act, Federal Water\n\nPollution Control Act and Power Authority Act of the State of New York (title 1\nof article 5 of the Public Authorities Law, chapter 772 of the Laws of 1931, all as amended shall be deemed to be incorporated in and made a part of this\n\nPart.
