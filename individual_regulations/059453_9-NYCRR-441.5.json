  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 441.5 - Alienation of park projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Project boundary map. (1)\n\nUpon completion of\na park project, the project sponsor shall submit a dated and signed project\nboundary map showing the location of the project and all related support\nfacilities acquired or developed pursuant to this Part. The map shall also\nindicate all structures, facilities and encroachments on the property which are\nused for non-park purposes, such as power lines, easements, school buildings or\nclubhouses. (2)\n\nIn cases where the\nproject is a discrete portion of the park, the project boundary map shall\ninclude as much of the park as would be required for the project to be operated\nby itself, including all support facilities such as roadways, parking lots, comfort stations and landscaping, except that utilities for the facility may be\nprovided from elsewhere in the park. (3)\n\nThe office shall review the proposed\nproject boundary map to determine its compliance with this section and any\nguidelines of the office and shall notify the project sponsor of its\ndetermination. The project boundary map shall define the public park facilities\nfor which State assistance was provided pursuant to this Subchapter. (b) Alienation mitigation. The act\nof the Legislature authorizing the alienation of facilities acquired or\ndeveloped by a municipality pursuant to this Part shall require the\nsubstitution of other lands and any other requirements which the commissioner\ndeems appropriate. (c) Substitute\nproperty. Substitute property must meet the following criteria to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner: (1)\nthe\nfair market value of the substitute property must be no less than the fair\nmarket value of the property being alienated; (2)\nthe substitute property must be of equal\nenvironmental value to the lands being alienated; (3)\nthe substitute property must provide\nrecreational resources and activities which are reasonably equivalent to those\non the property being alienated or meet demonstrated public recreation or open\nspace conservation needs; (4)\nthe\nlocation of the substitute property must be reasonably equivalent to the\nproperty being alienated, i.e., it must be accessible to the same people or a\ncomparable segment of the population; and\n(5)\nin cases where the project was for the\nacquisition of land, the substitute property may not be property which is\nalready owned by the project sponsor. (d) Leasing of State-funded facilities. The\nlease of facilities acquired or developed pursuant to this Subchapter is an\nalienation and requires the express authority of an act of the Legislature. However, substitution of other lands is not necessary if the lease provides for\nthe following: (1)\nthe leased premises must\nbe operated as a public park and/or recreational facility; that is, all\nprograms and activities must be offered to all members of the public on the\nsame terms and conditions which shall be subject to the approval of the\ncommissioner; (2)\nthe leased\npremises must be identified in signage, public records and publicity as a\npublic park and/or recreational facility; (3)\nat any time the facility ceases to be\noperated as a public park and/or recreational facility, the lease will\nterminate and the facility shall immediately revert to the project sponsor; and\n(4)\nall revenues received by\nthe project sponsor from the lease of the facility shall be used for the\nacquisition of other park facilities or capital improvements to municipal park\nand recreational facilities and shall not supplement monies otherwise\nappropriated. The project sponsor shall submit to the office certified copies\nof budget documents showing its anticipated expenditures for capital park\npurposes from all revenue sources with the use of the lease proceeds as a\nsegregated item. (e) Granting of an easement over project lands. If an act of the Legislature which\ngrants an easement over parkland requires that the lands continue to be used\nfor public park and recreation purposes, substitute property will not be\nrequired. (f) Review of alienation\nproposals by the office. (1)\n\nThe project\nsponsor shall submit to the office a proposal pertaining to the alienation of\nparklands receiving State assistance under this Part as early in the planning\nprocess as possible. (2)\n\nThe\nmaterial submitted shall include: (i) complete\nparkland alienation information required by the office; (ii)\na map showing the location of the\nparkland being alienated and the proposed substitute property; (iii)\nappraisals of both the property being\nalienated and the substitute property. The appraiser and the format of the\nappraisals shall be in accordance with section\n440.6\nof this\n\nTitle; (iv)\ndocumentation\nestablishing the project sponsor's compliance with the State Environmental\n\nQuality Review Act; (v) a complete\nsummary of public input supporting or opposing both the decision to alienate\nand the adequacy of the substitute property; and\n(vi)\nadditional material such as the proposed\ndeed for the substitute property, plans and drawings of developed or proposed\nfacilities or an archeological survey. (3)\n\nThe office will review the proposal and\nprovide its comments and recommendation to the project sponsor along with such\nadditional information as it deems relevant in sufficient time for the proposal\nto be considered by the Legislature at its next regular session. (g) Legislative approval. It shall\nbe the responsibility of the project sponsor to contact its legislative\nrepresentatives with regard to the introduction of legislation authorizing the\nalienation of parklands. The project sponsor shall give such legislative\nrepresentatives the comments and recommendations of the office. (h) Revised project boundary map. If the\nproject sponsor receives legislative approval for the alienation, it shall file\na revised project boundary map with the office showing the corrected boundaries\nof the project and including any substitute property. Upon approval of the\nalienation all restrictions and requirements pertaining to the project shall\napply to the substitute property. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
