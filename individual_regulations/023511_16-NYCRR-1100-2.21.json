Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.21 - Exhibit 20: Effect on Communications\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 20 shall contain: (a) A detailed description of the proposed\ntelecommunications interconnection, including all interconnecting facilities, line route, design details, size, functions, and operating\ncharacteristics. (b) For wind\nfacilities, an identification of all existing broadcast communication sources\nwithin a two (2)-mile radius of the facility and the electric interconnection\nbetween the facility and the point of interconnection, unless otherwise noted, including: (1)\nAM radio; (2)\nFM radio; (3)\n\nTelevision; (4)\n\nTelephone; (5)\n\nMicrowave transmission (all affected\nsources, not limited to a two-mile radius); (6)\n\nEmergency services; (7)\n\nMunicipal/school district\nservices; (8)\n\nPublic utility\nservices; (9)\n\nDoppler/weather radar\n(all affected sources, not limited to a two (2)-mile radius); (10)\n\nAir traffic control (all affected\nsources, not limited to a two (2)-mile radius); (11)\n\nArmed forces (all affected sources, not\nlimited to a two (2)-mile radius); (12)\n\nGlobal Positioning Systems (GPS); and\n(13)\n\nAmateur radio licenses\nregistered to users. (c) For solar and wind facilities, an identification of all existing underground\ncable and fiber optic major transmission telecommunication lines within a one\n(1)-mile radius of the facility and the electric interconnection between the\nfacility and the point of interconnection. (d) A statement describing the anticipated\neffects of the facility and the electric interconnection between the facility\nand the point of interconnection on the communications systems required to be\nidentified pursuant to subdivisions (b) and/or (c) of this section, including\nthe potential for: (1)\n\nFacility structures to\ninterfere with broadcast patterns by re-radiating the broadcasts in other\ndirections; (2)\n\nStructures to block\nnecessary lines-of-sight; (3)\n\nPhysical disturbance by construction activities; (4)\n\nAdverse impacts to co-located lines due\nto unintended bonding; and\n(5)\n\nAny\nother potential for interference. (e) An analysis demonstrating that there will\nbe sufficient capacity to support the requirements of the facility. (f) An evaluation of the design configuration\nof the facility and electric interconnection between the facility and the point\nof interconnection demonstrating that there shall be no adverse effects on the\ncommunications systems required to be identified pursuant to subdivisions (b)\nand/or (c) of this section. (g) A\ndescription of post-construction activities that shall be undertaken to\nidentify and mitigate any adverse effects on the communications systems\nrequired to be identified pursuant to subdivisions (b) and/or (c) of this\nsection that occur despite the design configuration of the proposed facility\nand electric interconnection between the facility and the point of\ninterconnection. (h) A description\nof the status of negotiations, or a copy of agreements that have been executed, with companies or individuals for providing the communications interconnection\nincluding any restrictions or conditions of approval placed on the facility\nimposed by the provider, and a description of how the interconnection and any\nnecessary system upgrades will be installed, owned, maintained and\nfunded.
