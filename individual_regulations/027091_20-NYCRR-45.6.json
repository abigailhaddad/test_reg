  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 45.6 - Installment and conditional sales\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Utilities frequently sell or lease\nmerchandise on installment, conditional sale and rental contracts which contain\na variety of different provisions. Some provide that when a certain number of\npayments have been made, the article sold or leased becomes the property of the\npurchaser or lessee and others provide that at any time during the life of the\ncontract the lessee has the option to purchase. Some rental contracts stipulate\nthat when the option is exercised, all rental payments shall be applied to the\npurchase price, and others condition that some percentage of the rental paid\nshall be so applied. It is understood that the utility on the accrual basis\naccrues and includes in gross income the total consideration of a pure\ninstallment sale and that practices differ with regard to the accounting\ntreatment given to the various forms of the conditional sale and rental\ncontracts. For purposes of accounting and reporting under this law, it is\nimmaterial whether the contract be a pure installment sale, some form of\nconditional sale, or rental contract. (b) A utility reporting on the accrual basis\nshall include in gross income the amounts accrued and included in gross income, according to the system of accounting employed. Where such practice is followed\na utility will be permitted to deduct sums not actually received on contracts\nwhich are cancelled where the merchandise is repossessed but not to exceed the\nremainder of the accrual. Such deductions will be permitted regardless of when\nthe contract was made. A utility reporting on the cash basis shall include in\ngross income all receipts from installment, conditional sales and rental\ncontracts regardless of when the contract was made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n45.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
