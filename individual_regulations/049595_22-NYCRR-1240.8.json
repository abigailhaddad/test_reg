Within 20 days after service of the answer or, if\napplicable, a reply, the Committee shall file with the Court a statement of\nfacts that identifies those allegations that the Committee contends are\nundisputed and those allegations that the party contends are disputed and for\nwhich a hearing is necessary. Within 20 days following submission by the\n\nCommittee, the respondent shall respond to the Committee's statement and, if\nappropriate, set forth respondent's statement of facts identifying those\nallegations that the respondent contends are undisputed and those allegations\nthat the respondent contends are disputed and for which a hearing is necessary. In the alternative, within 30 days after service of the answer or, if\napplicable, a reply, the parties may (i) file a joint statement advising the\n\nCourt that the pleadings raise no issue of fact requiring a hearing, or (ii)\nfile a joint stipulation of disputed and undisputed facts. (3)\n\nDisclosure Concerning\n\nDisputed Facts. Except as otherwise ordered by the Court, a party must, no\nlater than 14 days after filing a statement of facts with the Court as required\nby section\n1240.8\n(a)(2)\nof\nthese Rules, provide to any other party disclosure concerning the allegations\nthat the party contends are disputed. The disclosure shall identify the\nfollowing: (i) the name of\neach individual likely to have relevant and discoverable information that the\ndisclosing party may use to support or contest the disputed allegation and a\ngeneral description of the information likely possessed by that individual; and\n(ii)\na copy of\neach document that the disclosing party has in its possession or control that\nthe party may use to support or contest the allegation, unless copying such\ndocuments would be unduly burdensome or expensive, in which case the disclosing\nparty may provide a description of the documents by category and location, together with an opportunity to inspect and copy such documents. (4)\n\nSubpoenas. Upon\napplication by the Committee or the respondent, the Clerk of the Court may\nissue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of books and\npapers before Court or the referee designated by the Court to conduct a hearing\non the issues raised in the proceeding, at a time and place therein specified. When there is good cause to believe that a potential witness will be\nunavailable at the time of a hearing, the testimony of that witness may be\ninitiated and conducted, and used at the hearing, in a manner provided by\n\nArticle 31 of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules. (5)\n\nDiscipline by Consent. (i) At any time after the\nfiling of the petition with proof of service, the parties may file a joint\nmotion with the Court requesting the imposition of discipline by consent. The\njoint motion shall include: (A)\na stipulation of facts; (B)\nthe respondent's\nconditional admission of the acts of professional misconduct and the specific\nrules or standards of conduct violated; (C)\nany relevant aggravating and\nmitigating factors, including the respondent's prior disciplinary record; and\n(D)\nthe agreed\nupon discipline to be imposed, which may include monetary restitution\nauthorized by Judiciary Law § 90(6-a). (ii)\n\nWhen the proceeding includes allegations\nthat the respondent has willfully misappropriated or misapplied money or\nproperty in the practice of law, and the respondent has conditionally admitted\nfacts establishing that restitution is owed, the parties, in the joint motion, shall: (A)\nidentify the person or persons\nwhose money or property was willfully misappropriated or misapplied; (B)\nspecify the value of such money or\nproperty; and\n(C)\nstate that the\nrespondent has consented to the entry of an order requiring the respondent to\nmake monetary restitution pursuant to Judiciary Law §\n90(6-a). (iii)\n\nThe joint\nmotion shall be accompanied by an affidavit of the respondent acknowledging\nthat the respondent: (A)\nconditionally admits\nthe facts set forth in the stipulation of facts; (B)\nconsents to the agreed upon\ndiscipline; (C)\ngives the consent\nfreely and voluntarily without coercion or duress; and\n(D)\nis fully aware of the consequences of\nconsenting to such discipline. (iv)\n\nNotice of the joint motion, without its\nsupporting papers, shall be served upon the referee, if one has been appointed, and all proceedings shall be stayed pending the Court's determination of the\nmotion. If the motion is granted, the Court shall issue a decision imposing\ndiscipline upon the respondent based on the stipulated facts and as agreed upon\nin the joint motion. If the motion is denied, the conditional admissions shall\nbe deemed withdrawn and shall not be used against the respondent or the\n\nCommittee in the pending proceeding. (6)\n\nDiscipline on Default. In the event a respondent fails to file an answer within\nthe time period specified in these rules, the Committee may move the Court, on\nnotice to the respondent, for an order finding the respondent in default, deeming the material allegations of the petition admitted by the respondent, and granting any other relief provided by law and warranted under the\ncircumstances. (b) Disposition by Appellate Division. (1)\n\nHearing. Upon application\nof any party, or on its own motion, the Court may refer a formal disciplinary\nproceeding to a referee for a hearing on any issue that the Court deems\nappropriate. The referee may grant requests for additional disclosure as\njustice may require. Unless otherwise directed by the Court, the referee shall\ncomplete the hearing within 60 days following the date of the entry of the\norder of reference, and shall, following post-hearing submissions, file with\nthe Court a written report setting forth the referee's findings and\nrecommendations. Formal disciplinary charges may be sustained when the referee\nfinds, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, each essential element of the\ncharge. The parties may make such motions to affirm or disaffirm the referee's\nreport as permitted by the Court. (2)\n\nDiscipline. In presenting arguments\non the issue of appropriate discipline for misconduct, the parties may cite any\nrelevant factor, including but not limited to the nature of the misconduct, aggravating and mitigating circumstances, the parties' contentions regarding\nthe appropriate sanction under the American Bar Association's Standards for\n\nImposing Lawyer Sanctions, and applicable case law and precedent. Upon a\nfinding that any person covered by these Rules has committed professional\nmisconduct, the Court may impose discipline or take other action that is\nauthorized by law and, in the discretion of the Court, is appropriate to\nprotect the public, maintain the honor and integrity of the profession, or\ndeter others from committing similar misconduct. (c) Applications and Motions\nto the Appellate Division Unless otherwise specified by these Rules, applications and motions shall be made in accordance with the rules of the\n\nCourt in which the proceeding is pending.
