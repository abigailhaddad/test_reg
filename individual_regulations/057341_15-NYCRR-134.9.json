Tit. 15 § 134.9 - Conditional license\n\nState Regulations\nA conditional license will be issued only by the department\nwhich will establish the conditions applicable to each individual license based\nupon information submitted by the applicant. (a) Form of conditional license. The\nconditional license will be a two-part form. One part shall be computer\ngenerated and will bear a notation indicating that it is a conditional license. The other part will be manually generated and will contain the specific\nconditions applicable to that particular conditional license. The holder of a\nconditional license, when required to display such license, must display both\nparts of such license. (b) Establishment of conditions. Each conditional license shall contain the\ncondition that such license shall be subject to revocation for operation\noutside of the limitations appearing on such license. Each conditional license\nwill contain the limitations or use of such license as prescribed by the\ndepartment, and as accepted by the holder. Such conditions shall be limited to\noperation: to and from the holder's place of employment; during the course of\nemployment, when required; to and from a class or an activity which is an\nauthorized part of the rehabilitation program and at which the holder's\nattendance is required; enroute to and from a class or course at an accredited\nschool or approved institute of vocational or technical training; enroute to\nand from a medical examination or treatment as part of a necessary medical\ntreatment for such participant or member of his household, as evidenced by a\nwritten statement to that effect from a licensed medical practitioner; during a\nthree-hour consecutive daytime period as specified by the department on a day\nduring which the holder is not engaged in his usual employment or vocation; to\nand from court-ordered probation activities; to and from a motor vehicle office\nfor the transaction of business relating to such license or program; or enroute\nto and from a place, including a school, at which a child or children of the\nholder are cared for on a regular basis and which is necessary for the holder\nto maintain such holder's employment or enrollment at an accredited school, college or university or at a State-approved institution of vocational or\ntechnical training; (c) A\nconditional license issued to a person convicted of, or adjudicated a youthful\noffender for, a violation of any subdivision of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law or found to have violated section 1192-a of such\nlaw shall not be valid for the operation of commercial motor vehicles as\ndefined in section 501-a of such law or taxicabs as defined in section 148-a of\nsuch law. (d) Revocation of\nconditional license. (1)\nA conditional\nlicense which has been issued shall be revoked upon: the holder's conviction of\nany traffic violation, other than parking, stopping, standing, equipment, inspection or other nonmoving violations where such violation occurred during\nthe period of validity of the conditional license; or for the holder's failure\nto attend any portion or portions of the rehabilitation program in accordance\nwith attendance rules established for the program. A revocation for any of the\nabove reasons shall be issued without a hearing based upon receipt of a\ncertificate of conviction, or in the case of failure to attend any portion or\nportions of the rehabilitation program upon certification of the person\nadministering such program. In addition, the commissioner may revoke a\nconditional license after a hearing, based upon a finding that the holder has\nnot satisfactorily participated in the rehabilitation program, or that the\nholder is not attempting in good faith to accept rehabilitation, or upon a\ncomplaint that the holder is operating or has operated a motor vehicle in\nviolation of the conditions imposed on his conditional license. The\ncommissioner may also revoke a conditional license without a hearing upon\nreceipt of a certificate of conviction which indicates that the applicant has\ndriven in violation of the conditions of such license. (2)\n\nPersons under 21 years of age. The\nprovisions of this subdivision shall apply to any person under the age of 21\nwho enters a rehabilitation program and is issued a conditional license as a\nresult of a conviction for a violation of any subdivision of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, committed when such person was under the age of\n21. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Part, if any such person's\nconditional license is revoked and such person has completed a rehabilitation\nprogram as provided for in section\n134.10\nof this Part, time served\nshall be credited toward the remaining portion of the revocation period, calculated from the effective date of the order of revocation which resulted in\nthe issuance of the conditional license, to the date of the violation which\nresulted in the revocation of the conditional license. (e) Extra-territorial effect of conditional\nlicense. Whether a conditional license will be honored by other states will be\ndependent upon the laws of each such other state. This state will honor a\nsimilar type license issued by another state to a resident of the issuing state\nto the extent of the conditions imposed. The holder of a conditional license\nissued pursuant to article 31 should check with the appropriate motor vehicle\nauthorities of any other state in such other state. (f) Period of validity of conditional\nlicense. Unless otherwise revoked by the commissioner, a conditional license\nwill be valid from the date of its issuance until the expiration date contained\nthereon or until the holder's unconditional license is returned to him, whichever occurs first.
