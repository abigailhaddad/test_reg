(3)\n\nThe same number appearing on a buoy or\nmarket must appear in characters not less than three-fourths of an inch in\nheight, on all pots or traps identified by that buoy or marker. If the\nconstruction of a pot or trap does not allow it to be marked by branding, that\npot or trap must be marked by a tag or other device bearing, in clearly visible\nand legible characters, the same number appearing on a buoy or marker used to\nidentify that pot or trap.

If the pot or trap is constructed of nylon, polypropylene\nor any other synthetic fiber mesh netting placed over a frame, the escape panel\nmay be made by having a section of the mesh netting on the outside of the\nparlor section comprised of an untreated natural fiber which when rotted out or\ndeteriorated will leave an opening of at least the size specified in this\nsubdivision: (3)\n\nIt is unlawful to\ntake or possess any of the species listed in the following table, using fish\npots or traps, unless the minimum requirements for either circular vents, rectangular vents, or wire mesh listed in the corresponding row of the table\nare met as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision: Species\n\nCircular\nvents\n\nWire mesh\n\nNumber\n\nOpening\n\nNumber\n\nOpening\ndiameter\ndimensions\n\nBlack sea bass\n2\n21/2\"\n2\n13/8 \" x 53/4\" or 2\" x 2\"\nnot applicable\n\nScup\n1\n31/8\"\n1\n21/4\" x 21/4\"\nnot applicable\n\nTautog\n1\n31/8\"\nnot applicable\nnot applicable\n\nNorthern puffer\nnone required\nnone required\nnot applicable\n\nAmerican eels\nnot applicable\nnot applicable\n4\" x 4\" panel with 1\" x 1/2\" mesh\nall other fish\n1\n23/8\"\n1\n11/8 \" x 53/4\"\nnot applicable\n(f) Disturbance of unattended fish pots\nor traps.
