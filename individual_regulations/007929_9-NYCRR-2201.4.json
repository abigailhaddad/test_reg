  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2201.4 - Maximum base rents effective January 1, 1972\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nEffective January 1, 1972, the administrator shall establish new maximum rents\nfor housing accommodations subject to these regulations. Subject to the\nprovisions of section\n2201.6\nof this Part governing\ncollectibility, such new maximum rent for each housing accommodation shall be\nthe maximum base rent derived by apportioning the maximum gross building rental\ncomputed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section among the individual\nhousing accommodations in the property in accordance with subdivision (e) of\nthis section. (2)\n\nExcept as\notherwise provided, the application of this section shall be based upon the\nreports submitted pursuant to sections 2201.3 and\n2203.9\nof this Title, as modified\nor adjusted by the administrator. (3)\n\nThis section shall not apply to housing\naccommodations for which first rents were established pursuant to section\n2201.1\n(b), 2202.3\nor\n2202.22\nof this Title where the\nrehabilitation or improvement of substandard or deteriorated housing\naccommodations was financed under a governmental program providing assistance\nthrough loans, loan insurance or tax abatement, or has been undertaken under\nanother rehabilitation program no so financed but approved by the\nadministrator. (b) The\nmaximum gross building rental for a property is the sum of: (1)\nthe real estate taxes charged to the\nproperty on the records of the finance administrator for the fiscal year\n1971-72, after any abatement or reduction of tax so recorded; (2)\nthe water charges and sewer rents\nrecorded against the property by the finance administration for the calendar\nyear 1971, excluding any such rate or charges based on meter\nreadings; (3)\nan allowance for\noperating and maintenance expenses (to provide for the cost of fuel, utilities, payroll, maintenance, repairs, replacement reserves and miscellaneous charges)\ncomputed pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; (4)\nan allowance for vacancy and collection\nlosses in the amount of one percent of the maximum gross building\nrental; (5)\nan allowance for return\non capital value, to provide for debt service and return on equity, computed\npursuant to subdivision (d) of this section; provided, however, that where a property receives income\nfrom sources other than housing accommodations, the computation of the maximum\ngross building rental shall include only that part of the total real estate\ntaxes, water rates and sewer charges and allowance for return on capital value\nwhich bears the same proportion to the total of such items as the maximum gross\nbuilding rental bears to the sum of such rental plus the total income from the\nother souces, so that the maximum gross building rental shall be computed as\nfollows: MGBR =(MGBR x (RET + WS + RCV) + OM + VCL/MGBR +\nCI)\nwhere\nMGBR =Maximum gross building rental\nCI =Commercial income\nRET =Real estate taxes\nWS =Water charges and sewer rents\nRCV =Allowance for return on capital value\nOM =Allowance for operating and maintenance\nexpenses\nVCL =Allowance for vacancy and collection losses. (c) (1)\n\nFor purposes of computing the operating\nand maintenance expense allowance, a building shall be deemed to be a \"normal\npayroll building\" if the expenses for labor, including wages and fringe\nbenefits for all employees engaged in operation, maintenance and service of the\nbuilding, do not exceed $300 per year times the number of housing\naccommodations in the building. A building in which such expenses exceed such\namount shall be deemed to be a \"high payroll building.\"\n(2)\n\nThe allowance for operating and\nmaintenance expenses for a normal payroll building is the sum of the following\nfour items, multiplied by the number of housing accommodations in the building: $265.58\nplus $0.36 times the number of housing accommodations in\nthe building, plus $73.32 times the average number of rooms per housing\naccommodation in the building, plus $2.15 times the age factor for the building, as\ndefined in paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe allowance for operating and\nmaintenance expenses for a high payroll building is the sum of the following\nfive items, multiplied by the number of housing accommodations in the building: $315.11\nplus $0.09 times the number of housing accommodations in\nthe building, plus $128.31 times the average number of rooms per\nhousing accommodation in the building, plus $2.93 times the age factor for the building, as\ndefined in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, plus the amount by which the expenses for labor per\nhousing accommodation per year exceed $300. (4)\n\nAs used in this subdivision, the age\nfactor for a building is the number of years by which the year of the\ncompletion of construction of the building precedes 1967; provided that where\nthe completion of construction occurred prior to 1900, the age factor shall be\n67. For purposes of such calculation, construction means original construction, without regard to any subsequent rehabilitation or new certificate of\noccupancy. (d) The\nallowance for return on capital value shall be 8.5 percent of the equalized\nassessed value obtained by multiplying the assessed value of the property by\nthe 1971-1972 equalized ratio 1.754, as established by the New York State Board\nof Equalization and Assessment pursuant to article 12-A of the Real Property\n\nTax Law. (e) (1)\n\nFor purposes of apportioning the maximum\ngross building rental to individual housing accommodations, each housing\naccommodation is assigned a room index value based on the number of rooms\ntherein. A housing accommodation of one room is assigned a room index value of\n75, one of two rooms a value of 100, and one of more than two rooms a value of\n100 plus an additional 25 for each additional room beyond two. The term room\nhas, for purposes of this section, the same meaning as in section\n2201.3\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nWhere a property contains\nhousing accommodations which are not subject to control under these\nregulations, the portion of the maximum gross building rental attributable to\ncontrolled housing accommodations shall be a sum which bears the same\nproportion to the total as the sum of the room index values for all controlled\nhousing accommodations bears to the sum of the room index values for all\nhousing accommodations in the property, so that: where\nMGBR = Maximum gross building rental\nRIV =Sum of room index values (as defined above)\n(C) =Portion allocated to controlled housing\naccommodations\n(T) =Total. (3)\n\nThe room index values assigned to each\nhousing accommodation shall be adjusted for floor location. In a building\nwithout an elevator, the value computed in accordance with paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall be reduced by two percent for each floor above the\nmiddle floor, and increased by two percent for each floor below the middle\nfloor. In a building with one or more elevators, the value shall be increased\nby one percent for each floor above the middle floor and reduced by one percent\nfor each floor below the middle floor. As used in this paragraph, the middle\nfloor is, in a building with an odd number of floors, the floor midway between\nthe top and bottom floors, and in a building with an even number of floors, the\nmidpoint between two floors so located that is has an equal number of floors\nabove and below it. (4)\n\nThe maximum\nbase rent for each housing accommodation is that sum which bears the same\nproportion to the maximum gross building rental (or so much thereof as is\nattributable to controlled housing accommodations) as the room index value of\nthe housing accommodations, adjusted for floor location, bears to the total of\nsuch adjusted values for all controlled housing accommodations in the property, so that: MBR = MGBR x(R(F)/Total R(F))\n\nWhere MBR =Maximum base rent (for an individual housing\naccommodation)\nMGBR =Maximum gross building rental (as adjusted, if\nnecessary, pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision\nR(F) =Room index value, adjusted for floor located, of\nthe individual housing accommodation\n\nTotal R(F) =Sum of room index values, adjusted for floor\nlocation. (5)\n\nThe\nadministrator may make an appropriate adjustment to the maximum base rent for\nany housing accommodation with respect to which the landlord pays for gas or\nelectricity or both. (f) Except as otherwise provided, the term housing accommodation,as used in this\nsection, refers to every housing accommodation in a property, whether or not it\nis subject to or exempt from control under these regulations.
