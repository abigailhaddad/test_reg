Tit. 21 § 8.4 - Requirements for reinstatement after removal from register\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person removed from the \"deep-sea\"\nlongshoremen's register pursuant to article IX and section 5-c of the act and\nthis Part may seek registration upon fulfilling the same requirements as for\ninitial inclusion in such register, provided applications for registration are\nthen being accepted by the commission pursuant to section 5-p of the act and\nprovided further that at least one year has expired from the date of removal, except that immediate reinstatement shall be made upon a proper showing that\nthe registrant's failure to work or apply for work the minimum number of days\nrequired by this Part was caused by the fact that the registrant was engaged in\nthe military service of the United States or was incapacitated by ill health, physical injury, or other good cause. The registration of any person who, because of incapacitation by ill health or physical injury, failed to work or\nto apply for work the minimum number of days required by this Part shall be\nadministratively withdrawn during the pendency of such incapacitation. Upon\nrequest, immediate reinstatement shall be made upon a proper showing that: (1)\nthe registrant is no longer\nincapacitated; and\n(2)\nsuch request\nfor reinstatement is no more than one year after registrant's period of\nincapacitation. In the event such failure to work or apply for work the\nminimum number of days required by this Part was caused by the fact that the\nregistrant was incarcerated, such registrant may be reinstated provided he\napplies for such reinstatement within one year after the termination of such\nincarceration. Any reinstatement under this section shall not preclude a\nproceeding to revoke, cancel or suspend the registration of any such person\nreinstated to the register nor the temporary suspension of such registration\nunder the provisions of article XI of the act. (b) No petition for reinstatement shall be\naccepted from any person seeking reinstatement unless the person is sponsored\nfor employment by a \"stevedore\" or by any \"person\", within the meaning of those\nterms contained in the act, who is an employer of individuals requiring a\nregistration or a license under the act and where proof of sponsorship has been\nreceived by the commission, prior to submission to the commission of said\npetition, in the form of a letter submitted by the sponsoring\nemployer. (c) Any person removed\nfrom the \"A\" register may seek registration upon fulfilling the same\nrequirements as for initial inclusion in such register except that where\nreinstatement is sought within one year of removal from the said \"A\" register, the commission may, in its discretion, waive said\nrequirements.
