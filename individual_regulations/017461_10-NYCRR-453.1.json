  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 453.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The listing of\nmandatory reporting levels that follows is a system of aggregating accounting\ninformation for the purposes of uniform reporting mandated in this Article. Definitions for the mandatory reporting levels are contained within the listing\nfor all items other than the functional reporting centers which are\nspecifically addressed in Part 455 of this Article. The names of all such\nfunctional reporting centers are included in the listing and are designated\nwith an asterisk (*). (b) The\nlisting of mandatory reporting levels is not required to be formally adopted as\na residential health care facility's chart of accounts. However, such levels\nare mandated nonetheless, and the crosswalk between a facility's chart of\naccounts and the mandated levels must be considered a permanent part of the\nfacility's records and must contain sufficient audit trails to demonstrate the\nreliability of the information. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n453.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
