  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 82.3 - Adjustments to rate, payment, balance or term\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept for such further limitations on adjustment (i.e., \"ceilings\", \"floors\" or \"initial documents\") as may be set forth in the loan\ncontract: (a) Adjustments to the\ninterest rate shall correspond directly to the movement of an interest rate\nindex or an index that measures the rate of inflation, which index is readily\navailable to and verifiable by the borrower and is beyond the control of the\nlender; provided that a lender may decrease the interest rate at any time, and\nprovided further, that interest rate adjustments may be rounded to the nearest\nfraction of a percentage point when so stated in the contract. A lender may\nalso increase the interest rate pursuant to a formula or schedule that\nspecifies the amount of the increase, the time at which it may be made, and\nwhich is set forth in the loan contract. (b) Adjustments to the monthly payment and\nloan balance may be made to reflect interest rate adjustments and, in the case\nof a payment adjustment, where the adjustment reflects change in the loan\nbalance or is made pursuant to a formula or a schedule specifying the\npercentage or dollar change in the payment, as set forth in the\ncontract. (c) Any combination of\nindices or a moving average of index values may be used as an index, but a\nlender may not change or reserve the right to change the index or indices\nspecified in the loan contract unless the initial index or indices specified\nbecome(s) unavailable during the term of the loan. (d) The loan term may be adjusted only to\nreflect a change in the interest rate, the payment or the loan\nbalance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n82.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
