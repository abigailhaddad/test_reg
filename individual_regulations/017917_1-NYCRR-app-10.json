FLOW-DIVERSION DEVICE--PROPER ASSEMBLY AND\nFUNCTION\nReference.--Item 16p(A). Application.--To all flow-diversion devices used with\ncontinuous-flow pasteurizers. Frequency.--Upon installation and at least once each 3 months\nthereafter. Criteria.--The flow-diversion device shall function correctly\nin operating situations and shall de-energize the metering pump in the event of\nmalfunction or incorrect assembly. 1. LEAKAGE PAST VALVE SEAT(S)\n\nApparatus.--Suitable tools for disassembly of flow-diversion\ndevice and sanitary piping. Method. --Observe the valve seat(s) of the flow-diversion\ndevice for leakage. Procedure.--With the system operating with water, place the\nflow- diversion device in diverted-flow position. Disconnect the forward flow\npiping; observe the valve seat for leakage. Check leak escape ports to see if\nthey are open. Corrective Action.--If leakage is noted, device must be\ndismantled and defective gaskets replaced or other suitable repairs\nmade. 2. OPERATION OF VALVE STEM(S)\n\nApparatus.--Suitable tools for disassembly of flow-diversion\ndevice and sanitary piping. Method. --Observe flow-diversion device stem(s) for ease of\nmovement. Procedures. --When a stem packing nut is used, tighten stem\npacking nut as much as possible. Operate system; place device in forward and\ndiverted flow several times. Note freedom of action of valve system. Corrective Action. --If valve action is sluggish, suitable\nadjustment or repair shall be made to permit stem to act freely in all\npositions, with packing nut, when used, fully tightened. 3. DEVICE ASSEMBLY, SINGLE STEM DEVICE. Apparatus.--Sanitary fitting wrench. Method.--Observe function of metering pump when flow-diversion\ndevice is improperly assembled. Procedures.--\na. With HTST system in operation, unscrew by one-half turn, the\n13H hex nut which holds the top of the valve to the valve body. This should\nde-energize the metering pump. This test should be run with no piping connected\nto the forward flow port of the device since there can be sufficient force from\nthe piping to keep the forward flow port tightly clamped even though the hex\nnut is loosened. b. With the HTST system in operation and the flow-diversion\ndevice in the diverted position, remove the connecting key located at the base\nof the valve stem. The metering pomp should be de-energized. Corrective action.--If metering pump fails to respond as\nindicated, immediate checks of the device assembly and wiring are required to\nlocate and correct the cause. 4. DEVICE ASSEMBLY, DUAL STEM DEVICE. Apparatus.--None. Method.--Observe function of metering pump when flow-diversion\ndevice is improperly assembled. Procedures. --\na. With the device in diverted flow position, remove one\nactuator clamp. b. Move the device to the forward-flow position and disconnect\nstem from actuator. c. Move the device to the diverted-flow position and turn on\nthe metering pump. The metering pump should not run. d. Reassemble the device by moving it to the forward-flow\nposition and reconnecting the stem to the actuator. e. Move the device to the diverted-flow position and replace\nthe actuator clamp. f. Repeat the procedure for the other actuator. Corrective action. --If metering pump fails to respond as\nindicated, an immediate check of the device assembly and wiring are required to\nlocate and correct the cause. 5. MANUAL DIVERSION (when booster pump is installed in the HTST\nsystem). Apparatus.--None. Method.--Observe the response of the system to manual\ndiversion. Procedure.--With the HTST system in operation and the\nflow-diversion device in the forward-flow position, press the manual diversion\nbutton located on the valve bonnet cover plate. This should (a) cause the valve\nto assume the divert position, and (b) de-energize the booster pump; the\npressure differential between raw and pasteurized product in the regenerator\nshould be maintained. Corrective Action. --If (a) and (b) above do not occur as\ndescribed or the necessary pressure differential between raw and pasteurized\nproduct is not maintained, the assembly and wiring of the HTST system must be\nimmediately reviewed and the indicated deficiencies corrected. 6. RESPONSE TIME. Apparatus.--Stopwatch. The stopwatch should be used to\ndetermine that the response time interval does not exceed 1 second. Method.--Determine the elapsed time between the instant of the\nactivation of the control mechanism at cut-out temperature on declining\ntemperature and the instant the flow-diversion device takes the fully\ndiverted-flow position. Procedure.--\na. With water or oil bath at a temperature above cut-out\ntemperature, allow the water or oil to cool gradually. At the moment the\ncut-out mechanism is activated, start the watch and the moment the flow-\ndiversion device takes the fully diverted position, stop the watch. b. Record results. Corrective Action. --Should response time exceed 1 second, immediate corrective action must be taken. 7. TIME DELAY INTERLOCK WITH METERING PUMP. Application. --To dual stem flow-diversion devices with a\nmanual forward-flow switch. Apparatus.--None. Method.--Determine that the device does not assume a manually\ninduced forward-flow position while the metering pump is running. Procedures.--With the system running in forward flow, move the\ncontrol switch to the \"Inspect\" position and observe that the following events\nautomatically occur in sequence: a. The device immediately moves to the diverted-flow position\nand the metering pump is turned off. b. The device remains in the diverted-flow position while the\nmetering pump is running down. c. After the metering pump stops turning, the device assumes\nthe forward-flow position. d. Repeat the above procedure by moving the control switch to\nthe cleaned-in-place (CIP) position. e. Record test results and seal the control enclosure. Corrective action. --If the above sequence of events does not\noccur, either a timer adjustment or wiring change is required. TEST 6. INDICATING THERMOMETERS ON PIPELINES--THERMOMETRIC\nRESPONSE\nReference.--Item 16p(A). Application.--To all indicating thermometers located on\npipelines and used for determination of product temperatures during\npasteurization. Frequency.--Upon installation and once each 3 months\nthereafter. Criteria.--Four seconds under specified conditions. Apparatus.--Pipeline test thermometer, stopwatch, water bath\n(10- gallon can), agitator, heat supply, and indicating thermometer from\npasteurizer. Method.--By measuring the time required for the reading of the\nthermometer being tested to increase 12° F (7° C) through a specified\ntemperature range (temperature range must include pasteurization temperature). The temperature used in the water bath will depend upon the scale range of the\nthermometer to be tested. Procedure.--\n1. Immerse indicating thermometer in water bath heated to a\ntemperature at least 19° F (11° C) higher than minimum scale reading on\nindicating thermometer. Bath temperature should be higher than maximum\npasteurization temperature for which thermometer is used. 2. Immerse indicating thermometer in bucket of cold water for\nseveral seconds to cool it. Note.--Continuous agitation of water baths during the\nperformance of steps 3., 4., and 5. is required. Elapsed time between end of\nstep 1. and beginning of step 3. should not exceed 15 seconds so hot water bath\ndoes not cool significantly. 3. Insert indicating thermometer in hot water bath to proper\nbulb immersion depth. 4. Start stopwatch when indicating thermometer reads 19° F (11°\nC) below bath temperature. 5. Stop stopwatch when indicating thermometer reads 7° F (4° C)\nbelow bath temperature. 6. Record thermometric response time for office record. Example. --On a thermometer with a range of 150° F to 175° F\n(66° C to 80° C) used at a pasteurization temperature of 161° F and 166° F (72°\nC and 75° C), a water bath of 170° F (77° C) could be used. 19° F (11° C) below\n170° F (77° C) would be 151° F (66° C); 7° F (4° C) below 170° F (77° C) would\nbe 163° F (73° C). Hence after immersing the thermometer, which had been\npreviously cooled, in the 170° F (77° C) bath, the stopwatch is started when\nthe thermometer reads 151° F (66° C) and stopped when it reads 163° F (73°\nC). Note.--The test included the pasteurization temperature of 161°\nF (72° C) and 166° F (75° C). Corrective Action.--If the response time should exceed 4\nseconds, the thermometer should be replaced or returned for repair. TEST 7. RECORDER/CONTROLLER--THERMOMETRIC RESPONSE\nReference.--Item 16p(A). Application.--To all recorder/controllers used in connection\nwith continuous flow pasteurizers. Frequency.--Upon installation and at least once each 3 months\nthereafter. Criteria.--Five seconds, under specified conditions. Apparatus.--Previously tested indicating thermometer (on\npasteurizers), stopwatch, water bath (10-gallon milk can), agitator, heat\nsupply. Method.--Measure the time interval between the instant when the\nrecording thermometer reads 12° F (7° C) below the cut-in temperature and the\nmoment of cut-in by the controller. This measurement is made when the sensing\nelement is immersed in a rapidly agitated water bath maintained at exactly 7° F\n(4° C) above the cut-in temperature. Procedure.--\n1. Check and, if necessary, adjust the pen-arm setting of the\nrecording thermometer in the proper reference arc to agree with the indicating\nthermometer reading at pasteurization temperature. 2. Determine the cut-in temperature of controller (Test No. 8), either while in normal operation or by using a water bath. 3. Remove sensing element and allow to cool to room\ntemperature. 4. Heat water bath to exactly 7° F (4° C) above the cut-in\ntemperature while vigorously agitating bath to insure uniform\ntemperature. 5. Immerse recorder/controller bulb in water bath. Continue\nagitation during items 6. and 7. below. 6. Start stopwatch when the recording thermometer reaches a\ntemperature of 12° F (7° C) below the cut-in temperature. 7. Stop stopwatch when the controller cuts in. 8. Record thermometric response time for office record. Corrective Action.--If the response should exceed 5 seconds, the recorder/controller should be repaired. TEST 8. PRODUCT-FLOW CONTROLS--PRODUCT TEMPERATURES AT CUT-IN\nAND CUT-OUT\nReferences.--Items 16p(A), 16p(C)\n\nProduct--flow controls shall be tested for product temperature\nat cut-in and cut-out by one of the following applicable tests at the frequency\nprescribed: Application. --All recorder/controllers used in connection with\nHTST pasteurizers. Frequency.--Upon installation and quarterly by the regulatory\nagency; daily by the plant operator. Criteria.--No forward flow until pasteurization temperature has\nbeen reached. Flow diverted before temperature drops below minimum\npasteurization temperature. Apparatus.--No supplemental materials needed. Method.--By observing the actual temperature of the indicating\nthermometer at the instant forward flow starts (cut-in) and stops (cut-\nout). Procedure.--\n1. Cut-in temperature. a. While the product or water is completely flooding the\nsensing element of the recorder/controller and the indicating thermometer, increase the heat gradually so as to raise the temperature of the water or\nproduct at a rate not exceeding 1° F (0.5° C) every 30 seconds. b. Observe the indicating thermometer reading at the moment the\nforward flow starts (i.e., flow-diversion device moves). Observe that the\nfrequency pen reading is synchronized with the recording pen on the same\nreference arc. c. Record the indicating thermometer reading on the recorder\nchart; inscribe initials. The regulatory agency shall record test\nfindings. 2. Cut-out temperature. a. After the cut-in temperature has been determined and while\nthe product or water is above the cut-in temperature, allow the water to cool\nslowly at a rate not exceeding 1° F (0.5° C) per 30 seconds. Observe indicating\nthermometer reading at the instant forward flow stops. b. Record the indicating thermometer reading on the recorder\nchart. Corrective Action.--Should the reading be below the minimum\npasteurization temperature, the cut-in and cut-out mechanism and/or the\ndifferential temperature mechanism should be adjusted to obtain proper cut- in\nand cut-out temperatures by repeated tests. When compliance is achieved, seal\nthe controller mechanism. TEST 9. SETTING OF CONTROL SWITCHES--REGENERATOR\nPRESSURE\nReference.--Item 16p(B). 1. PRESSURE SWITCHES.--Used to control operation of booster\npumps. Application.--To all pressure switches controlling the\noperation of booster pumps on HTST pasteurizer systems employing\nregenerators. Frequency. --Upon installation, each 3 months thereafter, after\nany change in the booster pump or the switch circuit, and/or whenever the\npressure switch seal is broken. Criteria.--The pump shall not operate unless there is at least\na 1-pound pressure differential on the pasteurized product side of the\nregenerator. Apparatus. --Sanitary pressure gauge and pneumatic testing\ndevice, for checking and adjusting pressure switch settings. A simple inexpensive pneumatic testing device may be made from\na discarded 2inch-7BX sanitary tee, with two additional 13H nuts, one of which\nis provided with a 16A cap, drilled and tapped for a 1/2-inch galvanized iron\nnipple for the air connection. A hose connection is made to a compressed air\nsource in the plant by means of a snap-on fitting. The air pressure can be\ncontrolled by an inexpensive pressure reducing valve (range 0-60 psig) followed\nby a 1/2-inch globe-type bleeder valve connected into the side outlet of a\n1/2-inch tee installed between the pressure reducing valve and the testing\ndevice. The pressure switch so be tested is disconnected from the pasteurizer\nand connected to another of the outlets of the sanitary tee, and the pressure\ngauge is connected to the third outlet of the sanitary tee. By careful\nmanipulation of the air pressure reducing valve and the air bleeder valve, the\nair pressure in the testing device may be regulated slowly and precisely. (In\noperating the device, care should be taken to avoid exposing the pressure\nswitch and the sanitary pressure gauge to excessive pressure which might damage\nthem. This can be done by first closing off the air pressure regulating valve\nand opening fully the bleeder valve; these may then be manipulated slowly to\nbring the air pressure in the testing device within the desired range.) A test\nlight of proper voltage can be placed in series with the pressure switch\ncontact and in parallel with the electrical load (booster pump starter) so the\nactuation point may be readily determined. Method. --Check and make adjustment of pressure switch so as to\nprevent the operation of the booster pump unless the pressure on the\npasteurized product side of the regenerator is greater by at least 1 psi than\nany pressure that may be generated on the raw side. Procedure.--\na. Determine maximum pressure of booster pump. (1) Install sanitary pressure gauge in tee at discharge of\nbooster pump. (2) Operate the pasteurizer with water, with the flow-diversion\ndevice in forward-flow position, the metering pump operating at minimum speed\npossible, and the booster pump operating at its rated speed. If vacuum\nequipment is located between the raw outlet from the regenerator and the\nmetering pump, it should be bypassed while this determination is made. (3) Note maximum pressure indicated by pressure gauge under\nthese conditions. b. Check and set the pressure switch. (1) Install a sanitary pressure gauge of known accuracy on the\npneumatic testing device to which the pressure switch sensing element should\nalso be connected. (2) Remove the seal and cover to expose adjustment mechanism on\npressure switch. (3) Operate the testing device and determine the pressure gauge\nreading at the cut-in point of the pressure switch which will light the test\nlamp. (If the switch is short circuited, the lamp will be lighted before air\npressure is applied.)\n(4) The cut-in point should be adjusted, if necessary, so as to\noccur at a pressure gauge reading at least 1 psi greater than the maximum\nbooster pump operating pressure, as determined under a. preceding. Where\nadjustment is necessary, refer to manufacturer's instructions for adjusting\nprocedure. After adjustment, recheck actuation point and readjust if\nnecessary. (5) Replace cover and seal the pressure switch and restore\nsensing element to original location. (6) Record test results for the office record. 2. TIME-DELAY SWITCHES.--Used to control operation of booster\npumps. Application.--To all time-delay switches controlling operation\nof booster pumps. Frequency.--Upon installation, after any change in the pump or\nrelay circuit and whenever seal is broken. Criteria.--The booster pump shall not operate until the\npasteurized product has achieved a pressure at least 1 pound greater than the\nmaximum pressure developed by the booster pump. Apparatus. --Accurate stopwatch, graduated at intervals not to\nexceed 0.2 of 1 second, pressure gauge or manometer. Method.--Reference: Dashiell, W. N., Use of Time Delay Relay To\n\nControl Booster Pump Operation. Journal of Milk and Food Technology, 21:7. July\n1958. Procedure.--\na. Operate pasteurizers with water with the flow-diversion\ndevice in forward-flow position, metering pump operating at minimum speed, booster pump at rated speed. Vacuum equipment not operating or bypassed. b. Determine the maximum pressure developed at the discharge of\nthe booster pump. Following the determination of the height of the liquid\nlevel, add at least 3 feet to provide the 1 pound pressure differential\nequivalent of 0.7 feet of water column to compensate for difference in the\nspecific gravity between water at 161° F (72° C) and raw product at 40° F (5°\nC). The pasteurized liquid level must rise to the computed elevation, above the\noutlet level of the booster pump and be vented to the atmosphere at this or\nhigher level. c. Time the interval from the moment the forward flow is\nestablished until the pasteurized liquid level rises to the required elevation. The time measurement shall be made at the beginning of a run when no water is\nin the pasteurized product line. The booster pump shall not be\noperating. d. The time-delay relay shall be installed in the circuit, interlocked with the metering pump, forward-flow of the flow-diversion device\nand the booster pump. Adjust the time-delay setting to provide the time\ninterval. Check the setting several times. Seal the time-delay relay. e. Record for permanent office record. Corrective Action.--Adjust pasteurized product pipe to proper\nelevation. If time-delay relay is not accurate, return for repair. 3. PRESSURE GAUGES. --Used with booster pump operations. Application.--To all required pressure gauges used to measure\nrelative raw product and pasteurized product pressure in HTST\nregenerators. Frequency. --Upon installation, each 3 months thereafter, and\nwhenever the gauges are adjusted or repaired. Criteria. --Required pressure gauges shall be accurate. Apparatus. --Identical testing device used to check proper\noperation of pressure switch (Test 9, 1). A pressure gauge of known accuracy is connected to one outlet\nof the test apparatus. The gauge being checked is connected to the second\noutlet of the sanitary tee. Air is bled into the system through the third\noutlet and comparative readings made. Record test results for office\nrecord. Corrective Action. --Inaccurate gauges should be returned to\nthe factory for repair. It is not recommended that the plant operator attempt\nthe adjustment of pressure gauges. 4. DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE CONTROLLER\nApplication.--To all differential pressure controllers used to\ncontrol operation of booster pumps on HTST systems. Frequency. --Upon installation, each 3 months thereafter, and\nwhenever the differential pressure controller is adjusted or repaired. Criteria. --The booster pump shall not operate unless the\nproduct pressure in the pasteurized side of the regenerator is at least 1 psi\ngreater than the product pressure in the raw side of the regenerator. Apparatus.--A sanitary pressure gauge and a pneumatic testing\ndevice described under PRESSURE SWITCHES (Test 9,1) above can be used for\nchecking and adjusting the differential pressure switch setting. Method. --The differential pressure switch is checked and\nadjusted to prevent operation of the booster pump, or prevent forward flow, unless the product pressure in the pasteurized side of the regenerator is at\nleast 1 psi greater than the pressure in the raw side of the\nregenerator. Procedures.--\na. Loosen the process connection at both pressure sensors and\nwait for any liquid to drain through the loose connections. Both pointers\nshould be within 0.5 psi of 0 psig. If not, adjust pointer(s) to read 0 pounds\npsig. b. Remove both sensors from the process and mount them in a\ntee, either at the discharge of the booster pump, or connected to the pneumatic\ntesting device. Note the separation between the two pointers. The change in\nelevations of the sensors will have caused some change in the zero readings. Turn on the booster pump switch and depress the test push button to operate the\nbooster pump. If the pneumatic testing device is used in lieu of the booster\npump, adjust air pressure to the normal operating pressure of the booster pump. Note that the pointer separation is within 1 psi of that observed before\npressure was applied. If not, the instrument requires adjustment or\nrepair. c. Return the pressure sensors to their normal process\nlocations and turn off the booster pump switch. Manually move and hold the\nwhite pointer (raw side of the regenerator) at the normal operating pressure of\nthe booster pump. Press the test push button while manually moving the orange\npointer (pasteurized side of the regenerator) upscale until the pilot light\nturns on, then slowly move the orange pointer downscale until the pilot light\nturns off. The pilot light should not turn on until the orange pointer is at\nleast 2 psi higher than the white pointer, and the pilot light should turn off\nwhen the orange pointer is no less than 2 psi higher than the white pointer. If\nnecessary, adjust the differential setting. The 2 psi differential represents\nthe sum of the 1 psi differential required between raw and pasteurized product\nin the regenerator, plus the 1 psi imprecision permitted between the two\npressure sensors. d.

Application. --To all HTST pasteurizers employing a holding\ntime of 15 seconds or longer. Frequency. --Upon installation and semiannually thereafter, whenever seal on speed setting is broken; any alteration is made affecting the\nholding time, the velocity of the flow (such as, replacement of pump, motor, belt, drive or driven pulleys, or decrease in number of HTST plates) or the\ncapacity of holding tube; or whenever a check of the capacity indicates a\nspeedup. Criteria.--Every particle of product shall be held for at least\n15 seconds in both the forward- and diverted-flow positions. Apparatus.--Electrical conductivity measuring device, Appendix\n10(I), capable of detecting change in conductivity, equipped with standard\nelectrodes; table salt (sodium chloride), 50 ml. syringe; stopwatch; suitable\ncontainer for salt solution. Method.--The holding time is determined by timing the interval\nfor an added trace substance to pass through the holder. Although the time\ninterval of the fastest particle of product is desired, the conductivity test\nis made with water. The results found with water are converted to the product\nflow time by formulation since a pump may not deliver the same amount of\nproduct as it does water. Procedure.--\n1. Examine the entire system to insure that all flow promoting\nequipment is operating at maximum capacity and all flow impeding equipment is\nso adjusted or bypassed as to provide the minimum of resistance to the flow. There shall be no leakage on the suction side of the timing pump. 2. Adjust variable speed pump to its maximum capacity\n(preferably with a new belt and full size impellers). Check homogenizers for\nseals and/or gears or pulley identification. 3. Install one electrode at the inlet to the holder and the\nother electrode in the holder outlet. Close the circuit to the electrode\nlocated at the inlet to the holder. 4. Operate the pasteurizer using water at pasteurization\ntemperature, with flow-diversion device in forward-flow position. 5. Quickly inject 50 ml. of saturated sodium chloride solution\ninto the holder inlet. 6. Start the stopwatch with the first movement of the indicator\nof a change in conductivity. Open the circuit to the inlet electrode and close\nthe circuit to the electrode at the outlet of the holder. 7. Stop the stopwatch with the first movement of the indicator\nof a change in conductivity. 8. Record results. 9. Repeat the test six or more times, until six successive\nresults are within 0.5 seconds of each other. The average of these six tests is\nthe holding time for water in forward flow. When consistent readings cannot be\nobtained, purge the equipment, check instruments and connections, and check for\nair leakage on suction side. Repeat tests. Should consistent readings not be\nobtained, use the fastest time as the holding time for water. 10. Repeat steps 4. through 9. for testing time on water in\ndiverted flow. 11. With the pump at the same speed and equipment adjusted as\nin 1. above, time the filling of a 10-gallon can with a measured weight of\nwater using the discharge outlet with the same head pressure as in normal\noperation. Average the time of several trials. (Since flow rates of the large\ncapacity units make it very difficult to check by filling a 10-gallon can, it\nis suggested that a calibrated tank of considerable size be used.)\n12. Repeat procedure 11. using milk. 13. Compute the holding time for milk from the following\nformula by weight, using the average specific gravity. Compute separately for\nforward flow and diverted flow. Holding time for milk=(1.032(TMw)/Ww)(by weight), in\nwhich--\n1.032 = specific gravity for milk; T = average holding time for water; Mw = average time required to deliver a measured weight of\nmilk. Ww = average time required to deliver an equal weight of\nwater. 14. Record results for office record. Corrective Action.--When the computed holding time for milk is\nless than that required either in forward flow or diverted flow, the speed of\nthe timing pump shall be reduced or adjustment made in the holding tube, and\nthe timing test repeated until satisfactory holding time is achieved. Should an\norifice be used to correct the holding time in diverted flow, there should be\nno excessive pressure exerted on the underside of the valve seat of the\nflow-diversion device. Governors shall be sealed on motors that do not provide\na constant speed as provided in Item 16p(A), section\n3.25\n(b)(6)(ii)\nof\nthis Title. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
