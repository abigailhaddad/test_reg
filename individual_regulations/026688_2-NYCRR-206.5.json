A copy of all such eligible contracts and eligible contract amendments\nshall be retained on file with the Office of the State Comptroller. Such\nsubmission should be made in such form and manner as may be prescribed by the\n\nComptroller. The Comptroller also reserves the right to request submission of\nadditional materials that are relevant to the Comptroller's review and\napproval. (b) For each eligible\ncontract or eligible contract amendment described in a written notice issued\npursuant to section\n206.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, the State authority shall include a certification in the procurement\nrecord that it has undertaken an affirmative review of the responsibility of\nthe contractor and significant subcontractors known at the time of the contract\naward. Such review shall be designed to provide reasonable assurances that the\ncontractor and significant subcontractors are responsible and shall be\ndocumented in the procurement record. For purposes of this paragraph, a\nsubcontractor shall be deemed to be significant if: (1)\nthe subcontractor's qualifications are a\nmaterial factor in the award; or\n(2)\nthe value of the subcontract will equal\nor exceed an amount as the Comptroller may from time-to-time determine, to be\nreasonable. (c) Where\nthe Comptroller has provided written notice pursuant to section\n206.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, the State authority shall include in each eligible contract or eligible\ncontract amendment described in such notice a clause providing that the\ncontract or contract amendment is subject to the Comptroller's approval before\nsuch contract or contract amendment may become valid and enforceable. (d) The Comptroller shall have 90 days to\nissue a written determination with respect to the approval or disapproval of\neach eligible contract or eligible contract amendment submitted for approval. Such 90 day period shall begin upon receipt of the eligible contract or\neligible contract amendment, including all required documentation, by the\n\nOffice of the State Comptroller. No eligible contract or eligible contract\namendment submitted to the Comptroller shall become valid and enforceable until\nsuch eligible contract or eligible contract amendment has been approved by the\n\nComptroller; provided, however, that if the Comptroller has not issued a\nwritten determination within the 90 day period, such eligible contract or\neligible contract amendment shall become valid and enforceable without approval\nby the Comptroller. In the event that the State authority resubmits an eligible\ncontract or eligible contract amendment previously disapproved by the\n\nComptroller, the Comptroller shall have 90 days from the receipt of such\nresubmitted eligible contract or eligible contract amendment to issue a written\ndetermination. (e) The Comptroller\nreserves the right to require State authorities to transmit all or part of the\nprocurement record electronically according to standards developed by the\n\nComptroller.
