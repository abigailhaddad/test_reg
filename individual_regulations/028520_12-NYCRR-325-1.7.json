  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 325-1.7 - Duties of superseding physician\n\nState Regulations\nA physician authorized to treat workers' compensation\ncases, when requested to supersede another physician, must, before beginning\ntreatment of such patient, make reasonable effort to communicate with the\nattending physician to ascertain the patient' s condition. The superseding\nphysician must also advise the attending physician of the name of the person\nwho has requested him or her to assume care of the case and state the reason\ntherefor. If the superseding physician cannot contact the attending physician, and the claimant's condition requires immediate treatment, the superseding\nphysician should advise the physician previously in attendance within 48 hours\nthat he or she now has the patient in his or her care. The preceding physician\nshall supply the superseding physician with a complete history of the\ncase. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n325-1.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
