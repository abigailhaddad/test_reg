In addition to the definitions given in section\n2 of the Flammable Fabrics Act, as amended (sec. 1, 81 Stat. 568; 15\nU.S.C. 1191\n), and §7.2 of the Procedures\n(33 F.R. 14642, Oct. 1, 1968), the following definitions apply for the purposes\nof this Standard: (a) \"Acceptance Criterion\" means that at least seven out of\neight individual specimens of a small carpet or rug shall meet the test\ncriterion as defined in this Standard. (b) \"Test Criterion\" means the basis for judging whether or not\na single specimen of a small carpet or rug has passed the test, i.e., the\ncharred portion of a tested specimen shall not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0\nin.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point. (d) \"Small Rug\" means, for the purposes of this Standard, the\nsame as small carpet and shall be accepted as interchangeable with small\ncarpet. (e) \"Traffic Surface\" means a surface of a small carpet or rug\nwhich is intended to be walked upon. (g) \"Fire-Retardant Treatment\" means any process to which a\nsmall carpet or rug has been exposed which significantly decreases the\nflammability of that small carpet or rug and enables it to meet the acceptance\ncriterion of this Standard..2 Scope and Application. This Standard provides a test method\nto determine the surface flammability of small carpets and rugs when exposed to\na standard small source of ignition under carefully prescribed draft-protected\nconditions. It is applicable to all types of small carpets and rugs used as\nfloor covering materials regardless of their method of fabrication or whether\nthey are made of natural or synthetic fibers or films, or combinations of, or\nsubstitutes for these. One of a kind small carpet or rug, such as an antique, an\n\nOriental or a hide, may be excluded from testing under this Standard pursuant\nto conditions established by the Federal Trade Commission..3 General requirements--\n(a) Summary of test method. This method involves the exposure\nof each of eight conditioned replicate specimens of a small carpet or rug to a\nstandard igniting source in a draft-protected environment and measurement of\nthe proximity of the charred portion to the edge of the hole in the prescribed\nflattening frame. (b) Test criterion. A specimen passes the test if the charred\nportion does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in\nthe flattening frame at any point. (c) Acceptance criterion. At least seven of the eight specimens\nshall meet the test criterion in order to conform with this Standard..4Test procedure\n(a) Apparatus-- Test chamber. The test chamber shall consist of\nan open top hollow cube made of noncombustible material[FN1] with inside\ndimensions 30.48 x 30.48 x 30.48 cm. (12 x 12 x 12 in.) and a minimum of 6.35\nmm. ( 1/4 in.) wall thickness. The flat bottom of the box shall be made of the\nsame material as the sides and shall be easily removable. The sides shall be\nfastened together with screws or brackets and taped to prevent air leakage into\nthe box during use. NOTE: A minimum of two chambers and two extra bottoms is\nsuggested for efficient operation. (3) Standard igniting source. No. 1588 methenamine timed\nburning tablet or an equal tablet. These tablets shall be stored in a\ndesiccator over a desiccant for 24 hours prior to use. (Small quantities of\nsorbed water may cause the tablets to fracture when first ignited. If a major\nfracture occurs, any results from that test shall be ignored, and it shall be\nrepeated.)\n(4) Test specimens. Each test specimen shall be a 22.86 x 22.86\ncm. (9 x9 in.) section of the small carpet or rug to be tested. Eight specimens\nare required. (5) Circulating air oven. A forced circulation drying oven\ncapable of removing the moisture from the specimens when maintained at 105°\nC. (221° F.) for 2 hours. [FN2]\n(6) Desiccating cabinet. An air-tight and moisture-tight\ncabinet capable of holding the floor covering specimens horizontally without\ncontacting each other during the cooling period following drying, and\ncontaining silica gel desiccant. (7) Gloves. Nonhygroscopic gloves (such as rubber or\npolyethylene) for handling the sample after drying and raising the pile on\nspecimens prior to testing. (8) Hood. A hood capable of being closed and having its draft\nturned off during each test and capable of rapidly removing the products of\ncombustion following each test. The front or sides of the hood should be\ntransparent to permit observation of the tests in progress. (9) Mirror. A small mirror mounted above each test chamber at\nan angle to permit observation of the specimen from outside of the hood. (10) Vacuum cleaner. A vacuum cleaner to remove all loose\nmaterial from each specimen prior to conditioning. All surfaces of the vacuum\ncleaner contacting the specimen shall be flat and smooth. (b) Sampling--\n(1) Selection of samples. Select a sample of the material\nrepresentative of the lot and large enough to permit cutting eight test\nspecimens 22.86 x 22.86 cm. (9 x 9 in.) free from creases, fold marks, delaminations or other distortions. The representative sample of material may\nrequire the use of more than one small carpet or rug. The test specimens should\ncontain the most flammable parts of the traffic surface at their centers. The\nmost flammable area may be determined on the basis of experience or through\npretesting. If the small carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment, or is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, the selected\nsample or oversized specimens thereof shall be washed, prior to cutting of test\nspecimens, either 10 times under the washing and drying procedure prescribed in\n\nMethod 124-1967 of the American Association of Textile Chemists and Colorists\n[washing procedure 6.2 (III) with a water temperature of 60+-2.8° C\n(140+-5° F), drying procedure 6.3.2(B), maximum load 6.34 kg. (8 pounds)]\n[FN3] or such number of times under such other washing and drying procedures as\nshall previously have been found to be equivalent by the Federal Trade\n\nCommission. Alternatively, the selected sample or oversized specimens thereof\nmay be washed, dry-cleaned, or shampooed 10 times, prior to cutting of test\nspecimens, in such manner as the manufacturer or other interested party shall\npreviously have established to the satisfaction of the Federal Trade Commission\nis normally used for that type of small carpet or rug in service. (c) Conditioning. Clean each specimen with the vacuum cleaner\nuntil it is free of all loose ends left during the manufacturing process and\nfrom any material that may have been worked into the pile during handling. [FN4] Care must be exercised to avoid \"fuzzing\" of the pile yarn. Place the specimens in the drying oven in a manner that will\npermit free circulation of the air at 105° C (221° F) around them for 2\nhours. [FN5] Remove the specimens from the oven with gloved hands and place\nthem horizontally in the desiccator with traffic surface up and free from\ncontact with each other until cooled to room temperature, but in no instance\nless than 1 hour. (d) Testing. Place the test chamber in the draft-protected\nenvironment (hood with draft off) with its bottom in place. Wearing gloves, remove a test specimen from the desiccator and brush its traffic surface with a\ngloved hand in such a manner as to raise its pile. Place the specimen on the\ncenter of the floor of the test chamber, traffic surface up, exercising care\nthat the specimen is horizontal and flat. Place the flattening frame on the\nspecimen and position a methanamine tablet on one of its flat sides in the\ncenter of the 20.32 cm. (8 in.) hole. Ignite the tablet by touching a lighted match or an equivalent\nigniting source carefully to its top. If more than two minutes elapse between\nthe removal of the specimen from the desiccator and the ignition of the tablet, the conditioning must be repeated. Continue each test until one of the following conditions\noccur: (1) The last vestige of flame or glow disappears. (This is\nfrequently accompanied by a final puff of smoke.)\n(2) The flaming or smoldering has approached within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame at any point. When all combustion has ceased, ventilate the hood and measure\nthe shortest distance between the edge of the hole in the flattening frame and\nthe charred area. Record the distance measured for each specimen. Remove the specimen from the chamber and remove any burn\nresidue from the floor of the chamber. Before proceeding to the next test, the\nfloor must be cooled to normal room temperature or replaced with one that is\nnormal room temperature. (e) Report. The number of specimens of the eight tested in\nwhich the charred area does not extend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge\nof the hole in the flattening frame shall be reported. (f) Interpretation of results. If the charred area does not\nextend to within 2.54 cm. (1.0 in.) of the edge of the hole in the flattening\nframe at any point for at least seven of the eight specimens, the small carpet\nor rug meets the acceptance criterion. 5 Labeling requirement. (b) If a small carpet or rug has had a fire-retardant treatment\nor is made of fibers which have had a fire-retardant treatment, it shall be\nlabeled with the letter \"T\" pursuant to rules and regulations established by\nthe Federal Trade Commission. [F.R. Doc. 70-17474; Filed Dec. 28, 1970; 8:50 a.m.]\n[FN1] 6.35 mm. (1/4 in.) cement asbestos board is a suitable\nmaterial.
