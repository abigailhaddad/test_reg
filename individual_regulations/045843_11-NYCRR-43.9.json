(1)\n\nInternal index. Example 1: Five-year guaranteed interest rate policy. Assume this policy was issued three years ago with a five-year guaranteed interest rate of 12%. Currently, two-year single premium policies are issued with a two-year guaranteed interest rate of 10%.

Assume this policy was issued three years ago with a guaranteed interest rate of 12% in years 1-5, and a minimum interest guarantee of 5% in years 6-10. There is a 5% cap on market value adjustments. Currently, two-year guaranteed interest rates of 8% are being offered on similar policies.

Example 3: Five-year guaranteed interest rate policy. Assume this policy was issued two years ago with a five-year guaranteed interest rate of 9%.
