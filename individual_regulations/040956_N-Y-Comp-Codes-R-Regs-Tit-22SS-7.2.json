  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22§ 7.2 - Function of the attorney for the child\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As used in this Part, attorney for\nthe child means a law guardian appointed by the Family Court pursuant to\nsection\n249\nof the\n\nFamily Court Act, or by the Supreme Court or a Surrogate's Court in a\nproceeding over which the Family Court might have exercised jurisdiction had\nsuch action or proceeding been commenced in Family Court or referred\nthereto. (b) The\nattorney for the child is subject to the ethical requirements applicable to all\nlawyers, including but not limited to constraints on: ex parte communication; disclosure of client confidences and attorney work product; conflicts of\ninterest; and becoming a witness in the litigation. (c) In juvenile delinquency and\nperson in need of supervision proceedings, where the child is the respondent, the attorney for the child must zealously defend the child. (d) In other types of\nproceedings, where the child is the subject, the attorney for the child must\nzealously advocate the child's position. (1)\n\nIn ascertaining the child's\nposition, the attorney for the child must consult with and advise the child to\nthe extent of and in a manner consistent with the child's capacities, and have\na thorough knowledge of the child's circumstances. (2)\n\nIf the child is capable of\nknowing, voluntary and considered judgment, the attorney for the child should\nbe directed by the wishes of the child, even if the attorney for the child\nbelieves that what the child wants is not in the child's best interests. The\nattorney should explain fully the options available to the child, and may\nrecommend to the child a course of action that in the attorney's view would\nbest promote the child's interests. (3)\n\nWhen the attorney for the child is\nconvinced either that the child lacks the capacity for knowing, voluntary and\nconsidered judgment, or that following the child's wishes is likely to result\nin a substantial risk of imminent, serious harm to the child, the attorney for\nthe child would be justified in advocating a position that is contrary to the\nchild's wishes. In these circumstances, the attorney for the child must inform\nthe court of the child's articulated wishes if the child wants the attorney to\ndo so, notwithstanding the attorney's position.
