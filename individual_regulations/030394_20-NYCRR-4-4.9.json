  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.9 - Preceding taxable year method\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf, after exercising due diligence, the corporation does\nnot have adequate information to use the delivery destination method, it should\napportion its receipts from that service or other business activity to New York\nusing the preceding taxable year method based on the apportionment of receipts\nfrom the sales of that type of service or other business activity for the\npreceding taxable year. The amount included in New York receipts for the\ncurrent taxable year is determined by multiplying such receipts by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount included in New York receipts from the\nsales of that type of service or other business activity in the preceding\ntaxable year and the denominator of which is the amount included in everywhere\nreceipts from all such sales of that type of service or other business activity\nin the preceding taxable year. This method of the hierarchy cannot apply in a\ncorporation's first taxable year. A corporation that cannot use this method\nmust apportion the receipt using the current taxable year method (see section\n4-4.10\nof this Subpart). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-4.9\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
