  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 663.5 - Telecommunications plant retired\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Telecommunications plant accounts shall at all times disclose the original cost\nof all property in service. When any item of property subject to plant\nretirement accounting is worn out, lost, sold, destroyed, abandoned, surrendered upon lapse of title, becomes permanently unserviceable, is\nwithdrawn or for any other reason is retired from service, the plant accounts\napplicable to that item shall be credited with the original cost of the plant\nretired whether replaced or not (except as provided for minor items in\nparagraph [b][2] of this section). Normally, these retirement credits with\nrespect to such plant as entire buildings, entire central offices, all plant\nabandoned and any large sections of plant withdrawn from service, shall be\nentered in the accounts for the month in which use of the property ceased. For\nany other plant withdrawn from service, the retirement credits shall be entered\nno later than the next succeeding month. Literal compliance with the provision\nfor timing of entries with respect to property amounting to less than $50,000\nfor Class A companies or $10,000 for Class B companies retired under any one\nproject is not required if an unreasonable amount of recordkeeping and\nestimating of quantities, original costs and salvage is necessary. The\nretirement entry shall refer to the continuing property record, or records\nsupplemental thereto, from which the cost was obtained (note also subdivision\n[c] of this section). Every company shall establish procedures which will\nensure compliance with these requirements. (b) To avoid undue refinement, depreciable\ntelecommunications plant shall be accounted for as follows: (1)\n\nRetirement units. This group includes\nmajor items of property, as shown in the Retirement Units List of this system\nof accounts. (The Retirement Units List is set out at the end of the system of\naccounts, infra.) For items included on the retirement units list, the original\ncost of any such items retired shall be credited to the plant account and\ncharged to account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation, whether or not replaced. The\noriginal cost of retirement units installed in place of property retired shall\nbe charged to the applicable telecommunications plant account. (2)\n\nMinor items. This group includes any part\nor element of plant which is not designated as a retirement unit. The original\ncost of a minor item of property when included in the specific or average cost\nfor a retirement unit or units requires no separate credit to the\ntelecommunications plant account when such a minor item is retired. The cost of\nreplacement shall be charged to the account applicable for the cost of repairs\nof the property. However, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment\n(the primary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, of\ngreater durability, of greater capacity or more economical in operation), the\nexcess cost of such a replacement, over the estimated cost at the then current\nprices of replacement without betterment of the minor items being retired, shall be charged to the applicable telecommunications plant account. (c) The cost of property to be\nretired shall be the amount at which property is included in the\ntelecommunications plant accounts. However, when it is impracticable to\ndetermine the cost of each item due to the relatively large number or small\ncost of such items, the average cost of all the items covered by an appropriate\nsubdivision of the account shall be used in determining the cost to be assigned\nto such items when retired. The method used in determining average cost must\ngive due regard to the quantity, vintage, size and kind of items, the area in\nwhich they were installed and their classification in other respects. Average\ncost may be applied in retirement of such items as poles, wire, cable, cable\nterminals, conduit and booths. Any company may use average cost of property\ninstalled in a year or band of years. It should be understood, however, that\nthe use of average costs shall not relieve the company of the requirement for\nmaintaining its continuing property records to show, where practicable, dates\nof installation and removal for purposes of mortality studies. (See section\n663.7\nof this Part, standard\npractices for establishing and maintaining continuing property\nrecords.)\n(d) The accounting for\nthe retirement of property, plant and equipment shall be as provided above\nexcept: (1)\n\nAmounts included in subaccount\n2005.1, Telecommunications Plant Acquisition Adjustment; subaccount 2005.2, Other Plant Adjustment; account 2681, Capital Leases; account 2682, Leasehold\n\nImprovements; account 2690, Intangibles; and any amounts associated with\namortizable leaseholds, easements, and similar rights in land included in\naccount 2111, Land, shall be debited, as appropriate, to accounts 3410, 3420, 3500, 3600 and credited to the applicable accounts. (2)\n\nAmounts in account 2111, Land, and\namounts for works of art recorded in account 2122, Furniture, shall be treated\nat disposition, with commission approval, as a gain or loss and shall be\ncredited or debited to account 7150, Gains and Losses from Disposition of Land\nand Artworks, as applicable. The gain or loss shall be the difference between\nsuch original cost and the sale price (less commissions and other expenses of\nmaking the sale) of the land or artwork. If land or artwork is retained by the\ncompany and held for sale, the cost shall be charged to account 2006, Nonoperating Plant. (e) When the telecommunications plant is sold together with traffic associated\ntherewith, the original cost of the property shall be credited to the\napplicable plant accounts and the estimated amounts carried with respect\nthereto in the accumulated depreciation and amortization accounts shall be\ncharged to such accumulated accounts. The difference, if any, between the net\namount of such debit and credit items and the consideration received (less\ncommissions and other expenses of making the sale) for property that was ever\nincluded in regulated accounts shall, with commission approval, be included in\naccount 7350, Gains and Losses from Disposition of Certain Property. The\naccounting for depreciable telecommunications plant sold without the traffic\nassociated therewith shall be in accordance with the accounting provided in\nparagraph C of account 3100, Accumulated Depreciation. (f) Attention is directed further to the\nfollowing abstract from section\n99, subdivision\n2\nof the\n\nPublic Service Law, which defines the commission's authority to require\napproval for the assignment or transfer by a telegraph or telephone company of\nits owned or leased property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such transfer\nor lease with an original cost of: (1)\nless\nthan $100,000 proposed by a telephone corporation having annual gross revenues\nin excess of $200,000,000; (2)\nless\nthan $25,000 proposed by a telephone corporation having annual gross revenues\nof less than $200,000,000; or\n(3)\nless than $10,000 proposed by a telephone corporation having annual gross\nrevenues of less than $10,000,000 shall be effective without the commission's\nwritten consent within 90 days after such corporation notifies the commission\nthat it plans to complete such transfer or lease and submits a description of\nthe transfer or lease, provided however, that the commission may determine\nwithin such 90 days that the public interest requires its review and written\nconsent.
