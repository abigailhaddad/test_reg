  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 258.6 - Hydrostatic testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each new, reconstructed, relocated, replaced, or reactivated segment of pipeline must be\nhydrostatically tested in accordance with this section to substantiate the\ncurrent or proposed maximum operating pressure. Any pipeline, or segment\nthereof, for which the maximum operating pressure is to be increased must also\nbe tested in accordance with this section. (b) Notwithstanding the requirements of\n49 CFR\n195.302(c), the minimum test\npressure at the lowest point of the test section shall be the lesser of: (1)\n150 percent of the maximum operating\npressure; or\n(2)\nthe pressure that\nproduces a pipe stress equivalent to 90 percent of the specified minimum yield\nstrength of the pipe. (c) Except as provided in subdivision (d) of\nthis section, the test pressure must be maintained throughout the pipeline\nsegment for at least 12 hours following stabilization. (d) For a short segment of pipeline (100 feet\nor less) which is completely exposed and where its entire circumference may be\nreadily examined visually for the detection of leaks, the test duration shall\nbe at least four hours following stabilization and the test shall precede\ncoating of the welds. (e) A\ncalibrated recording pressure gauge that indicates increments of five pounds\nper square inch or less shall be attached to the test section. The gauge must\nbe calibrated at least hourly for the first and last two hours of the test. Calibration is against a dead-weight tester attached to the test\nsection. (f) At least five business\ndays prior to starting a test, the corporation shall notify the office of gas\nand water of the department in Albany in writing. In order to maintain\ncontinuity of service during emergencies, shorter notice is permissible. The\ncorporation shall also notify the officials of the municipalities wherein the\ntest is to be conducted. Tests conducted under this section are not deemed\nsatisfactory unless certified by an inspector of the office of gas and water of\nthe department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
