(3)\n\nThe term ineligible shall mean any\nemployee subject to these rules who is appointed on or after January 1, 1986\nwith no prior creditable service as defined in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision who is not eligible to enroll or be enrolled in the Income\n\nProtection Plan established pursuant to the provisions of 4 NYCRR Part\n78. (b) Saturdays, Sundays and holidays. (1)\n\nAll Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays shall, so far as practicable, be allowed as days\noff. Employees required to work on any of these days shall not be entitled to\ncompensatory time off in lieu thereof. (2)\n\nThe days prescribed as holidays by the\ndepartment's annual calendar for the school year shall be observed as\nholidays. (3)\n\nNo employee subject\nto these rules shall lose pay while employed in a teaching position during\ntimes other than the 10-month school year for days declared by the State as an\nemployer to be special holidays provided such employee was scheduled to work on\nsuch days. (c) Absences\nduring school year. Except as provided by these rules and except as provided by\nthe department's annual calendar for the school year, employees shall not be\nentitled to any leave of absence with pay during the school year; provided, however, that the department may grant time off with pay for religious\nobservance, teacher conferences and other appropriate professional meetings and\nfor extraordinary or emergency absences. Employees may be required to make up\nsuch time off by appropriate adjustments in their daily or weekly work\nschedules. (d) Sick leave. (1)\n\nSick leave is absence with pay\nnecessitated by the illness or disability of the employee including illness or\ndisability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (2)\n\nNonparticipant employees shall earn sick\nleave credits at the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period and may\naccumulate such credits up to a total of 200 days; provided, however, that no\nmore than 165 days of such credits may be accumulated to pay for health\ninsurance in retirement in accordance with section\n167\n(4)\nof the Civil Service Law and provided, however, that an employee shall not earn sick leave credit for any biweekly pay\nperiod unless such employee is in full pay status for at least seven workdays\nduring such biweekly pay period. A part-time employee who is required to work a\nfixed number of hours on a fixed schedule five days per week, or who is\nrequired to work at least half-time each biweekly pay period for a fixed number\nof hours on a fixed schedule shall also earn sick leave credit as provided\nherein, but total pay when absent on such leave shall be the amount which would\nhave been due had such employee worked regularly at his/her usual hours for\nsuch period. (3)\n\nEnrolled employees\nand ineligible employees who are on the payroll on the date on which sick leave\ncredits are otherwise to be granted shall be entitled to 61/2 days of sick\nleave credits for each 10-month school year of service up to a total of 200\ndays; provided, however, that no more than 165 days of such credits may be\naccumulated to pay for health insurance in retirement in accordance with\nsection\n167\n(4)\nof the Civil Service Law. Such sick leave\nshall be credited as follows: (i) Such\nfull-time employees shall be granted 31/4 days of sick leave credits on the\nfirst day of each semester of the school calendar beginning with the semester\nthe first day of which follows the date on which such person first became\nsubject to these rules; provided, however, that a person who elects to enroll\nin the Income Protection Plan pursuant to 4 NYCRR Part\n78, shall immediately\nreceive the prorated portion of 31/4 days of such sick leave credits, rounded\nto the next higher quarter day, based on the percentage of the semester\nremaining on the effective date of such election. (ii)\n\nSuch part-time employees shall be\ngranted sick leave credits not to exceed 31/4 days on the first day of each\nsemester which credits shall be prorated based on the percentage of full-time\nservice such employee is scheduled to work on the sick leave grant\ndates. (iii)\n\nEmployees who are not\nin pay status on a date on which sick leave would otherwise be credited, shall\nbe entitled to receive the prorated share of such leave credits, rounded to the\nnext higher quarter day, based on the percentage of the semester remaining on\nthe date they return to pay status, and, thereafter, on the first day of each\nsucceeding semester for which they are otherwise eligible. (4)\n\nAn employee absent on sick leave shall\nnotify the appropriate supervisor of such absence and the reason therefor on\nthe first day of such absence and within two hours after the beginning of the\nemployee's workday; provided, however, that where the work is such that a\nsubstitute may be required, the department may require earlier notification, but not more than two hours prior to the beginning of the employee's workday. Sick leave credits may be used in such units as the department may approve, but\nthe department shall not require that sick leave credits be used in units\ngreater than one-quarter hour. (5)\n\nBefore absence for personal illness may be charged against accumulated sick\nleave credits, the department may require such proof of illness as may be\nsatisfactory to it, or may require the employee to be examined, at the expense\nof the department, by a physician designated by the department. In the event of\nfailure to submit proof of illness upon request, or in the event that, upon\nsuch proof as is submitted or upon the report of medical examination, the\ndepartment finds that there is not satisfactory evidence of illness sufficient\nto justify the employee's absence from the performance of his/her duties, such\nabsence may be considered as unauthorized leave and shall not be charged\nagainst accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of sick leave privileges shall be\ncause for disciplinary action. (6)\n\nThe department may require an employee who has been absent because of personal\nillness, prior to and as a condition of return to duty, to be examined, at the\nexpense of the department, by a physician designated by the department, to\nestablish that such employee is not disabled from the performance of his/her\nnormal duties and that the return to duty will not jeopardize the health of\nother employees. (7)\n\nIn addition to\npersonal illness of the employee, the following types of absence, when approved\nby the department, may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits: illness or death in the employee's family; provided, however, that charge for\nsuch absence shall not exceed a maximum of 15 days in any one year; absence of\nan employee certified by an examining physician as benefiting from the use of a\nservice animal in performing major life activities, an employee registered with\nthe New York State Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped as legally\nblind or certified by an examining physician or licensed optometrist as legally\nblind, as manifested by visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with\nbest correction or a visual field of 20 degrees or less, or an employee who has\na hearing impairment manifested by a speech discrimination score of 40 percent\nor less in the better ear with appropriate correction as certified by an\nexamining physician or by a licensed audiologist or otolaryngologist, for the\npurpose of obtaining a service animal or guide dog and required training\nrelated thereto; provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 26 days in any one calendar year; and personal visits to\ndoctor or dentist. Proof of the need for such absence, satisfactory to the\ndepartment, may be required. (8)\n\nWhen an employee is transferred to another position in the same or a different\ndepartment or agency and such position is subject to attendance rules approved\nby the New York State Civil Service Commission, accumulated sick leave credits\nshall be transferred with such employee. When an employee is separated from\nservice for other than disciplinary reasons and is subsequently reinstated or\nreemployed within one year after such separation, or is reinstated by action of\nthe State Civil Service Commission, or is reinstated or reemployed while\neligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, sick leave credits\naccumulated and unused at the time of such employee's separation shall be\nrestored; provided, however, that such sick leave credits shall not be restored\nexcept when leave records satisfactory to the department are\navailable. (9)\n\nEvery employee\nshall, on the date on which he/she becomes subject to these rules, be credited\nwith the number of days of sick leave which were accumulated under the\n\nAttendance Rules for Institution Teachers (14 NYCRR Part\n250\n) and had remaining\nto his/her credit as of such date and thereafter shall be eligible to earn and\nbe credited with sick leave as hereinabove provided. (10)\n\nThis subdivision shall not be construed\nto require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it would\notherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation. (e) Extended sick leave. (1)\n\nThe department may, in its discretion, advance sick leave credits to nonparticipants absent due to personal illness\nwho have exhausted accumulated sick leave credits. Such advanced sick leave\ncredits shall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to\nduty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid\nsick leave credits advanced to any such employee under the provisions of this\nsection shall not at any time exceed a total of five days. (2)\n\nThe department may, in its discretion, advance sick leave credits to ineligibles absent due to personal illness who\nhave exhausted accumulated sick leave credits. Such advanced sick leave credits\nshall be repaid, as soon as practicable after the employee's return to duty, from subsequent accumulations of time credits. The outstanding unrepaid sick\nleave credits advanced to any such employee under the provisions of this\nsection shall not at any time exceed a total of three days. (3)\n\nThe department may, in its discretion, upon written request from an employee certified by an examining physician as\nbenefiting from the use of a service animal in performing major life\nactivities, an employee registered with the New York State Commission for the\n\nBlind and Visually Handicapped as legally blind or certified by an examining\nphysician or licensed optometrist as legally blind, as manifested by visual\nacuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with best correction or a visual\nfield of 20 degrees or less, or an employee who has a hearing impairment\nmanifested by a speech discrimination score of 40 percent or less in the better\near with appropriate correction as certified by an examining physician or by a\nlicensed audiologist or otolaryngologist, advance up to 26 days of sick leave\nto such employee who is absent for the purpose of obtaining a service animal or\nguide dog and required training related thereto and who has exhausted\naccumulated leave credits, provided the cumulative total of sick leave credits\ncharged and/or advanced for this purpose does not exceed 26 days in any one\ncalendar year. Such advanced sick leave credits shall be repaid, as soon as\npracticable after the employee's return to duty from subsequent accumulations\nof time credits. The outstanding unrepaid sick leave credits advanced to an\nemployee under the provisions of this subdivision shall not, at any time, exceed a total of 26 days. (4)\n\nUpon\ntermination of the employee's services any such advance of sick leave not\noffset by subsequent accumulations of sick leave credits, shall be deducted\nfrom salary or wages due the employee. (f) Sick leave at half-pay. The department\nmay, in its discretion, grant sick leave at half-pay for personal illness to\nnonparticipants and ineligibles having permanent status and having not less\nthan one year of service after all sick leave credits have been used; provided, however, that the cumulative total of all sick leave at half-pay hereafter\ngranted to any employee during such employee's State service shall not exceed\none pay period for each complete six months of such State service. (g) Personal leave. (1)\n\nPersonal leave is leave with pay for\npersonal business including religious observance and extraordinary or emergency\nabsences. Employees shall be entitled to personal leave not exceeding a total\nof three days in each school year. (2)\n\nPersonal leave may be drawn only at a\ntime convenient to and approved in advance by the department; provided, however, that personal leave allowed for religious observance shall be granted\non the days and hours required, insofar as the same may be granted at such time\nwithout interference with the proper conduct of government functions. (3)\n\nPersonal leave may be used in such units\nof time as the department may approve, but the department shall not require\nthat personal leave be used in units greater than one-quarter hour.

(h) Leave\nfor extraordinary weather conditions and extraordinary circumstances. (1)\n\nThe department may, in its discretion, grant employees time off with pay charged to leave credits (other than sick\nleave) for absences necessitated by excessive heat or other extraordinary\nweather conditions. (2)\n\nEmployees\nwho have reported for duty and because of extraordinary circumstances or\nextraordinary weather conditions are directed to leave work, shall not be\nrequired to charge such directed early departures to their leave\ncredits. (3)\n\nDuring a state of\nemergency declared by the Governor, employees directed by the Governor not to\nreport for duty to official work stations within the specific geographic area\ncovered by the emergency declaration shall not be required to charge such\ndirected absences to their leave credits. (i) Workers' compensation leave. This section\ngoverns leave for employees necessarily absent from duty because of an injury\nor disease arising out of and in the course of State employment.

(iii)\n\nWhere an\nemployee is required by the employer, the State Insurance Fund or Workers'\nCompensation Board to attend a medical examination or a hearing during the\nfirst 10 working days of such leave in any one calendar year and otherwise\nqualifies for such leave pursuant to paragraphs (1)-(14) of this subdivision, the employee shall not be required to charge leave credits for the time\nrequired, including reasonable travel time for such medical exam or hearing\nduring such 10 working days. (iv)\n\nUpon written application by an employee within 45 days of the occurrence of an\noccupational injury or disease, the head of the department or his/her designee\nmay, in his/her discretion, waive the requirement that an employee charge or\nrepay, if advanced, the first 10 working days of such leave in any one calendar\nyear to accrued leave credits.

(9)\n\nAccrual of leave credits. An employee who\nreceives full pay for any period of leave under this section shall earn leave\ncredits during such period. (10)\n\nReimbursement by employee. If it is subsequently determined that an employee\nwas not entitled to compensation leave with pay without charge to leave credits\nfor any period for which such employee was granted such leave as provided\nhereinabove, the employee shall be required to make reimbursement for such paid\nleave from current or subsequent accumulations of leave credits at a rate and\nin a manner determined by the department. (11)\n\nRestoration of leave credits. An\nemployee who draws leave credits or is allowed sick leave at half-pay as\nprovided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision shall be entitled to restoration\nof such credits and such sick leave at half- pay eligibility, excluding leave\ncredits charged pursuant to subparagraph (4)(i) of this subdivision or advanced\npursuant to subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision, but including those used\nfor absences of less than a full day, as are used during a period of absence\nfor which an award of compensation has been made and credited to the State as\nreimbursement for wages paid. Credits so restored may not again be used for\nfuture absences attributable to the same injury or disease. An employee who\nreturns to duty after absence on leave under this section shall have one year\nfrom the date of such return or restoration of credits to reduce his/her\naccrued leave credits, exclusive of personal leave, to the prescribed limits. Personal leave may not be restored as provided herein if the award of\ncompensation is received after the last day of the school year in which the\npersonal leave was used. (12)\n\nReturn to duty.

(15)\n\nWorkers' compensation\nbenefits for injuries or diseases suffered on or after September 1, 1986. (i) Except as otherwise provided in\nparagraphs (15) through (23) of this subdivision, an employee necessarily\nabsent from duty because of an injury or disease arising out of and in the\ncourse of State employment which occurred or was suffered on or after September\n1, 1986 shall be allowed leave from his/her position in accordance with the\nprovisions herein for the period during which the employee is unable to perform\nthe duties of his/her position because of such injury or disease upon giving\ntimely notice that such absence is the result of such injury or disease and\nthat a claim has been or will be filed for benefits under the New York State\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law. Such leave shall be permitted for all periods of\nabsence resulting from such injury or disease, not to exceed a cumulative total\nof one year; provided, however, such leave may be continued for additional\nperiods at the discretion of the department.

(ii)\n\nNo leave shall be allowed under paragraphs (15) through (23) of this\nsubdivision if the State Insurance Fund contests a claim filed by an employee, whether at the request of the department or on its own initiative, because it\nis alleged that such injury or disease did not occur on the job or the employee\nhas not suffered any such injury or disease. If such claim is resolved in favor\nof the employee, eligibility for leave shall be determined as provided in this\nsubdivision for all absences necessitated by the occupational injury or\ndisease. In the event a person who has returned to work claims that he or she\nhas suffered a reoccurrence of a previous injury or disease, which claim is\nthen contested, such claim shall be deemed a new claim for the purpose of this\nsubdivision unlss resolved in favor of the employee. (16)\n\nCompensation and pay benefits. An\nemployee on leave from his/her position pursuant to paragraph (15) of this\nsubdivision shall receive compensation or pay benefits during such leave for\neach separate injury or disease occurring on or after September 1, 1986 as\nhereinafter provided: (i) During the period\nof absence for which payment is being made pursuant to Title 4 NYCRR Part\n89\n(President's Regulations), an employee shall be deemed to be in full paid leave\nstatus.
