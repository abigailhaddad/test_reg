The vehicle must have been operational at some time on public\nhighways during the immediate three-year period prior to January 1, 1986 in\norder to be part of the banked weight system. (f) Categories of permits shall mean the\nassignment of a nomenclature by the department of either F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 or\nF6 to differentiate the categories of permits as specified in section\n385\n(15)(f)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw.

(i) Federal bridge formula. The weight produced by the following Federal bridge\nformula: W = 500((LxN) / (N-1)\n\nImage (12 x N)\n\nImage 36)\n\nWhere W equals overall gross weight on any group of two\nor more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L equals distance in feet\nfrom the center of the foremost axle to the center of the rearmost axle of any\ngroup of two or more consecutive axles, and N equals number of axles in group\nunder consideration.

Such rating\nwill be utilized only in connection with replacement vehicles. (o) Maximum gross vehicle weight is the\nmaximum gross weight for which a divisible load overweight permit may be\nissued.

The department may not issue a permit for vehicles which are not\nin compliance with legal width and length requirements. (s) Measurement of number of axles. At least\none wheel on each side of the axle must be in contact with the pavement when\nthe vehicle is loaded in order for the axle to be counted. (Note: To determine\nthe overall tire width in the case of multiple tires or multiple wheels, the\nsum of the widths of all the tires, which are in contact with the pavement when\nthe vehicle is loaded, on a wheel or combination of wheels shall be taken into\nconsideration.)\n(t) Most\nrestrictive weight shall mean the lesser of the maximum gross vehicle weight or\nthe maximum axle weight as prescribed in subsections (8), (9) and (10) of\nsection\n385\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law.

A nondivisible load is not a\nfungible load. Fungible loads consist of articles which are not distinguishable\nby a description referring to the particular item, but rather are\ndistinguishable by the ascertainment of weight and measure. The constituent\nparts which make up nondivisible loads are distinguishable from each other by\nphysical differences in size, shape, texture, and/or quality. Examples of\nnondivisible loads may include, but are not limited to single poles, girders, columns, wood or metal trusses, buildings, houses, and determinations made\npursuant to subparagraph (e) of subdivision 15 of section\n385\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law.

For vehicles owned and operated by municipalities or for F1 and\nF2 permits, the registered weight shall be the weight at which the vehicle is\nregistered in New York State at the time of the permit application. For the\npurpose of determining grandfather rights of a trailer, it shall be presumed\nthat the trailer has the same registration rights as the power unit to which it\nis to be attached. (z) Replacement\nvehicle shall mean a vehicle of like type, characteristic and function as the\nvehicle being replaced. It must be demonstrated that the replaced vehicle was\nregistered in New York State at some time prior to January 1, 1986, and was\noperational on public highways at some time during the three-year period prior\nto January 1, 1986, except for F1 and F2 permits. A replacement vehicle may\nhave greater or fewer axles than the vehicle replaced. A replacement vehicle\nmay be a combination of vehicles even if the replaced vehicle is a single\nvehicle. A replacement vehicle may be a single vehicle even if the replaced\nvehicle is a combination of vehicles. However, in no event shall a permit be\nissued to a replacement vehicle whose registered vehicle weight exceeds the\nhighest registered weight of the replaced vehicle, based solely on the replaced\nvehicle's prior New York State registered weights, except for F1 and F2\npermits.

(aj)\n\nWheelbase shall mean the measurement\nfrom the center of the foremost axle to the center of the rearmost axle of the\nvehicle or combination of vehicles, measured to the nearest inch. (Note:Measurement of six inches or greater is rounded up to the nearest foot, except for F3 and F4 type 3 permits, for purposes of determining the class of\npermit eligibility.)\n(ak)\n\nRenewal\nshall mean a reissue or extension of an existing permit with no changes, except\nfor effective dates. (al)\n\nLottery\nshall mean a random drawing held of all new vehicle permit applications for F1\nand F2 category permits. This drawing will be held on a monthly basis when\npermits are available.
