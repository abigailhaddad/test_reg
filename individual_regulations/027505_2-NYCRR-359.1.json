  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 359.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nChapter 437 of the Laws of 1993 added article 18 to the New\n\nYork State Retirement and Social Security Law, which authorizes the granting of\nretroactive transfer, retroactive membership and credit for previous service in\ncertain situations. Article 18, often referred to as the \"Administrative Review\n\nLaw,\" includes three sections which provide relief under different\ncircumstances. Section\n801\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw allows for retroactive transfer between public retirement systems by\ncertain members who were previously entitled to transfer membership in a public\nretirement system, but failed to make a timely election. This may result in a\ntier change based on a new date of membership. Section\n802\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw allows credit for service which was previously credited by a public\nretirement system but never transferred. Granting of credit under section\n802\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw will not affect a member's date of membership or tier status. Section\n803\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw allows for retroactive membership. This provision also may result in tier\nchanges based on the new retroactive membership date. Section 804 authorizes the comptroller to promulgate rules\nand regulations to implement the provisions of article 18, and this Part is\npromulgated pursuant to such section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n359.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
