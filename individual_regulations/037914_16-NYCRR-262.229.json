  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 262.229 - Reporting of alcohol testing results\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each large operator (having more than 50\ncovered employees) shall submit an annual MIS report to RSPA of its alcohol\ntesting results using the management information system (MIS) form and\ninstructions as required by 49 CFR part\n40\n(at section 40.25 and appendix H to\npart 40), by March 15th of each year for the previous calendar year (January\n1st though December 31st). The administrator may require by written notice that\na small operator (50 or fewer covered employees), not otherwise required to\nsubmit annual MIS reports, submit such a report to RSPA. (b) Each operator that has a covered employee\nwho performs mult-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee performs pipeline\nmaintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee\nonly on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or she is tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the employee performs more\nthan 50 percent of his or her duties. Operators may have to explain the testing\ndata for these employees in the event of a DOT agency inspection or\naudit. (c) Each report required\nunder this section, shall be submitted to the Office of Pipeline Safety (OPS), Research and Special Program Administration, Department of Transportation, Room\n7128, 400 Seventh Street SW, Washington, DC 20590. RSPA will allow the operator\nthe option of sending the report on the computer disk provided by RSPA. If this\noption is used, a signature page attesting to the validity of the information\non the computer disk must be sent to the address in this section. (d) A service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third\n\nParty Administrator as defined in 49 CFR part\n40\n) may prepare the MIS report on\nbehalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the\noperator's anti-drug manager or designated representative for accuracy and\ncompleteness. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n262.229\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
