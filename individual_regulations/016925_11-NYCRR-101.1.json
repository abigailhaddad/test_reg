  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 101.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Part implements, interprets and clarifies portions of chapter 586 of the Laws of 1998, which, inter alia, amended Insurance Law sections 3217-b and 4325 to permit certain insurers, effective July 1, 1999, to enter into financial risk sharing agreements with health care providers. With respect to an insurer's contractual obligations to its subscribers and required solvency, this Part addresses an insurer's obligation to assess the financial responsibility and capability of providers to perform their obligations under certain financial risk transfer agreements, and sets forth standards pursuant to which health care providers may adequately demonstrate such responsibility and capability to insurers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n101.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
