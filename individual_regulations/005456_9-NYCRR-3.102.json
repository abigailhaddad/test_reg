Carey, Governor of the State of New York, by\nvirtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws of the State\nof New York, do hereby appoint a Panel to Review Scientific Studies and the\n\nDevelopment of Public Policy on Problems Resulting From Hazardous Wastes, and\nrequest this panel to submit a report to the Governor and the Legislature at\nthe earliest possible time. In preparing its report, the panel shall: - review and evaluate medical and scientific data and\nstudies prepared by or at the request of the State Departments of Health and\n\nEnvironmental Conservation in connection with Love Canal, and the methodology\nused in compiling such data and preparing such studies; - review and evaluate medical and scientific data and\nstudies prepared by or at the request of the Federal government in connection\nwith Love Canal, with specific reference to studies relating to genetic damage\nconducted at the request of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, and\nthe methodology used in compiling such data and preparing such studies; - review and evaluate medical and scientific data and\nstudies relating to Love Canal compiled or prepared by any other agency, group\nor organization; - review available data concerning other known chemically\ncontaminated areas in the State; - review and comment upon the proper relationship between\n\nState and Federal agencies in local health emergencies such as that at Love\n\nCanal; - review and comment upon the proper use of medical and\nscientific data in the development of public policy in the areas of\nenvironmental protection and public health; - review and comment upon the current state of scientific\nknowledge regarding the effects of chemicals on the environment and public\nhealth.

The members shall receive no salary but shall be\nreimbursed for reasonable and necessary expenses incurred in the performance of\ntheir duties. I hereby direct all State agencies to assist and cooperate\nfully with the panel and to provide the panel with all available data necessary\nto the completion of its tasks, and I urge Federal agencies and other bodies\nwho have collected data at Love Canal to cooperate fully with the panel.
