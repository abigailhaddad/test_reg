  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-8.1 - Statement of findings and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission hereby declares that Lake George and its\nsurrounding environs are a treasured resource to the people of the State of New\n\nYork; that, consistent with article 43 of the ECL, this unique resource must be\nprotected and preserved through optimum conservation, protection and\npreservation measures to protect the Lake George Park and, in particular, the\nwater quality of Lake George; that in recent years the Lake George Park has\nexperienced rapid growth and development; that the subdivision and development\nof land are commercial enterprises which are leading to adverse impacts to\nwater quality; that recent testing of water quality in Lake George by the\ncommission, other State agencies, and local municipalities and the Lake George\n\nAssociation Fund has demonstrated alarming levels of contamination in Lake\n\nGeorge from both existing and new development and the wastewater and stormwater\ndischarges associated with those activities; that, if proper safeguards are not\nimplemented promptly, irreversible harm may be done to this treasured resource\nthrough further contamination of the waters of Lake George, the acceleration of\nthe eutrophication process, the proliferation of exotic weed species, all of\nwhich will adversely impact Lake George as a natural, scenic and economic\nresource; that, pursuant to chapter 617 of the Laws of 1987, the commission was\ngranted authority to regulate wastewater discharges and to promulgate\nregulations for the preparation of stormwater plans within the Lake George\n\nPark; that the implementation of that authority is imperative to address the\nserious water quality problems at Lake George; that the implementation of that\nauthority will take approximately one year or longer through the development of\ncomprehensive parkwide wastewater and stormwater management regulations and the\nregulatory and environmental reviews associated with that process; that, pending promulgation of such programs, interim stop gap measures are necessary\nto protect the water quality at Lake George from further degradation from\nfurther development in the Lake George Park without the benefit of the optimum\nconservation measures that will be incorporated in those programs; that, pursuant to ECL, sections 43-0107(24), (32) and 43-0111, the commission is\nauthorized to prohibit, restrict or control commercial development in the Lake\n\nGeorge Park; and that it is necessary for the commission to implement its\nauthority regarding commercial uses to establish a permanent zone and to\ntemporarily prohibit commercial development within that zone pending the\nimplementation of comprehensive wastewater and stormwater regulations, and then\nto limit commercial development consistent with such\nregulations.
