  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 578.8 - Impacts of certain regulated activities\n\nState Regulations\n\nRegulated activities will usually have the following\nimpacts: (a) Draining of wetlands\nlowers average water table elevations. It may increase downstream peak flows\nand, if normal flow channels are blocked, decrease water storage capacity and\ndownstream base flows. Secondary impacts may occur, such as a successional\nchange in wetland vegetative covertype toward drier types, increased water\ntemperatures, and changes in fish and wildlife use. Complete draining can\neliminate wetland vegetation or wetlands themselves. (b) Dredging, excavating, or channelizing\nwetlands, or removing soil, mud, sand, shells, or other aggregate from wetlands\nmay increase water depth and remove wetland plant species, altering the basic\nsubstrate characteristics. Wetlands may be eliminated by creating water levels\ntoo deep for wetland vegetation to survive. Fish and wildlife feeding or\nreproductive use may be altered. Water storage capacity may be increased while\nchanges in covertype variability, turbidity, sediment deposition and substrate\nerosion may result. (c) Filling, dumping, or construction of roads may decrease wetland area, hence decreasing\nthe multiple benefits derived from wetlands. Impacts may extend beyond the\nboundaries of the filled area especially if surface or subsurface water\nmovement is affected. For example, loss of storage capacity may result in\nincreased sedimentation of adjacent waters. Ancillary use of the filled area\ncould lead to runoff or leaching of noxious materials or chemicals. Extraneous\nmaterial incompatible with the wetland (such as certain metals or waste oil and\nother chemicals) may adversely impact water quality and fish and wildlife use. Such activities may degrade the aesthetic character of the wetland. Ultimately, filling may eliminate a wetland entirely. (d) Creation of impervious surfaces in\nwetlands, irrespective of other associated developmental activities, may\nincrease surface runoff and thereby may increase turbidity, sedimentation and\nwater flow through wetlands. Increased water flow through wetlands may increase\nerosion, interfere with natural biological and chemical processes, change\ncovertype patterns, and alter temperatures. Decreases in the functional\ncapacity of wetlands may result as may also introduction of incompatible\nmaterials or chemicals (such as trash or gasoline) from the impervious surface\nover wide areas of the wetland. (e) Erecting structures in wetlands, irrespective of other associated developmental\nactivities, may shade and thus alter wetland vegetation, obstruct or interfere\nwith surface or subsurface water flow, and interfere with fish and wildlife\nuse. (f) Placing obstructions or\ndriving piles in wetlands may interfere with surface or subsurface water flow, or increase water levels, thus affecting wetland water supply, flooding\npotential and vegetative patterns. The level of impact is related to the amount\nand location of obstruction. The placing of piles for support of other\nstructures may be a reasonable alternative to placement of fill when water\nstorage capacity or hydrologic absorption values are the primary benefits\nderived from the wetland, especially when such placement of piles will not\ncreate a hazardous obstruction to flowing water containing ice or other\nwater-borne material. (g) Introducing sewage wastewater treatment effluent or installing septic\ntanks or sewer outfalls\nin wetlands or adjacent areas may contaminate\nground or surface water with undesirable nutrients or organisms. Excessive\nnutrient loads may alter the vegetative composition or fish and wildlife use, and/or affect the suitability of water for human use. Organisms introduced with\nwastewater effluent may create a general health hazard. Effluent may increase\nsuccessional rates through the introduction of excessive levels of nutrients or\nby warming ambient water temperatures. Abnormal levels of water may be created\nin wetlands. These impacts may interfere with fish and wildlife as well as\nhuman use of water resources. (h) Construction of dams, dikes, and other impoundments and control structures in\nwetlands or on water bodies running through them usually increases water levels\nor restricts water flow, altering or eliminating wetland vegetation, and may\ndestroy whole wetlands. (i) Other\nregulated activities may introduce or increase toxins, noise and other forms of\npollution, remove or reduce vegetation or expose soil to erosion. Such\nactivities include, for example, the operation of all-terrain vehicles and\nairboats, construction of utilities in existing or new corridors, either\noverhead or underground, disposal of chemicals, introduction or discharge of\npollutants, application of pesticides and other chemicals, disposal of solid\nwastes, clearcutting or other timber harvesting practices, and construction or\nremoval of groins, bulkheads, berms or levies.
