Tit. 10 §§ 58-2.4 - Collection of blood\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Collection of blood for transfusion shall be performed under the direction of the medical director. Medical services for emergency care of the donor shall be available. Blood for transfusion shall be collected only on the premises of a blood bank, at a blood donation center approved by the department, in a self-contained blood collection vehicle operated by a blood bank, or at a temporary collection operation conducted by a blood bank. Each blood bank shall inform the department, upon request, of the location of all blood collection activities and the provisions made for the handling of medical emergencies. Prior to collection of blood for testing, a signed form must be obtained from the donor or person legally authorized to consent on behalf of such donor, in which the donor or the person legally authorized to consent acknowledges that he/she has been provided with written materials stating that HIV testing for donor screening purposes shall be performed in conjunction with all donations. (b) Quantity limitations. Allogeneic and autogeneic donors may give a maximum of 550 milliliters of whole blood in addition to pilot samples sufficient for all testing to be performed. (c) Frequency limitations. No allogeneic blood donor may donate more than 550 milliliters of whole blood within an eight-week period, unless approved to do so by a physician who examines the potential donor at the time of the proposed second donation. In no event may an allogenic blood donor donate more than twice within a 16-week period. The foregoing prohibition on donations does not apply to allogeneic blood donors diagnosed with hemochromatosis. For autogeneic collections, the frequency of donation shall be as specified in section\n58-2.2\n(e)(3)\nof this Subpart. (d) Persons collecting blood for transfusion shall be trained, under the direction of the medical director, to recognize donor reactions.
