  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe subdivisions of this section are to be considered in\ndetermining if, or to what extent, the requirements of any section of this\n\nSubpart apply to any emission unit (including any exempt or trivial activity as\ndefined in Part 201 of this Title), which is part of a proposed source project\nor proposed major facility, or to any emission unit, area source, mobile\nsource, or other source which is used to establish an ERC. Any emission unit\nsubject to this Subpart must also comply with State facility or title V\npermitting requirements, as applicable, pursuant to Part 201 of this\n\nTitle. (a) Applicability to emission\nincreases in any nonattainment area and attainment portions of the ozone\ntransport region. Any emission unit (including any exempt or trivial activity\nas defined in Part 201 of this Title) which emits any nonattainment contaminant\nis subject to this Subpart if: (1)\na permit\naction for such emission unit occurs on or after November 15, 1992; or an\nexempt or trivial activity is constructed on or after November 15, 1992 and\nprior to February 19, 2009; and\n(2)\nit is part of a proposed major facility for any such nonattainment contaminant, including any major electric generating facility subject to article X of the\n\nPublic Service Law, or any major steam electric generating facility subject to\narticle VIII of the Public Service Law; or\n(3)\nat an existing non-major facility, it is\npart of a proposed source project which, by itself, has a project emission\npotential of any such nonattainment contaminant equal to or greater than the\ncorresponding major facility size threshold in section 231-2.12 or\n231-2.13\nof this Subpart; or\n(4)\nat an existing major\nfacility, it is part of a significant source project for any such nonattainment\ncontaminant which results in a significant net emission increase for that\nnonattainment contaminant. For emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nin the severe ozone nonattainment area, special rules apply as set forth in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. If the emission unit is part of a significant\nsource project which does not result in a significant net emission increase, the emission unit remains subject to the applicable provisions of sections\n231-2.3, 231-2.4, 231-2.6, and\n231-2.7\nof this Subpart. (b) Severe ozone nonattainment\narea; special rules. For emissions of VOC or NO\nx\nonly, any emission unit which is part of a significant source project which results\nin a significant net emission increase as identified in paragraph (a)(4) of\nthis section is also subject to the following requirements: (1)\n\nAt an existing major facility, if the\nfacility emission potential of VOC or NO\nx\nis less than\n100 tons per year: (i) an emission offset of\nthe project emission potential at a ratio of at least 1.3 to 1 is required, except that best available control technology (BACT) may be substituted for\nLAER; or\n(ii)\nif the project\nemission potential is internally offset at a ratio of at least 1.3 to 1, the\nproposed source project is exempt from the requirements of BACT and an emission\noffset, but is subject to sections\n231-2.3, 231-2.4, 231- 2.8 and 231-2.10 of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nAt an\nexisting major facility, if the facility emission potential of VOC or NO\nx\nis 100 tons per year or more: (i) both an emission offset of the project\nemission potential at a ratio of at least 1.3 to 1 and LAER are required; or\n(ii)\nif the project emission\npotential is internally offset at a ratio of at least 1.3 to 1, the proposed\nsource project is exempt from the requirements of LAER and an emission offset, but is subject to sections\n231-2.3, 231-2.4, 231- 2.8 and 231-2.10 of\nthis Subpart. (c) Fugitive emissions. For the purposes of\nthis Subpart, the fugitive emissions of a facility shall be included in\ndetermining whether the facility is major if the facility belongs to one of the\nfollowing source categories: (1)\ncoal cleaning\nplants (with thermal dryers); (2)\nkraft pulp mills; (3)\nportland\ncement plants; (4)\nprimary zinc\nsmelters; (5)\niron and steel\nmills; (6)\nprimary aluminum ore\nreduction plants; (7)\nprimary\ncopper smelters; (8)\nmunicipal\nsolid waste incineration facilities (or combinations thereof) capable of\ncharging more than 50 tons of refuse per day; (9)\nhydrofluoric, sulfuric, or nitric acid\nplants; (10)\npetroleum\nrefineries; (11)\nlime\nplants; (12)\nphosphate rock\nprocessing plants; (13)\ncoke oven\nbatteries; (14)\nsulfur recovery\nplants; (15)\ncarbon black plants\n(furnace process); (16)\nprimary\nlead smelters; (17)\nfuel conversion\nplants; (18)\nsintering\nplants; (19)\nsecondary metal\nprocessing plants; (20)\nchemical\nprocessing plants; (21)\nfossil\nfuel-fired boilers (or combinations thereof) totaling more than 250 million\n\nBritish thermal units per hour of heat input; (22)\npetroleum storage and transfer units\nwith a total storage capacity exceeding 300,000 barrels; (23)\ntaconite ore processing\nplants; (24)\nglass fiber\nmanufacturing plants; (25)\ncharcoal\nproduction plants; (26)\nfossil\nfuel-fired steam electric plants of more than 250 million British thermal units\nper hour of heat input; (27)\nany\nother stationary source category referenced in sections\n200.9, Table 1, and 200.10, Tables\n2 and 3 of this Title. (d) Exemptions. (1)\n\nAny applicant for a proposed source\nproject or proposed major facility subject to this Subpart may petition the\ndepartment and the administrator of the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency, in accordance with\n42 U.S.C. section\n7511a(f)\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title), for a determination that reductions in emissions\nof NO\nx\nfrom the proposed source project or proposed\nmajor facility would not produce net ozone air quality benefits in the\nnonattainment area or ozone transport region. To the extent that such a\npetition is granted by both the department and the administrator, the\nrequirements of this Subpart for the proposed source project or proposed major\nfacility with respect to emissions of NO\nx\nshall not\napply. (2)\n\nAny emission unit which\nis to be operated for one year or less, and is determined not to be a\nsignificant action in accordance with the procedures contained in Part 617 of\nthis Title, is not subject to this Subpart. Any permit representing such an\nemission unit shall include enforceable conditions to prohibit operation beyond\none year. Relocation of the emission unit will not constitute a basis for\nextension or recommencement of the one-year period. If the owner of the\nemission unit proposes to continue operation beyond one year, the emission unit\nshall be subject to this Subpart. Operation of the emission unit shall not\ncontinue beyond one year until the applicant has demonstrated compliance with\nthis Subpart and received approval for such continued operation. (3)\n\nIf an applicant for a proposed source\nproject or proposed major facility which would be subject to this Subpart\nproposes enforceable permit conditions which reduce the project emission\npotential or facility emission potential such that the proposed source project\nor proposed major facility is not subject to this Subpart according to any\napplicability criterion contained in subdivision (a) of this section, the\nrequirements of this Subpart shall not apply. (4)\n\nThe addition, replacement, or use of a\npollution control project at: (i) an existing\nelectric utility steam generating unit shall not be subject to this Subpart if\nthe applicant demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that such action: (a) will not render the unit less\nenvironmentally beneficial; and\n(b) will not result in a significant net increase in representative actual annual\nemissions of a nonattainment contaminant over levels used for that emission\nunit in the most recent air quality impact analysis in the area conducted for\n\nState Implementation Plan (SIP) purposes; and\n(c) will not cause or contribute to a\nviolation of a national ambient air quality standard (NAAQS); or\n(ii)\nany emission unit other than\nan electric utility steam generating unit shall not be subject to this Subpart\nif the applicant demonstrates to the department's satisfaction that such\naction: (a) will not render the unit less\nenvironmentally beneficial; and\n(b) will not result in a collateral increase in emissions of a nonattainment\ncontaminant which exceeds the appropriate significant source project threshold; or for any such increase, emission offsets at a ratio of 1:1 have been\nobtained; and\n(c) will not cause or\ncontribute to a violation of a NAAQS. (5)\n\nThe installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project shall not\nbe subject to this Subpart if the project complies with: (i) the New York SIP; and\n(ii)\nany other requirements necessary to\nattain and maintain any NAAQS during the project and after it is\nterminated. (6)\n\nThe\nreplacement of an emission source with similar equipment using the same or new\nemission stack shall not be subject to this Subpart provided there is no\nincrease in the maximum annual potential of the emission unit representing the\nemission source. Similarly, the relocation of an emission source within the\nsame facility is exempt from this Subpart. However, such a relocation must\nsatisfy all other applicable Parts of this Title and result in acceptable air\nquality impacts pursuant to section\n200.6\nof this Title. (e) Applicability to emission\nreductions. Emission reductions through facility shutdown, emission unit\nshutdown, curtailment, over-control of emissions beyond an applicable limit, source reduction, and emission reductions associated with mobile sources or\ndemand side management efforts are eligible for certification as ERCs in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n231-2.6\nof this\n\nSubpart.
