A person must pass either the Standard or Modified Certification Test in order\nto live in a community residence for the purpose of receiving residential core. The person's answers to the questions must be recorded on the test form with A\nPIECE OF CARBON PAPER INSERTED BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL AND SECOND COPIES. The\nforms must be filled out by a qualified professional. Both the Standard and the Modified Tests may be administered in\none of two ways: 1)\n\nQuestions 1-2 may\nbe administered at the referral site as a means of pre- screening the\napplicant. If both questions are answered satisfactorily, the second part of\nthe test (Question #3) must then be administered at the proposed community\nresidence site. The community residence shall complete the instrument and shall\nreturn the carbon copy of the completed instrument to the referring agency, facility or program. 2)\n\nWhere there\nhas been no referral, the entire test may be administered at the proposed\ncommunity residence. If the applicant is certified as capable of\nself-preservation, the community residence shall send the carbon copy of the\ncertification instrument to the department regional office within seven days\nafter the person becomes a resident. Any such copy shall include the first\nname, last initial and date of birth of the person so certified but shall not\ninclude any other identifying information. If a person fails the Standard Test\nhe/she may be given the Modified Test immediately or may be trained and\nre-tested with the Standard Test, provided that there be a 24 hour interval\nbetween the last training and the testing day. If the individual fails the\n\nModified Test, he/she may be trained and re-tested, provided that there is a 24\nhour interval between the last training and the testing day. GENERAL AND LIMITED CERTIFICATION\nPersons tested according to the Standard or Modified Test may\nbe given General or Limited Certification. General Certification means that a person is capable of\nself-preservation from all locations within the community residence. Limited Certification means that a person is capable of\nself-preservation only from a certain location(s) within the community\nresidence. For example, a person with a physical handicap light be capable of\nleaving the residence within two and half minutes from the ground floor only -\nin this case, she/he would receive limited certification with the limitations\nplaced on his living situation specified on the instrument.
