  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 533.2 - Records to be kept\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1132(c), 1135, 1138(a), 1142(5)\n(a) General. (1)\n\nFor the proper administration of the\n\nSales and Use Tax Law and to prevent evasion of the sales tax, it is\nstatutorily presumed that all receipts from sales and purchases of property or\nservices of any type mentioned in subdivisions (a) through (d) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law, all rents for\noccupancy of the type mentioned in subdivision (e) of such section, and all\namusement charges of any type mentioned in subdivision (f) of such section are\nsubject to the tax until the contrary is established. The burden of proving\nthat any receipt, amusement charge or rent is not taxable is on the vendor or\nthe customer. To satisfy his burden of proof, a vendor must maintain records\nsufficient to verify all transactions. (2)\n\nUpon audit by the department, or at such\nother times as the department requests, the vendor or user must present all the\nrecords described in this Part, kept in a manner suitable to determine the\ncorrect amount of tax due, together with such documentation, summaries and\nschedules, including any New York State or Federal tax returns or schedules as\nthe department may request. The vendor or user may elect to retain records as\nhard-copy records, electronic records, or both. Such vendor or user must\nprovide the auditors of the department with suitable facilities for conducting\ntheir audit or examination. In those instances where the vendor or user\nmaintains or processes records on an electronic data processing system, the\ndepartment reserves the right to have such records presented on\nmachine-sensible form, and the vendor or user must furnish access to such\nequipment or records as is necessary for the department to carry out its\nstandard audit procedures. See Part 2402 of this Title concerning taxpayer\nrecord retention formats. See, also, paragraph (f)(4) of this section for\nspecific provisions that supplement Part 2402. (3)\n\nAll records required to be kept by this\n\nPart shall be preserved for a period of three years from the due date of the\nreturn to which they relate, or the date of filing, if later, except as\nprovided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision, and longer than three years if\ntheir contents are material to any period open or extended pursuant to statute, or in any action or proceeding pending before the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance or in a judicial proceeding or action. Cross-reference: For waivers, see Part 535 of this Title. For taxable\ntransactions, see Part 527 of this Title. Example 1: If a vendor applies for a refund or credit just before the\nstatute of limitation expires and the refund or credit is pending after the\nstatute expires, the vendor must retain all records relating to the quarter to\nwhich the refund or credit applies until a final determination is made on the\napplication. Such records are material in the administration of the Tax\n\nLaw. Example 2: If a vendor is audited by the department and does not agree\nwith the audit findings, the vendor must keep all records of the audited period\nuntil a final determination is made on the audit. Such records are material in\nthe administration of the Tax Law. Example 3: A department store leases cash registers for five years\nfrom an office supply company. A copy of the original lease must be retained by\nthe lessor (the office supply company) and the lessee (the department store)\nuntil three years after the tax on the last lease payment was payable by the\nlessor to the Department of Taxation and Finance. (4)\n\nGuest checks must be retained for at\nleast three years, unless an application is filed with the District Office\n\nAudit Bureau and permission is granted by the bureau to destroy the guest\nchecks before the expiration of the three-year statute of limitation. For form\nof records, see subdivision (f) of this section. (b) Sales records. (1)\n\nEvery person required to collect tax, including every person purchasing or selling tangible personal property for\nresale must keep records of every sale, amusement charge, charge for dues or\noccupancy, and all amounts paid, charged or due thereon, and of the tax payable\nthereon. The records must contain a true copy of each: (i) sales slip, invoice, receipt, contract, statement or other memorandum of sale; (ii)\nguest check, hotel guest check, receipt\nfrom admissions such as ticket stubs, receipt from dues; and\n(iii)\ncash register tape and any other\noriginal sales document. Where no written document is given to the customer, the\nseller shall keep a daily record of all cash and credit sales in a day book or\nsimilar book. (2)\n\nThe sales record either must provide sufficient detail to independently\ndetermine the taxable status of each sale and the amount of tax due and\ncollected thereon or may be substantiated by analysis of supporting records. (i) Cash register tapes which identify the\nindividual items sold, selling price and the tax due are sufficient to\nindependently determine the taxable status of each sale and the amount of tax\ndue thereon. (ii)\n\nCash register\ntapes which indicate whether each item sold is in a taxable or exempt category, but which do not identify the individual items sold, may be sufficient to prove\ngross sales but are not sufficient to independently determine the tax status of\neach sale. In this situation, other records will be required to substantiate\nthe proper collection of tax due, such as purchases records, identification of\ntaxable and nontaxable merchandise on display or documentation of like\nprobative value. (3)\n\nThe\nseller must maintain records which substantiate points of delivery if delivery\nwas made at a place other than his place of business. Such documents should\ninclude receipts from parcel delivery services, common carriers, unregulated\ntruckers, the United States Postal Service, foreign freight forwarders, and\nlogs from company vehicles. Such documents must be referenced to specific sales\ntransactions. (4)\n\nExemption\ncertificates must be dated and retained in order to prove exempt sales. Once a\nproperly completed certificate is obtained, it relieves the seller of liability\nto collect the tax on transactions to which the certificate applies. Every\nvendor accepting an exemption certificate must maintain a method of associating\na sale made for exempt purposes with the certificate on file. The burden of\nproving the validity of any properly completed certificate rests with the\ncustomer or other person who issues the certificate. Cross-reference: For the proper use of exemption certificates, see section\n532.4\nof this Title. (5)\n\nBad\ndebts. In support of deductions or claims for credit for bad\ndebts, returned merchandise and cancelled sales, retailers must maintain\nadequate and complete records showing: (i) date of original sale; (ii)\nname and address of purchaser; (iii)\namount purchaser contracted to\npay; (iv)\namount on which retailer\npaid tax; and\n(v) all payments or\nother credits applied to the account of the purchaser, and the dates of such\npayments. Cross-reference: For bad debts, see Part 534 of this Title. (6)\n\nVending machine operators must\nkeep records which indicate the number of machines and receipts within each\ntaxing jurisdiction. Such records must include a copy of all contracts with\nowners or lessors of the premises where the various machines are located. Records must be maintained as to the number, price and receipts from each item\nsold in the machines. Such receipts must be supported by detailed inventory\nwithdrawal records or similar data. (c) Purchase records. Every purchaser must maintain documentation to substantiate\nany exemption, exclusion or exception claimed on the purchase of any tangible\npersonal property or service. The purchase records must provide sufficient\ndetail to independently determine the taxable status of each purchase and the\namount of tax due, paid or remitted thereon. Purchase documents should be\ncategorized as follows: (1)\npurchases\nthat are subject to all taxes; (2)\npurchases exempt from all taxes because for resale (inventory and raw\nmaterials); (3)\npurchases that are\nexempt from all taxes for reasons other than for resale; e.g., purchases from an organization exempt from tax pursuant to section\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw; (4)\npurchases that are subject\nonly to the statewide sales tax or the New York City sales tax, or a local tax; e.g., electricity used to operate production machinery and\nequipment in New York City is exempt from the statewide tax but subject to the\n\nNew York City sales tax. (d) Miscellaneous records. (1)\n\nEvery vendor must maintain and make\navailable, upon request, records and supporting documents for all exemptions, exclusions or exceptions allowed by law or claimed in filing sales and use tax\nreturns. (2)\n\nRecords or schedules\nrelating to the sales tax return, such as tax worksheets, general journal, ledgers, sales and purchase journals, schedules accounting for the difference\nbetween gross sales and services and taxable sales and services, must be\nmaintained and be made available upon request. (3)\n\nDocumentation must be maintained for any\nrefund or credit claimed. (4)\n\nAny\nvendor who must file any tax returns or schedules required by the federal\ngovernment, the State of New York, or any municipality within New York State, must keep a copy of all such returns or schedules and make them available to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance upon request. (5)\n\nIf a vendor has signed a record retention\nagreement with the Internal Revenue Service, the vendor must make a copy of\nsuch agreement available upon request. (6)\n\nVendors must maintain and make available\ndocumentation which will provide a meaningful description of their accounting\nsystem, whether manual or automated, and the records contained therein. This\ndocumentation must be adequate to explain the meaning of all entries on the\nrecords. (7)\n\nRecords. In addition to the records required to be kept pursuant to\nthis section, retail food stores and other participants approved for\nparticipation in the federal food stamp program are required to keep and make\navailable to the department upon request the following: (i) true and complete copies of applications, updates of applications and returns and reports furnished to or by the United\n\nStates government or this State or their agencies in order for the vendor to\nparticipate in the food stamp program or redeem coupons issued under or\npursuant to such Federal Food Stamp Act, as amended; (ii)\nrecords of receipts indicating whether\npayment is by food stamps; and\n(iii)\ntrue and complete copies of redemption\ncertificates, validated by the bank; or true and complete copies of bank\ndeposit slips or receipts showing the amount of food stamps deposited with, cashed at or otherwise tendered to the bank, validated by the bank; or both\nsuch redemption certificates and deposit slips or receipts, if available; and\nany other document validated by a bank as to the amount of food stamps\ndeposited, cashed or otherwise tendered.
