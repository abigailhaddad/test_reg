  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 400.21 - Advance directives\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Statement of purpose. The New York State Health Care Proxy Law allows an adult\nto designate another adult, such as a trusted friend or loved one who knows the\nperson and his/her wishes, to make treatment decisions if the adult becomes\nincapacitated and is unable to do so. The Health Care Proxy Law guarantees an\nadult's right to self-determination and the expression of this right through\nanother adult. Advance directives also allow an adult to express his or her\npreference regarding health care treatment, including a desire to continue or\nto refuse treatment and life supports. In the absence of a health care proxy, the Family Health Care Decisions Act allows a surrogate (a family member or\nclose friend) to make treatment decisions on behalf of a patient, in accordance\nwith the patient's wishes, if known, or if the patient's wishes are not known, in accordance with the patient's best interests. Facilities must ensure that\nall adult patients/residents are informed of their rights and are supported and\nprotected as they exercise their right to formulate written or oral\ninstructions regarding their health care in the event such adults become\nincapacitated and are unable to direct their own health care. (b) Definitions.

(2)\nA\nhealth care proxy\nmeans a document created pursuant to article 29-C of the Public Health Law\nwhich delegates the authority to another adult known as a health care agent to\nmake health care decisions on behalf of the adult when that adult is\nincapacitated. (3)\nA\nliving\nwill\nmeans a document which contains specific instructions concerning\nan adult's wishes about the type of health care choices and treatments that an\nadult does or does not want to receive. (4)\nA\nhealth care agent\nor\nagent\nmeans an adult to whom authority to make health care\ndecisions is delegated under a health care proxy. (5)\n\nAn\nadult\nmeans any\nperson who is 18 years of age or older, or is the parent of a child, or has\nmarried. (6)\n\nMedical orders\nfor life-sustaining treatment (MOLST)\nmeans medical orders to provide, withhold or withdraw life-sustaining treatment.

The MOLST form and guidance and checklists for using\nthe MOLST form for any patient in any setting are posted on the department's\nwebsite. (c) Facility compliance.
