  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 613-2.6 - Out-of-service UST systems and closure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Out-of-service UST\nsystems. (1)\nA UST system is out of\nservice if: (i) the facility owner (or their\nauthorized representative) takes the tank system out of service by submitting\nan application to the Department, in accordance with subparagraph 1.9(c)(4)(ii)\nof this Part, indicating that the tank system is out of service; or\n(ii)\nthe tank system is no longer receiving\nor dispensing petroleum. Within 30 days after the tank system no longer\nreceives or dispenses petroleum, the facility owner (or their authorized\nrepresentative) must submit an application to the Department, in accordance\nwith subparagraph 1.9(c)(4)(ii) of this Part, indicating that the tank system\nis out of service. (2)\n\nOut-of-service UST systems are still subject to all applicable requirements of\nthis Part, with the exception of periodic equipment\ntesting/monitoring/inspections, walkthrough inspections, and leak detection\nrequired under subdivisions\n2.2\n(e) through\n(h), and\n2.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart, respectively, if the UST system is empty. (A UST system is\nconsidered empty when all petroleum has been removed using commonly employed\npractices so that no more than 2.5 centimeters (one inch) of residue remain in\nthe UST system.)\n(i) The suspended\nrequirements of subdivisions\n2.2\n(e) through\n(h), and\n2.3\n(a) and (b)\nof\nthis Subpart must resume in accordance with the original schedule when the UST\nsystem is returned to service. However, if the UST system has been out of\nservice such that any of the next periodic testing/monitoring/inspections was\nnot conducted in accordance with the original schedule, the\ntesting/monitoring/inspection must be performed when the UST system is returned\nto service. (ii)\n\nFor UST systems\ntaken out of service due to repairs (in response to a leak), the repair and\nsubsequent testing requirements of subparagraph 2.2(j) of this Subpart must be\nsuccessfully completed before the UST system is returned to service. (3)\n\nWhen a UST system is out of\nservice for more than 90 days, or has not received or dispensed petroleum in a\n90-day period, the following must also be performed: (i) empty the tank so that no more than 2.5\ncentimeters (one inch) of residue remains; (ii)\nleave vent lines open and functioning; and\n(iii)\ncap and secure all\npiping, fill ports, gauge openings, vapor returns, pump connections, ancillary\nequipment, and manways. (4)\n\nWhen a UST system is out of service for\nmore than 12 months, or has not received or dispensed petroleum in a 12-month\nperiod, the UST system must be permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivisions (b) through (e) of this section. (b) Permanent closure. (1)\n\nAt least 30 days before permanent\nclosure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must notify\nthe Department of this action, unless such action is in response to corrective\naction in accordance with Subpart 7 of this Part. (2)\n\nWithin 30 days after permanent closure, the facility owner (or their authorized representative) must submit an\napplication to the Department, in accordance with subparagraph 1.9(c)(7)(ii) of\nthis Part, indicating that the UST system has been permanently\nclosed. (3)\n\nThe required assessment\nof the excavation zone under subdivision (c) of this section must be performed\nafter notifying the Department in accordance with paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision but before completion of the permanent closure. The resultant\nreport must be submitted to the Department within 90 days after permanent\nclosure in accordance with paragraph (e)(2) of this section. (4)\n\nAll scheduled deliveries to UST systems\nthat have undergone permanent closure, must be terminated. (5)\n\nMethods of permanent\nclosure. (i) To perform a tank\nremoval, all liquids and accumulated sludge must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to removing the tank from the ground. All lines (including\ndelivery piping) must be either disconnected and removed, or securely capped or\nplugged. One of the following codes of practice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) API RP 1604, March\n1996; (b) PEI RP 1700, 2018\nedition; or\n(c) a code of practice\ndeveloped by a nationally recognized association or independent testing\nlaboratory and approved by the Department. (ii)\n\nTo perform an in-place closure, all\nliquids, accumulated sludge, and petroleum vapors must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to filling the tank with an inert solid material\n(\ne.g., sand or concrete slurry). All voids within the tank\nmust be filled. All lines (including delivery piping) must be either\ndisconnected and removed, or securely capped or plugged, and all manways must\nbe securely fastened in place. Tanks that will have a new tank installed within\nthem need not be filled with an inert solid material, but the remaining\nrequirements of this subparagraph and those of subdivisions (c) through (e) of\nthis section must be met. One of the following codes of practice (refer to\nsection\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) API RP 1604, March\n1996; (b) PEI RP 1700, 2018\nedition; or\n(c) a code of practice\ndeveloped by a nationally recognized associated or independent testing\nlaboratory and approved by the Department. (iii)\n\nTo perform a change-in-service, all\nliquids, accumulated sludge, and petroleum vapors must be removed from the tank\nsystem prior to changing the stored substance. One of the following codes of\npractice (refer to section\n1.10\nof this Part for complete\ncitation of references) must be adhered to in order to comply with this\nparagraph: (a) API RP 1604, March\n1996; (b) API RP 2015, August\n2001; (c) API RP 2016, August\n2001; (d) NFPA 326, 2010\nedition; (e) PEI RP 1700, 2018\nedition; or\n(f) a code of practice\ndeveloped by a nationally recognized association or independent testing\nlaboratory and approved by the Department. (6)\nUST systems that have been permanently\nclosed may not be returned to service unless all components of the UST system\nmeet applicable requirements for the latest Category. (c) Assessing the site at\nclosure. (1)\n\nBefore permanent closure\nis completed, the facility must measure for the presence of a release where\ncontamination is most likely to be present at the UST system location. In\nselecting sample types, sample locations, and measurement methods, the\nfollowing must also be considered: method of closure; the petroleum stored; the\ntype of backfill; depth to groundwater; and other factors appropriate for\nidentifying the presence of a release. The requirements of this subdivision are\nsatisfied if: (i) at the time of permanent\nclosure, there is no physical evidence (\ni.e., contaminated\nsoils, contaminated groundwater, or petroleum as a liquid or vapor) that a\nrelease has occurred around the UST system; (ii)\nthe UST system was being monitored for\nleaks at weekly intervals using one of the methods listed under paragraphs\n2.3(c)(5) and (6) of this Subpart at the time of permanent closure; and\n(iii)\nthe leak detection method\nlisted under paragraph 2.3(c)(5) or (6) of this Subpart indicate that no\nrelease has occurred. (2)\n\nIf contaminated soils, contaminated groundwater, or petroleum as a liquid or\nvapor is discovered, corrective action must begin in accordance with Subpart 7\nof this Part. (d) For any\nUST system that has been out of service since December 27, 1986 and which has\nnot been properly permanently closed in accordance with this section or in\naccordance with prior Department regulations governing UST system closure, the\nUST system must be permanently closed and the excavation zone assessed for\nreleases, in accordance with this section. (e) Recordkeeping. Records\nrequired by this section must be retained for three years after permanent\nclosure, or until the facility has been permanently closed, whichever is later. Copies of these records must consist of the following: (1)\na report detailing that the tank was\npermanently closed in accordance with subparagraph (b)(5)(i), (ii), or (iii) of\nthis section (and which must be submitted to the Department within 30 days\nafter permanent closure); and\n(2)\na\nreport detailing the required site assessment in accordance with subdivision\n(c) of this section (and which must be submitted to the Department within 90\ndays after permanent closure).
