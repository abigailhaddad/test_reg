  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 354.3 - Applicability and rationale\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is applicable to all intake services rendered by probation\ndepartments in matters of the Family Court, regardless of nomenclature assigned\nby a probation department to such services. (b) The rationale for this Part is as\nfollows: (1)\n\nIntake services are rendered in\n\nFamily Court support proceedings, family offense and marital conciliation\nmatters pursuant to statute. In addition, the Family Court, by court order, has\nrequired the rendering of intake services in other matters which are not\notherwise statutorily mandated. (2)\n\nSpecifying criteria for intake decisionmaking serves to facilitate uniformity\nin decisionmaking. (3)\n\nSpecifying\nprocedures for intake decisionmaking serves to expedite decisions made and, therefore, the processing of cases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n354.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
