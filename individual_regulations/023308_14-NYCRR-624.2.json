  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 624.2 - Background and Intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is the\nintent of this Part to require an incident management system, including the\nreporting, investigation, review, correction, and monitoring of certain events\nor situations, in order to protect individuals receiving services (to the\nextent possible) from harm; ensure that individuals are free from abuse and\nneglect; and to enhance the quality of their services and care. (b) A primary function of the reporting of\ncertain events or situations is to enable a governing body (see glossary, section\n624.20\n), executives, administrators, and supervisors to become aware of problems; to take corrective\nmeasures; and to minimize the potential for recurrence of the same or similar\nevents or situations. The prompt reporting of these events and situations can\nensure that immediate steps are taken to protect persons receiving services\nfrom being exposed to the same or similar risk. (c) The reporting of certain events or\nsituations in an orderly and uniform manner facilitates identification of\ntrends, whether within a facility or class of facilities, by one or more\nagencies, or on a statewide basis, which ultimately allows for the development\nand implementation of preventive strategies. (d) It is the intent of this Part to require\na process whereby those events or situations that endanger a person's wellbeing\nwhile under the auspices of an agency, which are defined in section\n624.3\nof this Part as \"reportable\nincidents,\" and in section\n624.4\nas \"notable occurrences,\"\nare reported, investigated, and reviewed, and protective, corrective, and\nremedial actions are taken as necessary. (e) It is not the intent of this Part to\nmandate that every potentially harmful event or situation attributable to or\ninvolving a person receiving services while under the auspices of an agency, be\nrecorded as a reportable incident or notable occurrence in accordance with this\n\nPart. It is the responsibility of the agency to determine how\nevents or situations involving persons receiving services that are under the\nauspices of the agency or sponsoring agency, other than reportable incidents\nand notable occurrences are to be documented, processed, corrected, monitored, and analyzed for trends through the development of policies and procedures that\nare in compliance with 14 NYCRR, and to develop a mechanism for review to\nensure compliance with such policies and procedures. (f) It is the intent of this Part to require\na process whereby the governing body ensures the effectiveness of the\nidentification, recording, investigation, review, and corrective actions with\nregard to events or situations involving persons receiving services referenced\nwithin this Part. This must be achieved through the establishment of the\ngoverning body's own protocol, which may include, but not be limited to, regular review of the minutes of the incident review committee and periodic\nattendance at that committee's meetings. (g) It is the intent of this Part to hold the\ngoverning body and the chief executive officer (see glossary, section\n624.20\n) responsible for the\nmanagement of incidents. However, the chief executive officer may designate\nstaff members to assume specified responsibilities to facilitate the day to day\nprocess, and these designations must be set forth in writing in agency policies\nand procedures and made known to all staff and others with a need to\nknow. (h) Though failure on the\npart of an agency to provide appropriate services may not meet the definition\nof an incident or notable occurrence as defined in sections 624.3 or\n624.4\nof this Part, OPWDD has, pursuant to statute, the authority to investigate or cause the investigation of\nconduct, performance, and/or alleged neglect of duty. (i) It is the intent of this Part to require\na process for facilities that is in full compliance with the provisions of\nsection\n29.29\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law. (j) Facilities and programs that are certified or operated by OPWDD, except those\nprograms that are certified under paragraph 16.03(a)(4) or 16.03(a)(5) of the\n\nMental Hygiene Law, are required to comply with relevant provisions of Article\n20 of the Executive Law (Protection of People with Special Needs) and Article\n11 of the Social Services Law (Protection of People with Special Needs), and to\nimplement regulations promulgated by the Justice Center for the Protection of\n\nPeople with Special Needs (Justice Center).
