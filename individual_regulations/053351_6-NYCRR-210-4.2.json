  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 210-4.2 - Recall\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the results\nof the in-use emission tests indicate that the average emissions of the test\nengines for any regulated pollutant exceed the applicable emission standards\nspecified in title 13, California Code of Regulations, section 2442 (see Table\n1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), the entire\nengine population so represented shall be deemed to exceed the standards. The\ndepartment shall notify the engine manufacturer of the test results and upon\nreceipt of the notification, the engine manufacturer has 45 days to submit a\nplan, to the department, to make up all excess emissions resulting from in-use\ntesting noncompliance in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section. If\nexcess emissions cannot be made up in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection, the engine manufacturer must implement a voluntary recall plan in\naccordance with the applicable portions of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this\nsection. If no excess emissions cannot be made up in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section and the engine manufacturer does not implement\na voluntary recall plan, the commissioner may prescribe the implementation of\nan ordered recall pursuant to the applicable portions of paragraph (d)(2) of\nthis section. (b) All excess\nemissions resulting from in-use noncompliance with the California standard must\nbe made up in the model year following the model year in which the notification\nof noncompliance is received. In-use noncompliance may not be remedied through\nimplementation of the Federal in-use credit program described in title 40, Code\nof Federal Regulations, part 91, subpart N (October 4, 1996) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). As an\nalternative to recall and with prior approval from the department and the\nexecutive officer of CARB where appropriate, the engine manufacturer may make\nup the excess emissions by any one or combination of the following options: (1)\nrecertification of the noncompliant\nengine family to a lower emission level (or higher FEL) that makes up for the\nnoncompliance, while maintaining compliance on a corporate average\nbasis; (2)\nimplementation of a\nrunning change and/or field fix on the noncompliant engine family; (3)\nimplementation of market-based\nincentives, to be approved by the commissioner, to make up the noncompliance; or\n(4)\npayment of a noncompliance\npenalty to be determined by the department on a per-engine basis as provided by\narticle 71 of the Environmental Conservation Law. (c) Voluntary emission recalls. (1)\n\nWhen an engine manufacturer initiates a\nvoluntary emission recall campaign, the department shall be notified of the\nrecall at least 30 days before owner notification is to begin. The engine\nmanufacturer shall also submit a voluntary recall plan for approval, as\ndescribed in subdivision (d) of this section. A voluntary recall plan shall be\ndeemed approved by the department within 30 days after receipt of the recall\nplan unless objected to in the interim. (2)\n(i) When any engine manufacturer, based on enforcement test results or any other\ninformation provided to or required by the department proposes to initiate a\nvoluntary emission recall program, the engine manufacturer shall submit for\napproval by the department an emission recall plan as described in subdivision\n(d) of this section. The plan shall be submitted within 45 days following the\nreceipt of a notification from the department that enforcement test results or\nother information demonstrate an engine noncompliance. (ii)\n\nThe department shall approve the recall\nplan in writing if it contains the information specified in subdivision (d) of\nthis section where specified and is designed to notify the engine/watercraft\nowner and correct the noncompliance in an expeditious manner. Notification of\nengine/watercraft owners and the implementation of recall repairs shall\ncommence no later than the schedule specified under subparagraphs (d)(1)(iii)\nand (iv) of this section, respectively, unless the engine manufacturer can show\ngood cause for the department to extend the deadline. If the plan does not\ncontain the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section, the department shall\ndisapprove the plan in writing and require revisions where deemed necessary. The engine manufacturer may contest such a disapproval by requesting a hearing\npursuant to section 622 of the State Administrative Procedure Act. If no\nrequest for a hearing is made or the hearing upholds the disapproval, the\nengine manufacturer shall incorporate all requested revisions to the plan and\nbegin implementation of the recall plan within 60 days of receipt of the\ndisapproval. (iii)\n\nThe engine\nmanufacturer may also request a public hearing pursuant to the procedures set\nforth in section 622 of the State Administrative Procedure Act to contest the\nfinding of nonconformity and the need for an ordered recall. If such a hearing\noccurs and the nonconformity is confirmed therefrom, the engine manufacturer\nshall submit the recall plan required by paragraph (d)(2) of this section\nwithin 30 days after receipt of the hearing decision unless an extension is\ngranted by the department. (d) Voluntary and ordered recall plans. (1)\n\nThe recall plan for voluntary and ordered\nrecalls must be submitted to the commissioner for review and must contain the\nfollowing information unless otherwise specified: (i) a description of each class or category\nof engines recalled, including the number of engines to be recalled, the model\nyear, and such other information as may be required to identify the engines\nrecalled; (ii)\na description of the\nspecific modifications, alterations, repairs, corrections, adjustments or other\nchanges to be made to correct the engines affected by the emission-related\ndefect; (iii)\na description of the\nmethod by which the engine manufacturer will notify engine/watercraft\nowners; (iv)\na description of the\nprocedure to be followed by engine/watercraft owners to correct the\nnonconformity. This may include the date on or after which the\nengine/watercraft owner can have the nonconformity corrected, the time\nreasonably necessary to perform the labor to correct the nonconformity and the\ndesignation of facilities at which the nonconformity can be remedied; (v) a description of the class of persons\nother than dealers and authorized warranty agents of the engine manufacturer\nwho will remedy the defect; (vi)\na\ndescription of the system by which the engine manufacturer will assure that an\nadequate supply of parts is available to perform the repair under the plan, including the date by which an adequate supply of parts will be available to\ninitiate the repair campaign, and the method to be used to assure the supply\nremains both adequate and responsive to engine/watercraft owner\ndemand; (vii)\na copy of the letter\nof notification to be sent to engine/watercraft owners; and\n(viii)\na copy of all necessary instructions\nto be sent to those persons who are to perform the repair. (2)\n\nFor an ordered recall, the recall plan\nshall include the information required for voluntary recall plans as specified\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision. Additionally, it shall include the\nfollowing: (i) a plan describing how the\nmaximum feasible capture rate will be achieved for recalls based on either the\nexceedance of emission standard or on the failure of an emission-related\ncomponent; (ii)\nthe plan shall also\ninclude a schedule for implementing actions to be taken including identified\nincrements of progress towards implementation and deadlines for completion of\neach increment. If, after good faith efforts, the engine manufacturer cannot\nreach the maximum feasible capture rate by the applicable deadline, the engine\nmanufacturer must propose mitigation efforts to be approved by the commissioner\nthat will offset the emissions of the unrepaired engines; and\n(iii)\nthe engine manufacturer must not\ncondition repair of the noncomplying engine/watercraft on the proper\nmaintenance or use of the engine except for compelling reasons approved by the\ncommissioner. The engine manufacturer, however, is not obligated to repair a\ncomponent which has been removed or modified. (3)\n\nRecordkeeping and reporting requirements. (i) The engine manufacturer shall report on\nthe progress of the voluntary or ordered recall program by submitting a report\none year from the date owner notification begins and a final report an\nadditional year later. Such reports shall be submitted to the Chief, Bureau of\n\nMobile Sources, Division of Air Resources. For each class of engine subject to\nthe recall program, the yearly report shall contain: (a) engine family and emission recall\ncampaign number designated by the engine manufacturer; (b) date engine/watercraft owner notification\nwas begun, and date completed; (c) number of engines involved in the voluntary or ordered recall\ncampaign; (d) number of engines\nknown or estimated to be affected by the nonconformity and an explanation of\nhow this number was determined; (e) number of engines inspected pursuant to the voluntary or ordered recall\nplan; (f) number of inspected\nengines found to be affected by the nonconformity; (g) number of engines receiving repair under\nthe recall plan and a listing of these engines' engine identification\nnumbers; (h) number of engines\ndetermined to be ineligible for recall action due to removed or modified\nparts; (i) a copy of any service\nbulletins transmitted to dealers or other authorized repair facilities which\npertain to the nonconformity to be corrected and that have not previously been\nreported; and\n(j) a copy of all\ncommunications transmitted to engine/watercraft owners that relate to the\nnonconformity and that have not previously been submitted. (ii)\n\nIf the engine manufacturer determines\nthat any of the information submitted pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph has changed or was incorrect, revised information and an explanation\nmust be submitted. Responses to clauses (i)(f), (g), (h), (i) and (j) of this\nparagraph shall be cumulative totals. (iii)\n\nThe engine manufacturer shall maintain\nthe names and addresses of engine/watercraft owners: (a) to whom notification was given; (b) whose engines were repaired or inspected\nunder the recall plan; and\n(c) whose engines were determined not to qualify for repair due to removed or\nmodified components. (iv)\n\nAll reports shall be maintained for not\nless than three years beyond the useful life of the engines and shall be made\navailable to authorized personnel of the department upon request. (v) Penalties. Under an ordered recall, failure of the engine manufacturer to notify the engine/watercraft owners and\nrepair the engines in the manner specified in the recall plan constitutes a\nviolation of the Environmental Conservation Law and subjects the engine\nmanufacturer to penalties pursuant to article 71 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law.
