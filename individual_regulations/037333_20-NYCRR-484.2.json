  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 484.2 - Who must file a return\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 505\n\nEvery carrier who operates a motor vehicle in this State\nfor which a permit is required and every carrier to whom a permit, a trip-lease\npermit or emergency authorization was issued must file a quarterly or monthly\ntax return listing each motor vehicle for which a permit was issued, whether or\nnot a truck mileage tax is due. (See section\n484.5\nof\nthis Part.) Where no truck mileage tax is due, by reason of the election of the\nunloaded weight method of reporting, the carrier must also set forth the\nunloaded weight of each such vehicle. Example: A carrier has obtained permits for the following motor\nvehicles: Truck A with an unloaded weight of 7,500 pounds and a maximum gross\nweight of 18,500 pounds, Tractor B with an unloaded weight of 3,900 pounds and\na maximum gross weight of 22,400 pounds and Trailer C with a maximum gross\nweight of 18,500 pounds. If he elects to report on the unloaded weight basis, he\nmust file a quarterly return for the first calendar quarter of the year and\nevery calendar quarter thereafter, listing Truck A and Tractor B and setting\nforth the unloaded weight of each. Since the unloaded weight of the truck is\nless than 8,000 pounds and the unloaded weight of the tractor is less than\n4,000 pounds, no tax will be due, but quarterly returns will be required for\neach calendar quarter thereafter, and tax will be due at the time he operates a\ntruck with an unloaded weight of over 8,000 pounds or a tractor with an\nunloaded weight of over 4,000 pounds, or he elects to report on the maximum\ngross weight method. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n484.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
