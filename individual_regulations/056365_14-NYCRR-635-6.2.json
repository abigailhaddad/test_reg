(1)\n\nSuch determination shall be made on a case-by-case basis. (2)\n\nSuch determination shall be based on\nwhether the facts and circumstances of the transaction, the parties' situation\nand history, indicate that the party from whom the provider or individual\nreceiving services obtained the real property, equipment, goods, services or\nproperty is a related party. (3)\n\nIf\na transaction is between a provider (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part)\nor individual receiving services and a party not presumed to be a related party\n(under subdivision [b] or [d] of this section, OPWDD nevertheless can determine\nthat the transaction is between related parties (using the criteria in\nparagraph [2] of this subdivision), where the party transacting with the\nprovider or individual receiving services directly or indirectly obtained the\nreal property, equipment, goods, services or property in question from someone\nor an organization (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part) presumed to be\nrelated to the provider or individual (under subdivision [b] or [c] of this\nsection). (b) The\nexistence of any of the conditions in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this\nsubdivision will create a presumption that the transaction is between a\nprovider and a related party. (1)\n\nThe\nprovider is a partnership and the other party to the transaction is a partner\nof the provider. (2)\n\nThe provider\nis a corporation and the other party to the transaction is an officer, director, trustee, principal stockholder (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this\n\nPart) or controlling party (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part) of the\nprovider.

(5)\n\nThe provider is an unincorporated\nassociation and the other party to the transaction is either: (i) someone who is a member of the\nprovider; (ii)\nsomeone, a member of\nwhose immediate family is a member of the provider; (iii)\na partnership in which one partner is a\nmember of the provider; (iv)\na\ncorporation in which a member of the provider is an officer, director, trustee, principal stockholder or controlling party; (v) a corporation in which a member of the\nprovider has an immediate family member who is an officer, director, trustee, principal stockholder or controlling party; (vi)\na corporation in which any partnership, in which a member of the provider is a partner, is a principal\nstockholder; (vii)\na corporation in\nwhich a co-partner of a member of the provider is an officer, director, trustee, principal stockholder or controlling party; or\n(viii)\na corporation in which another\ncorporation is a principal stockholder, where a member of the provider is an\nofficer, director, trustee, principal stockholder or a controlling party of\nsuch other corporation. (6)\n\nThe other party to the transaction is a\nspecial purpose organization (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this\n\nPart).

(d) The existence of any of the\nconditions in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this subdivision will create a\npresumption that the transaction is between an individual receiving services\nand a related party.
