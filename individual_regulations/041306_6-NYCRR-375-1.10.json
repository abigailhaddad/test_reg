  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-1.10 - Citizen participation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To\nfacilitate the remedial process and enable citizens to participate more fully\nin decisions that affect their health, the department will require the\nprovision of opportunities for citizen involvement and will encourage\nconsultation with the public early in that process before the department forms\nor adopts final positions. The primary goals of the citizen participation\nprogram at sites are to facilitate two-way communication between the department\nand individuals, groups, and organizations that have expressed interest in or\nare affected by the site or the site's program, in the decisionmaking process\nassociated with the remediation of sites. The department will require that\nopportunities for public involvement be included in the development and\nimplementation of a remedy. (b) All\nremedial programs shall include citizen participation activities which, at a\nminimum, shall include, but are not limited to, the preparation of a citizen\nparticipation plan, establishment of a document repository and public notice\nwith a prescribed comment period at select milestones. Program specific\nrequirements for these and other citizen participation activities are set forth\nunder each of the Subparts of this Part. (c) The design of any citizen participation\nplan, including the level of citizen involvement and the tools utilized, shall\ntake into account the scope and scale of the proposed remedial program, local\ninterest and history, and other relevant factors. While retaining flexibility, citizen participation plans shall embody the following principles of meaningful\ncitizen participation: (1)\nopportunities for\ncitizen involvement should be provided as early as possible in the\ndecisionmaking process prior to the selection of a preferred course of action\nby the department and/or the remedial party; (2)\nactivities proposed in such plan should\nbe as reflective of the diversity of interests and perspective found within the\ncommunity as possible, allowing the public the opportunity to have their views\nheard and considered, which may include opportunities for dialogue; and\n(3)\nfull, timely, and\naccessible disclosure and sharing of information by the department shall be\nprovided, including the provision of technical data and the assumptions upon\nwhich any analyses are based. (d) Within 20 days of the effective date of\nthe order, agreement or State assistance contract, the remedial party shall\nsubmit a citizen participation plan which shall include the following minimum\nelements: (1)\na site contact list; (2)\nthe name and address of a document\nrepository and proof of acceptance of this designation by the\nrepository; (3)\noverview of the\nsite's history and contamination issues; (4)\nidentification of major issues of public\nconcern related to the site and a description of any mitigation planned to\naddress the issues, if appropriate; (5)\na description and schedule of the major\nelements of the site's remedial program; (6)\na description and schedule of citizen\nparticipation activities conducted or planned relative to the site; and\n(7)\na description and schedule\nof any additional citizen participation activities needed to address public\nconcerns. (e) All\ncitizen participation plans and fact sheets required by the department will be\nsubject to department review and approval. The citizen participation plan will\nbe updated during the implementation of the remedial program. (f) Document repository. A document\nrepository shall be established at a location accessible to citizens where they\ncan review the remedial program documents. (1)\n\nDocuments shall be placed in the\nrepository, which are: (i) approved by the\ndepartment as set forth in section\n375-1.6\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart; or\n(ii)\notherwise\ndesignated by the department for inclusion. (2)\n\nThe remedial party shall ensure that all\nappropriate documents are in the repository. (3)\n\nThe department may allow an internet\nrepository to be used to satisfy this requirement. (g) Comment period extensions. (1)\n\nThe department shall consider a request\nto extend a comment period provided such request is received within five days\nprior to the identified end of the comment period. (2)\n\nThe time allotted for extensions shall\nnot be greater than 30 days. (3)\n\nAdditional notice is not required upon granting an extension. (h) Interim remedial measures. For\ninterim remedial measures, the department will not require citizen\nparticipation activities unless the scope of the IRM is likely to represent the\nremedy or a significant portion of the remedy, in which event the department\nwill require a 30-day comment period.
