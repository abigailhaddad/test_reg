  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 206.19 - Bifurcated trials\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Judges are encouraged to order a\nbifurcated trial of the issues of liability and damages in any action for\npersonal injury where it appears that bifurcation may assist in a clarification\nor simplification of issues and a fair and more expeditious resolution of the\naction. (b) Where a\nbifurcated trial is ordered, the issues of liability and damages shall be\nsevered and the issue of liability shall be tried first, unless the court\norders otherwise. (c) In the event of a claimant's judgment on the issue of liability or a\ndefendant's judgment on the issue of liability on a counterclaim, the damage\nphase of the trial shall be conducted as soon as possible before the same\njudge, unless the judge presiding over the trial, for reasons stated in the\nrecord, finds such procedure to be impracticable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n206.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
