  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2186.4 - Funding criteria and funding determination process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Grant limits. (1)\n\nGrants will be limited to a maximum of\n$5,000 for each unit of affordable housing to be contructed or rehabilitated in\nconjunction with the infrastructure improvements relating thereto. Grant funds\nprovided under the program may be used only to pay for eligible costs as\ndefined herein. The agency shall determine the number of units in any project\nwhich are to be considered affordable housing units for the purpose of\ncalculating the grant amount. In so doing the agency may rely on the definition\nof affordable housing unit used in the affordable housing program also\nproviding funds for the affordable housing projects in conjunction with the\nIDDP. (2)\n\nNot less than 45 percent\nof the total amount appropriated shall be made available for projects located\nin cities, towns or villages having a population of less than 20,000 persons; not less than 30 percent in localities having a population of 20,000 to 30,000\npersons, with the remaining amount(s) available (not to exceed 25 percent of\nthe total amount) in places with a population of more than 30,000 persons. Population of a city, town, or village shall be determined by reference to the\n1980 United States Census of Population unless alternative methods of\ncalculation are approved by the agency. (b) Minimum program requirements. To be\nconsidered for funding under the program, the application must, at a minimum, satisfy the following requirements: (1)\n\nAn\napplication shall have been made to a Federal, State or local entity to receive\nfunds for the construction or rehabilitation of an affordable housing project\nwhich shall be the same project for which IDDP funds are applied. Such\napplications for an affordable housing project may include, but are not limited\nto, applications to the Farmer's Home Administration, the United States\n\nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development, the New York State Housing Finance\n\nAgency, the New York State Affordable Housing Corporation, the State of New\n\nYork Mortgage Agency, the New York State Housing Trust Fund Corporation, the\n\nNew York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the New York State\n\nDepartment of Social Services, or any local governing body. The funds to be\napplied for may be, but are not limited to, mortgage loan financing, Federal\ncommunity development block grants, urban development action grants, section 8\nassistance payments, rental rehabilitation grants, housing development grants, homeless housing assistance program funds, local subsidies in the form of cash\ngrants and the like. Mortgage insurance does not qualify as funds for purposes\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe application\nto receive funds for the affordable housing project shall be an application\nsubmitted by the eligible applicant. For purposes of this Part, the agency may, as it considers appropriate, deem an application to receive funds for an\naffordable housing project to have been submitted by an otherwise eligible\napplicant if the eligible applicant has endorsed the application by its\nexecution and transmittal of a document or documents acceptable to the agency. In order to deem such application to have been submitted by the eligible\napplicant the agency may, whenever it considers it appropriate, require that\nthe eligible applicant have an interest in the project such as a joint venture\narrangement, partial ownership or partnership interest therein. Such\napplication shall be deemed to have been made by an otherwise eligible\napplicant if it is the successor in interest in the application through an\nassignment thereof. In no event, however, shall an eligible applicant assign\nits application for IDDP funds (i) without the agency's consent or (ii) to\nanyone other than another eligible applicant. In the event that an application\nis made for an affordable housing project under a local government or community\nprogram, the criteria used by the local government or community to determine\naffordability shall be defined and must be acceptable by the agency. (3)\n\nFunds for infrastructure improvements\nawarded under the program must reduce the cost of the new construction or\nrehabilitation of affordable housing projects below that cost otherwise\nattainable and such reduced cost must correspondingly reduce the cost of\nhousing to the occupants of such housing. (4)\n\nThe funds made available under the\nprogram must be used to increase locally funded operating or capital\nexpenditures instead of substituting for funds which the unit of local\ngovernment would otherwise have allocated to provide infrastructure\nimprovements through its normal budgetary process in the absence of the\nIDDP. (5)\n\nThe affordable housing\nproject must not result in the permanent displacement of low- or\nmoderate-income residents on the site of the infrastructure improvements except\npursuant to a plan approved by the agency which provides for alternative\nhousing which is affordable to the relocated household(s). Any temporary\nrelocation of residents must also be carried out in accordance with a plan\nwhich will be subject to the approval of the agency and which provides for\nrelocation within a reasonable distance from the project site and for a\nreasonable period of time. (6)\n\nThe\neligible applicant must agree to comply with the agency's affirmative action\nand equal opportunity requirements established by statute. (7)\n\nThe eligible applicant must agree to\ncomply with the requirements of SEQRA and SHPA. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
