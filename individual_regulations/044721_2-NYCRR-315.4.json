The\nelected or appointed official should extend the period of his or her record of\nwork activities by the amount of time utilized for vacations, illness, holidays\nor other reasons during the three-month period. The record of work activities\nmust represent months that are not unusually slow or busy. If a position is\nseasonal in nature, the record of work activities should be kept for an\nextended period of up to twelve months to capture an accurate account of work\nactivities In recording the description of work activities, such elected or\nappointed official shall include the start and end time of each activity\nperformed. The elected or appointed official may also include activities\nperformed outside the normal working hours that require his or her attention to\nattend to official duties, including responding to an emergency, attending an\nemployer sponsored event or meeting with or responding to members of the public\non matters of official business. During a period that an elected or appointed\nofficial is required to be on-call, he or she may only record the time actually\nspent performing a work-related activity. The elected or appointed official may\nnot include activities that would not be considered work-related such as\nattending electoral or campaign events, socializing after town board meetings\nor attending a candidates' forum. The elected or appointed official's initial three-month\nrecord of work activities shall be completed within 150 days of commencing a\nnew or subsequent term of office, or upon joining the Retirement System, on or\nafter August 12, 2009. The elected or appointed official must sign the record\nof work activities attesting to its accuracy and submit it to the secretary or\nclerk of the governing board within 30 days of completion. Each such record of\nwork activities and any subsequent recertification shall be retained by the\nemployer for a period of at least thirty years and full and complete copies\nthereof shall be provided to the State Comptroller upon his or her request. A\nrecord of work activities shall not be valid for more than eight years from the\ndate it was initially maintained. If the hours worked have not substantially or\nmaterially increased or decreased during the eight year period, the elected or\nappointed official may certify to such in writing to the governing board in\nlieu of maintaining a new record of work activities. The elected or appointed\nofficial must submit this certification to the governing board within 180 days\nof taking a subsequent term of office. If the hours worked have substantially\nincreased or decreased during the eight year period, the elected and appointed\nofficial must prepare, sign and submit a new record of\nactivities. (ii)\n\nIn the\nevent the elected or appointed official or the employer determines the initial\nrecording of work activities for a period of three consecutive months is not\nrepresentative of the average number of hours worked by the elected or\nappointed official, he or she must record work activities during the same\ncalendar year for an alternative period of three consecutive months which is\nrepresentative of the average number of hours worked by such official. Such\nrecord of work activities shall be signed by such elected or appointed official\nand submitted to the secretary or clerk of the governing board within thirty\ndays of the completion of the record. The failure of an elected or appointed official to record, sign and submit a record of work activities within the required time frame\nshall result in the suspension of service crediting and Retirement System\nmembership benefits. The suspension of service crediting will remain in effect\nuntil such time as the elected or appointed official completes a record of work\nactivities that complies with the requirements of this regulation and submits\nit to the secretary or clerk of the governing board. The record of work\nactivities must be submitted to the secretary or clerk prior to the elected or\nappointed official ending service in that title. (b) Completion of the Standard Work Day and\n\nReporting Resolution. In addition to the reporting requirements set forth in\nsubpart 315.3 of this Part, and for the sole purpose of reporting days worked\nto the Retirement System, the governing board of a participating employer of an\nelected or appointed official shall establish, by resolution, a standard work\nday for each elective or appointive office or position using the Standard Work\n\nDay and Reporting Resolution form provided by the Retirement System or a form\nor format approved by the Retirement System.

For each elected or appointed official who is not paid hourly or does\nnot participate in an employer's time keeping system that consists of a daily\nrecord of actual time worked and time charged to accruals and who has submitted\na record of work activities pursuant to paragraph (i) of subdivision (a) of\nthis section, the employer shall indicate the average number of days worked per\nmonth in the Resolution. In the event that the official has not recorded and\nsubmitted to the secretary or clerk of the governing board his or her record of\nwork activities for a period of three consecutive months the employer shall so\nindicate in the Resolution. The governing board shall determine whether\nactivities listed on the record of work activities are official duties of the\nposition. Activities that do not consist of official duties as described in\nparagraph (i) of subdivision (a) of this section are to be excluded from the\ncalculation of the average number of days worked per month to be listed on the\n\nStandard Workday and Reporting Resolution Such Standard Work Day and Reporting\n\nResolution shall be adopted at the first regular meeting held after a record of\nwork activities has been submitted. In the event an elected or appointed\nofficial submits a new record of work activities pursuant to Paragraph (ii)\nsubdivision (a) of this section, the governing board must pass an additional\nresolution for that individual amending the average number of days worked per\nmonth based on such record of work activities.

The elected or appointed official's Social Security Number (last four\ndigits) and Registration Number must be omitted from the copy of the Standard\n\nWork Day and Reporting Resolution that is publicly posted. A certified copy of\nthe Standard Work Day and Reporting Resolution and an affidavit of posting\nshall be filed by the secretary or clerk of the governing board with the Office\nof the State Comptroller within 15 days after the public posting period has\nended. The failure of the governing board to adopt such Standard Work Day and\n\nReporting Resolution shall result in the suspension of service crediting and\n\nRetirement System membership benefits for the elected or appointed official\nuntil such time as the Standard Work Day and Reporting Resolution is adopted, posted and filed with the Comptroller. In the event the governing board submits\nan additional Standard Work Day and Reporting Resolution amending the average\nnumber of days worked per month for an elected or an appointed official\npursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, such additional Standard Work Day\nand Reporting Resolution shall be subject to the posting and filing\nrequirements set forth in this subdivision. (d) Reporting Days Worked on the Monthly\n(Quarterly/Semi-Annual/ Annual) Report. Once a Standard Work Day and Reporting Resolution is passed, the average number of days worked per month listed on the Standard Work Day and\n\nReporting Resolution must be provided to the individual(s) responsible for\nreporting days worked to the Retirement System on the employer's behalf. These\nindividual(s) must ensure that the days worked reported on the Standard Work\n\nDay and Reporting Resolution are accurately converted to correspond with the\nofficial's payroll frequency and recorded on the report submitted to the\n\nRetirement System. In the event that the report submitted to the Retirement\n\nSystem does not reflect the average days worked per month documented on a\n\nStandard Work Day and Reporting Resolution, then retroactive adjustments must\nbe submitted for the period covered by the corresponding record of work\nactivities. A record of work activities submitted by an elected or\nappointed official, pursuant to section\n315.4, should be used as the basis\nfor his or her days worked reported for prior terms served in the same title, if no record of work activities was submitted for the prior\nterms.
