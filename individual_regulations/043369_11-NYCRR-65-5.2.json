  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 65-5.2 - Investigations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The superintendent may investigate any reports made pursuant to Insurance Law section 405, allegations, or other information in the superintendent's possession, regarding providers of health services engaging in any of the unlawful activities set forth in Insurance Law section 5109(b). After conducting an investigation, the superintendent will send to the Commissioner of Health or the Commissioner of Education, as appropriate, a list of any providers who or that the superintendent believes may have engaged in any of the unlawful activities set forth in Insurance Law section 5109(b), together with a description of the grounds for inclusion on the list. Within 45 days of receipt of the list, the Commissioner of Health or Commissioner of Education shall notify the superintendent in writing whether he or she confirms that the superintendent has a reasonable basis to proceed with notice and a hearing for determining whether any of the listed providers should be deauthorized from demanding or requesting any payment for medical services in connection with any claim under Insurance Law article 51. (b) The Commissioner of Health and the Commissioner of Education also may investigate any reports, allegations, or other information in their possession, regarding providers engaging in any of the unlawful activities set forth in Insurance Law section 5109(b). If either commissioner conducts an investigation, then that commissioner, or the superintendent, if requested by the commissioner, shall be responsible for providing notice and an opportunity to be heard to the providers of health services that they are subject to deauthorization from demanding or requesting any payment for medical services in connection with any claim under Insurance Law article 51. Nothing in this section, however, shall preclude the superintendent, Commissioner of Health, or Commissioner of Education from conducting joint investigations and hearings, or the Commissioner of Health or Commissioner of Education from conducting professional misconduct proceedings against the providers of health services pursuant to the Public Health Law or title VIII of the Education Law.
