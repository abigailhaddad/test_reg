  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 228-1.3 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nAny facility operating a coating line subject to this\n\nSubpart must comply with the following general requirements as\nspecified. (a) Opacity. (1)\n\nNo person shall cause or allow emissions\nto the outdoor atmosphere having an average opacity of 20 percent or greater\nfor any consecutive six-minute period from any emission source subject to this\n\nSubpart. (b) Recordkeeping. (1)\n\nExcept as provided for in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the owner or operator of any emission source\nsubject to this Subpart must maintain and, upon request, provide the department\nwith a certification from the coating supplier/manufacturer which lists the\nparameters used to determine the actual VOC content of each as applied coating\nused at the facility. In addition, purchase, usage and/or production records of\nthe coating material, including solvents, must be maintained in a format\nacceptable to the department and, upon request, these records must be submitted\nto the department within 90 days of receiving the request. Any facility\nrequired to perform the overall removal efficiency calculation set forth in\nequation 2 of section\n228-1.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, must maintain records to verify the parameters used in the\ncalculation. A facility owner or operator must maintain a record that\nidentifies each air cleaning device that has an overall removal efficiency of\nat least 90 percent. Any additional information required to determine\ncompliance with this Part must be provided to the department in a format\nacceptable to the department. All records required by this paragraph must be\nmaintained at the facility for a period of five years. (2)\n\nOwners and operators of emission sources\nnot subject to this Subpart as set forth in section\n228-1.1\n(b)(9) or\n(13)\nof this Subpart, or those sources that\nare using coatings not subject to specific requirements of this Subpart as set\nforth in paragraph (e)(2) of this section, or section\n228-1.4\n(b)(5)(iii)(e), (i) or\n(iv)\nof this Subpart, must maintain records\non an as used basis. The records must include the relevant regulatory citation\nof each exemption and quantity of coating used. If the exemption criteria are\nbased on VOC usage, the records must contain calculations and\nsupplier/manufacturer material data sheets for verification of VOC usage. All\nrecords required by this paragraph must be maintained at the facility for a\nperiod of five years. (c) Prohibition of sale or specification. (1)\n\nNo\nperson shall sell, supply, offer for sale, solicit, use, specify, or require\nfor use, the application of a coating on a part or product at a facility with a\ncoating line described in section\n228-1.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart if such sale, specification, or use is prohibited by any of the\nprovisions of this Subpart. The prohibition shall apply to all written or oral\ncontracts under the terms of which any coating is to be applied to any part or\nproduct at an affected facility. This prohibition shall not apply to the\nfollowing: (i) coatings utilized at surface\ncoating lines where control equipment has been installed to meet the maximum\npermitted VOC content limitations specified in the tables of section\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart; (ii)\ncoatings utilized at surface coating\nlines where a coating system is used which meets the requirements specified in\nsection\n228-1.5\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart; and\n(iii)\ncoatings\nutilized at surface coating lines that have been granted variances pursuant to\nsection\n228-1.5\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nAny person\nselling a coating for use in a coating line subject to this Part must, upon\nrequest, provide the user with certification of the VOC content of the coating\nsupplied. (d) Handling, storage and disposal of volatile organic compounds. Within the work area(s)\nassociated with a coating line, the owner or operator of a facility subject to\nthis Subpart must: (1)\nuse closed, non-leaking containers to store or dispose of cloth or other absorbent\napplicators impregnated with VOC solvents that are used for surface\npreparation, cleanup or coating removal; (2)\nstore in closed, non-leaking containers\nspent or fresh VOC solvents to be used for surface preparation, cleanup or\ncoating removal; (3)\nnot use VOC\nsolvents to cleanup spray equipment unless equipment is used to collect the\ncleaning compounds and to minimize VOC evaporation; (4)\nnot use open containers to store or\ndispense surface coatings and/or inks unless production, sampling, maintenance\nor inspection procedures require operational access. This provision does not\napply to the actual device or equipment designed for the purpose of applying a\ncoating material to a substrate. These devices may include, but are not limited\nto: spray guns, flow coaters, dip tanks, rollers, knife coaters, and extrusion\ncoaters; (5)\nnot use open\ncontainers to store or dispose of spent surface coatings, or spent VOC\nsolvents; (6)\nminimize spills\nduring the handling and transfer of coatings and VOC solvents; and\n(7)\nclean hand held spray guns by one of the\nfollowing: (i) an enclosed spray gun cleaning\nsystem that is kept closed when not in use; (ii)\nnon-atomized discharge of VOC solvent\ninto a paint waste container that is kept closed when not in use; (iii)\ndisassembling and cleaning of the spray\ngun in a vat that is kept closed when not in use; or\n(iv)\natomized spray into a paint waste\ncontainer that is fitted with a device designed to capture atomized VOC solvent\nemissions. (e) General control requirements for the emission of VOCs. (1)\n\nOnly facilities subject to this Subpart\nin accordance with section 228- 1.1(a)(1) of this Subpart must comply with the\ncompliant material requirements of section\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart. (2)\nA facility containing a coating line\n(other than a class A coating line) may use up to 55 gallons of coatings\n(facility wide) on a 12-month rolling total basis which does not comply with\nthe VOC content limits set forth in section\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart; provided\nsuch use is recorded in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (b)(2) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nFacilities\noperating a class A coating line or most class B coating lines, as specified in\nsection\n228-1.4\nof this Subpart must use\none or more of the following application techniques to apply the coating: (i) flow/curtain coating; (ii)\ndip coating; (iii)\ncotton-tipped swab\napplication; (iv)\nelectro-deposition coating; (v) high volume low pressure spraying; (vi)\nelectrostatic spray; (vii)\nairless spray, (including air\nassisted); (viii)\nairbrush\napplication methods for stenciling, lettering, and other identification\nmarkings; or\n(ix)\nother coating\napplication methods approved by the department which can demonstrate transfer\nefficiencies equivalent to or greater than high volume low pressure\nspray.
