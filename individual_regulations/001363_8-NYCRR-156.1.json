The commissioner may grant a waiver\nof this requirement for contracts or contract extensions covering school years\nprior to the school year beginning July 1, 1996, provided districts file with\nthe department detailed documentation allocating the total contract expense\nbetween to and from school and other purpose transportation services. (d) Bid specifications shall not include\nspecial requirements relating to buses, drivers, maintenance and service\nfacilities, the exclusive use of buses, or any other matter which tends to\nrestrict competitive bidding. The commissioner may authorize special\nrequirements which are essential due to special circumstances. No bid shall be\naccepted which is contingent on a discount if one or more other bids are also\naccepted. No bid may be rejected for failure to meet a specification which\nunduly restricts competitive bidding. (e) [Reserved]\n(f) A board of education or the trustee of a\npublic school district and a contractor shall not materially modify an approved\ntransportation contract except where such modification is necessary to comply\nwith any Federal, State or local law, rule or regulation imposed after the\nexecution of such contract or to enhance pupil safety and/or result in savings\nconsistent with maintaining pupil safety. The school district shall provide\nsatisfactory documentation to the commissioner of the enhancements in pupil\nsafety and/or of any increased savings consistent with maintaining pupil safety\nthat may result from the proposed amendment. Demonstrable enhancements in pupil\nsafety shall include, but not be limited to: two-way radios or other\ncommunication devices, video cameras, and perimeter motion detector systems. Such amendments shall result in no additional cost to the State, locality, or\nschool district.
