(f) Air contamination source or emission source. Any apparatus, contrivance or machine capable of causing\nemission of any air contaminant to the outdoor atmosphere, including any\nappurtenant exhaust system or air cleaning device. Where a process at an\nemission unit uses more than one apparatus, contrivance or machine in\ncombination, the combination may be considered a single emission\nsource. (g) Air\npollution. The presence in the outdoor atmosphere of one or more\ncontaminants in quantities, of characteristics and of a duration which are or\nmay be injurious to human, plant or animal life or to property or which\nunreasonably interfere with the comfortable enjoyment of life and\nproperty. (h) Annual. Refers to a period of time based upon a calendar year\ncommencing January 1st and terminating midnight December 31st. (i) Attainment area. Any area of the State meeting all National Ambient Air\n\nQuality Standards (NAAQS) for a specific air contaminant as designated pursuant\nto section 107(d) of the Federal Clean Air Act. (\nNote: A list\nof such areas may be obtained from any office of the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation.)\n(j) Best available control technology\n(BACT). An emission limitation or equipment standard based on the\nmaximum degree of reduction of each contaminant emitted from stationary air\ncontamination source which the department determines is achievable for such\nsource on a case-by-case basis considering: (1)\nprocess, fuels and raw material available\nand to be used; (2)\nengineering\naspects of the application of various types of control technology which has\nbeen adequately demonstrated; (3)\nprocess and fuel changes; (4)\nrespective costs of the application of all such control technologies, process\nchanges, alternative fuels, etc.; (5)\napplicable State and Federal emission\nstandards. In no event shall application of BACT result in emissions\nof any contaminant which will exceed the emissions allowed by any applicable\nstandard established. (k) By-product coke oven\nbattery. A process for the destructive distillation of coal and\nseparation of gaseous and liquid distillates from the carbon residue or coke, which includes ovens, charging systems (including larry cars, jumper pipes, charging conveyors from coal storage and/or weigh bins), auxiliary gas\ncollection systems, heating systems and flues, pushing systems, door machines, mud trucks, quench cars, quenching systems, desulfurization systems, sulfur\nrecovery units, waste heat stacks and air cleaning devices or control equipment\n(including oven patching equipment, door hoods, sheds and other hoods either\nmovable or stationary and with or without water sprays).

This\nincludes ASTM grade numbers 1 and 2 fuel oil, ASTM grade numbers 1-D and 2-D\ndiesel fuel oil and proposed ASTM grade numbers 1-GT and 2-GT gas turbine fuel\noil. (s) Emission. The release of any air contaminant into the outdoor\natmosphere. (t) Emission point. Any conduit, chimney, duct, vent, flue, stack or opening of\nany kind through which air contaminants are emitted to the outdoor\natmosphere. (u) Emission rate potential. The maximum rate at which a specified air contaminant from\nan emission source would be emitted to the outdoor atmosphere in the absence of\nany control equipment. The emission rate potential of a specified air\ncontaminant from an emission source is calculated by dividing the weight of\nsuch contaminant (expressed in pounds) that would be emitted to the outdoor\natmosphere during maximum emission conditions in the absence of any control\nequipment, by the duration (expressed in hours) of such emissions. When an air\ncontaminant is emitted for a period equal to or less than one hour, the\nemission rate potential is the weight of the contaminant emitted in the absence\nof any control equipment, divided by one hour, except that for any toxic air\ncontaminant specified by the commissioner, the duration of emissions used in\ncalculating the emission rate potential may be less than one hour. The maximum\nemission rate used for calculating the emission rate potential is not the\nemission rate during catastrophic or malfunction conditions. (v) Emission test.

(ci)\n\nMaintenance area. Any geographic region of the United States previously\ndesignated nonattainment under the act and subsequently redesignated to\nattainment subject to the requirement to develop a maintenance plan under\nsection 175A of the act, as amended (see section\n200.9\nof this\n\nPart). (cj)\nPM-2.5.

(ck)\n\nExempt VOCs. The organic compounds listed in the paragraphs of this\nsubdivision do not constitute VOCs for purposes of determining permitting\napplicability, demonstrating compliance with a VOC emission limit or VOC\ncontent requirement, or calculating operating permit program fees. These\ncompounds are considered to be VOCs for purposes of all VOC recordkeeping and\nemissions reporting requirements and are considered regulated air contaminants\nfor the purposes of Subpart 202-2, Emission Reporting Requirements; (1)\ntertiary butyl acetate. (cl)\n\nRoutine maintenance, repair, or replacement. Whether work done at an emissions source constitutes\nroutine maintenance, repair, or replacement is determined on a case-by-case\nbasis by examining factors such as the nature and extent, purpose, frequency, and cost of the work. Although no single factor is conclusive, generally\nroutine maintenance, repair, or replacement work is undertaken on a prescribed\nor regular schedule, limited in scope, and typically paid for out of the\noperation and maintenance budget of the facility. Work that is infrequent, extensive in scope, intended to extend the life expectancy of an emission\nsource, or intended to result in regaining lost capacity or availability is\nless likely to constitute routine maintenance, repair or\nreplacement.
