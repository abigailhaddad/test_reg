  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.17 - Group (formerly combined return) New York State nonresident personal income tax return for nonresident partners\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. A partnership, including a\nlimited liability partnership or a limited liability company that is treated as\na partnership for Federal tax purposes, required to file a New York State\npartnership return pursuant to section\n658 (c)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n151.4\nof\nthis Part) may be granted approval by the Department of Taxation and Finance to\nfile a New York State nonresident personal income tax group return for\nnonresident partners (hereinafter referred to in this section as group return)\non behalf of its qualified partners or limited liability company members\n(hereinafter referred to in this section as partners) who elect to have the\npartnership or limited liability company (hereinafter referred to in this\nsection as partnership) file on their behalf. The provisions of section\n151.1\nof this Part, Parts 106 and 140 of this Title and section\n185.3\n(j) of this Title will not apply if an election is made and permission is granted\npursuant to this section. All participating partners must have the same\naccounting period. (b) (1)\n\nRequest for permission. A partnership\nelecting to file a group return on behalf of its participating partners must\nrequest permission to do so by submitting an application on a form prescribed\nby the department for such purpose (or replica, reproduction, computer-prepared\nform or other such form containing the prescribed information). The application\nmust be accompanied by an individual power of attorney (or other evidence of\nauthority acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance) for each\nparticipating partner authorizing a common partner to represent such\nparticipating partner in making, executing, or filing the return. The request\nmust be sent to the Assistant Director, Registration and Licensing Services\n\nBureau, New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, Building 8, Room\n408, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. Request for permission to file a\ngroup return must be made by the 30th day following the close of the taxable\nyear for which the election is requested. Permission to file a group return\nwill be restricted to partnerships which have more than 10 electing qualified\nnonresident partners in each taxable year. Upon receipt of a properly completed\napplication, the department will determine whether or not the initial approval\nwill be granted and will notify the partnership accordingly. The department's\napproval to file a group return is tentative pending receipt of the final group\nreturn, and subject to revision or revocation on audit. A return filed on a\ngroup basis does not constitute a request for permission to file a group\nreturn. A request to file a group return must include the following\ninformation: (i) the exact name and address of\nthe partnership as shown on the New York State partnership return; and\n(ii)\nthe first taxable year for\nwhich the group return will be filed. (2)\n\nIf subsequent to filing an application, a\nqualified partner not included in the application elects to participate in the\nfiling of a group return, such partner must submit an individual power of\nattorney or other evidence acceptable to the Department of Taxation and Finance\nauthorizing the established common partner to represent such partner in making, executing, or filing the return. The power of attorney or other acceptable\nevidence of authority required for those partners electing to participate after\nthe filing of the application must be attached to the first group return filed\non behalf of such partner. (c) Definition of a qualified nonresident\npartner. The term qualified nonresident partner means a partner who meets all\nof the following conditions: (1)\nthe partner\nmust be a nonresident of New York State for the entire taxable year; (2)\nthe partner must have maintained no\npermanent place of abode in New York State at any time during the taxable\nyear; (3)\nthe partner or the\npartner's spouse must: (i) have no New York\nsource income, as determined under section\n132.2\nof this Subchapter, other than the partner's distributive share of partnership\nincome, as determined under Part 137 of this Title, allocated to New York\n\nState. However, nonresident partners with New York source income from sources\nother than their distributive share of partnership income may be eligible to\nfile on a group return under the provisions of section\n151.21\nof this Part; (ii)\nnot be subject\nto the minimum income tax (see section\n602\nof the\n\nTax Law); or\n(iii)\nnot be subject\nto the separate tax on the ordinary income portion of a lump sum distribution\n(see section\n603\nof the Tax Law); and\n(4)\nthe partner must waive the\nright to claim: (i) the New York standard or\nitemized deduction; (ii)\ndependent\nexemptions; (iii)\nany credits\nagainst New York State personal income tax; and\n(iv)\na New York State deduction resulting\nfrom a capital loss carryover or a net operating loss carryback or carryover, as determined pursuant to section\n132.7\nof this Title (i.e., either determined before filing, at the time of filing, or\nafter filing). (d) Form of return on group basis. The group\nreturn is required to be filed on the form prescribed by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance and in the manner prescribed by the department. The group\nreturn must contain the special identifying number which will be assigned to\neach partnership upon approval by the department. This special identifying\nnumber will remain in effect each year unless reassigned or revoked. The group\nreturn must be signed by a common partner having legal authority to act as\nagent for all participating partners. In such case, the partner signing the\nreturn and each participating partner are individually responsible for his or\nher part in making and signing the return. Each such common partner or\nparticipating partner, as the case may be, will incur liability for those\npenalties provided by the Tax Law that may be imposed with respect to such\nindividual's acts in making and signing erroneous, false, or fraudulent New\n\nYork State income tax returns. The group return must be filed with New York\n\nState Income Tax, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (e) The filing of a group return will be\nconsidered as a group of separate returns which will meet the individual filing\nrequirements of this Part. The Department of Taxation and Finance retains the\nright to require the filing of an individual New York State nonresident\npersonal income tax return by any of the individual partners. (f) A partnership filing a group return must\ninclude a detailed schedule indicating the name of the partnership, the special\nidentifying number, and the taxable year as shown on the group return. Also, for each participating partner, the partnership must provide the following\ninformation: (1)\nthe partner's name and\naddress (in alphabetical order by last name or other order acceptable to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance); (2)\nthe partner's social security\nnumber; (3)\nthe partner's\ndistributive share of partnership income, as determined under Part 137 of this\n\nTitle, allocable to New York State; (4)\nthe partner's New York State personal\nincome tax as determined in accordance with subdivision (g) of this\nsection; (5)\nthe New York State\nestimated income tax paid by such partner on an individual basis or the New\n\nYork State estimated income tax paid on behalf of such partner on a group basis\npursuant to section\n185.3\n(k) of this Title, as the case may be; (6)\nthe balance due or overpayment (any\noverpayment will not be refunded, but applied to the respective partner's\nestimated income tax for the following year); and\n(7)\nany other information the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may require. (g) New York State personal income tax. For\npurposes of this section, a participating partner's New York State personal\nincome tax is determined by multiplying such partner's distributive share of\npartnership income (as determined under Part 137 of this Title) allocable to\n\nNew York State by the highest effective rate of New York State personal income\ntax for the applicable taxable year. (h) The partnership must also attach to its\n\nNew York State partnership return a copy of the listings of the nonresident\npartners included in the group return, containing the names and social security\nnumbers of the partners who will be included in the group return for the\ncalendar year within which the taxable year of the partnership ends. (i) The approval to file a group return for a\ntaxable year will not be revoked subsequent to the filing date of that taxable\nyear simply because the partnership failed to maintain the minimum number of\nits electing qualified nonresident partners. For example, if a partnership\nfiled a timely group return on behalf of two more than the minimum number of\nelecting qualified nonresident partners for a taxable year and, subsequently, three of the partners file superseding or correcting New York State nonresident\npersonal income tax returns on or before April 15, of the following year, approval to file on a group basis for that taxable year will not be revoked\nsolely for failure to maintain the minimum number of electing qualified\nnonresident partners. However, unless the partnership has the minimum number of\nelecting qualified nonresident partners for group filing purposes in subsequent\ntaxable years, such approval will be revoked for such subsequent years. In addition, where a group return is not filed with\nrespect to a taxable year, the approval to file a group return will be revoked\nfor subsequent taxable years unless the partnership requests permission from\nthe department for reinstatement. (j) Where a partnership elected to file group\nrequired installments, pursuant to section\n185.3\n(k)(1)\nof this Title, and later determines than an individual electing partner will\nnot participate in the filing of a group return or where such individual\nelecting partner fails to qualify, pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section, the partnership should notify the Department of Taxation and Finance, in\nwriting, by the 15th day of the second month following the close of the taxable\nyear in which the partner elects not to participate or fails to qualify, as the\ncase may be. This will allow the department sufficient time to transfer\nrequired installments of estimated tax paid on behalf of such partner on a\ngroup basis to an individual account. An electing qualified nonresident partner\nmay not change such partner's election to file on a group basis to an\nindividual basis after the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of\nthe taxable year with respect to which the election is effective. Conversely, a\npartner may not elect to file on a group basis after the 15th day of the fourth\nmonth following the close of the taxable year for which the election is\nrequested (see section\n161.3\nof this Title). (k) A partnership\nthat has been granted approval by the Department of Taxation and Finance to\nfile a group return on behalf of its nonresident partners must notify the\ndepartment, in writing, when such partnership decides that it will not be\nfiling a group return for a taxable year. Such a decision will revoke approval\nby the department for such partnership to file a group return in subsequent\ntaxable years unless the partnership requests permission from the department\nfor reinstatement.
