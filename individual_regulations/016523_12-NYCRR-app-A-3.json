(The sketches referred to may be the same as\nmentioned under \"Preparation of Base Material\" or may be separate sketches. They should show, for the minimum thickness and for several intermediate\nthicknesses of base material, the welding technique to be used, whether weaving\nor beading, the number of layers or passes and diameter of electrode with the\nmean voltage and current for each layer or pass, and in the case of vertical\nwelds, the progression of each pass-whether upward or downward.)\n\nNote: Since, in the welding of many materials in the flat\nposition and particularly for the ordinary mild steels, the proper welding\n\"heat\" can be readily determined by the appearance of the individual beads of\nwelding, the use of a \"Standard Appearance Weld\" may be desirable for the flat\nposition. Such a weld should be made in the maximum thickness that will be used\nin construction, except that the maximum thickness of the standard appearance\nweld need not exceed three-quarters inch, and should show approximately two\ninches of the surface of each layer and a cross section through the weld at\neach layer, where such ross section is found necessary to produce a clearly\nunderstandable photograph. When a standard appearance weld is used the\nfollowing paragraph should be used in lieu of specifying current and voltage\nvalues. APPEARANCE OF WELDING LAYERS.
