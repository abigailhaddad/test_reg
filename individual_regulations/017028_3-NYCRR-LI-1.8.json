  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 1.8 - Writing covered call options on trust accounts\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked by a trust company whether, under\n\nNew York State Banking Law, it could write covered call options with respect to\nsecurities held by it as a trustee. By writing covered calls the trust company would grant to the\ncall's purchaser an option to buy from it a fixed number of shares at a fixed\nprice within a stated time period usually not exceeding nine months. As\nconsideration for the granting of this option the trust company would receive a\npremium which would be credited to the particular trust account. The trust\ncompany represented to the department that any sale by it of the underlying\nsecurity during the option period would be preceded or accompanied by the\npurchase on an option exchange of a call option covering the same securities\nand expiring at the same time as the original call so as to prevent the trust\naccount from being subject to an uncovered call at any time. Under the above conditions, the writing of covered call\noptions would be permissible in the department's view provided, however, that\nno option transactions of this nature would be effected for any account unless\npreviously authorized by the particular account party. DATED: March 1974\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 1.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
