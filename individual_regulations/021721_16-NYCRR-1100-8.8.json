  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-8.8 - Evidence, burden of proof and standard of proof\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Evidence. (1)\n\nAll evidence submitted shall be relevant\nand all rules of privilege shall be observed. However, other rules of evidence\nneed not be strictly applied. Hearsay evidence may be admitted if it falls\nwithin one or more of the exceptions provided by CPLR article 45 or other law, or is shown to be reasonably reliable, relevant and probative. (2)\n\nAlthough relevant, evidence may be\nexcluded if its value as proof is substantially outweighed by a potential for\nunfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, undue delay, waste of time or\nneedless presentation of repetitious or duplicative evidence. (3)\n\nWhere a part of a document is offered as\nevidence by one party, any party may offer the entire document as\nevidence. (4)\n\nEach witness shall be\nsworn or make an affirmation before testifying. Opening, closing and other\nunsworn statements are not evidence but shall be considered as arguments\nbearing on evidence. (5)\n\nThe ALJ or\nthe Executive Director may take official notice of all facts of which judicial\nnotice could be taken and of other facts within the specialized knowledge of\nthe Office. When official notice is taken of a material fact not appearing in\nthe evidence in the record and of which judicial notice could not be taken, every party shall be given notice thereof and, on timely request, be afforded\nan opportunity, prior to the final decision of the Executive Director, to\ndispute the fact or its materiality. (b) Burden of proof. (1)\n\nThe applicant has the burden of proof to\ndemonstrate that its proposal shall be in compliance with all applicable laws\nand regulations administered by the Office. (2)\n\nWhere the Office has initiated a permit\nmodification, the Office Staff bears the burden of proof to show that the\nmodification is supported by the preponderance of the evidence. (3)\n\nWhere an application is made for permit\nmodification, the permittee has the burden of proof to demonstrate that the\nmodified permitted activity is in compliance with all applicable laws and\nregulations administered by the Office. A demonstration by the permittee that\nthe there is no substantive change in the originally permitted activity, environmental conditions or applicable law and regulations constitutes a prima\nfacie case for the permittee. (4)\n\nThe burden of proof to sustain a motion shall be on the party making the\nmotion. (c) Standard of proof. Whenever factual matters are involved, the party\nbearing the burden of proof shall sustain that burden by a preponderance of the\nevidence unless a higher standard has been established by statute or\nregulation. This subdivision does not modify or supplement the questions that\nmay be raised in a proceeding brought pursuant to CPLR article 78. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
