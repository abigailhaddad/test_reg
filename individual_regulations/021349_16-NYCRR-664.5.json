  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 664.5 - Amortization accounting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Amortization shall be computed on the straight-line method, i.e., equal annual\namounts shall be applied, or other method as directed by the commission. The\ncost of each type of asset shall be amortized on the basis of the estimated\nlife of that asset and shall not be written off in the accounting period in\nwhich the asset is acquired. A reasonable estimate of the useful life may be\nbased on the upper or lower limits even though a fixed existence is not\ndeterminable. However, the period of amortization shall not exceed 40\nyears. (b) In the event any\nestimated useful life becomes no longer applicable, a revised estimated useful\nlife shall be determined in accordance with subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) Amortization charges\nshall be made monthly to the appropriate amortization expense accounts and\ncorresponding credits shall be made to the appropriate amortization reserve\naccounts. Monthly charges shall be computed by the application of one-twelfth\nto the annual amortization amount. (d) The company shall keep such records as\nwill allow the determination of the useful life of the asset. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n664.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
