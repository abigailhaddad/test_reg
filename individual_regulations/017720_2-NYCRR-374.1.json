  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 374.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Retirement and Social Security Law clearly envisions that\nan employee must separate from the service of the public employment upon which\nhis or her benefit eligibility is based, in order to commence receiving a\nretirement allowance based on such employment. However, the provisions of such\nlaw do not specifically address the situation faced by an individual who\ndesires to retire from a public position, but does not wish to resign from a\nsecondary position of elective office. We believe this situation should be\naddressed by regulation, in view of the public policy concerns which underlay\nthe special rules applicable to elective office that are provided by section\n150\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, and the practical effects of such rules. Sections\n101, 211, 212, and\n401\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw provide strict limits on the amount a pensioner may earn in public service\nwithout requiring a reduction or suspension of the retirement allowance. Notwithstanding these general rules, section\n150\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law provides a significant exception under which public\npensioners may earn unlimited sums from post-retirement elective office, without a resulting suspension or diminution of their retirement allowances. It\nis clear that the public policy basis for this provision is to encourage - or\nat least remove an obstacle that may discourage - retirees from running for and\nholding elective office. The current effect of the general rule requiring\nseparation from all covered public service upon retirement controverts public\npolicy concerns that underlay section\n150\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law. While section\n150\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law exempts individuals who are elected to public office after\nretirement from the earnings limitations provided in sections 101, 401, 211 and\n212, an individual who wishes to retire from a nonelective position while\nremaining in a secondary elective position must separate from the payroll of\nboth positions in order to commence receiving a retirement allowance. This is\ntrue even though that the individual may then return to public payroll within\ndays, without suspension or diminution of the retirement allowance, where the\nannual compensation for the elective position is within the post-retirement\npublic service earnings limit provided by section\n212\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. The clearly unintended effect of this statutory framework is that officers\nelected to office in a municipality who belong to the party which holds the\nmajority of seats on the municipality's governing body frequently resign from\nthe elective office at retirement, in order to commence drawing a retirement\nallowance - only to be reappointed by the board to complete the remainder of\nhis or her elective term. By contrast, a member of the minority party may be\nprevented from retiring from the primary (nonelective) public position, because\nhe or she would not be reappointed to the elective office upon resignation. Clearly, the regulatory structure should not make one's ability to receive a\npension based on the nonelective position dependent on whether he or she serves\nin the majority party with respect to his elective position. Furthermore, the\ncurrent regulatory framework can create the appearance of impropriety in\nsituations where an elective official resigns from an elective position and\nbecomes reinstated very soon thereafter in order to receive a retirement\nallowance. This action will solve the above discussed problems, by permitting\nan individual to receive a retirement allowance that is based primarily on a\nnonelective position without having to resign from a secondary, elective\nposition. It is structured in a manner that will do so without permitting undue\ndouble dipping, in view of the following. The permissive exception established\nby this regulation will not apply to any individual whose only covered\nemployment is the elective office. Neither will it apply to an individual whose\nelective position is higher paying than the nonelective position. Accordingly, it will not apply in situations where the elective office is actually the\nprimary position upon which his or her retirement allowance is based. Lastly, the rule established by this regulation will only apply to situations in which\nthe compensation for the elective office does not exceed the applicable section\n212 earnings limit. Section 212 establishes the maximum compensation that a\npublic pensioner may earn in public office without a resulting suspension or\ndiminution of his or her retirement allowance. Accordingly, this measure\neffectively incorporates the existing standard for what should be considered de\nminimus post-retirement income for the purposes of allowing pensioners to\nreceive their retirement allowances without suspension or\ndiminution.
