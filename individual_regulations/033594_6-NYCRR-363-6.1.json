  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.1 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. Except as described by the transition requirements of section\n360.4\nof this Title, all new\nlandfills, lateral and vertical expansions of existing landfills, and\nsubsequent development at existing landfills must conform to the requirements\nset forth in this Subpart. (b) The\nowner or operator must submit engineering reports, design drawings, and\nspecifications for all new construction of landfill components described in\nthis Subpart prior to construction. Construction must not commence before\nwritten approval is received from the department. (c) The landfill liner and leachate\ncollection and removal system must be designed and constructed to effectively\nprotect surface and groundwater resources from uncontrolled releases of\nlandfill leachate. The components of the liner system must be placed to achieve\na minimum slope of no less than two percent, except along leachate collection\npipes, which must have a minimum slope of one percent. (d) Any geomembrane, geosynthetic clay liner\n(GCL), geosynthetic drainage layer, geocushion or other geosynthetic material\ninstalled on landfill side slopes must be designed to minimize shear stresses\nand to withstand the calculated tensile forces acting upon the geosynthetic\nmaterials by the transfer of anticipated destabilizing forces to the landfill\nsubgrade. At a minimum, the design must consider the maximum friction angle of\nany soil-geosynthetic or geosynthetic-geosynthetic interface, along with\nseepage forces expected in the side slope soil drainage layer in the primary\nleachate collection and removal system, to ensure that overall slope stability\nis maintained and to meet the factor-of-safety requirements specified in\nparagraph 363-4.3(c)(3) of this Part. (e) For lateral expansions adjacent to\nexisting landfills that do not meet the liner system requirements of this Part\n(i.e., the existing liner system is single composite and the expansion requires\ndouble composite), any encroachment on the existing landfill's side slope must\nbe designed and constructed to meet the liner system requirements of this\n\nPart. (f) Landfills must be\ndesigned to minimize the need to decommission existing monitoring wells and to\ninstall new monitoring wells as a result of progressive cell construction into\nareas where monitoring wells are located. (g) A pre-construction meeting must be held\nprior to commencement of construction. This meeting must include, at a minimum: (1)\ndistribution to each involved entity of\nrelevant CQA and CQC documents and supporting information; (2)\nreview the role of specific CQA and CQC\nrequirements in demonstrating conformance with design criteria; (3)\nreview of responsibilities, authorities\nand lines of communication for each involved entity; (4)\nreview of established acceptance and\nrejection criteria as specified in CQA and CQC plan; (5)\nreview of methods for documenting and\nreporting all data; (6)\nreview of\nprocedures for storage and protection of landfill construction materials\non-site; and\n(7)\na site walk-around\nto identify project site layout and material and equipment storage\nlocations; (h) The owner\nor operator must notify the department at least seven days prior to each of the\nfollowing activities: (1)\nthe\npre-construction meeting; (2)\ncommencement of construction of the soil component of the secondary composite\nliner; (3)\ncommencement of\nplacement of the primary and secondary geomembrane liner; and\n(4)\ncommencement of geomembrane liner\nintegrity testing.
