  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 601.24 - References\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe New York major drainage basins in section\n601.2\n(j) of this\n\nPart were derived from an update of the United States Geological Survey's\n(USGS's) Hydrologic Unit Codes (HUCs). The updated HUCs were prepared by United\n\nStates Department of Interior-USGS, the United States Department of\n\nAgriculture-Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), and the United\n\nStates Environmental Protection Agency. The resulting Watershed Boundary\n\nDataset (WBD) has been made available from the NRCS Data Gateway by free\ndownload (as of November 2012 at the following web address: http://datagateway.nrcs.usda.gov/). The department downloaded the WBD from the\nNRCS Data Gateway on June 17, 2011 and utilized the data to prepare a map\ndisplaying the New York State major drainage basins and their respective HUCs. The department's map, entitled 'NYS Major Drainage Basins\" and dated October\n2012, is available from and published by the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233 and is on file at\nthe New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Central Office and\nall regional offices and sub-offices. It is also available on the department's\nwebsite (as of November 2012 at the following web address: http://www.dec.ny.gov/lands/56800.html). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n601.24\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
