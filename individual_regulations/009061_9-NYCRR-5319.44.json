  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.44 - Mechanical-based RNG games\n\nState Regulations\nA mechanical-based RNG game is a game that employs the\nlaws of physics in any way to generate the outcome of such game. All\nmechanical-based RNG games shall meet the requirements of this Part, with the\nexception of provisions in sections\n5319.37, 5319.38\nand\n5319.43\nof this Part that dictate\nthe requirements for electronic random number generators. Mechanical-based RNG\ngames shall meet the following: (a) The independent testing laboratory approved by the commission shall test\nmultiple iterations of a mechanical-based RNG game to gather enough data to\nverify randomness. In addition, the manufacturer may supply live data to assist\nin such evaluation. (b) The\nmechanical pieces of a mechanical-based RNG game shall be constructed of\nmaterials to prevent decomposition of any component over time\n(\ne.g., a ball shall not disintegrate prior to scheduled\nreplacement). (c) The properties of\nphysical items used to choose the selection in a mechanical-based RNG game\nshall not be altered. (d) A player\nshall not have the ability to interact physically or come into physical contact\nor manipulate the machine physically with the mechanical portion of a\nmechanical-based RNG game. (e) The\ncommission may require replacement parts after a pre-determined amount of time\nfor mechanical-based RNG game to comply with subdivision (a) of this section. In addition, the device or devices may require periodic inspections to ensure\nthe integrity of a device. Each mechanical-based RNG game shall be reviewed on\na case-by-case basis. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.44\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
