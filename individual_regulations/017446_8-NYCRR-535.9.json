  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 535.9 - Notice, hearing and determination of charges against students\n\nState Regulations\n\nApplies to charges for violation of the rules prescribed\nby or referred to in this Part heretofore served which have not been finally\ndetermined within 60 days after the adoption hereof, which charges shall be\nreferred to the committee constituted pursuant to said section\n535.9\nfor determination in\naccordance therewith, and said section shall apply to all charges for violation\nof such rules hereafter made, whether for violations heretofore or hereafter\ncommitted. [Education Law, §355(2)(b) ]Education Law, §355(2)(b)\n(a) The term chief administrative officer, as\nused in these rules, shall be deemed to mean and include any person authorized\nto exercise the powers of that office during a vacancy therein or during the\nabsence or disability of the incumbent and for purposes of this section shall\nalso include any designee appointed by said officer. (b) Whenever a complaint is made to the chief\nadministrative officer of any State-operated institution of the university of a\nviolation by a student or students of the rules prescribed in this Part (or of\nany rules adopted by an individual institution supplementing or implementing\nsuch rules) or whenever he has knowledge that such a violation may have\noccurred, he shall cause an investigation to be made and the statements of the\ncomplainants, if any, and of other persons having knowledge of the facts\nreduced to writing. If he is satisfied from such investigation and statements\nthat there is reasonable ground to believe that there has been such a\nviolation, he shall prepare or cause to be prepared charges against the student\nor students alleged to have committed such violation which shall state the\nprovision prescribing the offense and shall specify the ultimate facts alleged\nto constitute such offense. (c) Such charges shall be in writing and shall be served on the student or students\nnamed therein by delivering the same to him or them personally, if possible, or, if not, by mailing a copy of such charges by registered mail to such\nstudent or students at his or their usual place or places of abode while\nattending college and also to his or their home address or addresses, if\ndifferent. (d) The notice of\ncharges so served shall fix a date for hearing thereon not less than 10 or more\nthan 15 days from the date of service which shall be the date of mailing where\nnecessary to effect service by mail. Failure to appear in response to the\ncharges on the date fixed for hearing, unless there has been a continuance for\ngood cause shown, shall be deemed to be an admission of the facts stated in\nsuch charges and shall warrant such action as may then be appropriate thereon. Before taking such action the hearing committee, hereinafter referred to, shall\ngive notice to any student, who has failed to appear, in the manner prescribed\nin subdivision (c), of its proposed findings and recommendations to be\nsubmitted to the chief administrative officer and shall so submit such findings\nand recommendations 10 days thereafter unless the student has meanwhile shown\ngood cause for his failure to appear, in which case a date for hearing shall be\nfixed. (e) Upon demand at any time\nbefore or at the hearing, the student charged or his representative, duly\ndesignated, shall be furnished a copy of the statements taken by the chief\nadministrative officer in relation to such charges and with the names of any\nother witnesses who will be produced at the hearing in support of the charges; provided, however, that this shall not preclude the testimony of witnesses who\nwere unknown at the time of such demand. (f) The chief administrative officer may, upon the service of charges, suspend the student named therein, from all or any\npart of the institution's premises or facilities, pending the hearing and\ndetermination thereof, whenever, in his judgment, the continued presence of\nsuch student would constitute a clear danger to himself or to the safety of\npersons or property on the premises of the institution or would pose an\nimmediate threat of disruptive interference with the normal conduct of the\ninstitution's activities and functions; provided, however, that the chief\nadministrative officer shall grant an immediate hearing on request of any\nstudent so suspended with respect to the basis for such suspension. (g) There shall be constituted at each\n\nState-operated institution a hearing committee to hear charges against students\nof violation of the rules for maintenance of public order prescribed by or\nreferred to in this Part. Such committee shall consist of three members of the\nadministrative staff and three members of the faculty, designated by the chief\nadministrative officer, and three students who shall be designated by the\nmembers named by the chief administrative officer. Each such member shall serve\nuntil his successor or replacement has been designated. No member of the\ncommittee shall serve in any case where he is witness or is or has been\ndirectly involved in the events upon which the charges are based. In order to\nprovide for cases where there may be such a disqualification and for cases of\nabsence or disability, the chief administrative officer shall designate an\nalternate member of the administrative staff and an alternate member of the\nfaculty, and his principal designees shall designate an alternate student\nmember, to serve in such cases. Any five members of the committee may conduct\nhearings and make findings and recommendations as hereinafter provided. At any\ninstitution where the chief administrative officer determines that the number\nof hearings which will be required to be held is, or may be, so great that they\ncannot otherwise be disposed of with reasonable speed, he may determine that\nthe hearing committee shall consist of six members of the administrative staff\nand six members of the faculty to be designated by him and of six students who\nshall be designated by the members so designated by him. In such event the\nchief administrative officer shall designate one of such members as chairman\nwho may divide the membership of the committee into three divisions each to\nconsist of two members of the administrative staff, two faculty members and two\nstudents and may assign charges among such divisions for hearing. Any four\nmembers of each such division may conduct hearings and make recommendations as\nhereinafter provided. (h) The\nhearing committee shall not be bound by the technical rules of evidence but may\nhear or receive any testimony or evidence which is relevant and material to the\nissues presented by the charges and which will contribute to a full and fair\nconsideration thereof and determination thereon. A student against whom the\ncharges are made may appear by and with representatives of his choice. He may\nconfront and examine witnesses against him and may produce witnesses and\ndocumentary evidence in his own behalf. There may be present at the hearing: the student charged and his representatives and witnesses; other witnesses; representatives of the institutional administration; and, unless the student\nshall request a closed hearing, such other members of the institutional\ncommunity or other persons, or both, as may be admitted by the hearing\ncommittee. A transcript of the proceedings shall be made. (i) Within 20 days after the close of a\nhearing, the hearing committee shall submit a report of its findings of fact\nand recommendations for disposition of the charges to the chief administrative\nofficer, together with a transcript of the proceedings, and shall at the same\ntime transmit a copy of its report to the student concerned or his\nrepresentative. Within 10 days thereafter the chief administrative officer\nshall make his determination thereon. Final authority to dismiss the charges or\nto determine the guilt of those against whom they are made and to expel, suspend or otherwise discipline them shall be vested in the chief\nadministrative officer. If he shall reject the findings of the hearing\ncommittee in whole or in part, he shall make new findings which must be based\non substantial evidence in the record and shall include them in the notice of\nhis final determination which shall be served upon the student or students with\nrespect to whom it is made. [FN*] Applies to charges for violation of the rules\nprescribed by or referred to in this Part heretofore served which have not been\nfinally determined within 60 days after the adoption hereof, which charges\nshall be referred to the committee constituted pursuant to said section\n535.9\nfor determination in\naccordance therewith, and said section shall apply to all charges for violation\nof such rules hereafter made, whether for violations heretofore or hereafter\ncommitted.
