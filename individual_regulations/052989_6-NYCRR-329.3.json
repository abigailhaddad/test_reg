  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 329.3 - Policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is\nrecognized that: (1)\n\nOwners of lands through\nwhich water passes or which are bordered by waters have certain vested riparian\nrights to the use of these waters. (2)\n\nThe provisions of article 17 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law safeguard uses of waters through the maintenance\nof water quality standards assigned by classification. (3)\n\nUse of chemicals for controlling aquatic\ninsects may result in need for temporary curtailment of certain water\nuses. (b) In considering\nthe use of such chemicals it is the intent that: (1)\n\nThese regulations permit control or\nelimination of biting insects whose life history involves an aquatic stage\n(e.g., mosquitoes, black flies, etc.) and which may be detrimental to the\ncomfort and well-being of man, under such stipulated conditions as to protect\nthe waters for the best usages assigned to them and the public health, safety\nand welfare, and terrestrial and aquatic life or the growth and propagation\nthereof, other than aquatic insects intended to be controlled or eliminated. These regulations do not apply to space treatment or residual treatment for\ncontrolling adult insects over land. However, any treatment resulting in direct\nentry of chemicals into waters shall be deemed to be in violation of these\nregulations if the permit herein required has not been obtained. (2)\n\nPermits shall be granted under such\nlimitations as will protect to the greatest extent possible all terrestrial\nlife, aquatic life other than the aquatic insects intended to be controlled or\neliminated, all public and domestic water supplies and irrigational, recreational, agricultural and industrial water uses. (3)\n\nRegardless of conformity with other\nlimitations, no permit shall be issued for chemical treatment of water supply\nwaters, if the resultant chemical concentration at a water supply intake will\nexceed New York State Department of Health drinking water standards. In\naddition, the permit-issuing official may require the approval of the water\nsupply agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n329.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
