  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8010.2 - Parole release\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nLegislature mandated that the shock incarceration program be available only to\nspecially selected, nonviolent eligible inmates, and the program incorporates a\nhighly structured routine of discipline, intensive regimentation, exercise and\nwork therapy, together with substance abuse therapy, education, and pre-release\nand self-improvement counseling. The Board of Parole, after consideration of\nthe eligibility criteria established by the Legislature, and the extensive, stringent criteria established by the Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision for program selection and retention, believes that an inmate who is\nselected and who thereafter successfully completes the entire shock\nincarceration program will normally represent an excellent candidate for\nrelease onto parole. Therefore, an inmate's successful completion of the\nprogram, and receipt of a certificate of earned eligibility, shall create a\npresumption in favor of parole release. (b) An eligible inmate participant in the\nshock incarceration program shall be considered for release onto parole prior\nto such inmate's completion of the program, except as otherwise specified in\nparagraph (f)(1) of this section. A decision to grant or deny release onto\nparole will be made by at least two members of the board, and will be premised\non reports prepared and/or compiled by the department concerning the inmate\nparticipant. At the time of such review by members of the board, the board will\nassume that the inmate will successfully complete the program and be awarded a\ncertificate of earned eligibility by the department. Upon the completion of its\nreview, the board will either: (1)\nissue a\nconditional grant of parole, conditioned on the inmate's successful completion\nof the shock incarceration program and the issuance of a certificate of earned\neligibility to the inmate; or\n(2)\ndeny release. If release is denied, the inmate shall be informed in writing, within two weeks of the board's rendition of its decision, of the factors and\nreasons for such denial. An inmate denied parole release shall thereafter\nappear at least one month prior to the expiration of the minimum period of\nimprisonment fixed by the court, in accordance with the provisions of Part 8002\nof this Title. (c) A\nconditional grant of parole shall become final upon an inmate's successful\ncompletion of the shock incarceration program and the issuance to that inmate\nof a certificate of earned eligibility. Such an inmate shall thereafter be\nreleased onto parole in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (e) of\nthis section. (d) A conditional\ngrant of parole shall be rendered null and void upon the removal of the inmate\nfrom the shock incarceration program for any reason prior to the completion of\nthe program, or upon the failure of the inmate to obtain a certificate of\nearned eligibility upon the completion of the program. Notice to the inmate of\nthe nullification of the conditional grant of parole shall not be required, as\nthe inmate's failure to successfully complete the program or receive a\ncertificate of earned eligibility upon program completion would render such\ninmate statutorily ineligible for release onto parole. An inmate whose\nconditional grant of parole has been rendered null and void shall thereafter\nappear at least one month prior to the expiration of the minimum period of\nimprisonment fixed by the court, in accordance with the provisions of Part 8002\nof this Title. (e) An inmate\ngranted parole upon completion of the shock incarceration program shall be\nreleased upon a date specified by the board that shall correspond with the date\nupon which the inmate has completed the entire six-month shock incarceration\nprogram, or on a date specified by the board as soon thereafter as\npracticable. (f) An eligible inmate\nwho is removed from the shock incarceration program by the department for any\nreason, and who is subsequently afforded another opportunity to participate in\nthis program, shall be considered for release onto parole de novo in accordance\nwith the preceding subdivisions of this section, except that: (1)\nsuch consideration may occur subsequent\nto the inmate's completion of this program, where reinstatement has occurred\nless than 60 days prior to the inmate's completion of the program; and\n(2)\nrelease onto parole, if\ngranted, shall thereafter occur upon a date specified by the board that shall\ncorrespond with the inmate's completion of the program, or as soon as\npracticable thereafter. An inmate who has successfully completed the shock\nincarceration program and who has been issued a certificate of earned\neligibility prior to being considered for release onto parole by the board, or\nsubsequent to the board's decision but prior to actual release onto parole, may\nbe subject to rescission in accordance with the provisions of section\n8002.5\nof this Title.
