  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.25 - Other methods of allocation\n\nState Regulations\n\nSections\n132.15\nthrough\n132.24\nof this Part are designed to apportion and allocate to New York State, in a\nfair and equitable manner, a nonresident's items of income, gain, loss and\ndeduction attributable to a business, trade, profession or occupation carried\non partly within and partly without New York State. Where the methods provided\nunder those sections do not so allocate and apportion those items, the\ndepartment may require a taxpayer to apportion and allocate those items under\nsuch method as it prescribes, as long as the prescribed method results in a\nfair and equitable apportionment and allocation. A nonresident individual may\nsubmit an alternative method of apportionment and allocation with respect to\nitems of income, gain, loss and deduction attributable to a business, trade, profession or occupation carried on partly within and partly without New York\n\nState. The proposed method must be fully explained in the taxpayer's New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return. If the method proposed by the\ntaxpayer is approved by the department, it may be used in lieu of the\napplicable method under sections\n132.15\nthrough\n132.24\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n132.25\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
