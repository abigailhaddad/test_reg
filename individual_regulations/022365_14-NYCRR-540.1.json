  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 540.1 - Statement of purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Office of\n\nMental Health has a multifaceted responsibility in caring for patients\ncommitted to its custody by a criminal court after having been found to have a\nmental disease or defect which renders them incapable of understanding the\ncriminal proceedings against them or assisting in their own defense. It must\nmaintain custody of patients against whom criminal charges are pending; it must\nrespect society's expectation that patients for whom criminal charges have been\ndismissed but who have demonstrated their propensity for violence will not be\ninappropriately released; it must respect the civil rights of patients who are\nnot subject to criminal charges; and it must help patients make the therapeutic\nprogress that will make continued hospitalization unnecessary and enable them\nto either face their accusers or be released. (b) While criminal defendants are committed\nto the custody of the commissioner under court orders which vary in the degree\nto which they subject the patient to the continuing jurisdiction of the\ncriminal court, many such patients have one thing in common. They have been\naccused of an act of violence. Research studies have demonstrated that one\nreliable indicator of future violent criminal behavior is past acts of criminal\nviolence. A history of treatment for mental illness, in and of itself, has not\nbeen demonstrated to be related to violent behavior. (c) While the office does not intend to hold\npatients accountable for crimes of which they have not been convicted, it\nbelieves that commitment to the custody of the commissioner pursuant to a\ncriminal court order after having been accused of an act of violence is\nsufficient indication of a violent propensity to justify the precaution of\nconfirming the clinical judgment of the patient's treatment team prior to\nreleasing the patient or granting him furloughs. The office is therefore\nestablishing regulations which require each of its facilities to establish a\nmechanism to ensure clinical review of criminal order patients to determine\nwhether or not release, change of status or granting of a furlough is\nappropriate, thereby assuring that violent patients will not be inappropriately\nfreed from custody. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n540.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
