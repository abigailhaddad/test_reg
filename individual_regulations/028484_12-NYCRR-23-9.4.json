(2)\n\nSuch\nwire rope shall be connected by means of either a closed shackle or a safety\nhook capable of holding at least four times the intended load. (f) Limitation on modifications. No modifications affecting the load handling capacity of such machines shall be\nmade unless the modification is certified by either the manufacturer of the\nequipment or by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the State of\n\nNew York. (g) Capacity. No load\nshall be lifted by such equipment that exceeds the maximum load specified by\nthe manufacturer of such equipment. (h) General operation. (1)\n\nAny load lifted by such equipment shall\nbe raised in a vertical plane to minimize swing during hoisting.
