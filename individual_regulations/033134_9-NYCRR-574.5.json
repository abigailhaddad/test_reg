  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 574.5 - Further definitions of the development considerations\n\nState Regulations\n\nThose development considerations of section 805(4) of the\n\nAdirondack Park Agency Act which are pertinent will be considered by the agency\nin its review of projects. A list of the development considerations, containing\ncertain further definitions, is set forth below: (a) Natural resource considerations. (1)\n\nWater. (i) Existing water quality. (ii)\n\nNatural sedimentation or\nsiltation. (iii)\n\nEutrophication, as\nconsidered by the agency in its review of projects, means accelerated increases\nin the content of plant nutrients in a water body, caused by excess phosphorus\nand nitrogen, which typically result in murky water and nuisance algae blooms. If unchecked, this cultural enrichment will severely limit usage of surface\nwaters for drinking, swimming and fishing, and will lead to the decline or\ndisappearance of aquatic organisms and ultimately the death of the water\nbody. (iv)\n\nExisting drainage and\nrunoff patterns. (v) Existing flow\ncharacteristics. (vi)\n\nExisting\nwater table and rates of recharge means the seasonal high groundwater table and\nthe aquifer recharge rate. (a) The seasonal\nhigh groundwater table is the highest surface of a zone of saturated soil which\nis at least six inches thick and which persists during the average year for\nmore than a week when the ground is free of frost. (b) An aquifer is a permeable geologic\nformation which will yield significant quantities of potable water for supply\nby such means as drilled or artesian wells, springs and stream\nrecharge. (c) An aquifer recharge\narea is a region of land surface supplying water to an aquifer, and is\ncharacterized by gently sloping (less than 8%) soils with a rapid permeability\nrate (generally greater than 6.3 inches per minute) or with moderate to highly\nfractured bedrock at or near the surface. (2)\n\nLand. (i) Existing topography. (ii)\n\nErosion and slippage. (iii)\n\nFloodplain and flood hazard includes\nfloodplains, floodways and floodway fringes as determined by the highest level\nof flood that, on the average, is likely to be equalled or exceeded once every\n100 years. (a) A floodplain is a normally dry\nland area, adjoining rivers, streams, ponds, lakes or wetlands, which is\nsusceptible to partial or complete inundation due to: (1)\noverflow of inland waters; (2)\nunusual or rapid accumulation or runoff\nof surface waters from any source, including spring snowmelt, severe rainfall, and/or oversaturation of the soil; or\n(3)\nmudslides or mudflows proximately caused\nor precipitated by accumulations of water on or under the ground. (b) Floodways are the part of the\nfloodplain that must remain unrestricted in order to discharge the 100-year\nflood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one\nfoot at any point. They comprise the stream channel and immediately adjacent\nlands which are frequently flooded and which help carry the major portion of\nfloodwaters during extreme floods. (c) Floodway fringes are the parts of the\nfloodplain extending from the outer edge of the floodway to the outer limit of\nthe 100-year floodplain. Water in floodway fringes is often shallow and slow\nmoving, even during a major flood. (iv)\n\nMineral resources. (v) Viable agricultural soils means those\nsoils suited for commercial agricultural production. See Feuer and Maine, Soil\n\nGroups for Agriculture: A Report of Soils Occurring Primarily on Private Land\n\nWithin the Blue Line of the Adirondack Park (New York State College of\n\nAgriculture and Life Sciences at Cornell University, 1972). (vi)\n\nForest resources. (vii)\n\nOpen-space resources. (viii)\n\nVegetative cover. (ix)\n\nThe quality and availability of land for\noutdoor recreational purposes. (3)\n\nAir. (i) Air quality. (4)\n\nNoise. (i) Noise levels. (5)\n\nCritical resource areas. (i) Rivers and corridors of rivers designated\nto be studied as wild, scenic or recreational in accordance with section\n15-2715\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. (ii)\n\nRare plant\ncommunities means communities of native terrestrial plant species that occur at\nless than 30 recorded locations in New York State, as shown on the Listing of\n\nRare and Endangered Plants prepared by the agency or as may be located on the\n\nUnique Natural and Culture Feature Maps maintained by the agency. (iii)\n\nHabitats of rare and endangered species\nand key wildlife habitats. (a) Habitats of\nrare and endangered species means habitats and likely habitats of rare plant\ncommunities and of terrestrial wildlife listed in Rare and Endangered Wildlife\nwithin the Adirondack Park,appendix D of the agency publication Development in\nthe Adirondack Park. (b) Key\nwildlife habitats means habitats required for the survival of wildlife species\nwhich are characteristic of the northern hardwood and coniferous forests of the\n\nAdirondack Park, many of which are unique, within New York, to the Adirondacks\nor rare or endangered within the State. Key wildlife habitats include: (1)\ndeer wintering yards, which means areas\nhaving a distinctive combination of vegetation, topography and hydrological\ncharacteristics that offer protection and food for deer forced to seek shelter\ndue to deep snow or severe weather conditions; (2)\nwaterfowl nesting, resting and feeding\nareas, which means areas vitally important to the maintenance of breeding and\nmigrating waterfowl populations, especially shallow and deep water marshes\ncontiguous to open water; (3)\necotones, which means areas of major vegetation transition zones providing\nvaluable food, shelter, water and rearing areas for a variety of wildlife\nspecies, some of which live primarily within the ecotone, and some of which\ndepend on it during certain periods of their life cycle. Ecotones include\nborders of lakes, ponds, rivers and streams, borders between coniferous and\nhardwood vegetation, and the edges of open areas such as fields and plains\nwhich abut forested lands. (iv)\n\nAlpine and subalpine life\nzones. (v) Wetlands. (vi)\n\nUnique features, including gorges, waterfalls and geologic formations. (6)\n\nWildlife. (i) Fish and wildlife. (7)\n\nAesthetics means harmonizing land use or\ndevelopment with the natural environment. (i) Scenic vistas include distant views through or along an opening, especially\nviews which frame or focus attention upon a scene of distinctive character and\nnatural beauty such as a prominent landmark, mountain, river valley, plain, or\nhistorical monument. Scenic vistas include those designated on the official\n\nAdirondack Park land use and development plan map, and those locally\ndesignated. (ii)\n\nNatural and\nman-made travel corridors include the land or water visible from natural and\nman-made transportation routes such as interstate, State, county and town\nhighways, boating and canoe routes, and hiking and horse trails. (b) Historic site\nconsiderations. (1)\n\nHistoric factors: (i) historic sites of structures. (c) Site development\nconsiderations. (1)\n\nNatural site factors. (i) Geology. (ii)\n\nSlopes. (iii)\n\nSoil characteristics. (iv)\n\nDepth to groundwater and other\nhydrological factors. (2)\n\nOther site factors. (i) Adjoining and nearby land uses. (ii)\n\nAdequacy of site facilities. (d) Governmental\nconsiderations. (1)\n\nGovernmental service and\nfinance factors. (i) Ability of government to\nprovide facilities and services means the effect of a land use or development\nor subdivision of land upon the fiscal affairs of all local governments under a\nduty to provide services and facilities such as education, recreation, police\nand fire protection, public health, public sewer and water, sanitary landfills\nand transportation, assuming the current tax structure and tax rates are to be\nmaintained. (ii)\n\nMunicipal, school\nor special district taxes or special district user charges. (e) Governmental review\nconsiderations. (1)\n\nGovernmental control\nfactors. Conformance with other governmental controls includes conformance with\nlocal land use controls in accordance with section\n574.6\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
