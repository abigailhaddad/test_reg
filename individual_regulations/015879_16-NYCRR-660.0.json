  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 660.0 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe revised uniform system of accounts (USOA) is an\nhistorical financial accounting system which reports the results of operational\nand financial events in a manner which enables both management and regulators\nto assess these results within a specified accounting period. The USOA also\nprovides the financial community and others with financial performance results. In order for an accounting system to fulfill these purposes, it must exhibit\nconsistency and stability in financial reporting (including the results\npublished for regulatory purposes). Accordingly, the USOA has been designed to\nreflect stable, recurring financial data based, to the extent regulatory\nconsiderations permit, upon the consistency of the well established body of\naccounting theories and principles commonly referred to as generally accepted\naccounting principles. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n660.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
