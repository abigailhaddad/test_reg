Each panel shall\nbe rectangular in shape and shall have a white legend and border on a blue\nbackground. The content of the legend on each TOD business panel shall be\nlimited to the business identification for not more than one eligible\ntourist-oriented business. The legends shall not include promotional\nadvertising. 00C Arrows and distances shall be displayed on\n\nTourist-Oriented Directional signs, but shall not be displayed on Advance TOD\nsigns. Option: 00D TOD business panels may display business names in white\nseries B, C, or D lettering, or may display trademarks in their customary\ncolors. When a trademark is used, the border may be omitted. Standard: 00E Only trademarks which are registered with the Federal\n\nDivision of Patents and Trademarks shall appear on TOD business panels. Guidance: 00F The arrows on Tourist-Oriented Directional signs should\npoint in the general direction to be followed in turning onto the intersecting\nhighway. Vertical and diagonal arrows, where used, should be similar to those\nused on Destination signs (see Section\n2D.37\n), except that they should\nhave wider shafts. Arrows pointing to the right of vertical should be on the\nright side of the sign. Arrows pointing to the left of vertical should be on\nthe left side of the sign. Businesses to the left should appear above\nbusinesses to the right. Where more than one business lies in the same\ndirection, those closer should appear above those more distant. Distances to\nbusinesses should be displayed within the arrows, and should be stated to the\nnearest mile. Where the stated distance would be less than one mile, it should\nbe omitted. 00G On Tourist-Oriented Directional signs, closer\nbusinesses should appear above those more distant. Option: 00H Vertical arrows may be on either side of the\n\nTourist-Oriented Directional sign, as appropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2K.02\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
