  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7910.3 - Interest subsidies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The amount of the interest subsidy shall be the difference between the\ntotal interest due on a program loan over the life of the loan, calculated at\nthe financing institution's lending rate at the time of closing, and the\ninterest due on such loan over such period, calculated at the program rate, multiplied by a fraction equal to the subsidy period divided by the life of the\nloan. The total amount of the interest subsidy will be discounted to reflect\nthe payment of interest subsidies in advance of their becoming due. (b) Variable rate loans. For variable rate\nloans, the amount of the interest subsidy will not change during the term of\nthe loan, regardless of fluctuations in the financing institution's lending\nrate on that loan, except in cases where the financing institution's lending\nrate drops to a level where the interest subsidy would result in the approved\napplicant receiving a negative net interest rate. In such cases, the amount of\nthe interest subsidy will be reduced accordingly. (c) For loans with alternative payment\nschedules allowed pursuant to section\n7910.8\n(b)(3)\nof\nthis Part, (i.e., loans other than fully amortized or fixed principal payment\nloans) the amount of the interest subsidy shall be calculated as though the\nloan were fully amortized over the subsidy period. (d) Subsidy period. Interest subsidies will\nbe limited to a period of 10 years or the life of the loan, whichever is\nless. (e) Initial program rate. The\ninitial program rate will be five percent for all program loans. At the end of\nthree months following the effective date of this Part and from time to time\nthereafter, the program rate will be reviewed by the commissioner and may be\nchanged for new loans being issued under the program in accordance with\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (f) Revisions to program rate. At the\ndiscretion of the commissioner, the program rate may be adjusted, and different\nprogram rates may be established for different sectors or audiences, to reflect\nmarket changes, loan demand, and the possible need to stimulate participation\nin the program by certain audiences. Revised program rates will be at least 25\npercent below the prime interest rate. Notice of any revised program rates will\nbe published in the State Register. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7910.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
