Where the policy is secondary, benefits shall be limited to the difference between the amount paid from the other source and the benefit specified in the policy. (5)\n\nThe policy shall comport with the claims process requirements provided in 9 NYCRR\n210. (6)\n\nThe exclusions in section\n52.16\n(c) of this Part shall not be applicable to this coverage.

In the event any such reevaluation reveals that the insured firefighter has regained the ability to perform duties as a firefighter, then his or her monthly benefits shall cease the last day of the month of reevaluation.

(3)\n\nAn insured firefighter shall remain eligible for the benefits in subparagraphs (i), (ii) and (iv) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision for 60 months after the formal cessation of the insured firefighter's status as an active volunteer firefighter.
