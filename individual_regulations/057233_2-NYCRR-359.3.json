  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 359.3 - Transfer rights under section 801\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Background. Under this section, members who were previously eligible to\ntransfer between public retirement systems of the State, and who did not elect\nto transfer while both memberships were active, may be eligible to apply for\nthis transfer. Section\n801\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw also permits retroactive transfer, in certain cases, by members who\ncommenced employment which made them eligible to join a second public\nretirement system before their membership in the first retirement system\nterminated. For the purposes of section 801, public retirement system means the\n\nNew York State and Local Employees' Retirement System, the New York State and\n\nLocal Police and Fire Retirement System and the New York State Teachers'\nRetirement System. If New York City enacts legislation adopting the provisions\ncontained in article 18, the term public retirement system shall also apply to\nthe public retirement systems of New York City. (b) Filing requirements. To transfer a\nprevious membership under section\n801\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, a member must file a written transfer request on a form provided by his or\nher current retirement system with such retirement system. Forms may be filed\non or after October 24, 1993 and may not be filed any later than October 23, 1994. Application forms are available from the retirement system or from\nemployers. (c) Contents of\napplication. In completing the written request, a member must provide a\ndescription of the previous membership and should include: (1)\nthe name of the previous retirement\nsystem; (2)\nthe retirement system\nregistration number (if known); and\n(3)\nthe dates of employment. (d) Effects of transfer under\nsection 801. A retroactive transfer to the New York State and Local Retirement\n\nSystems may result in a tier change, since a member's date of membership in the\nfirst retirement system is also \"transferred.\" Tier status will be based on the\ndate of membership in the system from which membership is\ntransferred. (e) Member\ncontributions. Payment of additional member contributions required in\nconnection with a transfer under section\n801\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw must be made in a lump sum within one year after the member is notified by\nhis or her current retirement system as to the amount of member contributions\nrequired for such transfer. (f) Determination and hearings. Upon review of the application and the pertinent\nfacts, the retirement system shall issue a determination either approving or\ndisapproving an application for transfer under section\n801\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. An applicant shall be entitled to request an administrative hearing\npursuant to section\n74\nor section\n374\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, as appropriate, in the event of an adverse determination.
