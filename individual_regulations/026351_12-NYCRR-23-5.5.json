  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.5 - Tube and coupler metal scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Structural members. The structural\nmembers of tube and coupler scaffolds shall be constructed of steel\ntubing. (b) Couplers. (1)\n\nAll vertical, horizontal and diagonal\nmembers of tube and coupler metal scaffolds shall be securely fastened together\nwith approved safe locking devices to form positive connections. (2)\n\nThe use of grey cast iron fittings in\nsuch scaffolds is prohibited. (c) Runners. (1)\n\nEvery tube and coupler metal scaffold\nshall be provided with a ledger or runner of metal tubing locked end to end\nwith fittings to form a continuous length of the scaffold. Such runner shall be\nsecured to each intersecting post of the scaffold with approved couplers or\nclamps. (2)\n\nRunners shall be placed\nnot more than six feet, six inches on centers vertically. (3)\n\nThe bottom runner of any such scaffold\nshall be located as close to the base of the scaffold as possible. (d) Bearers or putlogs. (1)\n\nThe bearers or putlogs of such scaffolds\nshall be installed transversely between the posts. They shall be securely\ncoupled to the posts and shall bear on the runner couplers. When such bearers\nor putlogs are coupled directly to the runners, the couplers shall be kept as\nclose to the posts as possible. (2)\n\nThe bearers or putlogs shall be located at each set of posts, at each level and\nat each intermediate level where a working platform has been\ninstalled. (3)\n\nEach bearer or\nputlog shall be of sufficient length to provide an overhang of at least four\ninches but not more than 12 inches beyond the inside and outside\nposts. (e) Bracing. (1)\n\nCross bracing shall be installed across\nthe width of every tube and coupler scaffold at every third set of posts\nhorizontally and at every fourth runner vertically. Such bracing shall extend\ndiagonally from the inner and outer runners in an upward direction to the next\nouter and inner runners. (2)\n\nLongitudinal bracing shall be installed on every tube and coupler scaffold. Such bracing shall run from a point near the base of the first outer post\nupward at an approximate 45 degree angle to the extreme top of the\nscaffold. (3)\n\nWhere the length of\nthe scaffold continues beyond such longitudinal bracing, such bracing shall be\nduplicated, beginning at every fifth post. (4)\n\nIn a similar manner, such longitudinal\nbracing shall also be installed to run from a point near the base of the last\npost upward at an approximate 45 degree angle toward the first post to the\nextreme top of the scaffold. (5)\n\nWhere the height of any such scaffold is greater than its length, additional\nlongitudinal bracing shall be installed at a point on the first post at the\nsame elevation as the top of the lower longitudinal bracing. Such additional\nbracing shall run in an upward direction at an angle of approximately 45\ndegrees to the top of the scaffold. Such additional bracing shall also be\ninstalled in a similar manner starting from the outer end or last post at the\nsame elevation. (6)\n\nWhere\nconditions prevent the attachment of such longitudinal bracing to the posts, such bracing may be attached to the runners of the scaffold. (f) Light duty tube and coupler\nscaffolds. All posts, bearers, runners and bracing used for light duty tube and\ncoupler scaffolds shall be constructed of nominal two-inch O.D. steel tubing. The posts of any such scaffold shall be spaced not more than six feet apart by\n10 feet along the length of the scaffold. (g) Medium duty tube and coupler scaffolds. All posts, runners and bracing of medium duty tube and coupler scaffolds shall\nbe constructed of nominal two-inch O.D. steel tubing. Where the posts are\nspaced not more than six feet apart by eight feet along the length of such\nscaffold, the bearers shall be constructed of nominal two and one-half inch\nO.D. steel tubing. Where the posts are spaced not more than five feet apart by\neight feet along the length of such scaffold, the bearers shall be constructed\nof nominal two-inch O.D. steel tubing. (h) Heavy duty tube and coupler scaffolds. All posts, bearers, runners and bracing of heavy duty tube and coupler\nscaffolds shall be constructed of nominal two and one-half inch O.D. steel\ntubing. The posts of such a scaffold shall be spaced not more than six feet\napart by six feet, six inches along the length of the scaffold. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-5.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
