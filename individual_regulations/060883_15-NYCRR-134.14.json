  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 134.14 - Fees\n\nState Regulations\n\nArticle 21 provides for the establishment of a schedule of\nfees to be paid by or on behalf of each participant in the program, which fees\nshall defray the ongoing expenses of the program. (a) This fee shall consist of two parts: (1)\nthat portion of the fee necessary to\ndefray the administrative costs of the Department of Motor Vehicles in\nadministering the program, which shall be paid by the applicant to the\ndepartment at the time he makes application for acceptance in a rehabilitation\nprogram; and\n(2)\nthat portion of\nthe fee required for enrollment in a program which shall be paid by the\napplicant prior to entry into the program to the entity authorized by the\ndepartment to conduct a rehabilitation program. Such fee shall not be\nrefundable unless the person is denied enrollment in the program upon his\napplication. Moreover, no portion of the fee shall be refundable by reason of\nthe participant's withdrawal or expulsion from the program. (b) Except as provided in\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, the total fee for a rehabilitation\nprogram shall not exceed $315. Seventy-five dollars of any such total fee shall\nrepresent the reimbursement of costs for administrative expenses incurred by\nthe Department of Motor Vehicles and sentencing courts. A participant in the\nprogram shall not be required to pay the $75 fee to the department if such\nparticipant held a conditional license pending prosecution under section\n134.18\nof this Part, if such\nconditional license was not revoked, and such conditional license was issued as\nthe result of the same violation on which participation in such program is\nbased. The commissioner may require that up to $20 of the total fee for a\nrehabilitation program shall be used for reimbursement of costs for curriculum\nenhancements to be developed by the Department of Motor Vehicles and/or a third\nparty authorized by the department. If the commissioner so requires, written\nnotification of such requirement shall be sent to all rehabilitation programs, and such portion of the fee shall be paid by the program directly to such\nauthorized third party. (c) A\nparticipant in a program who transfers to another program shall pay to the new\nprogram a fee of $25, plus $10 for each session remaining to be completed in\nthe new program. (d) A participant\nwho has previously withdrawn from a program and subsequently reenters such\nprogram shall pay a reenrollment fee of $50 to the program. (e) Each program shall submit an annual\nfiscal report and an annual statistical report, on a form prescribed by the\ncommissioner. Such reports shall be filed with the department no later than\n\nApril 30th in the year following the calendar year to which it\npertains. (f) In addition to the\nfees established in the preceding subdivisions of this section, there may be an\nadditional charge for extended alcohol or drug rehabilitative activities to\nwhich any defendant is referred by the program administrator as part of the\nrehabilitation program.
