  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 510.3 - Life-cycle Cost Analysis of Energy Code Updates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Life-cycle costs of an Energy Code update\nfor commercial buildings will be analyzed by using the methodology for\ndetermining life-cycle cost net present value of savings established in the\nDOE Commercial Methodology, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n510.7\nof this Part and as modified\nin this section for New York State. Life-cycle costs of an Energy Code update\nfor residential buildings will be analyzed by using the methodology for\nlife-cycle costs established in the\nDOE Residential\n\nMethodology, as incorporated by reference in section\n510.7\nof this Part and as modified\nin this section for New York State. (b) Building Energy Use Evaluation. For both\ncommercial and residential buildings, whole building simulation will be used to\ncalculate annual energy consumption for the duration of the study period for\nrelevant end uses of buildings with construction starts that fall within a\nthree-year period commencing on the effective date of an Energy Code update. (1)\n\nBuilding Prototypes. Prototype building\nmodels developed by DOE under the Building Code Energy Program will be selected\nas follows: (i) Commercial prototype building\nmodels. DOE commercial prototype building models will be modified as necessary\nto align with the anticipated predominant new construction system and equipment\nparameters in New York State. A minimum of 5 prototypes will be selected to\nrepresent not less than 75% of new construction starts by floor area in New\n\nYork State. (ii)\n\nResidential\nprototype building models. DOE residential building prototypes will be modified\nas necessary to align with anticipated predominant new construction system and\nequipment parameters in New York State. (2)\n\nBuilding Model Cases. Two cases for each\nprototype building model will be analyzed. One model case will be a building\nthat complies with the current Energy Code and other legal requirements, including Energy Law section 11-104(6) and Executive Law section 378(19); the\nother model case will be an otherwise identical building that complies with the\nproposed Energy Code update and other legal requirements, including Energy Law\nsection 11-104(6) and Executive Law section 378(19). (i) Prototype building model cases will be\nconfigured to use typical and financially reasonable design parameters of each\nof the two cases. (ii)\n\nPrototype\nbuilding model components that are unchanged by a proposed Energy Code update\nare identical in prototype building model cases. (3)\n\nClimate Zones. Each selected prototype\nbuilding model will be simulated in each New York State climate zone, weighted\nby anticipated percentage of statewide new construction starts, to estimate the\noverall state average energy impact of the proposed Energy Code update. The\ncalculated statewide impact will be weighted to account for both climate zone\nand building type specific differences in new construction that may be affected\nby the proposed Energy Code update. (c) Costs\n(1)\n\nEnergy Prices. Retail energy prices will\nbe based on the most recently-available New York State commercial or\nresidential energy prices as of the date the analysis is performed, derived\nfrom public sources, which shall include, when available, reporting sources\nmaintained by a federal or New York State entity authorized by law to report\nsuch information and/or an investor-owned public utility. Energy prices for\ndelivered fuel will be based on weighted average delivered fuel cost derived\nfrom an estimate of fuel use by type in New York State. Energy prices will be\nescalated in accordance with the methods in this subdivision. (i) Energy Price Escalation. Energy price\nescalation rates will be based on the projected change in energy costs in New\n\nYork State. Energy price escalation values will be derived from public sources, which shall include, when available, reporting sources maintained by a federal\nor New York State entity authorized by law to report such information, the New\n\nYork Independent System Operator (NYISO), and/or an investor-owned public\nutilities and may use a combination of projections for the near term such as\npublished investor-owned public utility sources. For purposes of this section, contemporaneous information reported in the U.S Department of Energy's Energy\n\nInformation Administration regarding Short Term Energy Outlook and Annual\n\nEnergy Outlook, and/or NYISO System & Resource Outlook may be\nused. (ii)\n\nEnergy Price Weighting\nby Climate Zone. When available, energy prices may be calculated using weighted\nenergy prices, by climate zone, to better account for the variability of energy\nprices throughout the different regions of New York State. Climate zone\nspecific energy prices are calculated by weighting the delivered energy and\nenergy cost of utilities serving the different New York State climate\nzones. (2)\n\nEffective\n\nUseful Life. The effective useful life of equipment and systems will be\ndetermined in accordance with Appendix P of the TRM, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n510.7\nof this Part. If equipment\nor material is not listed in the TRM, or if the value in the TRM is unreliable, an alternative source may be used. If a source alternative to the TRM is used, the source and effective useful life will be cited in reporting. (3)\n\nLabor and Material Costs. Labor and\nmaterial cost estimates will be adjusted for Albany, Buffalo, and New York City\nin accordance with the\nDOE Commercial Methodology\nand the DOE\nResidential Methodology, which are incorporated by reference in section\n510.7\nof this Part. (4)\n\nProperty Tax. Property tax will not be\nincluded in life-cycle cost analysis. (d) Life-cycle Cost of Energy Code Updates\nfor Commercial Buildings. (1)\n\nOwnership\n\nScenarios. Life-cycle costs for commercial buildings will be analyzed in\naccordance with the\nDOE Commercial Methodology\nfor privately\nowned buildings, as incorporated by reference in section\n510.7\nof this Part. (2)\n\nMaintenance Costs. If data is publicly\navailable to support estimating maintenance costs, weighted by New York State\nclimate zones, this level of analysis will be performed. (3)\n\nLoan Interest Rate. Loan interest rate\nwill be determined based on the most recent commercial loan rates when the\nanalysis is performed for New York State as applied in the\nDOE\nCommercial Methodology, as incorporated by reference in section\n510.7\nof this Part. (4)\n\nIncome Tax Rate. The income tax rate will\nbe equal to the combined federal and New York State corporate income tax rates\nin effect for the reporting year in which the evaluation is\nperformed. (5)\n\nAggregating Results. The results will be aggregated using average weighting factors based on the\nmost recent as of the date the analysis is performed New York State-derived\ndisaggregated construction volume data. For purposes of this section, data\nobtained from Dodge Data & Analytics Construction Projects Starts Database, or equivalent commercially available a source, shall been deemed\nsufficient. (e) Life-cycle Costs of Energy Code Updates to Residential Buildings\n(1)\n\nMortgage interest rate. The mortgage\ninterest rate will be based on the ten-year historical average of a\nconventional 30-year real estate loan in New York State. (2)\n\nLoan Fees. Loan fee values will be based\non most recent New York State data as of the date the analysis is performed\nfrom a credible source such as the Freddie Mac Weekly Primary Mortgage Market\n\nSurvey. (3)\n\nAggregation across\nfoundation types. The results will be aggregated across foundation types using\naverage weighting factors based on the most recent New York State-derived data\nas of the date the analysis is performed. (4)\n\nAggregation across Heating Equipment\n\nTypes. The results will be aggregated across heating equipment types using\naverage weighting factors based on the most recent New York-State-derived data\nand statutory requirements as of the date the analysis is performed. (5)\n\nAggregation across Building Type. The\nresults will be aggregated across building types using average weighting\nfactors based on the most recent census data for New York State or the best\navailable New York State market data as of the date the analysis is\nperformed. (f) Statewide\n\nLife-cycle Costs. The statewide life-cycle cost will be the weighted sum of\nboth the residential and commercial life-cycle cost analyses performed in\naccordance with this section. Weighting will be based on the estimated\nproportion of new construction starts during the three-year period commencing\non the estimated effective date of an Energy Code update. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
