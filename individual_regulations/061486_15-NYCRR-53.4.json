  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 53.4 - Determination of coefficient-of-friction class coding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For purposes of identification of brake\nlinings according to their different friction characteristics, a letter code\nshall be employed. There shall be two conditions under which coefficients are\nclassified: normal friction and hot friction. The following letter codes shall\nbe used to describe coefficients of friction: C--Coefficient of friction over 0.05 but not over\n0.15. D--Coefficient of friction over 0.15 but not over\n0.25. E--Coefficient of friction over 0.25 but not over\n0.35. F--Coefficient of friction over 0.35 but not over\n0.45. G--Coefficient of friction over 0.45 but not over\n0.55. H--Coefficient of friction over 0.55. (b) The coefficient of friction of each\nlining shall be identified by two consecutive letters, the first to represent\nthe defined level of normal friction and the second letter to represent the\ndefined level of hot friction. (c) The normal friction coefficient is that coefficient which is the numerical\naverage of the four points located at 200, 250, 300 and 400F on the second fade\ncurve of the plot sheet on which the average of five test runs is\nplotted. (d) The hot friction\ncoefficient is that coefficient which is the numerical average of the following\n10 points on that plot sheet on which the average of five tests is plotted: points at 400 and 300F on the first recovery run; points at 450, 500, 550, 600\nand 650F on the second fade run; points at 500, 400 and 300F on the second\nrecovery run. (e) If any\ntemperature point or points required to calculate friction coefficients are not\nreached in the prescribed time limit, the coefficient of friction value at 10\nminutes shall be used to give the full number of points required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n53.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
