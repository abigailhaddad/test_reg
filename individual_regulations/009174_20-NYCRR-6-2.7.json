  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 6-2.7 - Commonly owned group election\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-C)\n(a) (1)\n\nSubject to the restrictions in section\n6-2.6\nof this Subpart, a taxpayer\nmay elect to treat as its combined group all corporations that meet the capital\nstock requirement (such corporations are collectively referred to as the\n\"commonly owned group\"). If the election is made, all of the corporations that\nare members of the commonly owned group are bound by the election and will be\ntreated as the members of a single combined group for combined reporting\npurposes, regardless of whether: (i) these\ncorporations are included in more than one Federal consolidated return filed by\nmore than one Federal consolidated group, or\n(ii)\nthese corporations in fact are engaged\nin one or more unitary businesses. (2)\n\nUpon making the election, the commonly\nowned group must calculate the combined group's combined business income, and\ncombined capital of all members of the commonly owned group, and the fixed\ndollar minimum base tax of all taxpayers in the commonly owned group. (3)\n\nUpon making the election, the commonly\nowned group is deemed to be engaged in a single unitary business for all\npurposes, including for purposes of calculating business and investment\ncapital, business and investment income and the apportionment factor. (4)\n\nExample. Corporation A is in the business of producing paper, packaging and office supplies. It has three wholly owned subsidiaries. Corporation B is in the business of producing school supplies. Corporation C is\nin the business of selling the paper, packaging, office and school supplies\nproduced by Corporations A and B. Corporation D is in the business of operating\nan electronic legal research service that it sells to law firms. In 2015 and\n2016, Corporations A, B and C properly file a combined report as a unitary\nbusiness and Corporation D properly files a separate report. The dividends\n\nCorporation A receives from Corporation D are properly treated as investment\nincome on the combined report as income received from stock in a non-unitary\ncorporation that qualifies as investment capital. In 2017, Corporation A makes\nthe commonly owned group election and Corporations A, B, C and D file a\ncombined report. As Corporation D is included in the combined report, its stock\ncannot be investment capital. On that report, the dividends Corporation A\nreceives from Corporation D are properly eliminated in computing combined\nbusiness income. In 2018, Corporation A sells all of its stock in Corporation D\nto a third-party, realizing a capital gain on the sale. Corporation A's capital\ngain on the sale of its stock in Corporation D is treated as a capital gain\nfrom the sale of a unitary member of the combined group and is properly\nreported as business income on the combined report of the commonly owned\ngroup. (b) Mechanics of making the election. A commonly owned group election must be made\nby the designated agent of the combined group, acting on behalf of all the\ncorporations in the commonly owned group. The election must be made on an\noriginal, timely filed report, determined with regard to extensions of time for\nfiling. Any commonly owned group election made on a report that is filed late\nwill be invalid and ineffective. (c) Effect of election in subsequent tax\nyears. A commonly owned group election is binding for and applicable to the\ntaxable year for which it is made and for the next six taxable years (if the\nfirst year is not a short taxable year) or the next seven taxable years (if the\nfirst year is a short taxable year). The election is binding on all\ncorporations that meet the capital stock requirement and continues in place\nregardless of whether any Federal consolidated group to which members of the\ncombined group belong discontinues the filing of a Federal consolidated return\nor the designated agent of the group changes. Any corporation that enters a\ncommonly owned group by acquisition or creation during the time that the\ncommonly owned group election is in effect must be included in the combined\ngroup beginning with the taxable year during which the corporation enters the\ngroup, and the corporation entering the group shall be considered to have\nconsented to the application of the election and to have waived any objection\nto its inclusion in the combined group. The disposition of or the failure to\nmeet the capital stock requirement of one or more members of a combined group\nwill not sever an election for the remaining members of the group and the\nleaving member or members are not bound by the election. However, reverse\nacquisition rules based on the Federal rules set forth in\n26 CFR\n1.1502-75(d)(3)\nwill be\napplied in determining whether a corporation is bound by a commonly owned group\nelection. The entrance or departure of a corporation from the commonly owned\ngroup does not change the effective periods as defined in subdivision (d) of\nthis section. (d) Revocation, renewal of election. A commonly owned group election, once made, cannot be\nrevoked until after it has been effective for seven taxable years (if the\nelection is not made on a short period return) or eight taxable years (if the\nelection is made on a short period return), such periods hereinafter referred\nto as the \"effective period\". When an election is made, it will continue to be\nautomatically renewed after the effective period for another effective period\nindefinitely, unless the designated agent of the commonly owned group, acting\non behalf of all the corporations included in the commonly owned group, affirmatively revokes the election at the end of the effective period. In the\ncase of a revocation, a new election will not be permitted in any of the three\ntaxable years immediately following the revocation. A revocation will be\neffective for the first taxable year (whether or not that taxable year is a\nshort taxable year) after the completion of the effective period for which the\nprior election was in place and must be made by the designated agent on an\noriginal, timely filed report, determined with regard to extensions of time for\nfiling, for that first subsequent taxable year. Every corporation that is a\nmember of the commonly owned group is bound by such revocation. If a commonly\nowned group election is affirmatively revoked after the effective period, the\nelection will terminate for the subsequent taxable year, and no commonly owned\ngroup election by any member of that commonly owned group will apply for that\nyear and the subsequent two taxable years (if revoked on a report that is not a\nshort period report) or the subsequent three taxable years (if revoked on a\nreport that is a short period report). In such cases, the designated agent of\nthat commonly owned group may make a new election beginning in the third or\nfourth taxable year after the revocation. (e) In determining the effective periods\ndescribed in this section, short taxable years will not be considered or\ncounted. However, the election or revocation may be made on a report for a\nshort taxable year. (1)\n\nExample. Corporation A is a calendar year taxpayer for Federal\nincome tax purposes. On April 1, 2015, Corporation A, which has 25 wholly owned\nsubsidiaries, purchases an office building in New York State. Prior to April 1, 2015, neither Corporation A nor any of its subsidiaries had nexus with New\n\nYork. Thus, Corporation A's first taxable year in New York is a short taxable\nyear (4/1/15-12/31/15). Corporation A, as the designated agent, makes the\ncommonly owned group election on its first report and includes all of its 25\nwholly owned subsidiaries in a combined report. Although the commonly owned\ngroup election can be made on the short period 2015 report, such period does\nnot count in determining the seven-year period for which the election is in\neffect. As such, the commonly owned group election will apply from April 1, 2015, until the tax year ending on December 31, 2022, assuming there are no\nother short taxable years during this time period.
