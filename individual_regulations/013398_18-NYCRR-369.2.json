Tit. 18 § 369.2 - Determination of initial eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nEligibility for family assistance shall be determined for\neach applicant in accordance with the policies and procedures generally\napplicable in public assistance. This determination shall include consideration\nof each of the following factors of eligibility: financial need, age, welfare\nof child or minor, residence within the State, living arrangements, relationship of child to relative, and the durational time limits applicable to\nthe FA program. Where there is emergent need and a presumption of categorical\neligibility exists, the predetermination grant procedure shall be followed. The\napplicant shall be advised of the requirement of having a social security\nnumber for each person in the public assistance household, and that the social\nsecurity number will be utilized in the administration of the FA program. The\napplicant shall further be advised of the requirement of complying, when\napplicable, with the requirements of the Child Support Enforcement Program in\naccordance with this section and Parts 346 and 347 of this Title and with the\nwork requirements, when applicable, in accordance with Part 385 of this\n\nTitle. (a) Financial\nneed. Financial need shall be determined in accordance with the\napproved standards of assistance. (1)\n\nDetermination of financial need of applicant. (i) Child living with one or both parents. Need for a child living with one or both parents shall be determined for the\nfamily unit in accordance with public assistance standards. (ii)\n\nChild living with another relative. (a) Dependent relative. When the child is\nliving with an eligible relative other than a parent, who is without adequate\nmeans of support, financial need shall be determined for the family unit in\naccordance with public assistance standards. (b) Self-maintaining, nonlegally responsible\nrelative. If the applicant is a nonlegally responsible relative who is\nself-maintaining or is supported by a spouse or other person who is not a\nlegally responsible relative, a FA grant may be made for the needy child. The\nneeds of the child shall be computed according to applicable public assistance\nstandards in accordance with the provisions of Part 352 of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nEligibility where child or applicant has sufficient resources for his or her\nown maintenance. (i) A child or minor who has\nsufficient financial income to meet the expenses of his or her own maintenance\nshall be considered categorically eligible for FA if the parent or eligible\nrelative with whom he or she is living and who is essential to his or her needs\nhas insufficient means for self-support. (ii)\nA child or minor shall be considered\neligible for FA if the parent or eligible relative with whom he or she is\nliving has sufficient means to maintain himself or herself but not enough to\nmaintain the child or minor and there are no other resources available\ntherefor. (3)\n\nThe social\nservices official shall determine the availability of, and seek enforcement and\ncollection of, all support obligations owed to recipients of family assistance\nand foster care pursuant to the requirements and procedures set out in Part 347\nof this Title. (b) Compliance with child support enforcement program (IV-D) eligibility\nrequirements. As used in this subdivision, public assistance (PA) shall\nrefer to assistance received through either the family assistance (FA) or the\nsafety net assistance (SNA) program. Except where specified otherwise in this\nsubdivision, the following provisions apply to both FA and SNA cases. (1)\n\nIn addition to other eligibility\nrequirements, each person who is applying for or receiving public assistance\n(PA) or each person upon whose behalf an application is made therefor, and who\nis otherwise eligible, shall be required, as a further condition of both\ninitial and continuing eligibility for such assistance: (i) to furnish a social security number for\neach member of the household for whom an application for assistance is made or\nwho is receiving assistance and any other individual whose needs are considered\nin determining the amount of assistance; (a) when a social security number cannot be furnished, the applicant or recipient\nshall apply for such number, submit verification of such application, and\nprovide the number upon its receipt; (b) the social services official shall assist\nthe applicant or recipient in verifying or obtaining a social security number; and\n(c) assistance shall not be\ndenied, delayed or discontinued pending issuance or verification of a social\nsecurity number if the applicant or recipient has complied with clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph; (ii)\nin the case of continued absence of a\nparent or stepparent of a household member under the age of 21 years, to assign\nto the State and the social services district any rights to support which such\nperson may have either in his or her own behalf or in behalf of any other\nfamily member for whom he or she is applying for or receiving aid and to pay to\nthe support collection unit any child support. Application for or receipt of PA\nshall constitute such an assignment; and\n(iii)\nto cooperate in good faith with the\n\nState and social services official in establishing the paternity of a child\nborn out of wedlock; in efforts to locate any absent parent or putative father; in establishing, modifying, and enforcing orders of support; and in obtaining\nsupport payments or any other payments or property due such person and due each\nchild. The term\ncooperate\nincludes the following: (a) completing the child support enforcement\nreferral form and, at a minimum, providing verifiable information on the form\nsufficient to identify and locate the absent parent or putative father, including: (1)\nthe full name and social\nsecurity number of the absent parent or putative father; or\n(2)\nthe full name of the absent parent or\nputative father and at least two of the following concerning such parent or\nfather: (i) date of birth; (ii)\nresidential and, if different, mailing\naddress; (iii)\ntelephone number; and\n(iv)\nname and address of\nemployer; or\n(3)\nthe\nfull name and any additional information equivalent to the information required\nby subclause (\n1\n) or (\n2\n) of this clause that\nleads to establishment of the absent parent's or putative father's identity and\nlocation. (b) appearing\nat the local child support enforcement unit, as necessary, to provide the child\nsupport enforcement referral form and such oral or written information or\ndocumentary evidence, known to be possessed by or reasonably obtainable by the\napplicant or recipient, that is relevant to achieving the objectives of this\nsubdivision; (c) appearing as a\nwitness at court or other hearings or proceedings necessary to achieve the\nobjectives of this subdivision; (d) providing information or attesting to the lack of information under penalty of\nperjury; (e) submitting the child\nand herself or himself to genetic tests, pursuant to judicial order or\nadministrative direction; and\n(f) after an assignment of support under this subdivision has been made, paying to\nthe support collection unit any payments received from the absent parent which\nare covered by that assignment; (iv)\nan applicant for or recipient of public\nassistance who, as a victim of domestic violence, has been granted a waiver of\nchild support cooperation requirements as authorized by section\n351.2\n(l) of this\n\nTitle is not required to cooperate to the extent authorized by such\nwaiver. (2)\n\nHowever, in\na case where a proceeding to establish paternity has been filed, and the\nallegation is denied by the respondent, the applicant or recipient shall be\ninformed that all paternity proceedings are stayed until 60 days after the\nbirth of the child. In such case, public assistance and care shall not be\ndenied during the stay on the basis of refusal to cooperate. (3)\n\nIf an applicant for or recipient of PA is\nfound to be ineligible for PA because of his or her failure to comply with the\nrequirements of this subdivision, except a refusal to furnish or apply for a\nsocial security number, he or she is prohibited from receiving assistance in\naccordance with section\n352.30\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. In such a case if the public assistance case is FA, any assistance for\nwhich the dependent child is eligible must be furnished in the form of\nprotective payments in accordance with Part 381 of this Title. (4)\n\nClaiming good cause for refusing to\ncooperate. (i) Opportunity to claim good\ncause. An applicant for, or recipient of, PA will have the opportunity to claim\ngood cause for refusing to cooperate as specified by subparagraph (iii) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nNotification to the applicant or\nrecipient. The public assistance worker or an appropriate designee shall notify\nthe applicant or recipient of the right to claim good cause as an exception to\nthe cooperation requirement and of all the requirements applicable to a good\ncause determination. (a) Such notice shall be\nin writing in a form prescribed by the office. (b) The PA worker or an appropriate designee\nand the applicant or recipient shall sign and date a copy of the notice. A copy\nof the notice shall be given to the applicant or recipient, and a signed copy\nshall be filed in the case record. (iii)\n\nRequirements upon applicant or\nrecipient. An applicant for, or recipient of, PA who refuses to cooperate, and\nwho claims to have good cause for refusing to cooperate, has the burden of\nestablishing the existence of a good cause circumstance and will be required\nto: (a) specify the circumstances that the\napplicant or recipient believes provide sufficient good cause for not\ncooperating; (b) corroborate the\ngood cause circumstances in accordance with subparagraph (vii) of this\nparagraph; and\n(c) if requested, provide sufficient information (such as the putative father or absent parent's\nname and address, if known) to permit an investigation pursuant to clause\n(\ng\n) of subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. If the applicant\nor recipient does not meet the above requirements, the public assistance worker\nor an appropriate designee shall on that basis determine that good cause does\nnot exist. (iv)\n\nCircumstances under which cooperation is against the best interests of the\nchild. Cooperation in establishing paternity or seeking support shall be deemed\nto be against the best interests of the child only if: (a) the applicant's or recipient's\ncooperation in establishing paternity or securing support is reasonably\nanticipated to result in: (1)\nphysical harm to\nthe child for whom support is to be sought; (2)\nemotional harm to the child for whom\nsupport is to be sought; (3)\nphysical harm to the parent or caretaker relative with whom the child is living\nwhich reduces such person's capacity to care for the child\nadequately; (4)\nemotional harm to\nthe parent or caretaker relative with whom the child is living, of such nature\nor degree that it reduces such person's capacity to care for the child\nadequately; or\n(b) the\nchild for whom support is sought was conceived as a result of incest or\nforcible rape; or\n(c) legal\nproceedings for the adoption of the child are pending before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; or\n(d) the\napplicant or recipient is currently being assisted by a public or licensed\nprivate social agency to resolve the issue of whether to keep the child or\nrelinquish the child for adoption, and discussions have not gone on for more\nthan three months. (v) Physical harm and emotional harm defined. Physical harm and emotional harm must\nbe of a serious nature in order to justify a finding of good cause. A finding\nof good cause for emotional harm may only be based on a demonstration of an\nemotional impairment that substantially affects the individual's\nfunctioning. (vi)\n\nSpecial\nconsiderations related to emotional harm. (a) For every good cause determination which is based in whole or in part upon the\nanticipation of emotional harm to the child, the parent or the caretaker\nrelative, the PA worker or an appropriate designee shall consider the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe present emotional state of\nthe individual subject to emotional harm; (2)\nthe emotional health history of the\nindividual subject to emotional harm; (3)\nthe intensity and probable duration of\nthe emotional upset; (4)\nthe degree\nof cooperation to be required; and\n(5)\nthe extent of the involvement of the\nchild in the paternity establishment or support enforcement activity to be\nundertaken. (b) The PA\nworker or an appropriate designee shall document the findings with respect to\nthe above factors in the PA case record. (vii)\n\nProof of good cause claim. (a) The PA worker or an appropriate designee\nwill make a good cause determination based on corroborative evidence supplied\nby the applicant or recipient only after the worker or designee has examined\nthe evidence and found it actually verifies the good cause claim. (b) The applicant or recipient who claims\ngood cause must provide corroborative evidence within 20 days from the day the\nclaim was made. If the PA worker or an appropriate designee determines the\napplicant or recipient requires additional time because of the difficulty of\nobtaining the corroborative evidence, upon supervisory approval, the worker or\ndesignee shall allow a reasonable additional period of time. (c) Good cause may be corroborated with the\nfollowing types of evidence: (1)\nbirth\ncertificates or medical or law enforcement records which indicate that the\nchild was conceived as the result of incest or forcible rape; (2)\ncourt documents or other records which\nindicate that legal proceedings for adoption are pending before a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction; (3)\ncourt, medical, criminal, child protective services, social services, psychological, or law enforcement records which indicate that the putative father or absent\nparent might inflict physical or emotional harm on the child or caretaker\nrelative; (4)\nmedical records which\nindicate emotional health history and present emotional health status of the\ncaretaker relative or the child for whom support would be sought, or written\nstatements from a mental health professional licensed to practice in New York\n\nState, indicating a diagnosis or prognosis concerning the emotional health of\nthe caretaker relative or the child for whom support would be sought; (5)\na written statement from a public or\nlicensed private social agency that the applicant or recipient is being\nassisted by the agency to resolve the issue of whether to keep the child or\nrelinquish him or her for adoption; and\n(6)\nsworn statements from individuals, other\nthan the applicant or recipient, with knowledge of the circumstances which\nprovide the basis for good cause claim. (d) If after examining the corroborative\nevidence submitted by the applicant or recipient, the PA worker or an\nappropriate designee determines that additional corroborative evidence is\nneeded to permit a good cause determination, the worker or designee will: (1)\npromptly notify the applicant or\nrecipient that additional corroborative evidence is needed; and\n(2)\nspecify the type of document\nneeded. (e) Upon\nrequest, the PA worker or an appropriate designee will: (1)\nadvise the applicant or recipient how to\nobtain the necessary documents; and\n(2)\nmake a reasonable effort to obtain any\nspecific documents which the applicant or recipient is not reasonably able to\nobtain without assistance. (f) Where a claim is based on the applicant's\nor recipient's anticipation of physical harm as specified and defined in\nsubparagraphs (iv) and (v) of this paragraph, and corroborative evidence is not\nsubmitted in support of the claim: (1)\nthe PA\nworker or an appropriate designee will investigate the good cause claim when\nthe worker or designee believes that the claim is credible without\ncorroborative evidence, and corroborative evidence is not available; (2)\ngood cause will be found if the\nclaimant's sworn statement and the investigation which is conducted satisfy the\nPA worker or an appropriate designee that the applicant or recipient has good\ncause for refusing to cooperate; and\n(3)\na determination that good cause exists\nwill be reviewed and approved or disapproved by supervisory personnel and the\nfindings will be recorded in the PA case record. (g) The PA worker or an appropriate designee\nmay further verify the good cause claim if the applicant's or recipient's\nstatement of the claim required by this subparagraph, together with the\ncorroborative evidence, does not provide sufficient basis for making a\ndetermination. When the worker or designee determines that it is necessary, the\nPA unit or designee may conduct an investigation of good cause claims to\ndetermine that good cause does or does not exist. (h) If the PA unit or an appropriate designee\nconducts an investigation of a good cause claim, the unit or designee will: (1)\ncontact the absent parent or putative\nfather from whom support would be sought if such contact is determined to be\nnecessary to establish the good cause claim; and\n(2)\nprior to making such necessary contact, notify the applicant or recipient to enable the applicant or recipient to: (i) present additional corroborative evidence\nor information so that contact with the parent or putative father becomes\nunnecessary; or\n(ii)\nwithdraw the\napplication for assistance or have the case closed; or\n(iii)\nhave the good cause claim\ndenied. (5)\n\nParticipation by the local child support\nenforcement unit. (i) Prior to making a final\ndetermination of good cause for refusing to cooperate, the PA worker or an\nappropriate designee shall: (a) afford the\nlocal child support enforcement unit the opportunity to review and comment on\nthe findings and basis for the proposed determination; and\n(b) consider any recommendation from the\nchild support enforcement unit. (ii)\n\nThe PA worker or an appropriate designee\nshall give the local child support enforcement unit the opportunity to\nparticipate in any hearing that results from an applicant's or recipient's\nappeal of any action of the office under this subdivision. (6)\n\nNotice to the local child support\nenforcement unit. The PA unit or an appropriate designee shall promptly report\nto the local child support enforcement unit: (i) all cases in which good cause has been\nclaimed and a determination is pending; (ii)\nall cases in which there is a good cause\nfor refusal to cooperate and the basis for the determination and whether or not\nchild support enforcement may proceed without the participation of the\ncaretaker relative; and\n(iii)\nall\ncases in which it has been determined there is not good cause for refusal to\ncooperate. (7)\n\nGranting\nor continuation of assistance. The PA worker shall not deny, delay or\ndiscontinue assistance pending a determination of good cause for refusal to\ncooperate if the applicant or recipient has complied with the requirement of\nthis subdivision to furnish corroborative evidence and information. (8)\n\nPeriodic review of good cause\ndetermination. The PA worker or an appropriate designee shall: (i) periodically review, not less frequently\nthan at each redetermination of eligibility, those cases in which the agency or\nan appropriate designee has determined that good cause exists based on a\ncircumstance that is subject to change; (ii)\ndetermine if circumstances have changed\nto the extent that good cause no longer exists. If so, the PA worker or an\nappropriate designee shall rescind the findings; and\n(iii)\ngive prompt notification to the child\nsupport enforcement unit of every change in determination of good cause, as per\nsubparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (9)\n\nRecordkeeping. Social services districts\nshall maintain records of the activities under this subdivision as prescribed\nby the office. (10)\n\nEnforcement\nwithout the caretaker's cooperation. (i) If\nthe PA worker or an appropriate designee makes a determination of good cause on\nthe basis of the circumstances specified above, the PA worker or designee shall\nalso make a determination of whether or not child support enforcement could\nproceed without risk to the child or caretaker relative if the enforcement or\ncollection activities did not involve their participation. (ii)\n\nThis determination shall be in writing, contain the agency's or its designee's finding and basis for determination, and\nbe entered into the PA case record. (iii)\n\nIf the PA worker or an appropriate\ndesignee excuses cooperation but determines that the child support enforcement\nunit may proceed to establish paternity or enforce support, the worker or\ndesignee shall notify the applicant or recipient to enable such individual to\nwithdraw his or her application for assistance or have the case\nclosed. (iv)\n\nIn the process of\nmaking a determination under this paragraph, the PA worker or an appropriate\ndesignee shall afford the child support enforcement unit the opportunity to\nreview and comment on the findings and basis for the proposed determination, and consider any recommendation from the child support enforcement\nunit. (11)\n\nFinal\ndetermination of good cause for refusal to cooperate. (i) The PA unit or an appropriate designee\nwill make the final determination that good cause does or does not exist. Such\ndetermination shall: (a) be in\nwriting; (b) contain the findings\nand basis for the determination; and\n(c) be entered in the PA case\nrecord. (ii)\n\nThe\ndetermination shall be made within 30 days from the day the good cause claim is\nmade. (iii)\n\nThe PA unit or an\nappropriate designee may exceed 30 days when the case record documents that\nadditional time is needed because the information required to verify the claim\ncannot be obtained within 30 days or the claimant did not provide corroborative\nevidence within 20 days. (iv)\n\nIf\nthe PA unit or an appropriate designee determines good cause does not exist: (a) the applicant or recipient will be so\nnotified and afforded the opportunity to cooperate, withdraw the application\nfor assistance, or have the case closed; and\n(b) continued refusal to cooperate will\nresult in sanctioning the applicant or recipient in accordance with section\n352.30\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. If the public assistance case is FA, any assistance for which the\ndependent child is eligible shall be furnished in the form of protective\npayments in accordance with Part 381 of this Title. (c) Age. A child is eligible if under 18 years of age; or if under\nage 19 if he or she is a full-time student regularly attending a secondary\nschool, or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training. The age\nof each child for whom family assistance is requested shall be established. However, family assistance shall not be denied to children who are obviously\nbelow the age limit solely because the date of birth cannot be determined\nimmediately. Age shall be established as soon as possible. The fact that a\nchild 18 years of age is a full-time student in a secondary school, or in the\nequivalent level of vocational or technical training shall be established. The\nfollowing considerations shall apply to establishing such facts: (1)\n\nSecondary school, or in the\nequivalent level of vocational or technical training\nshall mean\nattending public, private or parochial school with a course of study leading to\na high school diploma or its equivalent whose curriculum is approved by the\n\nEducation Department. (2)\n\nFull-time attendance, provided it represents a program of\neducation or training as defined in this subdivision, shall be: (i) in accordance with what the individual\ninstitution considers full-time for academic institutions; (ii)\na minimum schedule of 25 hours per week\nfor trade schools and other nonacademic institutions. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, a child shall be considered in full-time attendance while: (i) a resident pupil temporarily absent from\nhome, when the primary purpose is to secure educational, vocational or\ntechnical training and the parent retains full responsibility for and control\nof such minor; (ii)\nenrolled in\nschool, but on vacation; or\n(iii)\nreceiving instruction in the home conducted by the board of education or while\nenrolled in any courses leading to a high school equivalency\ncertificate. (d) Welfare of child or minor. A child or minor shall be considered to be eligible for\nFA if his or her home situation is one in which his or her physical, mental and\nmoral well-being will be safeguarded. Where there is concern for a child's\nwelfare, referral shall be made to children's services for assessment of the\nchild's home situation. (1)\n\nIn\ndetermining the ability of a parent or relative to care for the child so that\nthis purpose is achieved, the home shall be judged by the same standards as are\napplied to self-maintaining families in the community. When, at the time of\napplication, a home does not meet the usual standards of health and decency but\nthe welfare of the child is not endangered, FA shall be granted and services\nprovided in an effort to improve the situation. Where appropriate, consultation\nand direct service shall be requested from children's services. (2)\n\nThe parent or other caretaker relative\nmay be considered available for employment in accordance with Parts 385 and 388\nof this Title. (e) Residence requirement. A child or minor, to be eligible for FA, shall live\nwithin the State at the time of application. His or her residence shall be\nestablished. (f) Living with parent or other adult relative. (1)\n\nOwn home. A child or minor, to be\neligible for FA, shall be living in his or her own home, i.e., with his or her parent or parents or with some other adult relative as\nspecified in section\n369.1\nof this Part. A child is\nconsidered to be living in his or her own home as long as the relative takes\nresponsibility for the care and control of the child, even though: (i) circumstances may require temporary\nabsence of either the child or relative; (ii)\nthe child has been placed in the home of\nsuch relative by the court, except when placement is on a board basis with a\nplan for supervision and control by the Office of Children and Family Services\nor social services district through its children's services program. (2)\n\nRelationship of child to\nrelative. The specific relationship of the child or minor to the parent or\nother eligible relative shall be established. (g) Out-of-wedlock children. (1)\n\nInitial information as to alleged\npaternity shall be obtained from the mother and a referral to the local Child\n\nSupport Enforcement Unit shall be made in accordance with section\n369.7\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWhere paternity has been acknowledged or\nadjudicated, eligibility for FA is determined in the same manner as for a child\nwhose parents are legally married. (h) Potential eligibility for\nSSI. Any applicant for or recipient of family assistance who, based on a medical statement documenting or indicating the existence of a\nphysical or mental impairment, reasonably appears to qualify for Supplemental\n\nSecurity Income (SSI) benefits, or who otherwise appears to be eligible for SSI\nbenefits must, as a condition of eligibility or of continuing eligibility, apply for and cooperate with all requirements set forth by the Social Security\n\nAdministration (SSA) for making a determination of that individual's\neligibility for SSI benefits and appeal any denial of his or her initial SSI\napplication and exhaust the available administrative remedies. An applicant or\nrecipient who is referred to the SSA to apply for SSI must be provided by the\nsocial services district with any available medical documentation which may\nhave been used to establish potential eligibility for SSI and any other medical\ninformation available at the time of referral. An entry must be made in the\ndistrict's SSI tracking system established under section\n370.2\nof this Title with respect\nto each such referral. When such applicant or recipient refuses to cooperate in\napplying for SSI benefits for himself or for a member of the FA household, the\nneeds of such individual must be eliminated from the grant, and the needs of\nthe family must be determined based on the remaining persons in the grant. If, however, such individual is physically or emotionally unable to complete the\nSSI application process, the social services district must provide any services\nwhich are necessary to ensure that the individual is assisted in making the SSI\napplication. In such instance, that individual must not be denied public\nassistance and care. (i) Restriction in payment to minor parents and pregnant minors. No individual who is under the age of 18 and is not\nmarried, who resides with and provides care for his or her dependent child (not\nincluding adoptive children) or is pregnant and otherwise entitled to FA (a\n\"minor parent\"), shall receive FA for himself or herself unless the individual\nand child or pregnant woman resides in the household of a parent, legal\nguardian, other relative of the individual who is over the age of 18 and is\nlisted in section\n369.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart unless one of the exclusions in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is found\nto exist. (1)\n\nThe appropriate living\narrangement for the individual and minor child will be determined according to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision if one of the following exclusions is found\nto exist: (i) the minor parent has no living\nparent or legal guardian whose whereabouts is known; or\n(ii)\nno living parent or legal guardian or\nadult relative of the minor parent allows the minor parent to live in his or\nher home; or\n(iii)\nthe individual\nor minor child is being or has been subjected to serious physical or emotional\nharm, sexual abuse or exploitation in the residence of the parent or guardian; or\n(iv)\nsubstantial evidence exists\nof imminent or serious harm if the individual or dependent child were to live\nin the residence with the individual's parent or legal guardian; or\n(v) the social services district determines\nthat it is in the minor child's best interest to waive such requirement with\nrespect to the individual or minor child. (2)\n\nWhen an exclusion exists, and unless the\nindividual's current living arrangement is appropriate, the social services\ndistrict shall locate or assist the individual in locating an adult supervised\nsupportive living arrangement approved by the district in accordance with the\nstandards set by the office taking into account the needs and concerns of the\nindividual, including but not limited to a maternity home or a second chance\nhome. A\nsecond chance home\nis a facility which provides\nteenaged parents with a supportive and supervised living arrangement in which\nthey are required to learn parenting skills, including child development, family budgeting, health and nutrition and other skills to promote long-term\neconomic independence and the well-being of their children. (3)\n\nIf an individual subject to the\nrequirements of this subdivision alleges facts which, if true, would render the\nrequirement to live with a parent or other relative inapplicable by reason of\nsubparagraphs (1)(iii) and (iv) of this subdivision, the local district shall\nnot deny assistance under the authority of this subdivision unless it has been\nduly investigated in accordance with Part 432 of this Title and made a contrary\nfinding. If the local district denies assistance when, after such contrary\nfinding, the individual refuses to live with the parent or relative, the\nindividual shall be entitled to a fair hearing pursuant to Part 358 of this\n\nTitle held within 30 days of the request, if the request is timely\nmade. (j) Refugee\ncash assistance. A person who is eligible for benefits under the refugee\ncash assistance program as defined in Part 373 of this Title is not eligible\nfor FA. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
