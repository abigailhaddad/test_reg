  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-4.8 - Transfer, segregation and investment of reserve\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt the end of each calendar quarter, the provision for\nreplacements as per Table II of the schedule of replacement reserve\nrequirements shall be transferred from the administration fund to the reserve\nfund, as directed in section\n1647-4.5. It is preferable that\nexpenditures for replacements be made directly from the reserve fund, but they\nmay also be made from the administration fund, in which case the administration\nfund shall be reimbursed not later than the end of the quarter in which the\nexpenditure was made. The segregation and investment of the reserve are\ndiscussed in Subpart 1647-5, to which reference should be\nmade. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1647-4.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
