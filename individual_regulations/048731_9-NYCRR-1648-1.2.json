  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-1.2 - Statutory limitations\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Public Housing Law places the following limitations\non the payment of State subsidies: (a) Maximum State subsidy. The State subsidies actually paid will vary each year\nwith the operating deficit of a project, but no State subsidy may be paid in\nexcess of the maximum amount stipulated in the Public Housing Law. The maximum\namount of State subsidy payable in any one year on any one project cannot\nexceed a sum equal to the largest annual interest charge on funds borrowed from\nthe State to finance such project, exclusive of funds borrowed for working\ncapital, plus one per cent of the project cost. However, where all or any part\nof the funds necessary to finance the project are borrowed from sources other\nthan the State, or Federal government the State subsidy may equal but cannot\nexceed the largest annual interest charge on all borrowed funds, plus one per\ncent of the project cost or three and one-half per cent of the project cost\nwhichever is less. (b) Matching\nlocal subsidy. The law provides that no State subsidy shall be available for\nany project unless and until the municipality in which such project is situated\nshall contract to make subsidies to such project in an amount at least equal to\nsubsidy contracted to be made by the State. However, all or any part of such\nmunicipal subsidy may be in the form of exemption from local or municipal taxes\nto the extent specified in section 73 of the law. In practice, these provisions\nmean that the local subsidy, including the tax exemption subsidy, must at all\ntimes match the State subsidy but may at times exceed it. (c) Appropriations for State subsidies. State\nsubsidies are payable on an annual basis out of moneys appropriated therefor by\nthe State legislature. Time is of the essence in submitting requisitions for\n\nState subsidies (see Subpart 1648-3), particularly where such subsidies are\nrequired in connection with debt service. (d) Fixed period of years. State subsidies\nare payable over a fixed period of years not exceeding the life of the project, but in any event not exceeding 50 years. The period of years over which the\n\nState subsidy is payable will, ordinarily, be stated in the contract for State\naid. The fixed period of years over which the State subsidy is payable\ncommences on the date of substantial completion of the project, as determined\nby the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
