  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 573.1 - Issuance of operating certificate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applications for operating certificates shall be submitted on a form provided\nby the office which shall specify: (1)\nidentification of the governing body and its legal base; (2)\nthe class of operating certificate for\nwhich application is made; and\n(3)\nidentification of the facilities and programs to be operated. (b) The applications shall be\nsubmitted with all documentary material required by the operating standards for\nthe facilities proposed to be operated in the case of original applications or\nas required by revisions to documentary materials and written annual\nevaluations in the case of applications for renewal of operating\ncertificates. (c) (1)\n\nFor all providers for which an operating\ncertificate from the Office of Mental Health is required, except for family\ncare homes, initial operating certificates will be issued for a period not to\nexceed three years, as determined by the office. Subsequent operating\ncertificates will be issued for periods of three years except that shorter\nperiods may be prescribed for cause. (2)\n\nIn accordance with Mental Hygiene Law\nsection 31.03, the operating certificate issued for a family care home shall be\nvalid for two years. (d) Operating certificates shall: (1)\ncertify\neach separate location covered by the operating certificate; and\n(2)\nspecify the class of the operating\ncertificate and the programs authorized thereby to be operated. (e) (1)\n\nNo application for the renewal of an\noperating certificate for a psychiatric inpatient unit of a hospital licensed\npursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law and Part 580 of this Title\nshall be accepted until the applicant hospital is granted approval to admit\npatients pursuant to section\n9.39\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law, except that the commissioner shall waive this requirement\nfor a period of two years upon his or her determination that: (i) there is no public need for additional\nbeds for emergency psychiatric admission in the subregional service area. In\ndetermining such need, the factors which the commissioner shall consider shall\ninclude, but not be limited to: (a) the\ncurrent and projected population characteristics of the service area, including\nthe prevalence of mental illness in the population; (b) the current patterns of utilization of\npsychiatric services and the service demands of the service area; (c) the existence and availability of\npsychiatric resources available in the community; and\n(d) acute bed needs of the service area as\nidentified in the acute bed needs methodology set forth in the Office of Mental\n\nHealth's five-year plan for mental health services required by section\n5.07\n(h) of the Mental Hygiene Law; (ii)\nthe hospital lacks the\nphysical capacity to reasonably accommodate such emergency admissions without\nextensive structural changes. For the purpose of this section, extensive\nstructural changes shall consist of any project for which the costs of\naccommodating emergency admissions will unreasonably increase the approved\npsychiatric inpatient rate of the hospital; (iii)\nthe hospital does not and reasonably\ncould not provide the scope of services necessary to assure adequate and\nappropriate psychiatric care and treatment for patients in emergency\nsituations; (iv)\nthe hospital has\nagreed to accept referrals of involuntary psychiatric patients under an\nemergency admissions system which has been approved by the commissioner. In\ndetermining whether such a proposed system should be approved, the\ncommissioner, in consultation with the local governmental unit, shall consider\nwhether such proposal: (a) defines the\nspecific area to be served; (b) provides for sufficient beds for emergency psychiatric admissions to meet the\npublic needs identified for the subregional service area pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph; (c) describes the manner in which the\npatterns of admission in the service area will be altered; and\n(d) projects the number of admissions that\nwill occur at the hospitals covered under the proposal. The commissioner shall also consider the way in which the\nproposed system would affect the availability of emergency psychiatric services\nin other service areas, and the ability of such areas to provide for sufficient\nbeds for emergency psychiatric admissions to meet the projected public\nneeds. (2)\n\nNo hospital without an onsite emergency\nroom shall be required to accept patients in need of emergency observation, care and treatment. No application for the renewal of an operating certificate\nfor psychiatric inpatient units of such hospitals shall be accepted until the\nhospital has agreed to accept referrals of involuntary psychiatric patients\nunder an emergency admission system which has been approved by the\ncommissioner, except the commissioner may waive this requirement for a period\nof two years pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nNothing in this Part shall prevent the\ncommissioner from requiring a hospital to admit patients under section\n9.39\nof the\n\nMental Hygiene Law on an emergency basis if the health or welfare of the public\nso requires. The commissioner shall specify in writing the nature and reasons\nfor such determination. (4)\n\nPrior\nto granting a waiver to a hospital, the commissioner shall consider the\ncomments of the director of the local governmental unit of the specific\nsubregional service area. The commissioner shall forward a copy of the waiver\nrequest to the director of the local governmental unit, who shall have 30 days\nwithin which to respond. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
