  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 179-1.2 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Disciplinary\naction is an essential element in treatment. Residents of OCFS secure centers\nare expected to follow rules of conduct that have been designed to support the\nhabilitation process. Disciplinary action, when applied reasonably and with\nfairness, promotes the security and protects the health and safety of all\npersons within an OCFS facility. It is also a positive factor in the morale of\nresidents and staff in the facility. (b) Limits of disciplinary action. Disciplinary action shall be taken only in such measures and degree as\nnecessary to: (1)\nmaintain residents' behavior\nwithin acceptable limits; (2)\nachieve compliance by the entire resident population with required standards of\nbehavior; and\n(3)\nreinforce to the\nresident population and facility staff, the OCFS commitment to maintain\nrequired standards of behavior. (c) Disciplinary action must be fair and\nconsistent. Disciplinary action must be administered in a fair, impartial and\nexpeditious manner and must be consistent. (1)\n\nDisciplinary measures shall not be overly\nsevere. A sound disciplinary program relies upon certainty and promptness of\naction rather than upon severity. (2)\n\nDisciplinary action must never be\narbitrary or capricious or administered for the purpose of retaliation or\nrevenge. Corporal punishment is absolutely forbidden for any purpose and under\nall circumstances. (d) Criminal activity. Commission of any Penal Law offense is prohibited and may be\nreferred to law enforcement agencies for prosecution through the courts in\naddition to sanctions imposed through resident discipline. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n179-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
