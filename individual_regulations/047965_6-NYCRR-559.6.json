  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 559.6 - Drilling practices\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section applies to a \"Bass Island\"\nwell and to a well described in section\n559.1\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (b) (1)\n\nThe operator of a well described in\nsubdivision (a) of this section must make every effort to accomplish\npenetration of the target interval during daylight hours, and must notify the\ndepartment's regional permitting office administering to the county in which\nthe well is located of its intention to penetrate that interval at least eight\nhours before that interval is reached. A rig that has been certified by the\ndriling contractor as having an approved vapor-proof lighting system and air\nshut-off on the rig engines is exempt from the daylight hour\nrequirement. (2)\n\nThat operator must\nnotify the local fire department of that well's location and the potential\nhazards involved before penetrating the target interval, unless the operator\nhas adequate firefighting equipment and personnel on a standby basis approved\nin writing by the department. (c) (1)\n\nThe\noperator of a well described in subdivision (a) of this section must construct\nand have ready for use before penetrating the target interval, a completely\nlined and sealed pit sized to fully contain all drilling fluids and any fluids\nresulting from natural precipitation. (2)\n\nThat operator must maintain all fluids\nonsite and properly dispose of them as soon as possible after completion of\ndrilling operations. The disposal must be undertaken only by a solid waste\nhauler having a permit issued under Part 364 of this Title. (d) (1)\n\nUnless the department's studies show some\nother requirements to be more appropriate in a particular area, the operator of\na well described in subdivision (a) of this section must set surface casing to\nthe greater depth of 450 feet from the surface or 100 feet into bedrock and\nmust cement that casing to the surface by circulating cement, using enough\nexcess cement to ensure cement returns. That operator must use centralizers and\nbaskets at appropriate intervals, and the surface casing must have a minimum\nbursting pressure of 1,800 pounds per square inch. That operator must notify\nthe department of the start of cementing operations at least four hours before\nthose operations start. If a State inspector is not present during cementing\noperations, that operator must attach a copy of the cement ticket to the well's\ncompletion report. (2)\n\nTo ensure\nadequate cementing results, that operator must add material to control lost\ncirculation to the cement used in cementing the conductor and surface casing\nstrings. If a lost circulation zone is encountered, the operator must try to\nseal off that zone with lost circulation materials before pumping the cement\nslurry. If cement circulation is not achieved, that operator must grout the\nwell from the surface using cement having materials to control lost\ncirculation, to ensure a complete cement bond. If cement grouting is\ninadequate, the department may require a cement bond log and additional\nremedial measures to ensure adequacy of the bond. (e) (1)\n\nThe\noperator of a well described in subdivision (a) of this section must install on\nthe surface casinghead blow-out prevention equipment of the pipe and blind ram\ntype or of the spherical annular type that must be actuated by an energy source\nother than rig hydraulics. The blow-out prevention equipment must be tested to\na minimum of 1,000 pounds per square inch before drilling out the surface\ncasing cement. That operator must notify the department at least eight hours\nbefore the testing of the equipment. If the department's inspector is not on\nlocation at the designated time, the test may proceed, with the witness' name\nand results of the test being noted on the driller's log. All blow-out\nprevention equipment control lines must be made of high pressure tubular steel\nwith flanged connections. A new air-head rubber must be installed in a rotating\nhead before penetrating the target interval. (2)\n\nThat operator must install a flanged\nchoke manifold assembly no closer than 25 feet from the wellhead. This assembly\nmust not contain any elbows or T's either at the wellhead or before the choke\nthat controls the flow through the kill lines. Each kill line must be connected\nwith welded flanges from the flange spool to the choke assembly. (3)\n\nThat operator must stake and chain all\npipes and lines and must remove any diverters from the flow lines before\npenetrating the interval between the Tully horizon and above the base of the\nlowest Salina Group Salt horizon. (4)\n\nOnce fluid has been put into the well to\nkill it, that operator must have pressure control devices (e.g., spherical\nannular blow-out preventers, lubricators, wipers, etc.) installed and ready for\nuse during logging operations. That operator also must have a blow-out\npreventer installed and ready for use while running production\ncasing. (5)\n\nThat operator must\nprovide the drilling company with a well prognosis, indicating formation tops\nand appropriate warning comments. That operator must ensure that this prognosis\nis clearly posted and maintained in the dog house. Drilling companies must post\nin the dog house individual crew member responsibilities for blow-out control. That operator, or his designee, must be on site before and during the\npenetration of the target interval. (f) The operator of a well described in this\nsection must provide supplementary connected mud pumping capability on site, either with a secondary mud pump or with a standby service company pump truck. At least 300 barrels of kill fluid must be on site and ready for use if\nrequired by well conditions. Additionally, appropriate amounts of bentonite, weight material, and material to control lost circulation must be on site to\naid in well control. (g) The\noperator of a well described in subdivision (a) of this section must construct\nthe flow line from the wellhead to the pit using T and C tubular goods with a\nworking pressure of 1,500 pounds per square inch and with flanged connections\nat the wellhead. (h) If oil is\nproduced during drilling operations of a well described in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, the operator of that well must store the oil on site in\ntanks. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n559.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
