Such operation certificate shall not\nbe altered, modified or Adopted except in accordance with Article 13 of the\n\nRacing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law and this Subchapter. (d) The continued effectiveness of each\noperation certificate shall be a prerequisite for the gaming facility to which\nsuch certificate applies to remain open to the public for the operation of\ngaming. (e) Each gaming facility\nlicensee to which an operation certificate is issued shall operate such\nlicensee's gaming facility strictly in accordance with the terms of such\nlicensee's original operation certificate and the approved gaming floor layout\nsubmitted in support thereof, and shall not change any of the items to which\nthe operation certificate applies, except in accordance with Article 13 of the\n\nRacing, Pari-Mutuel Wagering and Breeding Law and this Subchapter and after\nobtaining any required amendments to such operation certificate.

(f) Whenever a gaming facility licensee\nproposes a physical change to such licensee's gaming facility or to a\nrestricted area that requires commission approval in order for such licensee's\noriginal operation certificate, or any approved amendments to such operation\ncertificate, to continue in force and effect, such gaming facility licensee\nmust submit an application for Adopted operation certificate, the form of which\nthe commission shall provide to the applicant upon request.

(h) Upon receipt of the notice to proceed, the gaming facility licensee shall complete the changes outlined in the\napplication for Adopted operation certificate and notify the commission in\nwriting within five days of final completion of any proposed change. A gaming\nfloor layout that depicts the actual changes made shall accompany the notice of\nfinal completion and be filed with the commission.

Following such inspection, the commission\nshall notify the gaming facility licensee in writing as to which physical\nchange is approved and which is rejected, whereupon: (1)\nthe gaming facility licensee, in the\nevent any change is rejected, shall either: (i) correct any rejected change to conform\nwith the floor plan accompanying the notice of final completion and the\ndescription previously submitted to the commission, as modified by any properly\nfiled amendments thereto, which correction shall be completed and inspected\npursuant to this section; (ii)\nsubmit for approval, pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, a new\napplication for Adopted operation certificate; or\n(iii)\ntake such other action as the\ncommission may direct to ensure that the currently approved gaming floor layout\naccurately depicts the physical layout of the gaming facility, including any\nrestricted areas; and\n(2)\nthe operation certificate shall be\n\nAdopted to conform to each inspected and approved physical change.
