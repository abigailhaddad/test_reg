  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-1.2 - Types of investments\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Public Housing Law permits authorities to invest\nfunds held in reserves, or any funds not required for immediate disbursement in\nproperty or securities which are legal investments for savings banks. The law, however, imposes a further restriction on the investment of development funds\nof State-aided projects. Such development funds may be invested only in such\nsecurities as are approved by the State Comptroller. In most instances, the\n\nComptroller has limited development fund investments to U.S. government\nobligations maturing not more than one year from date of purchase. In some\ninstances, however, the Comptroller has permitted development funds to be\ninvested in 13-month obligations. The Law, in effect directs local agencies to\nplace safety and security of the principal above all other considerations. The\ninvestments (other than development fund investments), which may be made by a\nlocal agency, are therefore, limited to deposits in savings banks, savings and\nloan associations, certain types of bonds and similar obligations so that the\nincome element to be accounted for will, ordinarily, be in the form of\ninterest. Local agencies should consult with the division, and secure its\napproval prior to making investments. The division is prepared to make\nrecommendations of legal investments at all times. While the division will\ninsist on the prompt investment of all excess funds, its recommendations with\nrespect to specific investments are strictly advisory and not mandatory. For\nthe investment of development fund or administration fund balances in excess of\nimmediate needs and a reasonable allowance for working capital, the division\nrecommends short-term U.S. government securities, such as U.S. treasury bills, treasury notes and certificates of indebtedness. For the investment of\nreplacement reserve funds the division recommends long-term U.S. government\nsecurities, Federal National Mortgage Association Notes and deposits in savings\naccounts of savings banks insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation\nand savings and loan associations insured by the Federal Savings and Loan\n\nInsurance Corporation. For painting and decorating reserve funds or operating\nimprovement reserve funds, short term U.S. government securities and Federal\n\nHome Loan Bank Notes are recommended. For vacancy and collection loss reserves\nthe division recommends these funds be invested in three to five year U.S. government securities and Federal National Mortgage Association Notes. The\ndivision does not recommend the investment of security deposit funds. All\nsecurities recommended by the division will be normally selected with a view to\nobtaining the maximum yield over the period it is anticipated the security will\nbe held, inasmuch as there is ordinarily a direct relationship between the\nyield and both the maturity date of the security and the time it is held. The\ndate on which it is anticipated that the invested funds will be required is, therefore, an important factor in the selection of securities for investment. For example, the yield on a series \"K\" United States savings bond, redeemed\nafter one year from purchase date is only 1.16 per cent. The yield on the same\nbond, if held 12 years to maturity is 2.76 per cent. It is evident that series\n\"K\" bonds would be suitable for long term investments, such as replacement\nreserve funds, but not for investment, such as painting and decorating reserve\nfunds, which has a maximum turnover of three years. For the latter investment, a security having a shorter maturity, such as a treasury note or certificate of\nindebtedness, would give a higher yield over the anticipated holding period. In\nselecting securities for investment, the division also considers\ndiversification of the portfolio held by each local agency. This results in\ngreater flexibility when the need arises for the \"cashing in\" of securities to\nmeet current reserve fund needs. In compliance with New York State Banking\n\nDepartment regulations [see 3 NYCRR Banking], all reserve funds deposited in\nsavings banks and savings and loan associations must be of a long-term\ninvestment nature. To comply with this directive the division recommends\ndeposit of funds in these savings institutions only if it is anticipated that\nsuch funds will remain on deposit a minimum of five years.
