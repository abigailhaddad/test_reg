Such designation shall also state the locations where applications to inspect\nrecords may be submitted and where records shall be available for public\ninspection and copying. § 4. Procedure for obtaining records. Any person wishing to inspect and/or obtain a\ncopy of any record of the Executive Chamber, may make application to the\nrecords access officer. Such application shall be in writing and shall\nreasonably describe the record or records sought. The application may be\nsubmitted to the records access officer either personally at the designated\nlocation on any workday between the hours of 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m., or by\nmail addressed to the designated location. Upon receipt of such an application, in the proper form and at the appropriate time, the records access officer\nshall search for the record requested. Within five workdays of receipt of an\napplication, the records access officer shall provide or deny access to the\nrecord sought or furnish a written acknowledgment of receipt of the application\nand a statement of the approximate date when the request will be granted or\ndenied. If the records access officer determines that the record requested is\nnot in his custody, the records access officer shall advise the applicant, as\nthe case may be (i) that the record does not exist, (ii) that the record is in\nthe custody of another specified agency, or (iii) that the record cannot be\nfound after a diligent search. If the records access officer determines that\nthe record requested is in his custody, the records access officer shall either\n(i) produce the record for inspection at his office (and, if so requested and\nupon payment of the appropriate fee, shall make and certify a copy of the\nrecord), (ii) advise the applicant that the record is in his custody and make\narrangements for inspection and/or copying at a later time, or (iii) deny\naccess to the record as provided in section eight of this regulation.

On behalf of the Executive Chamber, the\nrecords access officer shall maintain and make available for inspection and\ncopying at his office a current list, reasonably detailed by subject matter, of\nthe types of records produced, filed or kept in the Executive Chamber. Such\nlist shall be in conformity with such regulations as may be promulgated by the\n\nCommittee on Open Government. Any person desiring a copy of such list may\nrequest a copy thereof personally or by mail and one shall be\nsupplied. § 6. Fees. The fee\nfor photocopies of records shall be 25 cents per page not exceeding nine inches\nby fourteen inches in size.

In the event that one or more\ndeletion is so made from any document, the records access officer shall provide\nwritten notice of that fact to the person given access to the record. If the\nrecord is such that the personal matters cannot be fully deleted without\nsubstantively affecting the record or the identifying details cannot be\neffectively deleted, the records access officer shall deny access to such\nrecord as provided in section eight of this regulation. § 8. Grant or denial of access to\nrecords. If the records access officer determines that an application to\ninspect and/or copy records pertains to information required to be disclosed\nunder section\neighty seven\nof the Public Officers Law and not exempt from disclosure as an unwarranted\ninvasion of personal privacy or otherwise, he shall grant the application. If\nthe records access officer determines that an application to inspect and/or\ncopy records pertains to information exempted from disclosure by section\neighty seven\nof the Public Officers Law or under section seven of this regulation pursuant\nto subdivision two of section eighty-nine of such law, he shall deny such\napplication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the records access officer may\nwaive any exemption from disclosure provided by section\neighty seven\nof the Public Officers Law, if he shall determine that disclosure (i) is in the\npublic interest, and (ii) is authorized by law. In denying any application to\ninspect and/or copy records, the records access officer shall indicate his\nreasons for such denial and shall advise the applicant of his right to appeal\nsuch denial to the counsel within 30 days. § 9.
