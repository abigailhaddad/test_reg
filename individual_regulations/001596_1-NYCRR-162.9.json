New York State Seal of Quality cauliflower shall be heads of\ncauliflower which meet the following requirements. Basic requirements for curds\nare: clean, compact, color--white, size--not less than six inches in diameter. Heads are required to be fairly uniform in size--which means that variation of\ncurd size in individual containers does not exceed two inches in diameter. Basic requirements for jacket leaves: fresh, closely trimmed, fairly clean. Free from: soft or wet decay. Free from damage caused by: bruising, cuts, discoloration, enlarged bracts, fuzziness, hollow stem, insects, mold, riciness, wilting and other means. Free from serious damage by any\ncause. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nDamage means any specific defects as\noutlined in the United States Standards for grades of cauliflower with the\nfollowing exception: (i) Discoloration means\nwhen yellow or other abnormal color materially detracts from the appearance of\nthe curd, or slightly detracts from the appearance of the jacket leaves (in the\ncase of closely trimmed cauliflower). (c) Tolerances. In order to allow for\nvariations incident to proper grading and handling in each of the foregoing\ngrades, the following tolerances, by count, are provided as specified: (1)\n\nFor defects. Ten percent for heads of\ncauliflower in any lot which fail to meet the requirements of the grade, but\nnot more than one-half of this tolerance or five percent shall be allowed for\ndefects causing serious damage, including in this latter amount not more than\none percent for soft or wet decay affecting the curd or butt. (2)\n\nFor off-size. Five percent for heads of\ncauliflower smaller than the specified minimum curd size and five percent for\nheads of cauliflower larger than the two inch size variation. (d) Application of tolerances. The\ncontents of individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are\nsubject to the following limitations: (1)\nA\npackage may contain not more than double any specified tolerance except that at\nleast two defective and two off-size specimens may be permitted in any package: provided, that not more than one specimen which is affected by soft or wet\ndecay occurring on the curd or butt portion of the head may be permitted in any\npackage: and provided further, that the averages for the lot are within the\ntolerances specified for the grade. (2)\n\nIn order to allow for variations in\nregard to proper packing, not more than 10 percent (by count) of the containers\nin any lot may fail to meet the requirements for fairly uniform size. (e) Packing. Cauliflower must be\npacked in new standard crates or cartons or other new standard packages which\nare subject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. Package\napproval shall be based upon the ability of the package to maintain the quality\nstandards and integrity of the product. (f) Markings.
