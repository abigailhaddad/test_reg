  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 365-1.2 - Management of RMW by the generator\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Waste management plan. (1)\nA generator of RMW\nis responsible for properly identifying and segregating the waste and must\ndevelop, document and implement policies and procedures specific to the\nmanagement of RMW generated on-site, and for labeling RMW based on the planned\nmethod of treatment (e.g., autoclave, incineration, etc.) off-site. The\npolicies and procedures must include, but are not limited to: (i) a description of the types, and method(s)\nfor treatment or disposal of RMW generated on-site; (ii)\nthe procedures, including the employee\ntraining, for safe handling and transport of the RMW within the facility from\nthe point of generation or acceptance to the point of storage and/or\ntreatment; (iii)\na description of\nshort and long term storage areas including, as applicable, patient care areas, laboratories, production and testing rooms, etc. which details the location, ventilation and capacity of each storage area, and the length of time waste is\nto be retained in each area; (iv)\nthe titles and contact information for persons responsible for monitoring\ncompliance with the waste management plan; (v) for facilities that treat RMW on-site, an\noperation plan for each treatment system employed; and\n(vi)\na contingency plan that addresses\nemergencies, spills, and other unexpected events. (b) Containment and storage. (1)\nRMW must be separated from other waste as\nsoon as practicable at the point of generation prior to storage, treatment or\ndisposal. (2)\n\nContainers holding\nRMW that cannot be treated by an autoclave or other approved treatment\ntechnology must be labeled accordingly. The label must identify waste types and\nacceptable treatment method (e.g., incinerate only, etc.). (3)\nRMW that contains radioactive isotopes\nmust be stored until decayed to a background radiation level prior to transport\noff-site, unless returned to the dispensing radiopharmacy or managed as a\nprohibited radioactive material. (4)\nRMW must be contained in a primary\ncontainer, defined in paragraph 365-1.2(b)(13) of this section. (5)\nA sharps container must not be filled\nbeyond the fill line indicated on the container. (6)\n\nFluids contained in leak-proof containers\nmust be placed in a primary container, oriented in an upright position and\nsecured to prevent leakage, and then placed in a secondary container, defined\nin paragraph 365-1.2(b)(12) of this section, prior to off-site\ntransport. (7)\n\nSharps containers\nmust be removed from patient care or use areas to a room or area designated for\nRMW storage when: the container has reached the fill line indicated on the\ncontainer, is otherwise filled, or generates odors or other evidence of\nputrefaction, whichever occurs first. (8)\n\nOther RMW containers, at a laboratory or\nother generation area must be moved to an RMW storage area when the container\nhas reached the fill line indicated on the container, is otherwise filled, or\ngenerates odors or other evidence of putrefaction, whichever occurs\nfirst. (9)\n\nAn RMW storage area must\nbe adequately sized for the volume of RMW generated between scheduled waste\npick-ups by a transporter, or, for facilities treating the waste on-site, the\nvolume of waste that can be treated on-site within a 24-hour period. (10)\n\nAn RMW storage area must: (i) display prominent signage indicating the\nareas is used to store RMW; (ii)\nbe\ndesigned or equipped to prevent unauthorized access; (iii)\nbe designed or located to protect waste\nfrom the elements, and prevent access by vermin; (iv)\nhold the waste at a temperature that\nprevents rapid decomposition and resultant odor generation; (v) be appropriately ventilated; and\n(vi)\nbe of sufficient size to\nallow clear separation of RMW from any other waste, if waste other than RMW is\nstored in the same area. (11)\nRMW must not be stored in a storage area\nfor a period exceeding 30 days, except for a generator of less than 50 pounds\nof RMW per month that does not accept RMW for treatment from other facilities\nmay store RMW until the container has reached the fill line on the container, is otherwise filled, or generates odors or other evidence of putrefaction, whichever occurs first. For bulk packaging, storage must be in accordance with\nsubparagraphs (14)(vi) and (vii) of this subdivision. For radiological RMW, the\nRMW may be stored for a period of time necessary to allow decay to a background\nradiation level, or if long lived must be managed as a prohibited radioactive\nmaterial (including waste disposal). (12)\n\nPrior to transport of RMW off-site for\ntreatment, the: (i) primary containers, except sharps containers, must be placed in a secondary container and marked\nprominently with the universal biohazard symbol or the word Biohazard, and, if\napplicable, must be affixed with a label indicating that the contents require\nspecial handling (e.g., incinerate only, etc.); and\n(ii)\nprimary containers must be labeled with\nthe name and address of the generating facility when placed in a secondary\ncontainer that is a bulk container used by multiple generators. (13)\n\nRequirements for primary\ncontainers. (i) Primary containers, with the\nexception of sharps containers, must be a plastic bag that complies with the\nstandards prescribed by 49\nCFR\n173.196, 173.197\nand\n173.199, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n360.3\nof this Title, and is\ncertified by the bag manufacturer to meet federal requirements. (ii)\n\nThe primary container for discarded\nsharps must be rigid, leak-proof on the sides and bottom, puncture-resistant\nand closable, and may serve as a secondary container for purposes of transport, provided it meets the definition of a secondary container. (iii)\n\nPrimary containers must not be filled\nin a manner that results in the breakage of the container. (iv)\n\nPrimary containers in laboratory and\nclinical settings must be kept in secure locations (e.g., access restricted\nrooms) when in use and must be properly closed when moved to other locations. In other settings, primary containers must be properly closed at all times when\nnot being filled. (v) Only primary\ncontainers that have been approved for reuse by the United States Food and Drug\n\nAdministration (FDA) may be reused. (vi)\n\nPrior to transport off-site, RMW must be\nplaced in commercially manufactured disposable (e.g., fiberboard boxes that\nmeet USDOT HMR specifications) or reusable secondary containers. (14)\n\nRequirements for secondary\ncontainers. (i) Secondary containers must\ncomply with the standards prescribed by the USDOT found at\n49 CFR\n173.134, 173.196, 173.197, and\n173.199\nas incorporated by\nreference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. Reusable\nsecondary containers can include wheeled carts or roll-off bulk\ncontainers. (ii)\n\nReusable secondary\ncontainers must be inspected prior to return to use to verify that the\ncontainers are not defective (i.e., have no cracks or other defects, that the\nlid closes and, if available, the locking mechanism works) and are cleaned and\ndisinfected. Reusable containers must be immediately cleaned and disinfected\nupon emptying if the liner is compromised, visual inspection yields evidence\nthat the container's surface has come in contact with RMW prior to treatment, the contained waste includes cultures and/or stocks, or the contained waste has\na highly infectious bioload. (iii)\n\nWheeled carts or bulk packaging used as secondary containers to contain RMW\nmust be used exclusively to transport RMW. (iv)\n\nBulk packaging may not be used for the\ndisposal of liquid blood or blood products, sharps, pathological waste, or\ncontaminated animal carcasses or body parts, unless the waste is properly\ncontained in rigid primary containers with enough absorbent material to absorb\nall liquid present and separated from other regulated medical waste by a\nleak-proof rigid barrier, divider or separate compartment. (v) All wheeled carts and bulk outer packages\nused as secondary containers must be kept in a sanitary condition, disinfected\nbefore reuse, and must not be allowed to become putrescent. (vi)\n\nBulk packages that are roll-off\ncontainers (except those used for pathological waste, blood or blood products, or animal waste) that will be sent off-site may only be stored at the site of\ngeneration until the container is filled, or for 21 days if ambient\ntemperatures are below 45 degrees Fahrenheit (7 degrees Centigrade) or for 14\ndays if above 45 degrees, whichever comes first, except that bulk packages that\nare putrescent must be immediately sent to the receiving facility. (vii)\n\nBulk packages that are roll-off\ncontainers used for pathological waste, blood or blood products, or animal\nwaste that will be sent off-site may only be stored at the site of generation\nuntil the container is filled, or for seven days, whichever comes first. Bulk\npackages that are putrescent must be immediately sent to the receiving\nfacility. (viii)\n\nBulk outer\npackaging may not be used for the transport of cultures and stocks containing\nselect agents or toxins of biological origin listed in\n9 CFR\nPart 121 and\n42\nCFR\nPart 73 as incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. (ix)\n\nAll internal surfaces of a reusable\nsecondary container, except for reusable sharps containers, must be completely\nprotected by a disposable liner, which may also function as the primary\ncontainer provided it meets the criteria for a primary container, or the\nsecondary container serves as both a primary and secondary container. The liner\nmust be removed as a secured unit with the contained RMW and treated as\nRMW. (15)\n\nDisposable\nsingle-use secondary containers, broken reusable containers or containers no\nlonger in service must be treated as RMW unless decontaminated for\nrecycling. (16)\nRMW cannot be\ntransferred from one container to another in a manner that compromises health\nand safety of the persons handling the RMW. RMW being moved from one container\nto another, or one location to another within a facility must, at a minimum, be\nsecured in a primary container. (17)\n\nSharps or other secondary containers\nmust not be opened for consolidation or other purposes unless the container is\nroutinely reopened to add waste or the procedure has been approved as required\nby Subpart 365-2 of this Part. (18)\n\nMovement of RMW within a facility from the point of generation to the point of\nstorage or treatment must be by covered cart or other appropriately covered\nconveyance system marked prominently with labeling indicating that the contents\nare infectious or are RMW; provided, however, waste held in containers meeting\nthe definition of secondary container may be transported within a facility from\npoint of generation to the point of storage or treatment using an open\nconveyance system (e.g., laboratory cart, dolly, etc.) provided each container\nis labeled and appropriately closed. RMW must not be moved within a facility by\ngravity alone without control of impact (e.g., trash chutes, slides, etc.). (19)\nRMW must not be\ncompacted or compressed unless it has undergone treatment in accordance with\n\nSubpart 365-2 of this Part. (c) Transfer of RMW for off-site treatment\n(1)\n\nGenerators of RMW must transfer the waste\nfor off-site treatment only to a transporter authorized to transport RMW under\n\nPart 364 of this Title. (2)\n\nRadiological RMW must be returned to the dispensing radiopharmacy, stored at\nthe generator's location until the RMW has decayed to a background radiation\nlevel, or if long lived must be managed as a prohibited radioactive material\n(including waste disposal). (3)\nA\nhard copy of a medical waste tracking form must accompany each load of RMW\nleaving the generator. The instructions on the tracking form must be\nfollowed. (4)\n\nAll municipal solid\nwaste transported in a load containing RMW must also be treated as RMW, unless\nthe RMW is separately contained in a secondary container or is otherwise kept\nseparate from the MSW by leak-proof barriers. (5)\n\nAny pharmaceutical waste that is unable\nto be separated at the site of generation must include a label that reads\n\"Incinerate Only\" on the secondary container and must be disposed at a RMW or\nmunicipal waste combustor that is permitted to accept non-hazardous\npharmaceutical waste, or at another approved facility. Most non-hazardous\npharmaceutical waste may not be disposed in sanitary sewers, septic systems or\nwastewater treatment systems. The following are the only types of\npharmaceutical waste that may be disposed in sanitary sewers, septic systems or\nwastewater treatment systems: saline solution; lactate; nutrients such as\nglucose, vitamins, potassium or other salts; and electrolytes. (6)\n\nSecondary containers, except for\nnon-hazardous pharmaceuticals, must be labeled in accordance with the\ndefinitions and applicable classification criteria (e.g., RMW, Infectious\n\nSubstances or Used Healthcare Products) required by\n49 CFR\n173.134, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n360.3\nof this Title. Each label\nmust be printed on or affixed to a surface (other than the bottom) of the\ncontainer and be located on the same surface of the container near the proper\nshipping name marking. Each label, whether printed on or affixed to a\ncontainer, must be durable and weather resistant. (7)\n\nIf an infectious substance, secondary\ncontainers, except sharps containers, must be affixed with an \"INFECTIOUS\nSUBSTANCE\" label or marked with the fluorescent orange Universal \"BIOHAZARD\"\nsymbol meeting the specification under\n29 CFR\n1910.1030(g)(1)(i)\nin\naccordance with 49 CFR\n173.134, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n360.3\nof this Title, date of\ntransport, and if applicable, that the contents (if containing pharmaceutical, chemical or pathological waste) require incineration. An \"INFECTIOUS SUBSTANCE\"\nlabel is not required on a non-bulk secondary container with a \"BIOHAZARD\"\nmarking. (d) Processing\nof RMW on-site. (1)\n\nUnless otherwise exempt\nor required to obtain a permit under Subpart 365-2 of this Part, facilities\n(i.e. generators) described in this paragraph are subject to the registration\nprovision of section\n360.15\nof this title. Each facility\nidentified in this paragraph must obtain a registration from the Department but\nis not required to comply with section\n360.19\nof this Title: (i) a facility that decontaminates or treats\nless than 500 pounds of RMW (including waste from a laboratory or other\ngeneration area operating at biosafety level 2 (BSL-2) per month of its own\nwaste with autoclaves, a NYSDOH approved alternative treatment system; or with\nany Department-approved method of treatment of infectious waste regardless of\nhow the waste is disposed; and, (ii)\na facility that decontaminates, inactivates or treats its own waste generated from a biosafety level 3 (BSL-3)\nor an animal biosafety level 3 (ABSL-3) laboratory or other generation area, subject to the following: (a) Decontamination\nand treatment is performed with autoclaves, a NYSDOH-approved alternative\ntreatment system, or with any Department-approved method of inactivation of\ninfectious waste, (b) The facility\nhas a current registration number with the Federal Select Agent Program (FSAP)\nauthorizing the facility to possess and work with select agents or toxins of\nbiological origin listed in 7 CFR Part\n331, 9 CFR Part\n121\nor 42 CFR Part\n73\nas\nincorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title, and\n(c) BSL-3 and ABSL-3 wastes generated at\nthese facilities must be decontaminated, inactivated or treated on-site and\nmust be disposed of as RMW at a permitted RMW treatment\nfacility. (2)\n\nThe facility registered pursuant to subparagraph 365-1.2(d)(1)(ii) may include\nanother BSL-3 or ABSL-3 laboratory or other generation area at the same\ninstitution as the FSAP-registered area which utilizes the biosafety protocols\napproved as part of the FSAP registration and is overseen by the same\ninstitutional biosafety committee and environmental health and safety office, provided decontamination, inactivation or treatment of RMW complies with the\n\nDepartment's registration.
