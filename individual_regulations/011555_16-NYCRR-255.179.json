  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.179 - Valves on pipelines to operate at 125 psig (862 kpa) or more\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each pipeline\nto operate at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more must have sectionalizing block valves\nspaced according to the following: (1)\n\nEach\npoint on the pipeline in a Class 4 location must be within 1/2 mile (0.805\nkilometer) of a valve. (2)\n\nEach\npoint on the pipeline in a Class 3 location must be within two miles (3.22\nkilometers) of a valve. (3)\n\nEach\npoint on the pipeline in a Class 2 location must be within 31/2 miles (5.63\nkilometers) of a valve. (4)\n\nEach\npoint on the pipeline in a Class 1 location must be within five miles (8.05\nkilometers) of a valve. (b) Each sectionalizing block valve and\noperating device on a pipeline to operate at 125 psig (86.2 kPa) or more must: (1)\nbe readily accessible and protected from\ntampering and damage; and\n(2)\nbe\nsupported to prevent settling of the valve or movement of the pipe to which it\nis attached. (c) Each\nsection of a pipeline to operate at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more must have a\nblow-down valve with enough capacity to allow the line to be blown down as\nrapidly as practicable or other approved means to reduce the\npressure. (d) Each blow-down\ndischarge must be located so the gas can be blown to the atmosphere without\nhazard and, if the line is adjacent to an overhead electric line, so that the\ngas is directed away from the electrical conductors. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.179\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
