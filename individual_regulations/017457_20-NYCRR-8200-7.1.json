  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8200-7.1 - Annual charge to railroad companies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each year a charge shall be computed for\neach railroad company receiving a tentative railroad ceiling. (b) The charge shall be computed as follows: (1)\nORPTS shall establish a dollar amount for\nthe direct and indirect costs and expenses for computing and establishing\nrailroad ceilings. In establishing this amount, ORPTS shall include the costs\nof obtaining valuation information, processing that information, calculating\nvalues, establishing ceilings and complying with all statutory and regulatory\nnotice and hearing requirements for establishing those ceilings. ORPTS shall\nnot include the cost of any contractual expenses incurred in defense of any\nrailroad ceilings; (2)\nthe value of\nrailroad real property used for transportation purposes used to establish the\nfinal railroad ceilings for the previous year for all railroad companies shall\nbe divided into the dollar amount determined in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. This shall be the charge rate; (3)\nthe charge rate shall be multiplied by\nthe value of real property used for transportation purposes which was used to\ncompute the final railroad ceiling for a railroad company for the previous\nyear. In the first year a railroad company receives a railroad ceiling, the\ncharge rate shall be multiplied by the value of real property used for\ntransportation purposes which was used to compute the tentative railroad\nceiling for that company; and\n(4)\nwhere a charge of less than $25 is computed, no charge shall be imposed. Annual\ncharges unpaid more than 60 days after the billing date shall be considered\npast due. (c) Charges\nshall be computed and billed annually on or about July 1st, or within 45 days\nof the adoption of the State operations budget, whichever is later. If the\ntotal amount computed and billed is more than the amount previously estimated\nand sent to a railroad company in the preceding calendar year after submission\nof the budget request pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section, the bill\nshould be accompanied by a detailed explanation of the difference. (d) All revenue collected pursuant to this\n\nSubpart shall be deposited in the industrial and utility service account of the\nspecial revenue fund. (e) In no\nevent may the amount computed and billed for the Railroad Ceiling Program\nexceed the funds appropriated for this program in the State operations budget. The amount computed shall be reduced prior to billing by the amount of any\nfunds remaining unexpended in the industrial and utility service account of the\nspecial revenue fund that are identifiable to the Railroad Ceiling\n\nProgram. (f) No later than 30 days\nprior to the submission of the next fiscal year's budget request, ORPTS shall\nnotify railroad companies of prospective program changes, if any, and the\npreliminary estimated cost for administration of the Railroad Ceiling Program\nfor the next fiscal year. Railroad companies may submit comments regarding\nthese changes and costs up to 15 days after issuance of the notice. These\ncomments shall be considered by ORPTS in finalizing the budget request. After\nsubmission of the budget request, ORPTS shall notify railroad companies of the\nfinal estimated cost for administration of the program for the next fiscal\nyear. (g) Within 10 days of receipt\nof the notice of any prospective program changes and the preliminary estimated\ncost of administration of the program for the next fiscal year, any railroad\ncompany may request that a meeting be scheduled for railroad companies to\ndiscuss these proposed program changes and preliminary estimated costs with\nORPTS. Upon receipt of any such request, ORPTS shall schedule such a meeting\nand shall provide all railroad companies with notice of the time and place that\nsuch meeting will be held. (h) At\nthe same time that ORPTS notifies railroad companies of prospective program\nchanges for the next fiscal year, an accounting of the costs of administering\nthe Railroad Ceiling Program for the preceding fiscal year shall be available\nupon request. (i) (1)\n\nCosts and expenses incurred in the\nestablishment of railroad ceilings which shall be paid from the collection of\nthe annual charge shall include direct personal services, nonpersonal services, and indirect costs. (2)\n\nDirect\npersonal services shall be calculated in the following manner. ORPTS shall\nidentify those job titles that directly perform tasks required by the Railroad\n\nCeiling Program and shall enumerate the percent of time each particular job\ntitle is expected to spend on the program. (3)\n\nNonpersonal services include travel, supplies, equipment, contractual obligations, and mandated fringe benefit\ncharges as published annually by the Office of the State Comptroller and\nexpressed as a percentage of estimated personal service costs. (4)\n\nIndirect costs, or overhead, include\nspace rental, heat, utilities, security, computing and data processing costs, training and staff development costs, and the cost of executive direction and\nadministration. (5)\n\nIn computing\nindirect costs, the amount of time individual employees spend in the\nestablishment of railroad ceilings, as enumerated pursuant to paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, shall be expressed as full-time employee equivalents. This\nnumber shall be divided by the number of full-time employee equivalents of\nORPTS whose official station is the Albany office of ORPTS on the first day of\nthe fiscal year for which the annual charge is determined. This percentage\nshall be computed to the third decimal place. The resulting percentage shall be\napplied to total costs for Albany space, heat, utilities, security, computing\nand data processing, and training and staff development to determine indirect\ncosts other than the cost of executive direction and administration. (6)\n\nThe cost of executive direction and\nadministration required for the establishment of railroad ceilings, which\nincludes the costs of legal services, fiscal and administrative services, human\nresource management and development, and the deputy commissioner's office, shall be determined by dividing the total personal services appropriation of\nORPTS for the fiscal year for which the annual charge is being computed into\nthe salary equivalents of the sum of those individuals responsible for\nproviding these services. The resulting percentage, computed to the third\ndecimal place, shall be applied to the amount determined for the cost of direct\npersonal services pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision to determine\nthe indirect cost of executive direction and administration. (j) In computing the annual charge\nrate or the annual charge for any railroad company pursuant to this section, the value of railroad real property shall be determined without any adjustment\nfor any economic factor established pursuant to title 2-A of article 4 of the\n\nReal Property Tax Law.
