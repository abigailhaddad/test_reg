  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 151.19 - Locks\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Passage. (1)\n\nWhen approaching a lock, operators must\nstop at a safe distance and follow specified signals provided by the lock\noperator. Operators of floats intending to enter a lock can contact the lock\noperator via marine band radio channel 13, or by three distinct blasts or\nsoundings of a horn, whistle, or other signaling device. Lock operators will\nreply with navigation lights. Green indicates that the lock is ready and the\nfloat may advance. Red indicates that the float must wait. (2)\nA float approaching a lock which is not\nready to receive it shall come to a full stop at a safe distance from the lock\nand await the signal of the lock operator to approach. If the lock is ready to\nreceive the float, the float shall slow down at a proper distance from the lock\nto avoid damaging the lock structure or equipment. (3)\n\nIf no light is shown, the float shall\nstop, stay in place or tie up immediately to the approach wall, and await\nfurther instructions from the lock operator. (4)\nA float which arrives at a lock and does\nnot employ the first opportunity of passing through same, shall lose its\npreference if there is any other float ready to pass through the\nlock. (5)\n\nNo owner or operator of a\nfloat shall unnecessarily or unreasonably delay, hinder or detain its entry\ninto, passage through, or exit from a lock or the passage through a lock of any\nother float awaiting locking. The lock operator may order any float engaging in\nsuch delay removed from the lock and the owner thereof shall pay all expenses\ninvolved in such towing or removal. (6)\n\nFenders shall be used as required to\nprevent damage to the lock structure. Floats leaving the lock shall navigate at\na reduced speed until the stern of such float has reached a point of at least\n150 feet beyond the lock chamber. (7)\n\nEvery float operator shall comply\nstrictly with directions or orders of the lock operator as to management of the\nfloat while awaiting locking, during locking or on entering or leaving a\nlock. (8)\n(i) At Lockport operators of double-locking\ntows: eastbound, are required to have the power unit remain on the upper level\nuntil the first locking is complete; when westbound, the power unit shall enter\nthe lock with the first locking of its double-locking tow, so as to provide\npower on the upper level for the floats comprising the first locking. (ii)\n\nAt the Waterford flight of locks\ndouble-locking tows are not allowed in either direction without special\npermission of the Canal Corporation or its representative. (9)\n(i) No\noperator of a float shall allow the float to leave an approach wall, enter a\nlock, or leave a lock until the lock gates are fully open, and no red light is\nshown by the traffic control device on the lock, or operator of a float is\ndirected by a lock operator to proceed. (ii)\n\nEvery operator of a float waiting to\nenter a lock shall give way to floats leaving the lock. (iii)\n\nNo operator of a float shall allow the\nfloat to pass through a lock unless the float is equipped with good and\nsufficient mooring lines and securely attached fenders; the float and any goods\nor equipment on the float are in a condition that permits passage through the\nlock in a safe and controlled manner; and the float is of a dimension, configuration or draft that permits safe passage. (10)\n\nNo person shall, while on a float that\nis passing through a lock of the canal, smoke or have or maintain an open\nflame, including a pilot light. (11)\n\nThe lock operator may require the\nremoval of persons or perishable property from canoes, rowboats or personal\nwatercraft during locking. The lock operator may prohibit the passage of such\nfloat through the lock if, in the discretion of the lock operator, such passage\nwould create a hazardous condition or obstruction to navigation. (b) Floats under control. To\nprevent any damage to the lock structure or its equipment, floats shall, at all\ntimes, enter each lock squarely and under proper control at a speed that is\nconsistent with navigation safety under the weather and water conditions\nprevailing in the vicinity of the lock at that time. Float personnel shall\nexecute all specified and required navigation and safety measures to bring the\nfloat safely into the lock and to insure a full stop in the lock chamber\nwithout touching, hitting or damaging lock gates or any other vulnerable part\nof the lock structure or equipment. Lines shall be put out from the float to\nslow its final drift speed, bring it to a stop and hold it safely in the lock\nduring locking operation. (c) Penalties. Any operator of a float violating this section shall be subject to a\npenalty not to exceed $100 for each offense and the lock operator may refuse\nthe float passage violation through the lock for a period of not more than six\nhours.
