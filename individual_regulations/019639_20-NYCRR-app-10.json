A. General rule\n1. Determine the factor that will convert the payroll in\nquestion to a more common payroll period for which tables are available (i.e., quarterly is 3 times the monthly, 28-day is 2 times the biweekly, etc.). 2. Using this factor, convert the payroll to the equivalent for\nthe more common period (quarterly ÷ 3 = monthly, etc.). 3. Apply the table or method for the more common period to the\nderived equivalent wages, and get the amount to be withheld for the more common\nperiod. 4. Convert the amount that would be withheld for the more\ncommon period by the factor found in Step 1 above. This is the amount to be\nwithheld for the payroll period in question. B. Using the Monthly table for Quarterly\npayrolls\n1. Quarterly (3 months) ÷ monthly (1 month) = factor of 3. 2. Divide the quarterly wages by 3 to get a monthly\nequivalent. 3. Refer to the monthly withholding table, using the monthly\nequivalent wages, and get the amount that would be withheld monthly, under the\nappropriate exemption column. 4. Multiply the monthly withholding amount by 3 to get the\nquarterly equivalent. This is the amount to be withheld. Example: New York State - Personal Income\n\nTax\n\nQuarterly wages of $6,750, married with 2 exemptions: (1) Factor = 3\n(2) $6,750 ÷ 3 = $2,250\n(4) $65.90 x 3 = $197.70\nC. Using the Monthly table for 10-day\npayroll\n1. The monthly is 3 times the 10-day payroll. 2. Multiply the 10-day payroll by 3 to get a monthly\nequivalent. 3. Refer to the monthly table, using monthly equivalent wages\nand get the amount that would be withheld monthly, under the appropriate\nexemption column. 4. Divide the monthly amount to be withheld by 3 to get the\n10-day equivalent of the amount to be withheld. D. Salaries paid on a 10-month basis: Converting salaries\nto a 12-month basis in order to use the Monthly table (or Semimonthly, etc.)\n1. Divide the annual wages by 12 to arrive at the equivalent\nmonthly wages (if payments are made semimonthly instead of monthly, divide by\n24). 2. Refer to the monthly table, using the derived equivalent\nmonthly wages from Step 1 above, and obtain the amount that would be withheld\nmonthly 12 times per year, under the appropriate exemption column. (If payments\nare made semimonthly, use that table.)\n3. Multiply the amount that would be withheld 12 (or 24) times\na year found in Step 2 above by 1.2 (12/10 or 6/5), to allow for the fact that\nwithholding will occur in only 10 of the 12 months. This is the amount to be\nwithheld from each of the 10 monthly payments or, if payments are semimonthly, from each of the 20 semimonthly payments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
