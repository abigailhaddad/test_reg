  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.27 - Eligible food purchased with food stamps\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(k)\n(a) Definitions. (1)\n\nFood stamps. The term\nfood stamps\nwhen used in this\nsection means coupons issued under or pursuant to the Federal Food Stamp Act of\n1977 (7 U.S.C. §\n2011\net seq. ), as\namended. (2)\n\nRetail food\nstores and other participants. The term\nretail food stores and other\nparticipants\nmeans entities authorized to accept food stamps, including: (i) an establishment (such\nas a supermarket or grocery store), a recognized department of an establishment\nor a house-to-house trade route, whose eligible food sales volume is more than\n50 percent of staple food items intended for home preparation and consumption, such as meat, poultry, fish, bread and breadstuffs, cereals, vegetables, fruits, fruit and vegetable juices, and dairy products; (ii)\npublic or private communal dining\nfacilities and meal delivery services; (iii)\nprivate nonprofit drug addiction or\nalcoholic treatment and rehabilitation programs; (iv)\npublicly operated community mental\nhealth centers that conduct residential programs for drug addicts and/or\nalcoholics; (v) private or public\nnonprofit group living arrangements; (vi)\npublic or private nonprofit shelters for\nbattered women and children; (vii)\nprivate nonprofit cooperative food purchasing ventures, including those whose\nmembers pay for food prior to receipt of the food; (viii)\nwholesale food concerns which sell\neligible foods to retail food stores or to meal services for resale to\nhouseholds; (ix)\nfarmers' markets; and\n(x) restaurants authorized by\nthe United States Department of Agriculture to accept food stamps for meals\npurchased by the elderly and supplemental security income benefit (SSI)\nrecipients and spouses of those elderly and SSI recipients. (3)\n\nEligible foods. The term\neligible foods\nmeans food and\nnonfood items and meals, eligible to be purchased with food stamps, including: (i) any food or food product\nintended for human consumption, except alcoholic beverages, tobacco products, and hot foods and hot food products prepared for immediate consumption (other\nthan meals described in this paragraph); (ii)\nfruit and vegetable seeds and plants to\ngrow food for the personal consumption of eligible households; (iii)\nmeals prepared and delivered by an\nauthorized meal delivery service to households eligible to use food stamps to\npurchase delivered meals; (iv)\nmeals served by an authorized communal dining facility for the elderly, SSI\nhouseholds or both to households eligible to use food stamps for communal\ndining; (v) meals prepared and\nserved by a drug addiction or alcoholic treatment and rehabilitation center to\neligible households; (vi)\nmeals\nprepared and served by a group-living-arrangement facility to residents who are\nblind or disabled recipients of benefits under Title II or Title XVI of the\n\nSocial Security Act; (vii)\nmeals\nprepared and served by a shelter for battered women and children to its\neligible residents; and\n(viii)\nrestaurant meals prepared and served in restaurants authorized by the United\n\nStates Department of Agriculture to accept food stamps for meals purchased by\nthe elderly and SSI recipients and their spouses. (4)\n\nOtherwise taxable eligible food. The term\notherwise taxable eligible food\nmeans that eligible food which\nis ordinarily subject to sales and use taxes but exempt from such taxes when\nactually purchased with food stamps pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection. Examples are: (i) fruit and vegetable\nseeds and plants to grow food for the personal consumption of eligible\nhouseholds; (ii)\ncandy and\nconfectionery; (iii)\nfruit drinks\ncontaining less than 70 percent natural juices; (iv)\nsoft drinks and sodas; (v) cold sandwiches; (vi)\nbottled water; (vii)\nbaking nonstick sprays; (viii)\nice; and\n(ix)\nmeals served (\na\n) in\nrestaurants authorized by the United States Department of Agriculture to accept\nfood stamps from the elderly and SSI food stamp recipients and their spouses or\n(\nb\n) by those other participants described in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (b) Exemption. Receipts from the sale of eligible food by retail food\nstores and other participants are exempt from State and local sales and\ncompensating use taxes imposed by article 28 and pursuant to the authority of\narticle 29 of the Tax Law when such eligible food is actually purchased with\nfood stamps. (c) Nonqualifying purchases. Food stamps cannot be used to purchase certain items\ncommonly sold by retail food stores and other participants, such as: (1)\nnonfood items such as pet foods, soaps, paper products, household supplies, grooming items and cosmetics; (2)\nalcoholic beverages; (3)\ntobacco and tobacco products; (4)\nmeals and heated food, unless qualified\nas eligible food (see paragraph [3] of subdivision [a] of this\nsection). (d) General rule for applying food stamps to the purchase of eligible food. No tax is due when eligible food is purchased with food\nstamps. When a customer purchases eligible food, some of which is otherwise\ntaxable eligible food, and the customer does not have enough food stamps to\ncover the entire purchase, the vendor must apply the food stamps first to the\npayment of the otherwise taxable eligible food. Thus no tax is due on such food\nto the extent purchased with food stamps. If any food stamps remain after\npayment of such otherwise taxable eligible food, the vendor should apply them\nto the balance of the eligible food. To the extent cash is tendered in payment\nof otherwise taxable eligible food, tax must be collected. Example 1: A food stamp recipient purchases $50 worth of eligible food\nof which $20 is otherwise taxable eligible food and $30 is nontaxable items. The recipient pays with $25 of food stamps and the balance in cash. The $25 in\nfood stamps is applied first to the $20 of otherwise taxable eligible food, and\nthe balance to the nontaxable items. Since all of the otherwise taxable\neligible food is purchased with food stamps, no tax is due on this\npurchase. Example 2: Same facts as Example 1 except the recipient pays with $15\nin food stamps and the balance in cash. Applying the $15 in food stamps first\nto the $20 cost of the otherwise taxable eligible food leaves $5 in such items\npurchased with cash, which are thus subject to tax. Presuming a tax rate of\nseven percent (four percent State, three percent local), the recipient must pay\ntax of 35 cents on the $5 in otherwise taxable eligible food purchased with\ncash. (e) Special rule\nfor applying food stamps when discount coupons are also tendered. When a customer tenders discount coupons together with food\nstamps and cash (if any) to purchase eligible food, the vendor must apply the\ndiscount coupons first to the cost of the eligible food to which they relate. Food stamps and cash (if any) are then applied to the balance of the cost of\nthe eligible food according to the general rule described in subdivision (d) of\nthis section. The portion of the purchase price paid for with the discount\ncoupon may or may not be taxable, depending on whether it is a store coupon or\nmanufacturer's coupon, and, of course, on whether the item purchased is one\nsubject to tax in the first place. (1)\n\nStore coupons are coupons issued by a store or chain of stores, for which the\nstore does not receive any reimbursement. Such store coupons actually reduce\nthe price charged to customers for the items to which they relate and thus\nreduce the receipt subject to tax, if any. When otherwise taxable eligible food\nis purchased with such a store coupon and food stamps, the price is reduced by\nthe value of the coupon, and food stamps may be accepted in payment of the\nbalance. Under such circumstances, no tax is due on such purchase. Example 3: A food stamp recipient gives a food merchant $9 in food\nstamps and a store coupon worth $1 in payment of $10 worth of eligible food. There are no receipts subject to tax and no sales tax is due on this purchase, since the $9 paid for with food stamps is always exempt, and the $1 store\ncoupon reduces the price to the purchaser. In this example, it would not matter\nwhether the eligible food is otherwise taxable, since the entire amount is paid\nfor with food stamps and store coupons. (2)\n\nManufacturer's coupons are issued by the\nmanufacturer or producer of eligible food, and represent an intention by such\nmanufacturer or producer to reimburse the vendor for accepting such coupon from\nits customers. Manufacturer's coupons thus do not serve to reduce the receipt\nsubject to tax, if any. Rather, such coupons are to be treated as the\nequivalent of cash. Coupons issued by stores where the manufacturer or producer\nreimburses the store are treated as manufacturer's coupons. When eligible food\nis purchased with manufacturer's coupons, food stamps and cash (if any), such\ncoupons are first applied to the items to which they relate. In conformance\nwith the general rule, food stamps are then applied first to otherwise taxable\neligible food and then, if any food stamps remain, to the remaining eligible\nfood. Tax must be collected on the portion of the purchase price paid for with\nmanufacturer's coupons and cash (if any). Example 4: A food stamp recipient gives a food merchant $9 in food\nstamps and a manufacturer's coupon worth $1 in payment of $10 worth of eligible\nfood. The $9 portion of the purchase price is exempt from sales tax because it\nis paid for with food stamps. The $1 paid for with the manufacturer's coupon\nwill also be exempt from tax if the item purchased is not otherwise taxable; that is, if the item is actually food for human consumption, such as meat, milk\nor cereal. But the $1 paid with the manufacturer's coupon will be subject to\ntax if the item purchased with such coupon is otherwise taxable eligible food, such as carbonated beverages, candy, ice or gardening seeds. (3)\n\nDouble or triple coupons. When a store doubles, triples or otherwise supplements the\nvalue of a manufacturer's coupon, the excess value added by the store (for\nwhich the store does not receive reimbursement) is treated as a store coupon\nand the face value of the manufacturer's coupon is treated as a manufacturer's\ncoupon. That is, the value added by the store serves to reduce the purchase\nprice subject to tax, if any, but the value of the manufacturer's coupon does\nnot. Example 5: A customer purchases $200 in groceries consisting of $30\nworth of soap and paper products (which are not eligible to be purchased with\nfood stamps) and $170 worth of eligible food. Included in the $170 worth of\neligible food are $50 worth of otherwise taxable eligible food items. The\ncustomer pays for the groceries with $168 in food stamps, $2 in manufacturer's\ncoupons (which relate to the otherwise taxable eligible food items) and the\nbalance in cash ($30 not including tax). In this instance, the store first\napplies the $2 in manufacturer's coupons to the otherwise taxable eligible food\nto which they relate and then accepts the $168 in food stamps for the balance\nof the eligible food. The store must collect tax on receipts of $32, consisting\nof the $2 value paid for with the manufacturer's coupons and on the $30 worth\nof soap and paper products. Example 6: A customer purchases $200 in groceries consisting of $30\nworth of soap and paper products (which are not eligible to be purchased with\nfood stamps), and $170 worth of eligible food. Of the $170 of eligible food\nitems, $50 are otherwise taxable eligible food items. The customer pays for the\ngroceries with $48 in food stamps, $2 in store coupons related to the $50 in\notherwise taxable eligible food items (for which the store receives no\nreimbursement), and the balance with cash ($150 not including tax). Under these\ncircumstances the store will be required to collect tax only on the $30\nattributable to the soap and paper products purchased with cash, since the $48\nin food stamps are applied first to the $48 net price of the otherwise taxable\neligible food items. Example 7: A customer purchases $200 in groceries consisting of $30\nworth of soap and paper products (which are not eligible to be purchased with\nfood stamps) and $170 worth of eligible food, of which $50 are otherwise\ntaxable eligible food. The customer has $2 in manufacturer's coupons relating\nto the $50 in otherwise taxable eligible food, which will give the customer a\n$4 discount under the store's double coupon policy. The customer pays for the\ngroceries with $60 in food stamps, the $2 in manufacturer's coupons (for which\n$4 credit is given) and the balance in cash ($136 not including tax). Under\nthese circumstances, the store will be required to collect tax on receipts of\n$32, consisting of the $30 worth of soap and paper products plus the $2\nattributable to the manufacturer's portion of the double coupon. No tax is\nrequired to be collected on the store's portion of the double coupon\ndiscount.
