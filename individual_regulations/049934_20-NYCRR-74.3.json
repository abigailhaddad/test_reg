  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 74.3 - Affixation and cancellation of cigarette stamps\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471, 472(1), 473, 475 and 481(2)\n(a) (1)\n\nIn\ngeneral, unstamped packages of cigarettes are introduced into New York State\nprimarily by manufacturers of cigarettes and by dealers having exclusive\ndistribution privileges. While the mere possession of cigarettes to be sold\nwithin the State brings with it a presumption of a taxable event, persons who\nintroduce cigarettes into the New York State market, for sale therein, may do\nso without subjecting themselves to such presumption and without violating any\nprovision of the Tax Law or this Title, provided the cigarettes are: (i) transported in the State by way of common\ncarrier only; (ii)\nstored, if\nnecessary, in bonded or public warehouses; and\n(iii)\nsold exclusively to licensed cigarette\nagents who shall affix and cancel the cigarette tax stamps. Dealers and manufacturers, other than agents, in\npossession of unstamped packages of cigarettes, except as provided herein or\nelsewhere in this Title, may be held liable for the cigarette tax and for\nviolation of the Tax Law and this Title. (2)\n\nLicensed cigarette agents may possess\nunstamped packages of cigarettes for taxable sales in the State until such time\nas the cigarettes at issue are first offered for sale. Every licensed cigarette\nagent must affix to each package of cigarettes, cigarette tax stamps evidencing\nthe payment of the cigarette tax and must cancel such stamps prior to the time\nsuch cigarettes are offered for sale or otherwise disposed of, unless proper\nstamps have been affixed to such packages and cancelled prior to the time when\nthe agent received them or unless such cigarettes are exempt from tax as\nprovided for in this Title. (i) Stamps must be\naffixed to each individual package of cigarettes, as distinguished from cartons\nor large containers, in an aggregate denomination not less than the amount of\ntax upon the contents therein. Stamps must be affixed to the bottoms of such\npackages in such a manner as to be clearly visible to subsequent purchasers. Other than the design of the package itself or the cancellation required\nherein, no other stamp, label, decal, mark or sign shall be affixed to or\ndisplayed on the bottom of a package of cigarettes without prior written\napproval from the Department of Taxation and Finance. Such approval will be\ngiven only to licensed cigarette agents who agree to purchase such indicia from\npersons who manufacture cigarette tax stamps pursuant to contracts entered into\nunder the provisions of section\n74.2\nof this Part and provided such indicia is acceptable to the department as to\ncolor and design. All cigarette tax stamps must be cancelled in ink with\nidentification numbers assigned to each licensed agent and such stamps may be\ncancelled prior to the time when they are affixed to individual packages. In no\nevent shall anything displayed anywhere on a package of cigarettes, other than\nthe cigarette tax stamps themselves, resemble the cigarette tax stamps\nprescribed by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. (ii)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay prescribe the machinery, equipment or other means by which cigarette tax\nstamps are affixed and cancelled. Further, the department reserves the right to\nallow for the affixation and cancellation of such stamps by way of metering\nmachines, subject to such stipulations as it may prescribe. (3)\n\nCustom stamping. In general, the department does not allow the practice of custom stamping; that is, the\naffixing of cigarette tax stamps by one agent for or on behalf of any other\nagent. Accordingly, in addition to affixing stamps on packages of cigarettes\nowned by another agent, custom stamping also includes the sale of stamped\npackages of cigarettes by one agent to another agent. However, with prior\nwritten authorization, the department may permit interagent sales of stamped\npackages of cigarettes in limited circumstances. For example, an unforeseen\ndepletion in stock of a given brand of cigarettes or the limited availability\nof an off-brand of cigarettes might necessitate interagent sales. While such\nauthorization will not be unreasonably withheld by the department, the extent\nof such interagent sales may affect agent-status for purposes of the Cigarette\n\nMarketing Standards Act (see section\n82.1\nof this\n\nTitle). (b) (1)\n\nAs compensation for an agent's services\nand expenses in affixing stamps showing payment of tax in the amount of $4.35\nfor each 20 cigarettes, or fraction thereof, plus for packages in excess of 20\ncigarettes, $1.0875 for each additional five cigarettes or fraction thereof, each agent is allowed commissions computed on the par value thereof. In the\ncase of stamps representing payment of State tax only, and in the case of joint\nstamps showing payment of both State tax and New York City tax, the\npar\nvalue\nfor purposes of this paragraph shall be deemed to mean the face\nvalue of such stamps representing payment of State cigarette tax only at the\nrate imposed by law. The rates of such commissions are as follows: (i) on the par value of stamps evidencing\npayment of the State tax (including joint stamps) not exceeding $5,611,200\npurchased during each calendar year, a commission of.3696 percent with\nreference to so much thereof as represents the par value of separate stamps\nshowing payment of the State tax only and.4071 percent with reference to so\nmuch thereof as represents the par value of joint stamps; and\n(ii)\non the par value of stamps evidencing\npayment of the State tax (including joint stamps) in excess of $5,611,200\npurchased during each calendar year, a commission of.2625 percent with\nreference to so much thereof as represents the par value of separate stamps\nshowing payment of the State tax only and.2893 percent with reference to so\nmuch thereof as represents the par value of joint stamps. (2)\n\nSuch commissions shall be deducted and\nretained by the licensed cigarette agent from the purchase price of the stamps\nat the time payment is made therefor. (3)\n\nFor the applicable rates of commissions\nallowed by the City of New York as computed on the city par values and the city\nrate threshold, see chapter 13 of title 11 of the New York City Administrative\n\nCode and the city regulations adopted pursuant thereto. (c) (1)\n\nEvery wholesale and retail dealer of cigarettes, other than an agent, must\nimmediately upon receipt of any cigarettes at such dealer's place of business\nmark, in ink, on each unopened box, carton or other container of cigarettes the\nword \"received\" and indicate thereon the year, month, day and hour. The dealer\nshall also sign such dealer's name in verification of the date and time of\nreceipt. (2)\n\nAdditionally, every\nretail dealer, other than an agent, must open each box, carton or container of\ncigarettes (other than individual packages) within 24 hours after their\nreceipt, as evidenced by the date and time subscribed pursuant to paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, and, prior to offering for sale or selling such\ncigarettes, the retail dealer must examine each individual package contained\ntherein for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not each package has affixed\nthereon a proper cigarette tax stamp. Unless specifically provided for\notherwise in this Title, if unstamped or improperly stamped packages of\ncigarettes are discovered, the retail dealer must immediately notify the dealer\nfrom whom the cigarettes were purchased. Such dealer, upon notification, shall\nretrieve the unstamped or improperly stamped packages in question and replace\nsuch packages with packages upon which stamps have been properly affixed. Any\nwholesale dealer which retrieves unstamped or improperly stamped packages shall\nin turn, notify its supplier and shall be given the same consideration by its\nsupplier as that afforded the retail dealer. (3)\n\nWhenever any cigarettes are found in the\nplace of business of a wholesale or retail dealer, other than an agent or other\nthan as provided for in this Title, without cigarette tax stamps being affixed\nand cancelled on individual packages or without being marked as having been\nreceived within the preceding 24 hours, it shall be presumed that such\ncigarettes are kept there in violation of the provisions of article 20 of the\n\nTax Law and this Title.
