Records shall be kept\nso that the utility can readily furnish information as to the source, purpose, and amount of each contribution, the property to which each contribution\nrelates and the conditions, if any, upon which each contribution was\nmade.

Except as\nprovided herein, such amounts representing contributions in aid of construction\nshall not be transferred to any other account without the approval of the\ncommission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
