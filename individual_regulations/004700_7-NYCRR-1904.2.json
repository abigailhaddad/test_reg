  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1904.2 - Removal procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any\nfacility employee of the Department of Correctional Services or the Division of\n\nParole who is assigned to the facility where the inmate is confined and who has\nknowledge of an inmate's unsatisfactory adjustment may file a written statement\nto the chairperson of the temporary release committee requesting that the\ncommittee review the inmate's adjustment to the Temporary Release Program. Upon\ncompletion of its review, the committee will forward a recommendation regarding\nthe inmate's continued participation to the facility superintendent. (b) If a temporary release inmate violates\nany provision of the program, or any rule or regulation promulgated by the\ncommissioner for conduct of inmates participating in temporary release\nprograms, such inmate shall be subject to disciplinary measures to the same\nextent as if he or she violated a rule or regulation of the commissioner for\nconduct of inmates confined in a general confinement facility. (c) An inmate who is considered a security\nrisk may be immediately transferred to a more secure correctional facility\nprior to the initiation of disciplinary proceedings or an appearance before the\ntemporary release committee if: (1)\nhe is\nviolent; (2)\nhe presents a danger\nto himself, to others, to property or to facility security; (3)\nthere is an immediate threat to his\nsafety; (4)\nthere is reasonable\ncause to believe that he may try to abscond; or\n(5)\nthe inmate has been arrested. (d) An inmate may be transferred\nto another correctional facility for medical purposes prior to an evaluation by\nthe temporary release committee. (e) A transfer order to move an inmate out of\na work release facility shall be obtained from the director of the temporary\nrelease program. (f) Upon\ncompletion of Tier I and II hearings, the hearing officer may refer the case to\nthe temporary release committee for review. All Tier III hearings however must\nbe referred to the temporary release committee by the hearing officer for\nreview. The hearing officer may not impose as a penalty removal from the\ntemporary release program. Only the temporary release committee can remove an\ninmate from the program. Regardless of the outcome of any disciplinary hearing, the temporary release committee retains the right to review an inmate's\nbehavior and remove the inmate from the program based on the factors delineated\nin section\n1904.1\n(b) of this Part. If the temporary release committee does conduct a review of an\ninmate's program adjustment, the temporary release committee must submit a\nrecommendation to the superintendent concerning the inmate's continued\nparticipation in the temporary release program. (g) The temporary release committee may not\nuse a misbehavior report as a basis for recommending that an inmate be removed\nfrom the temporary release program when the violation has not been\nsustained. (h) When the temporary\nrelease committee is reviewing an inmate's appropriateness for continued\nparticipation in a temporary release program, the temporary release committee\nshall conduct a full hearing to ensure that the inmate has been afforded due\nprocess. The following procedures are to be followed: (1)\n\nAn inmate should be provided with a\nnotice of specific reasons for the referral at least 24 hours prior to the\ntemporary release committee meeting. A non-English speaking inmate who cannot\nread and understand English must be given a translated notice and a translator\nshall be present at the hearing. (2)\n\nThe inmate shall make a personal\nappearance before a temporary release committee unless he or she refuses to\nattend, or is excluded for reasons of institutional safety or correctional\ngoals. (3)\n\nAn electronic recording\nof the entire hearing shall be made. (4)\n\nAn opportunity for an inmate to request\nan inmate assistant if the inmate is illiterate, non-English speaking, the\nissues are complex, the inmate is \"keeplocked\" or in SHU and unable to prepare\na defense, or the inmate is sensorially disabled (in which case the inmate will\nbe provided reasonable accommodations including, but not limited to, the\nprovision of a qualified sign language interpreter for a deaf and\nhard-of-hearing inmate who uses sign language to communicate). (5)\n\nAn opportunity for the inmate to call\nwitnesses and to proffer questions to be asked of witnesses called. (6)\n\nAn opportunity to reply and produce\ndocumentary evidence. (7)\nA written\nstatement setting forth the decision and the evidence relied on, following the\nsuperintendent's review of the temporary release committee's recommendation. A\nnon-English-speaking inmate who cannot read and understand English must be\ngiven a translated statement. (8)\n\nForm 4187 must then be completed and a copy kept on file. (i) The superintendent shall either approve\nor disapprove a recommendation made by the temporary release committee. If the\nsuperintendent disapproves a temporary release committee recommendation, he/she\nshall submit a written statement to the temporary release committee. (j) Where the superintendent revokes an\ninmate's privilege to participate in the temporary release program, he will\nimmediately decide whether or not the inmate's removal from the temporary\nrelease committee makes him unsuitable to remain at his present facility. If\nthe superintendent determines that the inmate should not remain at his present\nfacility, he shall contact the director of the temporary release program to\nobtain a transfer order to a more secure facility. (k) When a superintendent revokes an inmate's\nprivilege to participate in the temporary release program, he will immediately\nadvise the chairperson of the temporary release committee. The chairperson of\nthe temporary release committee will forward to the inmate a written statement\nbriefly advising the inmate that the superintendent has ordered him removed\nfrom the temporary release program and stating the reasons why the temporary\nrelease committee recommends that the action be taken. This statement should be\nforwarded to the inmate within a week of his removal. Copies of this statement\nshould be forwarded to the guidance unit and parole officer at any institution\nwhere the inmate has been transferred. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
