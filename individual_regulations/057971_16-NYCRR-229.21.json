  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 229.21 - Required tests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Determination\nfor metering purposes. Where a company is required by the provisions of section\n229.20\n(a) herein\nto provide any of its testing stations required herein by section\n229.50\n(a)-(d)\nof\nthis Part with a recording gravitometer for the purpose of determining the\nspecific gravity of the distributed gas in a manner adequate for orifice and\nother types of velocity metering, said company shall continuously record the\nspecific gravity of the distributed gas therewith. Each said recording\ngravitometer shall be calibrated once each calendar month at intervals of not\nmore than 35 days and the results recorded. Each said recording gravitometer\nshall be adjusted if it is determined to be in error. (b) Automatic determination. Where the tests\nset forth in subdivision (a) of this section are not required, the company\nshall determine the specific gravity of the distributed gas either in\ncompliance with subdivision (c) of this section or continuously determine the\nspecific gravity of the distributed gas with automatic specific gravity\nequipment at the testing stations required herein by section\n229.50\n(a)-(d)\nof\nthis Part in compliance with this rule. Where the automatic specific gravity\nequipment is of an indicating type, the specific gravity of the distributed gas\nshall be read and recorded daily therefrom. In all instances, automatic\nspecific gravity equipment shall be calibrated once each alternate calendar\nmonth at intervals of not more than 70 days and the results recorded. (c) Manual determination. Unless tests are\nmade in conformity with subdivision (a) or (b) of this section, each company\nshall determine and record the specific gravity of the distributed gas with\nmanual specific gravity equipment at the testing stations required herein by\nsection\n229.50\n(a)-(d)\nof\nthis Part except that at a testing station testing gas obtained from a stand-by\nsource, said tests need not be made during any day that gas be obtained from\nsaid stand-by source for a total of less than one hour. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n229.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
