CUOMO, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby find that a disaster is imminent for\nwhich the affected local governments are unable to respond adequately. Therefore, pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, I hereby\ndeclare a State Disaster Emergency effective March 12, 2014 within the\nterritorial boundaries of the counties of Allegany, Cattaraugus, Cayuga, Chautauqua, Erie, Genesee, Livingston, Monroe, Niagara, Ontario, Orleans, Oswego, Wayne, Wyoming, and contiguous areas. This Executive Order shall be in\neffect until March 14, 2014; and\nFURTHER, pursuant to Section 29 of Article 2-B of the\n\nExecutive Law, I direct the implementation of the State Comprehensive Emergency\n\nManagement Plan and authorize, effective March 12, 2014, the State Office of\n\nEmergency Management, the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nTransportation, the State Police, the Division of Military and Naval Affairs, the Department of Environmental Conservation, the State Department of\n\nCorrectional Services, the Public Service Commission, the Office of Fire\n\nPrevention and Control, the Department of Labor, the Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, the Office of General Services, the State\n\nUniversity of New York, the Thruway Authority, the Division of Homeland\n\nSecurity and Emergency Services, other State agencies as necessary, and the\n\nAmerican Red Cross to take appropriate action to protect State property and to\nassist affected local governments and individuals in responding to and\nrecovering from this disaster, and to provide such other assistance as\nnecessary to protect the public health and safety.

Such relief from the FMCSR is necessary in order to ensure\nthat snow removal crews can clear vital roadways and hasten the movement of\nutility power restoration crews into New York State. FURTHER, I have designated Jerome M. Hauer, Commissioner of\nthe Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Services, as the State\n\nCoordinating Officer for this event. Signed: Andrew M.
