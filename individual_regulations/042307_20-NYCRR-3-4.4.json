Tit. 20 §§ 3-4.4 - Presumed investment capital that fails the holding period requirement\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(5)(d))\n(a) If a corporation disposes of presumed\ninvestment capital after the filing of the original report for that tax year\nthe corporation must determine how long such stock had been held for\ninvestment. If any such stock in fact had been held as investment for one year\nor less (as counted across tax years), the corporation must either: (1)\nfile an amended report for the taxable\nyear in which such stock was presumed investment capital to properly classify\nthe capital and income as business capital and income, respectively; or\n(2)\n(i) increase its business capital in the\nimmediately succeeding taxable year by the amount previously included in\ninvestment capital for that stock, net of any liabilities attributable to that\nstock (but not less than zero); and\n(ii)\nincrease its business income in the\nimmediately succeeding taxable year by the amount of income and net gains (but\nnot less than zero) from that stock previously included in gross investment\nincome after the limitation in section\n3-4.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart less either\n(a) the safe harbor\nreduction amount determined in section\n3-4.8\nof this Subpart on the\nreturn on which this presumed investment capital was identified or\n(b) the amount of interest deductions\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to the items of investment capital that\nfailed the presumption determined pursuant to the method in section\n3-4.7\nof this Subpart on the\nreturn on which this presumed investment capital was identified. No adjustment\nwill be allowed in the immediately succeeding taxable year for excess interest\ndeductions directly or indirectly attributable to the items of investment\ncapital that failed the presumption that were added back to ENI in the year the\npresumed investment capital was included in investment\ncapital. (b) For purposes of paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, to determine if stocks that are presumed\ninvestment capital generated income that was claimed as investment income in\nthe preceding tax year, the corporation shall use the ordering rules contained\nin section\n3-4.5\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. Provided that, for purposes of paragraph (3) of such subdivision, stocks that had been held as investment for more than one year, as counted\nacross tax years, shall be considered before stocks that had been held as\ninvestment for one year or less. For stocks held for one year or less, stocks\nwith the largest interest deductions computed pursuant to section\n3-4.7\nof this Subpart shall be\nconsidered first. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
