  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1.73 - Executive Order No. 73: Relating to the supervision of food processing establishments and service food establishments. [*]\nState Regulations\n\nTwo State agencies, the Departments of Health and\n\nAgriculture and Markets, have a responsibility for protecting the public from\nconditions that might spread disease through unsanitary food preparation and\nservice and to protect the public against adulterated or substitute food\nproducts. In general, the Department of Health and local health\ndepartments have the responsibility for inspecting and supervising places where\nfood is consumed on the premises or sold ready-to-eat for off-premises\nconsumption. Inspections to assure proper sanitary conditions are conducted by\nemployees of the State Department of Health or local health agencies with the\n\nState Department of Health paying part of the local costs and providing\ntechnical supervision. In general, the Department of Agriculture and Markets has\nthe responsibility for inspecting and supervising places where food is\nprocessed or manufactured. On July 14, 1960, I issued an Executive Order which\ndelineated the respective responsibilities of the Departments of Agriculture\nand Markets, Health and Labor with regard to sanitary inspections of\nrestaurants. That order was intended to insure that the public was fully\nprotected against unsanitary conditions in restaurants while avoiding wasteful\nduplication of effort by different State agencies. The Secretary to the Governor and the Division of the\n\nBudget has recently completed a joint review of the inspection and supervision\nof food processing plants, restaurants and other types of establishments\nprocessing or serving food products in New York State. That study recommended\nthat it would be desirable to expand existing licensing requirements to provide\nfor licensing by the Commissioner of Agriculture and Markets of all food\nprocessing establishments not otherwise licensed. Chapter 863 of the Laws of\n1972, which was a part of my 1972 Legislative Program, implements this\nrecommendation. The joint review also recommended a further delineation of\nthe responsibilities of State agencies with respect to the inspection and\nsupervision of food establishments other than restaurants in furtherance of the\nsame objectives that underlie the July 14, 1960 Executive Order, i.e., to strengthen the State's consumer protection effort by\ninsuring that there is a coordinated, efficient program with no gaps in\ncoverage and no wasteful duplication of effort. Accordingly, I direct that the Department of Agriculture\nand Markets and the Department of Health enter into a Memorandum of\n\nUnderstanding, and adopt regulations in conformity therewith, that will provide\nfor: - regulation and inspection by the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets of places of food processing or manufacturing; - regulation and inspection by the Department of Health of\nplaces where food is consumed on the premises or sold ready-to-eat for\noff-premises consumption; - a detailed listing of the specific types of\nestablishments for which each Department will be responsible; - systematic exchange of information; - joint periodic management evaluation by both Departments\nof food regulatory programs, with any recommendations to the Governor which may\nbe deemed appropriate; - coordination of enforcement of standards for health, sanitation, adulteration, labeling and economic factors; and\n- such other related matters as may be appropriate for\nimplementation of this Executive Order and to the execution of the Departments'\nrespective responsibilities. I further direct the Departments of Agriculture and Markets\nand Health to continue their cooperative efforts in other areas of consumer\nprotection to insure that the State has a comprehensive, coordinated and\nefficient system of food inspection and regulation. The Labor Department, which in furtherance of its\nresponsibility to provide for the protection and safety of employees conducts\ninspections of various food processing and service food establishments, is\ndirected to consult with the Departments of Agriculture and Markets and Health\nto avoid unnecessary duplication in sanitary inspections. The provisions of the Executive Order of July 14, 1960 on\nrestaurant inspections shall remain in effect and the provisions of this order\nshall be deemed supplementary thereto except where inconsistent, in which case\nthe provisions of this Executive Order No. 73 shall control.
