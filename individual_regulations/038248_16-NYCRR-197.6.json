  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.6 - Delayed items\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The term\ndelayed items means items relating to transactions which occurred before the\ncurrent fiscal year. It includes adjustments of errors in the income, operating\nrevenue, and operating expense accounts of prior years. (b) Delayed items shall be charged or\ncredited to the same accounts which should have been charged or credited if the\nitems had been taken up or adjusted in the period to which they pertain. When\nthe amount of a delayed item is relatively so large that its inclusion in the\naccounts for a single month would seriously distort those accounts, it may be\ndistributed in equal amounts to the accounts for the current and remaining\nmonths of the fiscal year. (c) If\nthe amount of any delayed item is relatively so large that its inclusion in the\naccounts for a single year would seriously distort those accounts, the utility, if so authorized by order of the commission, may carry to Surplus as much of\nthe amount as may be authorized. In requesting such authority, the utility\nshall file with the commission the full particulars concerning each such item\nand the reasons which in its judgment indicate the propriety of such\naccounting. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n197.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
