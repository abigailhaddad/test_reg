(c) Confidential\nnature of statements. (1)\n\nAll\nstatements of retainer or closing statements filed shall be deemed to be\nconfidential and the information therein contained shall not be divulged or\nmade available for inspection or examination except upon written order of the\npresiding justice of the Appellate Division. (See subdivision [g] of this\nsection.)\n(2)\n\nThe\n\nOffice of Court Administration of the State of New York shall reproduce in an\nalternative format, as that term is defined in section\n104.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, all statements filed pursuant to this section by a means that shall\naccurately reproduce the original statements in all details thereof, and shall\nthereafter destroy the originals so reproduced. Such a reproduction in an\nalternative format shall be deemed to be an original record for all purposes, and an enlargement or facsimile thereof may be introduced in evidence in all\ncourts and administrative agencies and in any action, hearing or proceeding in\nplace and stead of the original statement so reproduced, with the same force\nand effect as though the original document were presented. (d) Deposit of collections; notice. (1)\n\nWhenever an\nattorney, who has accepted a retainer or entered into an agreement as above\nreferred to, shall collect any sum of money upon any such action, claim or\nproceeding, either by way of settlement or after a trial or hearing, he shall\nforthwith deposit the same in a special account in accordance with the\nprovisions of section\n691.12\nof this Part. Within 15\ndays after the receipt of any such sums he shall cause to be delivered\npersonally to such client or sent by registered or certified mail, addressed to\nsuch client at the client's last known address, a copy of the closing statement\nrequired by this section. At the same time the attorney shall pay or remit to\nthe client the amount shown by such statement to be due the client, and he may\nthen withdraw for himself the amount so claimed to be due him for compensation\nand disbursements. For the purpose of calculating the 15-day period, the\nattorney shall be deemed to have collected or received or been paid a sum of\nmoney on the date that he receives the draft endorsed by the client, or if the\nclient's endorsement is not required, on the date the attorney receives the\nsum. The acceptance by a client of such amount shall be without prejudice to\nthe latter's right in an appropriate action or proceeding, to petition the\ncourt to have the question of the attorney's compensation or reimbursement for\nexpenses investigated and determined by it. (2)\n\nWhenever any sum of money is\npayable upon any such claim, action or proceeding, either by way of settlement\nor after trial or hearing, and the attorney is unable to locate a client, the\nattorney shall apply pursuant to subdivision f-1 of section 1200.46 of the\n\nDisciplinary Rules of the Code of Professional Responsibility to the court in\nwhich such action or proceeding was pending, or if no action had been\ncommenced, then to the Supreme Court in the county in which the attorney\nmaintains an office, for an order directing payment to be made to the attorney\nof the fees and reimbursable disbursements determined by the court to be due\nsaid attorney and to the Lawyer's Fund for Client Protection of the balance due\nto the client, for the account of the client, subject to the charge of any lien\nfound by the court to be payable therefrom. (e) Contingent fees in claims\nand actions for personal injury and wrongful death. (1)\n\nIn any claim or action for personal\ninjury or wrongful death, or loss of services resulting from personal injury or\nfor property or money damages resulting from negligence or any type of\nmalpractice, other than one alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice, whether determined by judgment or settlement, in which the compensation of\nclaimant's or plaintiff's attorney is contingent, that is, dependent in whole\nor in part upon the amount of recovery, the receipt, retention or sharing by\nsuch attorney, pursuant to agreement or otherwise, of compensation which is\nequal to or less than that contained in any schedule of fees adopted by this\ndepartment is deemed to be fair and reasonable. The receipt, retention or\nsharing of compensation which is in excess of such scheduled fees shall\nconstitute the exaction of unreasonable and unconscionable compensation in\nviolation of any provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct as set forth\nin Part 1200 of this Title, unless authorized by a written order of the court\nas hereinafter provided. (2)\n\nThe following is the schedule of\nreasonable fees referred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision: either\nSCHEDULE A\n(i) 50 percent on the first\n$1000 of the sum recovered; (ii)\n40 percent on the next $2000 of\nthe sum recovered; (iii)\n35 percent on the next $22,000 of\nthe sum recovered; or\n(iv)\n25 percent on any amount over\n$25,000 of the sum recovered; or\nSCHEDULE B\n(v) A percentage not exceeding\n331/3 percent of the sum recovered, if the initial contractual arrangement\nbetween the client and the attorney so provides, in which event the procedure\nhereinafter provided for making application for additional compensation because\nof extraordinary circumstances shall not apply. (3)\n\nSuch percentage shall be\ncomputed on the net sum recovered after deducting from the amount recovered\nexpenses and disbursements for expert medical testimony and investigative or\nother services properly chargeable to the enforcement of the claim or\nprosecution of the action. In computing the fee, the costs as taxed, including\ninterest upon a judgment, shall be deemed part of the amount recovered. For the\nfollowing or similar items there shall be no deduction in computing such\npercentages: liens, assignments or claims in favor of hospitals, for medical\ncare and treatment by doctors and nurses, or self- insurers or insurance\ncarriers. (4)\n\nIn the\nevent that claimant's or plaintiff's attorney believes in good faith that\n\nSchedule A above because of extraordinary circumstances, will not give him\nadequate compensation, application for greater compensation may be made upon\naffidavit with written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the client and\nother persons holding liens or assignments on the recovery. Such application\nshall be made to the justice of the trial part to which the action had been\nsent for trial; or, if it had not been sent to a part for trial, then to the\njustice presiding at the trial term calendar part of the court in which the\naction had been instituted; or, if no action had been instituted, then to the\njustice presiding at the trial term calendar part of the Supreme Court for the\ncounty in the judicial department in which the attorney who filed the statement\nof retainer, pursuant to this section, has an office. Upon such application, the justice, in his discretion, if extraordinary circumstances are found to be\npresent, and without regard to the claimant's or plaintiff's consent, may fix\nas reasonable compensation for legal services rendered an amount greater than\nthat specified in Schedule A of paragraph (2) of this subdivision; provided, however, that such greater amount shall not exceed the fee fixed pursuant to\nthe contractual arrangement, if any, between the client and the attorney. If\nthe application be granted, the justice shall make a written order accordingly, briefly stating the reasons for granting the greater compensation; and a copy\nof such order shall be served on all persons entitled to receive notice of the\napplication. (5)\n\nThe\nprovisions of subdivision (e) of this section shall not apply to an attorney\nretained as counsel in a claim or action for personal injury or wrongful death\nby another attorney, if such other attorney is not subject to the provisions of\nthis section in such claim or action, but all other subdivisions of this\nsection shall apply. (6)\n\nNothing contained in subdivision\n(e) of this section shall be deemed applicable to the fixing of compensation\nfor attorneys representing infants or other persons, where the statutes or\nrules provide for the fixation of such compensation by the court. (7)\n\nNothing contained in\nsubdivision (e) of this section shall be deemed applicable to the fixing of\ncompensation for attorneys for services rendered in connection with the\ncollection of first party benefits as defined by article XVIII of the Insurance\n\nLaw. (8)\n\nThe\nprovisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall not apply to claims\nalleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice. Compensation of claimant's\nor plaintiff's attorney for services rendered in claims or actions for personal\ninjury alleging medical, dental or podiatric malpractice shall be computed\npursuant to the fee schedule in section\n474-a\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law. (f) Preservation of records of claims\nand actions. Attorneys for both plaintiff and defendant in the case of any such\nclaim or cause of action shall preserve, for a period of seven years after any\nsettlement or satisfaction of the claim or cause of action or any judgment\nthereon or after the dismissal or discontinuance of any action, the pleadings\nand other papers pertaining to such claim or cause of action, including, but\nnot limited to, letters or other date relating to the claim of loss of time\nfrom employment or loss of income; medical reports, medical bills, X-ray\nreports, X- ray bills; repair bills, estimates of repairs; all correspondence\nconcerning the claim or cause of action; and memoranda of the disposition\nthereof as well as canceled vouchers, receipts and memoranda evidencing the\namounts disbursed by the attorney to the client and others in connection with\nthe aforesaid claim or cause of action and such other records as are required\nto be maintained under rule 1.15 of Part 1200 of this Title. (g) Special authorization to\ndivulge retainer and closing statements filed by attorneys. Pursuant to\nparagraph (c)(1) of this section, the presiding justice of the Appellate\n\nDivision of the Supreme Court in the second judicial department does hereby\norder that, without his further specific order, the clerk of the said Appellate\n\nDivision and the Office of Court Administration of the State of New York, jointly and severally, are authorized to permit any agent or representative of\nthe Treasury Department or of the district director of internal revenue of the\n\nUnited States, upon the presentation of written authorization from a\nsupervising official or head in the office of said department or district\ndirector, to examine and copy any retainer or closing statement heretofore or\nhereafter filed by any attorney in the office of the said clerk or the Office\nof Court Administration of the State of New York, in accordance with said rules\nregulating the conduct of attorneys and counselors at law.
