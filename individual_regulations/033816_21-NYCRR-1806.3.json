To\nphysically initiate assemblage, installation, erection or fabrication of any\nfacility involving or intended for the withdrawal, conveyance, storage or\nconsumptive use of waters of the basin. For purposes of natural gas well\ndevelopment projects subject to review and approval pursuant to section\n1806.4\n(a)(8)\nof\nthis Part, initiation of construction shall be deemed to commence upon the\ndrilling (spudding) of a gas well, or the initiation of construction of any\nwater impoundment or other water-related facility to serve the project, whichever comes first. (j) Consumptive use. The loss of water transferred through a manmade conveyance\nsystem or any integral part thereof (including such water that is purveyed\nthrough a public water supply or wastewater system), due to transpiration by\nvegetation, incorporation into products during their manufacture, evaporation, injection of water or wastewater into a subsurface formation from which it\nwould not reasonably be available for future use in the basin, diversion from\nthe basin, or any other process by which the water is not returned to the\nwaters of the basin undiminished in quantity. (k) Diversion. The transfer of water into or\nout of the basin. (l) Executive\ndirector. The chief executive officer of the commission appointed pursuant to\narticle 15, section 15.5, of the compact. (m) Facility. Any real or personal property, within or without the basin, and improvements thereof or thereon, and any and\nall rights of way, water, water rights, plants, structures, machinery, and\nequipment acquired, constructed, operated, or maintained for the beneficial use\nof water resources or related land uses or otherwise including, without\nlimiting the generality of the foregoing, any and all things and appurtenances\nnecessary, useful, or convenient for the control, collection, storage, withdrawal, diversion, release, treatment, transmission, sale, or exchange of\nwater; or for navigation thereon, or the development and use of hydroelectric\nenergy and power, and public recreational facilities; of the propagation of\nfish and wildlife; or to conserve and protect the water resources of the basin\nor any existing or future water supply source, or to facilitate any other uses\nof any of them. (n) Flowback. The\nreturn flow of water and formation fluids recovered from the wellbore of an\nunconventional natural gas or hydrocarbon development well following the\nrelease of pressures induced as part of the hydraulic fracture stimulation of a\ntarget geologic formation, and until the well is placed into\nproduction. (o) Formation fluids. Fluids in a liquid or gaseous physical state, present within the pore spaces, fractures, faults, vugs, caverns, or any other spaces of formations, whether or\nnot naturally occurring or injected therein. (p) Governmental authority. A Federal or\n\nState government, or any political subdivision, public corporation, public\nauthority, special purpose district, or agency thereof. (q) Groundwater. Water beneath the surface of\nthe ground within a zone of saturation, whether or not flowing through known\nand definite channels or percolating through underground geologic formations, and regardless of whether the result of natural or artificial recharge. The\nterm includes water contained in quarries, pits and underground mines having no\nsignificant surface water inflow, aquifers, underground water courses and other\nbodies of water below the surface of the earth. The term also includes a spring\nin which the water level is sufficiently lowered by pumping or other means of\ndrainage to eliminate the surface flow. All other springs are considered to be\nsurface water. (r) Hydrocarbon\ndevelopment. Activity associated with the drilling, casing, cementing, stimulation and completion of wells, including but not limited to\nunconventional natural gas development wells, undertaken for the purpose of\nextraction of liquid or gaseous hydrocarbons from geologic\nformations. (s) Hydrocarbon water\nstorage facility. An engineered barrier or structure, including but not limited\nto tanks, pits or impoundments, constructed for the purpose of storing water, flowback or production fluids for use in hydrocarbon development. (t) Member jurisdiction. The signatory\nparties as defined in the compact, comprised of the states of Maryland and New\n\nYork, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, and the United States of\n\nAmerica. (u) Member state. The\nstates of Maryland and New York, and the Commonwealth of\n\nPennsylvania. (v) Person. An\nindividual, corporation, partnership, unincorporated association, and the like\nand shall have no gender and the singular shall include the plural. The term\nshall include a governmental authority and any other entity which is recognized\nby law as the subject of rights and obligations. (w) Pre-compact consumptive use. The maximum\naverage daily quantity or volume of water consumptively used over any\nconsecutive 30-day period prior to January 23, 1971. (x) Production fluids. Water or formation\nfluids recovered at the wellhead of a producing hydrocarbon well as a\nby-product of the production activity. (y) Project. Any work, service, activity, or\nfacility undertaken, which is separately planned, financed or identified by the\ncommission, or any separate facility undertaken or to be undertaken by the\ncommission or otherwise within a specified area, for the conservation, utilization, control, development, or management of water resources, which can\nbe established and utilized independently, or as an addition to an existing\nfacility, and can be considered as a separate entity for purposes of\nevaluation. For purposes of hydrocarbon development activity, including that\nrelated to unconventional natural gas development, the project shall be\nconsidered to be the drilling pad upon which one or more exploratory or\nproduction wells are undertaken, and all water-related appurtenant facilities\nand activities related thereto. (z) Project sponsor. Any person who owns, operates or proposes to undertake a\nproject. The singular shall include the plural. (aa)\n\nPublic water supply.

(ab)\n\nSurface\nwater. Water on the surface of the ground, including water in a perennial or\nintermittent watercourse, lake, reservoir, pond, spring, wetland, estuary, swamp or marsh, or diffused surface water, whether such body of water is\nnatural or artificial. (ac)\n\nTophole\nwater. Water that is brought to the surface while drilling through the strata\ncontaining fresh groundwater. Tophole water may contain drill cuttings typical\nof the formation being penetrated but may not be polluted or contaminated by\nadditives, brine, oil or man induced conditions. (ad)\n\nUnconventional natural gas development. Activity associated with the drilling, casing, cementing, stimulation and\ncompletion of wells undertaken for the purpose of extraction of gaseous\nhydrocarbons from low permeability geologic formations utilizing enhanced\ndrilling, stimulation or recovery techniques. (ae)\n\nUndertake. Except for activities related\nto site evaluation, the initiation of construction or operation of a new or\nexpanded project, or the operation of an existing project, that is subject to\ncommission review and approval. (af)\n\nWater or waters of the basin. Groundwater or surface water, or both, within the\nbasin either before or after withdrawal. (ag) Water resources. Includes all waters and related\nnatural resources within the basin. (ah)\n\nWithdrawal. A taking or removal of water\nfrom any source within the basin for use within the basin. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
