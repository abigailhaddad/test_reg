  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 228-1.1 - Applicability and exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. Except as provided for in subdivision (b) of this\nsection, every owner or operator of a facility containing a coating line must\ncomply with the provisions of this Subpart. All facilities which start-up after\nthe effective date of this regulation must be in compliance upon start-up. All\nother subject facilities must be in compliance by the effective date of this\nregulation; or submit a schedule and plan to the department within three months\nof the effective date of this regulation. The schedule and plan must describe\nin detail how the facility will implement the applicable requirements of this\n\nSubpart, and include a compliance schedule outlining the specific dates the\nimplementation measures will be completed. This schedule and plan must be\nimplemented and bring the facility into compliance within nine months of the\neffective date of the regulation. (1)\n\nTable 1 identifies the coating lines subject to this Subpart based on their\npotential to emit (PTE) or actual emissions of volatile organic compounds\n(VOCs), from all sources at the facility, regardless of process type, excluding\ncombustion installations. The coating lines identified in table 1 must comply\nwith the requirements set forth in this Subpart, including any specific\nrequirements applicable to the designated coating line class. Table 1 - Applicability\n\nDesignation of Coating Line Class & Description\nof Coating Line\n\nThe following facilities, containing a\ncorresponding coating line, are subject to this Subpart: Class A Coating Line: Mobile Equipment Repair and Refinishing or Color\n\nMatched Coating Lines\n(i) All facilities regardless of location or their\nactual or potential to emit volatile organic compounds. Class B Coating Lines: (1) Metal Furniture (2) Large Appliance (3) Flat\n\nWood Paneling (4) Miscellaneous Metal Parts (5) Miscellaneous Plastic Parts (6)\n\nAuto/Transportation and Business Machine Plastic Parts (7) Marine pleasure\ncraft surface (8) Motor vehicle materials (9) Automobile and Light Duty Truck\n\nAssembly\n(i) All facilities located in the New York City\nmetropolitan area, plus the Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury; and (ii) Facilities not\nlocated in the above counties and towns with actual process emissions greater\nthan or equal to 3 tons of VOC per year. Class C Coating Line: Wood Finishing\n(i) All facilities located in the New York City\nmetropolitan area, plus the Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury; and (ii) Facilities not\nlocated in the above counties and towns with PTE's greater than or equal to 25\ntons of VOC per year. Class D Coating Lines: Magnetic Wire Metal Cans Coil Vinyl Fabric Paper, Film and Foil\n(i) All facilities located in the New York City\nmetropolitan area, plus the Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury; and (ii) Facilities not\nlocated in the above counties and towns with PTE's greater than or equal to 10\ntons of VOC per year. Class E Coating Lines: Tablet (pharmaceutical) Glass Leather\n\nAerospace\n(i) All facilities located in the New York City\nmetropolitan area, plus the Orange County towns of Blooming Grove, Chester, Highlands, Monroe, Tuxedo, Warwick, and Woodbury; and (ii) Facilities not\nlocated in the above counties and towns with PTE's greater than or equal to 50\ntons of VOC per year. (2)\n\nCoating lines not specifically listed in\ntable 1 may also be subject to the requirements applicable to coating line\nclasses A through E. The owner/operator of any \"coating line\" or \"coating\nprocess\" not specifically listed in table 1 of this section must contact the\ndepartment's regional office, who will determine the applicable VOC control\nrequirements of the coating process and the class of the coating line. The\ndepartment's applicability determination will be based on a review of the\nfacility, including but not limited to a review of any processes, emission\nsources, and/or products to be, or being, coated at the facility. For purposes\nof its review, the department may require a physical inspection of the\nfacility. (3)\n\nAny coating line that\nis or becomes subject to the provisions of this Subpart will remain subject to\nthese provisions even if the annual potential to emit, or actual emissions of\nVOCs, for the facility later falls below the thresholds set forth in this\nsubdivision of this section. (4)\n\nCoating lines not specifically identified in table 1 of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision or subject to class A through E requirements pursuant to paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision need only comply with the 'General Requirements'\nprovisions of section\n228-1.3\n(a) through\n(d) of this Subpart, including opacity, recordkeeping, prohibition of sale, and handling, storage and disposal\nrequirements. (b) This\n\nSubpart does not apply to the following: (1)\ncoating lines used in research and development processes which produce a\nproduct for study rather than eventual sale; (2)\ncoating lines where coatings are applied\nmanually (by hand or without the use of mechanical means) with a brush, roller, cloth or an aerosol spray can; (3)\ncoating lines which apply clear or translucent coatings to clear or translucent\nplastic substrates utilized in the manufacture of back-lighted outdoor\nsigns; (4)\ncoating lines which\napply clear and pearlescent coatings to plastic fashion items such as beads, buttons, buckles or other plastic accessories; (5)\ncoating lines used in the manufacture of\noptical lenses at a facility whose annual potential to emit VOCs is 10 tons or\nless; (6)\ncoating lines which apply\nreflective coatings to highway cones; (7)\ncoating lines which apply electromagnetic\ninterference/radio frequency interference (EMI/RFI) coatings on plastic\nelectronic equipment to provide shielding against electromagnetic interference, radio frequency interference, or static charge; (8)\ncoating lines which apply electric\ndissipating coatings used to rapidly dissipate a high voltage electric charge\napplied on plastic parts; (9)\nfacility wide use of up to 55 gallons of coatings (or up to 400 pounds of\nactual VOC usage) on a 12-month rolling total. This exemption is contingent on\nthe owner or operator of the facility maintaining records of such surface\ncoatings, and maintaining compliance with all requirements of section\n228-1.3,'General Requirements', of\nthis Subpart. Mobile equipment repair and refinishing or color matched coating\nlines do not qualify for this exemption; (10)\nmobile equipment repair and refinishing\nor color-matched coating lines where the person applying the coatings does not\nreceive compensation; (11)\ncoating\nlines which use powder coatings; (12)\ncoating lines that are subject to Part\n234 'Graphic Arts' of this Title; (13)\nmobile equipment repair and refinishing\nor color-matched coating lines where the facility: (i) applies coatings using one or more of the\ntechniques specified in section\n228-1.3\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart that minimize VOC emissions; (ii)\ncleans spray guns using techniques\nspecified in section\n228-1.3\n(d)(7)\nof\nthis Subpart that minimize VOC emissions; (iii)\nuses coatings that do not exceed the\nappropriate VOC content limits in table A of section\n228-1.4\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart; (iv)\nuses appropriate\nemission control measures; (v) applies coatings to work areas that do not exceed 9.0 square feet unless the\ncoating is applied within an enclosure which prevents the uncontrolled release\nof air contaminants to the outside atmosphere and operates using appropriate\nemission control measures; and\n(vi)\nuses a quantity of coatings and cleaning solvents on an annual basis that does\nnot exceed 55 gallons (or 400 pounds of actual VOC usage, from coatings and\ncleaning solutions) on a 12-month rolling total. This exemption is contingent\non the owner or operator of the facility maintaining records of the coatings\nand cleaning materials used, and maintaining compliance with all requirements\nof section\n228-1.3, 'General Requirements', of\nthis Subpart.
