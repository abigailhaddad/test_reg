  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-5.2 - Definition of employee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\npurposes of computing the payroll factor, the term \"employee\" means any\nindividual whose relationship with the surcharge taxpayer is that of employer\nand employee, as described in subdivision (b) of this section. The wages, salaries and other personal service compensation of every such individual, except general executive officers, will be included in the computation of the\npayroll factor of the MCTD apportionment percentage. (b) Generally, the relationship of employer\nand employee exists when the surcharge taxpayer has the right to control and\ndirect the individual not only as to the result to be accomplished by such\nemployee, but also as to the means by which such result is to be accomplished. If the relationship of employer and employee exists, the designation or\ndescription of the relationship, as well as the measure, method and designation\nof the employee's compensation, are immaterial. (c) A director of a corporation is not an\nemployee. Therefore, compensation paid to directors for acting in their\ncapacity as directors should not be included in computing the payroll factor. In addition, a partner in a partnership cannot be an employee of that\npartnership. (d) (1)\n\nFor purposes of this section, a general\nexecutive officer is an appointed or elected officer of the corporation who\neither has company-wide authority with respect to the officer's assigned\nfunctions or duties or is responsible for an entire division of the company. Specifically, a general executive officer: (i) will have been elected by the\nshareholders of the corporation; (ii)\nwill have been elected or appointed by\nthe board of directors of the corporation; or\n(iii)\nif initially appointed by another\nofficer, will have had such appointment ratified by the board of directors of\nthe corporation. (2)\n\nIf\nthe jurisdiction of incorporation is other than New York State, the officer of\nthe corporation must be elected or appointed in accordance with the laws of the\nstate or country of incorporation. (3)\n\nGeneral executive officers include the\nchairperson, president, vice-president, secretary, assistant secretary, treasurer, assistant treasurer, comptroller, and any other officer charged with\nand performing general executive duties of the corporation. (4)\n\nAny person who has merely been designated\nas an officer but who is not an appointed or elected officer, as described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, is not a general executive\nofficer. (5)\n\nPersonal service\ncompensation paid to general executive officers of the taxpayer for acting in\nthe role of a general executive officer should not be included in the\ncomputation of the payroll factor.
