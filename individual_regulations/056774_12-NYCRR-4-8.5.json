  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-8.5 - Pilot installation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Flame visibility. Pilots shall be placed so that their flames may be directly\nobserved with the main burners off and also, unless other means are available\nfor checking their operations, with the main burners on. (b) Dirt protection. Pilots shall be\ninstalled so that the ignition port and operating mechanism will not be\nobstructed by falling scale and dirt in normal operation. (c) Fastening and removal. Pilot assemblies\nand bleed assemblies, when used, shall be made secure against accidental\ndisplacement. Pilot assemblies shall be so installed that they may be removed\nwithout the use of special tools, and with reasonable care even when hot, without removing main burners, controls or accessories or breaking or\ndisturbing any gas connections other than that of the pilot supply, bleed\nsupply or manifold unions. Pilots may be removed as a unit. (d) Supply line connection. When the pilot\nburner supply line is taken from a horizontal line, the connection shall be\nmade either on the side or top. If taken from a vertical line, the connection\nshall be above the main burner supply line. Pilot supply lines may be taken\nfrom the bottom of a horizontal line if means are provided to prevent\ncondensate from entering the pilot line. (e) Air supply. When an enclosed type of fire\nbox is used, provisions shall be made to assure an adequate supply of air for\ncombustion of the gas from the pilot. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
