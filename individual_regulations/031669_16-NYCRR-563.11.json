  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 563.11 - Work order and property record system required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each utility shall record all\nconstruction and retirements of water plant by means of work orders or job\norders. Separate work orders may be opened for additions to and retirements of\nwater plant or the retirements may be included with the construction work\norder, provided, however, that all items relating to the retirements shall be\nkept separate from those relating to construction and provided, further, that\nany maintenance costs involved in the work shall likewise be\nsegregated. (b) Each utility shall\nkeep its work order system so as to show the nature of each addition to or\nretirement of water plant, the total cost thereof, the source or sources of\ncosts, and the water plant account or accounts to which charged or credited. Work orders covering jobs of short duration may be cleared monthly. (c) Each utility shall maintain records in\nwhich, for each plant account, the amounts of the annual additions and\nretirements, subsequent to the effective date of this system of accounts, are\nclassified so as to show the number and cost of the various record units or\nretirement units. (d) All\ninstallations, additions, retirements, or replacements shall be covered by a\nwork order estimate and a work in progress record, which shall be supported as\nindicated in subdivisions (e) and (f) herein. Standing work orders may be used\nfor projects of less than $1,000 each, except that projects upon which interest\nduring construction is charged shall not be recorded through standing work\norders. These limits may be modified by order of the commission when warranted\nby particular circumstances. (e) The work order estimate shall include the following particulars: (1)\nA designation number or letter and the\nsignature of the officer or employee who authorized the work or purchase. If\nauthorization is by the board of directors or other body, the proper officer\nshall so state over his signature. (2)\nA description and the location of the\nwork to be done (or the purchase to be made), stating the reasons which\nnecessitated the work, and the dates between which such work (or purchase) is\nto be accomplished. For each project of which interest during construction is\ncharged, the date when completed and the date when placed in operation shall be\nshown either in the work order estimate or the work in progress\nrecord. (3)\n\nDetailed estimates of\nthe cost of the project to be supported by maps, plans, diagrams, specifications, etc., as applicable. (4)\n\nThe account or accounts to which the cost\nof the project is chargeable and the amount chargeable to each\naccount. (5)\n\nAny variations between\nestimates and actual cost of the project. (6)\n\nWhen a project involves changes in\nexisting property, either the work order estimate or the work in progress\nrecord shall show the year or installation of the property retired or otherwise\naffected and shall show or refer to other records which cover the book cost\n(estimated if not known, and the basis of the estimate to be stated) and the\nname and page of the accounting and engineering books and records covering such\ninstallation and the cost thereof. (f) The work in progress record shall contain\nthe following particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter which shall correspond to the number or letter of the work\norder estimate covering the same project. When more than one such work in\nprogress record covers the work on a work order estimate, each shall be\nnumbered or lettered in such manner as to be readily identifiable with the work\norder estimate for the same project. (2)\n\nThe accumulated charges applicable to\neach particular job or project, the total cost of the completed project, and\nthe cost of removal shall be shown. When any project involves charges to more\nthan one water plant account, the work in progress record shall be kept so as\nto show the amount chargeable to each account. Every charge or credit on work\nin progress records shall refer to the voucher, journal, or other source from\nwhich the entry therein was made. (3)\n\nFull details at any time of the amount\ncarried in account 107, Construction Work in Progress--Water or account 108.1, Retirement Work in Progress, as applicable. The cost of completed projects\nshall be promptly transferred from those accounts to the accounts to which\nchargeable. Upon coming into service, completed portions involving additions to\naccounts shall be transferred to the appropriate account although other\nportions of the work covered by the same work order are not yet completed and\nthe work order has not been closed. Credits for such transfers shall be made in\nseparate columns. Note A:Requirement of the use of the work order system\nhere outlined may be suspended by order of the commission in the case of a\nutility which satisfies the commission that the system which it has in use for\nrecording changes in water plant accounts gives the equivalent detail by\naccounts in substantially the same form. The identification of expenditures\nwith property must be complete and clear, and the detail of the cost of each\nproject or job must be readily available. The total of the uncompleted projects\nmust also be in agreement with account 107, Construction Work in\n\nProgress--Water, or subaccount 108.1, Retirement Work in Progress, as\napplicable. Note B:The work order system is required to record\nchanges in water plant used wholly or partly in water operations. Its use is\nrecommended, however, in recording other expenditures, such as for plant in\nother departments, repairs, etc. When used for repairs, balances applicable\nthereto shall be cleared monthly to the appropriate accounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n563.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
