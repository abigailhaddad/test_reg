  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.48 - Grand Slam wager\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Commission\napproval. An association or corporation must obtain written approval from the\ncommission for the initial scheduling or specific performances of Grand Slam\nraces or any other name used to characterize this bet type, and identify the\npari-mutuel pool and any required distribution percentages. Changes to the\napproved Grand Slam format, or suspension of previously approved Grand Slam\nwagering, require prior written approval from the commission. (b) Grand Slam pools. (1)\n\nThe Grand Slam requires selection of the\nofficial first, second or third-place finisher in each of the first three races\nin a series of four designated Grand Slam races in a single day. A completed\nwinning Grand Slam wager requires the selection of the official first place\nfinisher in the fourth and final event in this same series of races. The Grand\n\nSlam wager is classified as an exotic bet and is subject to the prevailing\nexotic takeout rate set forth in section 318 of the Racing Pari-Mutuel Wagering\nand Breeding Law (between 20 to 30 percent of total deposits in pools resulting\nfrom on-track exotic bets and selected by an association or corporation and\napproved by the commission). (2)\n\nThe Grand Slam pool shall be apportioned under the following method: (i) The net Grand Slam pool shall be\ndistributed from a single betting pool to participants who selected the first, second or third-place finisher in the first three races of a series of four\n\nGrand Slam races completing a winning wager with the selection of the first\nplace finisher in the fourth and final Grand Slam event in this same series, based upon the official order of finish. (ii)\n\nIf there are no winning wagers taking\ninto account all four segments of the Grand Slam wager, then the pool shall be\ndistributed as a single betting pool to those who selected the first place\nfinisher in the fourth and final Grand Slam event in this series of races along\nwith the greatest number of first, second or third-place finishes each of which\nhad an accompanying show pari-mutuel payout, in each of the first three races\nin the series of four designated Grand Slam races. All results are based upon\nthe official order of finish for each race. (3)\n\nIf there is a dead heat for first in any\nof the Grand Slam segments involving: (i) Official program numbered horses representing the same betting interest, then\nthe Grand Slam pool shall be distributed as if no dead heat occurred. (ii)\n\nOfficial program numbered horses\nrepresenting two or more betting interests, then the Grand Slam pool shall be\ndistributed from a single betting pool with a winning wager including each\nbetting interest participating in the dead heat provided each entrant has a\npari-mutuel show payout within its race. (4)\n\nIf there is a dead heat for second and/or\nthird in any of the first three races in a series of four designated Grand Slam\ncontests involving: (i) Horses representing\nthe same betting interest, then the Grand Slam pool shall be distributed as if\nno dead heat occurred. (ii)\n\nHorses\nrepresenting two or more betting interests, then the Grand Slam pool shall be\ndistributed from a single betting pool with a winning wager including the\nbetting interest which finished first or any betting interest involved in the\ndead heat for second or third providing the horse has a show pari-mutuel\npayout. (5)\n\nShould a\nbetting interest in any of the Grand Slam contests be scratched: (i) The actual favorite, as evidenced by\ntotal amounts wagered in the Win pool at the host association for the contest\nat the close of wagering on that contest, shall be substituted for the\nscratched betting interest for all purposes, including pool calculations. In\nthe event that the Win pool total for two or more favorites is identical, the\nsubstitute selection shall be the betting interest with the greatest amount of\nmoney in the place pool. The totalisator shall produce reports showing each of\nthe wagering combinations with substituted betting interests that became\nwinners as a result of the substitution, in addition to the normal winning\ncombination. (ii)\n\nShould a scratch\nor scratches occur in any of the first three races in a series of four\ndesignated Grand Slam contests and subsequently show wagering is cancelled due\nto an insufficient number of remaining betting interests, this race for winning\n\nGrand Slam wagering purposes would include the win and place horse\nonly. (6)\n\nIf at least\ntwo contests included as part of a Grand Slam wager are canceled or declared\n\"no contest\", then the Grand Slam pool shall be canceled and all Grand Slam\nwagers for the individual performance shall be refunded. (7)\n\nIf at least one race included as part of\na Grand Slam wager is canceled or declared \"no contest\", but not more than the\nnumber specified in paragraph (6) of this section, then the net pool shall be\ndistributed from a single betting pool to those bettors whose selections\nfinished first, second or third in the greatest number of Grand Slam contests\nin the first three races in a series of four designated Grand Slam contests. In\ndetermining a pari-mutuel distribution under this section, a finish of first in\nthe final and fourth designated Grand Slam contest race for the performance in\nquestion shall have the same weight as a finish of first, second or third in\nthe greatest number of Grand Slam contests in the first three races in a series\nof four designated Grand Slam contests. (8)\n\nProviding information to any person\nregarding covered combinations, amounts wagered on specific combinations, number of tickets sold, or number of live tickets remaining prior to the third\nsegment of the wager being made official is strictly prohibited. This shall not\nprohibit necessary communication between totalisator and pari-mutuel department\nemployees for processing of pool data. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
