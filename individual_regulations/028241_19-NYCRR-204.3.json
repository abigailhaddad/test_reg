  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 204.3 - Facility operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Plan of operations. Every\nnatural organic reduction facility shall maintain a written plan describing the\nprocess it uses for natural organic reduction and shall follow that plan. The\nplan shall specify and describe: (1)\nthe\nprocedures to ensure the accurate identification of remains, including\nassigning a unique natural organic reduction identification number to the\nremains, accurately and legibly labelling the outside of each container or\nvessel, and placing a non-compostable identification tag with the remains in\neach container or vessel, bearing the decedent's name and natural organic\nreduction identification number, throughout the natural organic reduction\nprocess; (2)\na process flow diagram\nof the entire process, including all major equipment and flow\nstreams; (3)\nthe processing\nduration, including the time period from acceptance of remains to completion of\nthe natural organic reduction process and delivery of the naturally organically\nreduced remains; (4)\nvessel\nspecifications and dimensions, including width, length, height, and\nmaterials; (5)\nthe bulking agents\nadded to the vessel to be used in the process of natural organic\nreduction; (6)\nthe storage\nfacilities used for bulking agents; (7)\nthe procedure for reducing (including\ncomposting, turning, and adding additional air, water, or other materials) and\nprocessing remains; (8)\nthe\nprocedures for pathogen reduction and vector attraction reduction; (9)\nthe procedures for accurately measuring\nand recording the temperature and any other necessary data of the\nremains; (10)\nprocedures to be\nfollowed if the resulting reduced remains do not satisfy the pathogen or\npollutant testing requirements in section\n204.8\nof this Part; (11)\nthe methods that will be used to prevent\nrun-on from entering and run-off from leaving the site and preventing the\nmovement of organic matter into the soil under the site; (12)\nthe method that will be used to\ndetermine product maturity, including proposed standards for maturity and the\nmonitoring methods or other means that will be used to measure\nmaturity; (13)\nhow the natural\norganic reduction facility will comply with article 15 of the N-PCL and this\n\nPart; (14)\nthe storage and\nreceiving facility for recyclables (if applicable), residue, or other inorganic\nmaterial removed from remains; (15)\na description of the air emission collection and control equipment, if\nused; (16)\na description of the\nmethod used to prevent surface water run-off and to prevent the escape of\nleachate; (17)\na spill plan that\ndescribes how an accidental release of remains or leachate will be minimized\nand addressed; (18)\nan odor control\nand response plan that describes how odors will be controlled and monitored, and how any odor problems will be addressed; (19)\nthe method for removing naturally\norganically reduced remains from the natural organic reduction facility, including a description of how the reduced remains will be managed; and\n(20)\na sampling and analysis\nplan that describes how representative samples will be taken, how samples will\nbe managed prior to acceptance at the laboratory, and the laboratories that\nwill be used for analysis. (b) No delays in processing. Every natural organic reduction facility shall use its best efforts to begin\nthe process of natural organic reduction of remains within 24 hours of\naccepting delivery of such remains. Absent good cause, such as the need to\nconfirm the identity of the deceased human being, natural organic reduction of\nremains will commence within 48 hours after delivery is accepted. The natural\norganic reduction facility must document within the natural organic reduction\nlog an explanation for the delay if natural organic reduction commences 48\nhours after delivery of the remains is accepted. (c) Odors. Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, if any remains exhibit an objectionable odor either at delivery\nor at any time thereafter, natural organic reduction of such remains shall\ncommence as soon as possible after they have been accepted by the natural\norganic reduction facility or as soon as possible after the objectionable odor\nis first detected. (d) Remains to be rejected. Natural organic reduction facilities\nshall not accept for natural organic reduction remains: (1)\nthat have been embalmed; (2)\nthat contain a battery, battery pack, power cell, or radioactive implant; (3)\nof a person whose cause of death, including the immediate cause or as a consequence of, as recorded on the\ndecedent's death certificate, was active tuberculosis, Ebola, or a prion\ndisease such as Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease; (4)\nof a person who is known or suspected to\nhave been, at the time of their death, infected with any contagious disease\nwhich the New York State Department of Health has determined renders the\nremains unsuitable for natural organic reduction; or\n(5)\nof a person who perished in or as a\nresult of a radiologic incident or accident, unless a written release is\nprovided by the New York State or local Department of Health or other state or\nfederal agency in charge of the response to the radiological incident or\naccident. (e) Removal of container. Remains must be placed within the vessel\nin a natural organic reduction container. Once the remains are in the vessel, the natural organic reduction facility operator may remove the container so\nlong as the remains are covered with bulking agents or other organic material\nfor natural organic reduction as the container is removed, to prevent exposing\nthe remains. (f) Weight. No natural organic reduction facility may impose a\ncharge for the natural organic reduction of the remains of a deceased human\nbeing based on the combined weight of the remains and any outer wrapper, container or permitted incidental material. A natural organic reduction\nfacility may refuse to accept remains that are too large, either by weight, volume, or height, for its vessels. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
