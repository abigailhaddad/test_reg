  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 93.5 - Records and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach life insurer engaging in the aircraft reinsurance business shall maintain accounting records which adequately reflect the operations of its aircraft reinsurance line of business in a manner similar to that of a fire or casualty insurer doing the same kind of business. Such records shall distinguish, as reasonably practical, between the reinsurance of conventional aircraft and space vehicles. In this respect Insurance Department Regulation 33 (11 NYCRR\n90-91\n) will be applicable to the allocation of expenses to such line of business. Each life insurer engaging in such business shall report to the superintendent in such manner and at such times as the superintendent may hereafter prescribe with respect to this line of business and the funds applied thereto. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n93.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
