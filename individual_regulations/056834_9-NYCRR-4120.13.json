Tit. 9 § 4120.13 - TCO2 blood gas testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncommission may obtain pre-race blood samples from horses for subsequent testing\nfor total carbon dioxide level (TCO2). The commission may also obtain post-race\nblood samples from horses for subsequent testing for TCO2, after a minimum\none-hour standing at rest period for the horse after such horse's race. It\nshall be a violation of this section where the horse's TCO2 level equals or\nexceeds 37 millimoles per liter or, for horses administered furosemide pursuant\nto section\n4120.2\n(b)(6)\nof\nthis Part during the four hours before the blood sample was taken, 39\nmillimoles per liter. (b) It shall\nbe an affirmative defense that the horse's physiologically natural TCO2 level\nwas not exceeded. To demonstrate natural TCO2, such horse's owner or trainer\nmust make a written request to the judges, within three calendar days of\nreceiving notice of the horse's TCO2 test result, that the horse be held in\nguarded quarantine for this purpose. The racetrack operator shall make\navailable a three-day guarded quarantine for a time determined by the presiding\njudge, not to exceed 72 hours, at the sole expense of the requesting party, where blood samples shall be periodically taken for subsequent testing by the\ncommission. If the owner or trainer properly arranges with the commission in\nadvance, then samples shall also be taken and sent for independent testing at\nanother laboratory at the sole expense of the requesting party. During\nquarantine the horse shall not race, but it may be exercised and trained at\nprescribed times that do not interfere with monitoring, sampling, and testing\nthe horse. After the quarantine, the presiding judge shall determine whether\nthe horse's TCO2 level was physiologically natural for it. The presiding judge\nmay also require, at least 45 days later, that the horse re-establish such\nhorse's natural TCO2 level with another guarded quarantine to be made available\nat the sole expense of the racetrack operator. (c) Any guarded quarantine provided by the\nracetrack operator shall ensure that, at a minimum: (1)\nsuch horse shall be under direct\nsurveillance by at least one guard at all times; (2)\naccess to the horse shall be restricted\nto licensed persons who are directly affiliated with such horse, judges, or\nemployees of the commission, all of whom shall provide their respective track\nidentification badge or commission-issued photo identification card prior to\nentry; (3)\na written or electronic\nlog of all persons who have had access to the horse shall be maintained by the\nguard, indicating the name and license number or track identification badge\nnumber of the person, the date and time of the visit (including time in and out\nof the restricted area), the nature and purpose of the visit, a description of\nany and all equipment, paraphernalia, tack, medications, or feed brought to the\nhorse, and all activity observed by the guard during the visit; and\n(4)\nthe racetrack operator shall maintain\nsuch written or electronic logs of guarded quarantine activity for a minimum\nperiod of 90 days after the conclusion of the applicable guarded quarantine\nperiod. (d) The penalty\nfor violations of this rule shall be not less than: (1)\nfor a first violation, a 60-day license\nsuspension and $1,000 fine; (2)\nfor\na second violation, a 75-day license suspension and $2,500 fine; and\n(3)\nfor additional violations, a one-year\nsuspension and $5,000 fine together with a referral to the commission for\nfurther action including a possible license revocation. Where independent evidence shows that the horse was\ntreated within 24 hours of its race by means not permitted by section\n4120.2\nof this Part, however, every\nlicense suspension shall be for at least two years. Every suspension shall\ninclude denial of the privileges of the grounds. (e) For a violation of this rule, a horse\nshall be disqualified, any purse monies shall be forfeited and redistributed\npursuant to section\n4120.5\nof this Part, and the horse\nshall be subject to pre-race detention, and shall be ineligible to race until\nits tests in compliance with this rule and tests negative for drugs.
