  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.155 - Welded branch connections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nwelded branch connection made to pipe in the form of a single connection, or in\na header or manifold as a series of connections, must be designed to ensure\nthat the strength of the pipeline system is not reduced, taking into account\nthe stresses in the remaining pipe wall due to the opening in the pipe or\nheader, the shear stresses produced by the pressure acting on the area of the\nbranch opening, and any external loadings due to thermal movement, weight, and\nvibration. (b) The reinforcement\nrequired in a welded branch connection shall be determined by the rule that the\nmetal area available for reinforcement shall be equal to or greater than the\nrequired area as defined in Rules for Reinforcement of Welded Branch\n\nConnections and examples 1 and 2 in Appendix 14- G of this Title. (c) If a reinforcement member is required, and the branch diameter is such that a localized type of reinforcement member\nwould extend around more than half the circumference of the header, then a\ncomplete encirclement type of reinforcement member shall be used, regardless of\nthe design hoop stress, or a smoothly contoured wrought steel tee of proven\ndesign may be used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.155\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
