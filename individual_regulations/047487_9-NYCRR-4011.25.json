  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.25 - Pick-five pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Description. A winning pick-five wager requires selection of the\nfirst-place finisher in each of five designated, consecutive contests, unless\notherwise provided in this section. The track operator must obtain written\napproval from the commission concerning the scheduling of pick-five contests, the designation of the method used and the amount of any cap to be set on the\ncarryover. Any changes to the approved pick-five format require prior approval\nfrom the commission. (b) Separate wager. The pick-five wager is not a parlay and has no\nconnection or relation to the other betting pools for the respective races. The\npick-five pool shall be held entirely separate from all other pools and is no\npart of a daily double, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta or other\nwagering pool. (c) No resale. Resale of pick-five tickets from one individual to\nanother is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection, and may be deemed illegal\ngambling. (d) Clear\ndesignation. Races in which pick-five pools shall be conducted\nshall be clearly designated in the program and racing cards issued by the\nassociation or corporation. (e) Ticket design. The design of the pick-five tickets shall be clearly\nand immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (f) Scratched\nhorses and nonstarters. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared\na nonstarter in any pick-five race before the start of the first pick-five\nrace, any affected bettor may select another betting interest, if the wager can\nbe canceled and a replacement wager issued before the start of the first\npick-five race, or may obtain a cancellation of the wager prior to the start of\nthe first race of the pick-five sequence. If neither option is exercised, then\nwagers upon such scratched or declared nonstarter shall be deemed wagers upon\nthe designated horse for such race. The\ndesignated horse\nmeans\nthe betting entry or field upon which the most wagering money has been\nregistered at the track in the win pool at the close of win-pool betting for\nsuch race. (In the event of a money tie, the tied betting entry or field with\nthe lowest program number shall be designated.) At any time after wagering\nbegins on the pick-five pool, should an entire betting entry or field be\nscratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick-five race, no further tickets\nselecting such betting entry or field shall be issued, and wagers upon such\nbetting entry or field, for purposes of the pick-five pool, shall be deemed\nwagers upon the designated horse. Wagers in the pick-five pool upon an entry or\nfield of horses from which a starter or starters may have been scratched will, in the case of such entry or field, be deemed wagers upon the horse or horses\nremaining in such entry or field. In case no starter remains representing any\nbetting entry or field, wagers upon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers\nupon the designated horse in the race affected by the scratch. Should the\nbalance of a betting entry or field race as a non-betting starter for purposes\nof other pari-mutuel pools, as provided in sections\n4009.20\nand\n4009.21\nof this Article, wagers\nupon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for\nsuch race. (g) Wagering\ntickets and winners. If neither subdivision (h) nor subdivision (i) of\nthis section applies, then the pick-five pool shall be apportioned, with the\nprior written approval of the commission following the request of track\noperator offering this wager, pursuant to either paragraph (1) or (2) of this\nsubdivision, as follows: (1)\nthe net\npick-five pool and carryover, if any, shall be distributed as a single price\npool to those who selected the first-place finisher in each of the pick-five\ncontests, based on the official order of finish, unless otherwise provided in\nthis section. If there are no such wagers, the net pick-five pool shall be\nadded to the carryover; or\n(2)\nthe\nnet pick-five pool and carryover, if any, shall be distributed as a single\nprice pool to those who selected the first-place finisher in each of the\npick-five contests, based on the official order of finish, or to the holders of\nwagers selecting the first-place finisher in each of the pick-five contests\nwith no more than one all-win race, unless otherwise provided in this\nparagraph. Should there be no wager selecting winners of all five designated\nraces or no wager selecting the winners of the designated races with no more\nthan one all-win race, then 25 percent of the net pool, excluding carryover\nfrom the previous program, shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of\nwagers selecting the winners of the most pick-five races and 75 percent of the\nnet pool shall be added to the carryover. In addition to the net-pool share and\nany carry-overs distributable when a wager correctly selects winners of all\nfive designated races, or four winners and no more than one all-win race of a\npick-five pool, there shall be distributed by the track operator from its own\nfunds, upon such occurrence, any amounts the track operator has advertised that\nthe track operator will add to the total distribution. (h) Race cancellations. Except for pick-five pools in which a designated\ndistribution is to be made, the following shall apply: (1)\n\nIf one or two of the pick-five races are\ncancelled or declared no race or non-betting, then those who selected the\nwinners of other pick-five races shall share the net pool. Any carryover from\nprevious programs will be carried over to the next pick-five wager pool. If\nthere are no such wagers and the track operator has selected the pick-five\nwagering option set forth in paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of this section, 25 percent of the net pick-five pool, excluding any carryover from previous\nprograms, shall be distributed, less breaks, as a single price pool to those\nwho selected the first-place finisher in the greatest number of pick-five\nraces, and 75 percent shall be added to the carryover. (2)\n\nIf more than two of the pick-five races\nare cancelled or declared no race or non-betting, then the entire pool shall be\ncancelled and all pick-five wagers shall be refunded. (3)\n\nIf any of the designated races of the\npick-five sequence is cancelled or declared no race or non-betting before the\nfirst pick-five race is made official, then the pick-five pool shall be\ndeclared off and the gross pool refunded. (i) Surface transfer. When the condition of a turf course warrants a\nchange of racing surface to a non-turf course in any of the pick-five races, and such change has not been known to the public before the close of wagering\nfor the pick-five pool, then such changed race shall be deemed an all win race\nfor pick-five wagering purposes. An all-win race means the winning horse of\nthat race is assigned to each pick-five bettor as such bettor's selection for\nthat race. Except for pick-five pools in which a final distribution is to be\nmade, a pick-five pool with surface transfer(s) shall be handled as\nfollows: (1)\n\nIf there was a surface\nchange to a non-turf course in only one of the pick-five races, then the\nbettors who selected the winners of the four pick-five races for which there\nwere no surface changes shall share that day's net pool for such wager as well\nas any carryover. If there are no such wagers and the track operator has\nselected the pick-five wagering option set forth in paragraph (2) of\nsubdivision (g) of this section, 25 percent of the net pick-five pool, excluding any carryover from previous programs, shall be distributed, less\nbreaks, as a single price pool to those who selected the first-place finisher\nin the greatest number of pick-five races, and 75 percent shall be added to the\ncarryover. (2)\n\nIf there was a\nsurface change to a non-turf course in more than one of the pick-five races, then the bettors who selected the winners of all the other pick-five races\nshall share that day's net pool for such wager but shall not share any\ncarryover (any such previous carryover to be carried over to the next\nperformance's pick-five wager pool). If there are no such wagers and the track\noperator has selected the pick-five wagering option pursuant to paragraph (2)\nof subdivision (g) of this section, 25 percent of the net pick-five pool, excluding any carryover from previous programs, shall be distributed, less\nbreaks, as a single price pool to those who selected the first-place finisher\nin the greatest number of pick-five races, and 75 percent shall be added to the\ncarryover. (3)\n\nIf there are one or\nmore surface change races in the pick-five sequence, and there are no bettors\nwho selected the winner(s) of all the other pick-five races, then: (i) if the track operator has selected the\npick-five wagering option set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (g) of this\nsection, the net pool for such program shall be carried over to the next\nperformance's pick-five wager pool; or\n(ii)\nif the track operator has selected the\npick-five wagering option pursuant to paragraph (2) of subdivision (g) of this\nsection, 25 percent of the net pick-five pool, excluding any carryover from\nprevious programs, shall be distributed, less breaks, as a single price pool to\nthose who selected the first-place finisher in the greatest number of pick-five\nraces, and 75 percent shall be added to the carryover. (4)\n\nIf there are one or more surface change\nraces in the pick-five sequence and there are no bettors who selected the\nwinner of any of the other pick-five races, then the entire pool for such\nprogram shall be refunded. (j) Dead heats. If there is a dead heat for first in any of the\npick-five contests involving: (1)\ncontestants representing the same betting interest, then the pick-five pool\nshall be distributed as if no dead heat occurred; or\n(2)\ncontestants representing two or more\nbetting interests, then the pick-five pool shall be distributed as a single\nprice pool with each winning wager receiving an equal share of the\nprofit. (k) Carryovers. (1)\n\nThe pick-five carryover may be capped at\na designated level approved by the commission so that if, at the close of any\nperformance, the amount in the pick-five carryover equals or exceeds the\ndesignated cap, then the pick-five carryover will be frozen until such\ncarryover is won or distributed under the other provisions of this section. After the pick-five carryover is frozen, 100 percent of the net pool that\nordinarily would be added to the pick-five carryover shall be distributed to\nthose whose selection finished first in the greatest number of pick-five\ncontests for that performance. (2)\nA written request for permission to distribute the pick-five carryover on a\nspecific performance may be submitted to the commission. The request must\ncontain justification for the distribution, an explanation of the benefit to be\nderived and the intended date and performance for the distribution. (3)\n\nIf for any reason the pick-five carryover\nmust be held over to a subsequent meet, the carryover shall be deposited in an\ninterest-bearing account approved by the commission. The pick-five carryover\nplus accrued interest shall then be added to the net pick-five pool of the\nfollowing meet on a date and performance so designated by the\ncommission. (4)\n\nWith the written\napproval of the commission, the track operator may contribute to the pick-four\ncarryover a sum of money up to the amount of any designated cap. (l) Other designated\ndistributions. The pick-five carryover may be designated for\ndistribution on a specified date and performance, other than as a final\ndistribution, as set forth in subdivision (m) of this section, only under the\nfollowing circumstances: (1)\nupon\nwritten approval from the commission as provided in subdivision (i) of this\nsection; or\n(2)\nupon written\napproval from the commission when there is a change in the carryover cap, a\nchange from one type of pick-(n) wagering to another, or when the pick-five\npool is discontinued. If the pick-five carryover is designated for\ndistribution on a specified date and performance in which there are no wagers\nselecting the winner in each of the pick-five races, then the net pool, with\nany carryover, shall be distributed as a single-price pool to those whose\nselection finished first in the greatest number of pick-five\ncontests. (m) Final distribution. The track operator shall select, with the approval of\nthe commission, a date and program during the final week of the annual assigned\nracing dates of the track operator, and also during the year during the final\nweek of a meeting at a track after which such track operator will operate at\nanother track, when there shall be a final distribution of all accumulated\ncarryovers together with the net pool of the pick-five pool conducted during\nsuch program to the holders of wagers selecting the winners of the most\npick-five races contested during such program. If all pick-five races on the\nprogram designated for final distribution are cancelled and no further programs\nare conducted at the meeting, then no other pick-five pools shall be conducted\nduring such week and the commission shall require that a pick-five pool be\nconducted on the first program of the next race meeting conducted at such track\nby such track operator to provide for final distribution for such prior\nmeeting. The commission may also order a final distribution for an earlier time\nin the commission's discretion. (n) Suspension of wager. The\ntrack operator may suspend previously approved pick-five wagering with the\nprior approval of the commission. Any carryover shall be held until the\nsuspended pick-five wagering is reinstated. A track operator may request\napproval of a pick-five wager or separate wagering pool for specific\nperformances. (o) [\nReserved\n]\n(p) Other occurrences. In the event of occurrences not encompassed\nwithin the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall be\nformulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel practice and in accordance\nwith the distribution philosophy set forth in this section; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made on the basis of\noutstanding tickets, then the method of formulation announced by the track and\nthe basis upon which payments have been made shall be deemed conclusively\ncorrect and not subject to review. (q) Posting of winning\ncombinations. Every pick-five wagering combination entitled to a\npayoff shall be posted publicly by the track operator together with the payoff\nprice. (r) Non-transferability. Pick-five tickets shall be nontransferable, and\nviolations of this subdivision may lead to confiscation and cancellation of\nsuch tickets in addition to other disciplinary action. (s) Betting information. A track operator may display publicly information in\nregard to combinations wagered upon, amounts wagered on such combinations, numbers of tickets sold or number of tickets still capable of winning a\npick-five pool. The operation of the totalisator equipment and reports\ngenerated thereby shall be subject to the strict supervision of the\ncommission. (t) -(w)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(x) Rule availability. Copies of this section shall be made\navailable free of charge by the track operator to the public in the public\nbetting area of the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
