  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 214.12 - Omission or redaction of confidential personal information in civil actions and proceedings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except\nfor any action or proceeding arising under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, or\nprosecution of a violation of an ordinance of a city, town or village, or in a\npetition for change of name under the Civil Rights Law, or as otherwise\nprovided by rule or law or court order, and whether or not a sealing order is\nor has been sought, the parties shall omit or redact confidential personal\ninformation in papers submitted to the court for filing. For purposes of this\nrule, confidential personal information (CPI)\nmeans: (1)\nthe taxpayer identification number of an\nindividual or an entity, including a social security number, an employer\nidentification number, and an individual taxpayer identification number, except\nthe last four digits thereof; (2)\nthe date of an individual's birth, except the year thereof; (3)\nthe full name of an individual known to\nbe a minor, except the minor's initials; and\n(4)\na financial account number, including a\ncredit and/or debit card number, a bank account number, an investment account\nnumber, and/or an insurance account number, except the last four digits or\nletters thereof. (b) The\ncourt\nsua sponte\nor on motion by any person may order a party\nto remove CPI from papers or to resubmit a paper with such information\nredacted; order the clerk to seal the papers or a portion thereof containing\nCPI in accordance with the requirement of section\n216.1\nof this Title that any\nsealing be no broader than necessary to protect the CPI; for good cause permit\nthe inclusion of CPI in papers; order a party to file an unredacted copy under\nseal for in camera review; or determine that information in a particular action\nis not confidential. The court shall consider the\npro se\nstatus of any party in granting relief pursuant to this provision. (c) Where a person submitting a paper to a\ncourt for filing believes in good faith that the inclusion of the full\nconfidential personal information described in paragraphs (a)(1) to (4) of this\nsection is material and necessary to the adjudication of the action or\nproceeding before the court, he or she may apply to the court for leave to\nserve and file together with a paper in which such information has been set\nforth in abbreviated form a confidential affidavit or affirmation setting forth\nthe same information in unabbreviated form, appropriately referenced to the\npage or pages of the paper at which the abbreviated form appears. (d) The redaction requirement does not apply\nto the last four digits of the relevant account numbers, if any, in an action\narising out of a consumer credit transaction, as defined in subdivision (f) of\nsection\n105\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules. In\nthe event the defendant appears in such an action the defendant may without\nleave of court submit papers disclosing full account numbers to the extent\nnecessary to ensure that an order or judgment issued by the court contains\nproof satisfactory to a credit reporting agency. In the event the defendant\nappears in such an action and denies responsibility for the identified account, the plaintiff may without leave of court amend his or her pleading to add full\naccount or CPI by: (1)\nsubmitting such\namended paper to the court on written notice to defendant for in camera review; or\n(2)\nfiling such full account or\nother CPI under seal in accordance with rules promulgated by the chief\nadministrator of the courts.
