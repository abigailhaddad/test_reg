  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 651.5 - Definition of record media\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurpose of this Part, the data constituting the records listed in the schedule\nof records and periods of retention may be retained in any of the media forms\nin Figure 1 of this subdivision, or in any other generally accepted electronic\nor photographic media form, provided that the media selected has a standard\nlife expectancy equal to or in excess of the specified retention period. However, records supporting plant cost shall be retained in their original form\nunless microfilmed. (See section\n651.11\nof this Part for periods of\nretention.) In no instance will media regeneration to achieve the full length\nof period retention be allowed without commission approval of the request of\nthe company, which approval will be based on the condition of the record and\nits projected life expectancy. In emergency cases management shall take such\naction as prudence calls for and notify the commission thereafter. FIGURE 1-RECORD MEDIA\nRecord media/form\n\nMedia expected life\n\nComments and\nstandards\n1. Paper & card stock (hardcopy)\n\nArchival permanency\n\nFor each document, paper stock should be selected\nwith a life expectancy equal to or greater than the retention period specified\nfor that document. 2. Tape magnetic (including video tape)\n5 years\n\nAssumes storage in a controlled environment with a\ntemperature and humidity range of 60-80 degrees F and 40-60% respectively. (See\nsection\n651.8\nfor specific storage\nconditions). Punched\n\nArchival permanency\n\nFor each record, tape media (paper, mylar, metallic\nbase) should be selected with a life expectancy equal to, or greater than, the\nretention period specified for that record. 3. Microforms\na. Microfilm including Computer Output Microfilm\n(COM) microfiche jackets and aperture cards\n\nArchival permanency\n\nAssumes processing to standards and storage in a\ncontrolled environment with a temperature and humidity range of 35-77 degrees F\nand 20-50% respectively. Ref. American National Standards Institute (ANSI)\nstandards ANSI/NAPM IT9.1-1992 and ANSI IT9.11-1991. b. Updatable type\n\nDependent on use of Media\n\nFor temporary records not requiring archival\npermanency so long as the microform or film selected has a life expectancy\nequal to, or greater than, the retention period for that record. Same storage\nconditions as for microfilm. c. Metallic recording data strips\n\nArchival permanency\n\nSame storage conditions as for microfilm. (b) If the media form of the record retained\nis other than a readable paper copy, then reader and/or printer equipment and\nrelated printout programs, if required, shall be provided by the utility for\ndata reference. (c) The media form\ninitially selected for the record becomes the \"original\" for that particular\nrecord. If subsequent conditions (\ne.g., improved media life\nexpectancy, increased utility resources, environmental factors) require and the\nremaining retention period permits a change in the media forms, the utility may\nconvert to another media, provided the certification processes described in\nsection\n651.6\nof this Part are observed\nand data referencing capability is maintained. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n651.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
