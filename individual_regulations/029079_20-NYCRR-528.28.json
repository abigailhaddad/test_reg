  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.28 - Tangible personal property donated to exempt organizations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(1)\n(a) Tangible personal property donated to an\nexempt organization described in section\n529.2, 529.3, 529.4, 529.6, 529.7, 529.8, 529.9\nor\n529.10\nof this Title is exempt from sales and use taxes provided that: (1)\nthe property is manufactured, processed\nor assembled by the donor; and\n(2)\nthe manufacturer, processor or assembler offers items of the same kind of\ntangible personal property for sale in the regular course of business; and\n(3)\nthe manufacturer, processor\nor assembler has not made any other use of the tangible personal property which\nis donated. Example 1: On December 5, 1988, a company that manufactures and sells\ncomputers to retail computer stores donates several computers to a New York\n\nState public school, an exempt organization under section\n529.2\nof this Title. The computers were, prior to being donated, held in inventory\nand were not used for any other purpose. Since the company offers the computers\nfor sale during the regular course of business and made no use of the computers\nbefore they were donated to the public school, the company may make the\ndonation without incurring sales or use tax liability. Cross-reference: For definition of the terms \"items of the same kind\" and\n\"offered for sale in the regular course of business,\" see section\n531.3\n(b) of this Title. (b) The donation of tangible personal\nproperty by an individual, retailer, wholesaler or other person, who did not\nmanufacture, process or assemble the donated property and who has not already\npaid sales or use tax on the donated property is generally subject to sales or\nuse tax. The tax is to be paid by the donor. Example 2: On December 5, 1988, a proprietor of a retail computer\nstore, who bought computers for resale, donated five of these computers to a\n\nNew York State public school, an exempt organization under section\n529.2\nof this Title. Although the proprietor offers the computers for sale in the\nregular course of business and made no use of the computers before they were\ndonated to the public school, the vendor is not the manufacturer, processor or\nassembler of the equipment. Accordingly, the proprietor owes tax on the\ndonation of the computers. (c) Nothing in this subdivision shall be\nconstrued to allow a refund or credit of sales or use tax properly paid by the\ndonor on the donated property. Example 3: A manufacturer of computers withdrew one of its computers\nfrom inventory for use in its own office operations. As the manufacturer used\nthe computer itself, the manufacturer was properly liable for and paid use tax\non its use of the computer. Subsequently, the manufacturer donated the computer\nto an exempt organization described in section\n529.7\nof this Title. As the manufacturer properly paid tax at the time of self-use of\nthe computer, the manufacturer is not allowed a credit or refund of the tax\nproperly paid, even though the computer was donated to the exempt organization. No additional sales or use tax is due at the time of the\ndonation. (d) Tangible\npersonal property purchased and used by a manufacturer, processor or assembler\nin performing services described in sections\n527.4\nand\n527.5\nof this Title (such as processing, installing, maintaining and repairing of\ntangible personal property) and donated to an exempt organization described in\nsubdivision (a) of this section is not exempt from sales or use tax. Thus, the\nmanufacturer, processor or assembler must pay the applicable tax. But where the\nmanufacturer, processor or assembler uses tangible personal property which it\nmanufactured, processed or assembled in conjunction with performing such\nservices (without having made any prior use of such property), the donation of\nsuch property in conjunction with performing such services is exempt. (e) Services performed by the manufacturer, processor or assembler (donor) on qualifying tangible personal property which\nit donated to an exempt organization are not subject to tax, whether or not the\ndonor charges the donee for the services. Where the donor charges the donee, the purchase of the donor's services is exempt because the donee is an exempt\norganization, provided that the donee gives the donor a properly completed\nexempt-organization certificate. Where the donor does not charge the donee, the\nwages, salaries and other compensation paid by the donor to its employees in\nconjunction with performing the services on the exempt donated tangible\npersonal property are not subject to tax. But where the donor purchases such\nservices from a third party to be performed on the donated property, then the\ndonor is liable for sales or use tax on the amounts it paid to purchase such\nservices. The charges to the donor for any replacement parts which do not\nqualify for the exemption described in subdivision (a) of this section are also\ntaxable to the donor. Example 4: A manufacturer of photocopy machines donates a photocopier\nto an exempt organization described in section\n529.7\nof this Title. The manufacturer hires a subcontractor to perform maintenance\nand repairs on the copier. Upon completion of the maintenance or repair work, the subcontractor directly bills the manufacturer/donor. These charges to the\ndonor for its purchase of such services are subject to applicable sales or use\ntax. Example 5: Assume that the photocopy machine manufacturer in Example 4\nuses its own employees to perform maintenance and repairs, rather than hiring a\nsubcontractor to perform the services. While the salaries, wages and other\ncompensation paid to the donor's employees are not subject to tax, any supplies\nand any replacement parts that do not qualify for exemption under section\n528.28\n(a) of this Part are subject to tax.
