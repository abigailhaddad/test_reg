  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.12 - Geosynthetic drainage layers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Geosynthetic drainage layers must comply with the following. (1)\n\nAny geosynthetic drainage layers designed\nfor use in a groundwater suppression system or a leachate collection and\nremoval system must meet the structural and hydraulic transmissivity design\nrequirements using actual boundary conditions at the maximum adjusted design\nload for a minimum period of 100 hours, modified to take into consideration the\nlong-term conditions for creep representative of site conditions, and other\nreduction factors. (i) For hydraulic flow\ncapacity calculations, the design engineer must use a factor of safety of at\nleast three, and consider the reduction in transmissivity due to creep, biological clogging, and chemical clogging. (ii)\n\nThe chemical and physical resistance of\nthe geosynthetic drainage material must be adequate so that its hydraulic\ntransmissivity is not adversely affected by waste placement or\nleachate. (2)\n\nAny\ngeosynthetic drainage layers designed for use in a final cover system for\neither drainage or gas venting must meet the transmissivity design requirements\nusing actual boundary conditions at the maximum adjusted design load for a\nminimum period of 100 hours, and appropriate reduction factors and must\nconsider any proposed landfill end use structures. (i) For hydraulic flow capacity calculations, the design engineer must use a factor safety of at least three. (ii)\n\nThe hydraulic design of the geosynthetic\ndrainage layer should be performed using the saturated hydraulic conductivity\nof the barrier protection layer. (b) Construction requirements. (1)\n\nGeosynthetic drainage layers must not be\nseamed or fastened horizontally more than once per length of side slope. If\nhorizontal seams are necessary, they must be staggered between adjacent rolls. The geosynthetic drainage layers must be seamed or fastened together in\naccordance with industry standards. (2)\n\nThe geosynthetic drainage layer must be\ninstalled in accordance with the procedures set forth in paragraphs\n363-6.8(b)(2) through (4) and subparagraph 363-6.8(b)(5)(iii) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nIf a geosynthetic\ndrainage layer is specified in the primary leachate collection and removal\nsystem, a 24-inch soil drainage layer is required which meets the minimum\nrequirements of section\n363-6.10\nof this Subpart. (4)\n\nIf a geosynthetic drainage layer is\nspecified in the secondary leachate collection and removal system, a 12-inch\nsoil drainage layer which meets the requirements of section\n363-6.10\nof this Subpart is\nrequired in all areas where the liner slope is less than ten percent. (5)\n\nAll rolls of geosynthetic drainage\nmaterials received and stored at the landfill must be enclosed in protective\nwrapping, such as the original, unopened packaging or an opaque tarpaulin, to\nensure protection from direct sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, temperatures in\nexcess of 160° F and below 32° F, mud, debris and other deleterious\nmaterials, and any other environmental condition that may damage the physical\nproperty values of the material. The storage location must be stable, dry, and\nwell-drained. The surface on which the material is stored must be free of sharp\nobjects. Rolls of geosynthetic drainage material must not be stored in stacks\nmore than three tiers high. Extended outdoor storage of geosynthetic drainage\nmaterials must not exceed manufacturer's recommendations or nine months, whichever is less. For storage periods longer than manufacturer's\nrecommendations or nine months, rolls must be stored off the ground under an\nadditional cover or tarpaulin beyond the manufacturer's wrapping or placed in\nan enclosed structure. (c) Certification requirements. The project\nengineer must certify the following information as part of certification. (1)\n\nResults of applicable geosynthetic\nquality control testing required in paragraph 363-6.8(c)(1) of this Subpart. (2)\n\nResults of hydraulic\ntransmissivity testing performed in a laboratory in accordance with subdivision\n363-6.12\n(a) of\nthis Part including confirmation that the head within the leachate collection\nand removal layer will remain less than the thickness of that layer for the\ndesign flow of 1,000 gallons per acre per day in the secondary leachate\ncollection and removal system is met. (3)\n\nThat the construction quality assurance\nstaff have performed visual inspections for any depressions or irregularities\non all installed products. (4)\n\nThat\npost-construction care procedures were carried out to protect the geosynthetic\ndrainage layer from the intrusion of fines related to water-borne and\nwind-borne sedimentation.
