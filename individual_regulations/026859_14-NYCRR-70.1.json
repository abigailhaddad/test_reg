  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 70.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is\nintended to establish an all-inclusive set of categories, named classes, to\nwhich all providers of services to the mentally disabled subject to the\nrequirement to obtain an operating certificate from the Commissioner of Mental\n\nHygiene will be assigned, for purposes of determining compliance with the most\nappropriate standards of operation and construction pursuant to the issuing of\nan operating certificate. (1)\nA provider of\nservices which has been issued an operating certificate to engage in the\noperation of any facility may designate itself or that facility to the public\nby any term it chooses, except that no such designation shall denote any class\nherein established which is not specified in the operating certificate of that\nfacility. (2)\n\nNo entity which is\nineligible to be issued an operating certificate in accordance with the Mental\n\nHygiene Law and this Title shall designate itself to the public by terms which\ndenote any class herein established or which express or imply any approval by\nthe department. (b) The\nstatutory requirement that an operating certificate be obtained by certain\nproviders of services to the mentally disabled is applicable on the basis of\nthree factors: characteristics of the persons served, characteristics of the\nservices provided, and the auspices of the provider of services. (1)\n\nThe primary basis for the requirement of\nan operating certificate is that the subject activities are conducted primarily\nor exclusively for persons who are mentally disabled, as that term is defined\nin the Mental Hygiene Law. Accordingly, those organized activities of life in\nwhich mentally disabled persons engage on the same basis as others not so\nhandicapped are not intended to be included. Also, neither those services to\npersons whose disabilities are primarily of a nature other than mental, nor\nthose services to persons whose mental problems are not so disabling as to\nconform to the definitions of mental illness, mental retardation and alcoholism\nin the Mental Hygiene Law, are intended to be included. (2)\n\nThe secondary basis for the requirement\nof an operating certificate is that the subject activities are sufficiently\nspecialized, technical and potent as to warrant their regulation in the\ninterest of their safe and effective use for the benefit of persons not\nnecessarily capable of assuring this for themselves. The issuance of an\noperating certificate is intended to signify that a provider has met minimum\nstandards for conditions conducive to safe and effective operation and to\nestablish the accountability of the provider for operation in accordance with\nthose standards. Accordingly, any activities however well-intended which\nrequire no expertise and are free of risk are not intended to be\nincluded. (3)\n\nThe tertiary basis\nfor the requirement of an operating certificate is that the subject activities\nare not subject to comparable regulation, in accordance with statutes other\nthan the Mental Hygiene Law, as administered by agencies other than the\n\nDepartment of Mental Hygiene. Accordingly, the private practice of a\nprofession, whether on an individual, partnership or corporate basis, whereby\noutpatient or nonresidential services to the mentally disabled are provided, is\nnot intended to be included if that practice is authorized in accordance with\nappropriate professional licensure or certification and registration under the\n\nEducation Law. Also, institutions of learning chartered or established in\naccordance with the Education Law, whose students provide services to the\nmentally disabled incidental to a curriculum of education and training in\nprofessional disciplines, are not intended to be included. (c) Providers of services to the mentally\ndisabled which are issued an operating certificate by the Commissioner of\n\nMental Hygiene nevertheless remain subject to all applicable Federal, State and\nlocal laws, regulations and ordinances. In those matters which are subject to\nmore than one jurisdiction or regulatory requirement, the most strict\nprovisions shall apply. In the event that any other legal requirements are\ncontradictory to those in the Mental Hygiene Law or this Title, it is incumbent\nupon the certificate holder to bring this information to the attention of the\ndepartment.
