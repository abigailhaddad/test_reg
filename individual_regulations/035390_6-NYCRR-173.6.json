Such care must\ninclude at a minimum all of the following: (1)\n\nIndoor facilities (mews) will include: (i) inside dimensions not less than eight\nfeet in each direction. In no case shall small wire bird cages sold in pet\nstores for smaller birds be used to house raptors; (ii)\ninterior surfaces containing no beams, ledges, or other protrusions on which the raptors might injure themselves, unless raptors are to be maintained tethered; (iii)\nat least one window, with vertical bars\nor rods on the inside, spaced narrower than the width of the bird's body, on\nthe south or east portion of the mews, of sufficient size to pass sunlight and\nventilation sufficient to maintain the raptors in good health. The outside of\nthe windows should be covered with a screen or 1/4\" or 1/2\" hardware cloth\n(wire) to prevent entrance of rats or weasels; (iv)\nat least one door to permit easy access\nand cleaning of facilities. If such door opens directly to the out-of-doors, it\nshall have a shield or another door on the inside to prevent escape of the\nraptor, and shall be key-locked and have a spring or hook on the inside to keep\nit closed; (v) floor surface which\nshall permit easy cleaning and shall be well drained; (vi)\na perch, of such size, strength, and\nconstruction as to permit the raptors to grip and hold it with their talons\nsafely and in a manner in keeping with the birds' perching habits in the wild; and\n(vii)\na pan of clean water for\neach raptor. (2)\n\nOutdoor\nfacilities will include: (i) sufficient space\nto allow tethered raptors to bate (attempt flight) without striking wings on\nthe sides or top of the facility; and\n(ii)\nsides and top of facility enclosed with\nmaterial suitable to exclude predators. (3)\n\nEnvironmental protection will include: (i) maintenance of facility temperature\nwithin healthful range; (ii)\nshielding from high wind and winter storms; (iii)\nprotection from avian and ground\npredators; and\n(iv)\nprevention of\ndisturbances which would likely cause injury. (4)\n\nEquipment will include: (i) a pair of Aylmeri (style) jesses (or\nsimilar type). An Aylmeri jess consists of an anklet, grommet, and a removable\nstrap for attaching the anklet and grommet to the swivel; (ii)\na swivel which is strong enough that the\nraptor cannot break it, but not so large as to weigh the bird down or injure\nit; (iii)\na leash of quality\nleather or synthetic material; (iv)\na bath container, two to six inches deep and wider than the length of the\nraptor, for drinking and bathing, for each raptor; (v) an outdoor perch, for each raptor, of\nsuch size, strength, and construction as to permit the raptor to grip and hold\nit with its talons safely and in a manner in keeping with the birds perching\nhabits in the wild; and\n(vi)\na\nreliable weighting scale or balance graduated in increments of not more than\none half ounce (15 grams). (5)\n\nCare will include: (i) provision at all times of conditions\nsufficient for maximum health, comfort, safety, and security of the\nraptor; (ii)\nremoval of waste and\nother debris as well as soiled floor covering material as necessary to comply\nwith subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; and\n(iii)\nmaintenance of the raptor facilities\nand equipment in a state of complete repair at all times. (b) A falconer may designate in\nwriting another person to care for the falconer's raptor(s) in the event that\nthe falconer is absent or in an emergency. If the period of care will exceed 30\ndays, the falconer must notify and obtain the department's prior approval and\ninform the department in writing of where the bird is to be held, who is to\ncare for it, and approximately how many days it is to be in the care of the\nsecond person. (c) A falconer may\nhouse their raptor(s) on property owned by another where the falconer resides, or at a different location. (1)\n\nRegardless of\nlocation, the facilities must meet the standards of this section. (2)\n\nThe falconer must submit a signed and\ndated statement showing that the falconer or the property owner agrees that the\nfalconry facilities, equipment, and raptors may be inspected without advance\nnotice by the department at any reasonable time of day. Inspections must be in\nthe presence of the licensee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n173.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
