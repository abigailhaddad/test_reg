  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4045.4 - Administrative action\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission shall take the following administrative\naction after a final adjudication of the commission establishes that a licensee\nhas committed a precipitating equine drug rule violation in New York: (a) The commission shall calculate the points\napplicable to such licensee to determine whether to take any further\nadministrative action pursuant to this Part. (1)\nA licensee may be mailed a letter\nadvising such licensee of the status of the equine drug violation record of\nsuch licensee and any possible future action that may be taken in the event of\nsuch licensee's accumulation of additional points. (2)\n\nAlthough point values shall be assigned\nas of the date of each violation, the commission shall not initiate a\nsuspension pursuant to this Part until after the final adjudication of an\nequine drug rule violation for which points are assigned pursuant to this Part. (3)\n\nWhen a precipitating equine\ndrug rule violation results in the licensee having accumulated five or more\npoints based on final adjudications of equine drug rule violations, the\ncommission shall find that a licensee is a habitual or persistent equine drug\nrule violator. (b) The\n\nDirector of the Division of Horse Racing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering shall suspend\nthe occupational licenses of a habitual or persistent equine drug rule\nviolator, at a minimum, as follows: (1)\nif\nthe licensee has accumulated 5 to 5.5 points as a result of equine drug rule\nviolations, a suspension of 15 days; (2)\nif the licensee has accumulated 6 to 8.5\npoints as a result of equine drug rule violations, a suspension of 30\ndays; (3)\nif the licensee has\naccumulated 9 to 10.5 points as a result of equine drug rule violations, a\nsuspension of 90 days; and\n(4)\nif\nthe licensee has accumulated 11 or more points as a result of equine drug rule\nviolations, a suspension of 180 days. (c) Such license suspensions shall in no way\naffect any administration action taken under any other provision of this\n\nSubchapter, including the imposition of a penalty for the precipitating or\nother equine drug rule violation in New York. (d) The Director of the Division of Horse\n\nRacing and Pari-Mutuel Wagering, on behalf of the commission, may\nproportionately reduce such suspension, however, when convinced by clear and\nconvincing evidence that the commission had already enhanced, based on one or\nmore of the predicate equine drug rule violations, the penalty imposed on the\nlicensee for the precipitating equine drug rule violation. The Director may\nalso impose a suspension before there has been a final adjudication of one or\nmore of the predicate equine drug violations, when points assessed for matters\nthat have been finally adjudicated suffice to impose a suspension pursuant to\nthis Part; the balance of any suspension shall be imposed upon additional final\nadjudications. (e) The State\n\nSteward may, when authorized by the Director of the Division of Horse Racing\nand Pari-Mutuel Wagering, add the habitual or persistent equine drug rule\nviolator suspension when issuing a ruling upon a precipitating equine drug rule\nviolation.
