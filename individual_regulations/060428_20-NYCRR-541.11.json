  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.11 - Fabrication and manufacturing\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1105(c)(2), 1110, 1111(a)\n(a) Fabricators and manufacturers who install\ntheir fabricated or manufactured product into real property are\ncontractors. (b) Fabricators\nas contractors. (1)\n\nWhen a\ncontractor-fabricator purchases tangible personal property which he fabricates\nand installs to the specifications of a capital improvement, the value added by\nsuch fabrication is not subject to the use tax. Example 1: A contractor-fabricator purchases steel beams from a\nmanufacturer and pays the sales tax on his cost. His employees fabricate the\nbeams to job specifications and install the beams in a capital improvement job. The contractor-fabricator is not subject to a use tax on the value added by his\nfabrication. (2)\n\nHowever, where a contractor fabricates tangible personal property of others, without\ninstallation, he is required to collect the tax on his total charges even if\nthe property is to be installed by another to the specifications of a capital\nimprovement. If he fabricates tangible personal property and sells the tangible\npersonal property, the total charge for the tangible personal property and\nservices performed thereon is subject to tax. Example 2: A contractor purchases steel beams which must be fabricated\nbefore they can be installed. The work is subcontracted out for fabrication. The fabricator's charge to the contractor for the fabrication of the steel\nbeams which the contractor will install is subject to the tax. (3)\n\nMachinery and equipment used\npredominantly to fabricate tangible personal property which the fabricator\ninstalls are subject to the tax. (4)\n\nWhen a fabricator uses machinery and\nequipment directly and predominantly to process tangible personal property for\nsale without installation (as the term\ndirectly and\npredominantly\nis used in section\n528.13\nand the term\nprocessing\nis used in section\n531.2\nof\nthis Title), such machinery and equipment is exempt from the New York State and\nlocal sales and use taxes, including the taxes imposed in New York City under\nsection\n1107\nof the Tax Law. (c) Manufacturers as\ncontractors. (1)\n\nManufacturing is the\nproduction of tangible personal property that has a different identity from its\ningredients. Manufacturing includes the production of standardized items as\nwell as the production of items to a customer's specifications. (2)\n\nWhen a manufacturer incorporates its\nmanufactured product into real property in New York State to the specifications\nof a capital improvement, the manufacturer is making a use of the product that\nis subject to use tax. The amount subject to use tax depends on whether the\nmanufacturer offers items of the same kind for sale in the regular course of\nbusiness. (3)\n\nWhen a manufacturer\nfabricates its manufactured product and later incorporates the product into\nreal property in New York State to the specifications of a capital improvement\nto real property, the manufacturer does not owe a use tax on the value added by\nthe fabrication. However, the incorporation of the manufactured product into\nreal property in New York State is a use of the product that is subject to use\ntax. The amount subject to tax depends on whether the manufacturer offers items\nof the same kind for sale in the regular course of business. Cross-reference: For a detailed discussion of the computation of use tax on\nproperty manufactured by the user, see section\n531.3\n(b) of this Title. (4)\n\nMachinery\nand equipment used directly and predominantly to produce tangible personal\nproperty for sale, as the terms\nproduction\nand\ndirectly and predominantly\nare used in section\n528.13\nof this Title, are exempt from the New York State and local sales and use\ntaxes, including the taxes imposed in New York City under section\n1107\nof the Tax Law.
