Findings of the commission of intentional program\nviolations in the ADC and HR programs prior to August 20, 1997 must be\nconsidered in determining the sanction to be imposed for a public\nassistance-IPV. (b) The sanction in subdivision (a) of this\nsection is in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other sanctions\nwhich may be provided for by law with respect to the offenses involved. However, the social services official or court official assessing penalties\nagainst a public assistance recipient for an act of fraud or misrepresentation\nmay consider whether to impose such penalties based upon the existence of the\npenalties described in subdivision (a) of this section. (c) Individuals found to have committed an\nFS-IPV, either through an administrative disqualification hearing or by a court\nof appropriate jurisdiction, or who have signed either a waiver of right to an\nadministrative disqualification hearing or a disqualification consent\nagreement, will be ineligible to participate in the Food Stamp program: (1)\nfor one year for the commission of a\nfirst FS-IPV; (2)\nfor two years\nupon: (i) the commission of a second FS-IPV; or\n(ii)\nthe first occasion of a\nfinding by a Federal, State, or local court of the trading of a controlled\nsubstance for coupons; and\n(3)\npermanently upon: (i) the commission of a third FS-IPV; or\n(ii)\nthe second occasion of a\nfinding by a Federal, State, or local court of the trading of a controlled\nsubstance for coupons; or\n(iii)\nthe\nfirst occasion of a finding by a Federal, State, or local court of the trading\nof firearms, ammunition, or explosives for coupons; or\n(iv)\nthe conviction of an offense for\nknowingly using, transferring, acquiring, altering or possessing food stamp\ncoupons, authorization to participate cards or access devices in any matter not\nauthorized by this Part if such food stamp coupons, authorization to\nparticipate cards or electronics devices have a value of $500 or\nmore. (d) If\na court of appropriate jurisdiction determines that an individual has engaged\nin conduct that would constitute an intentional program violation in accordance\nwith the standards described in section\n359.3\nof this Part, the social\nservices district must impose the penalties specified in this section, except\nas otherwise set forth below: (1)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of this section, an individual found guilty of\nan intentional program violation must be disqualified from the public\nassistance or Food Stamp program for the length of time specified by the court, if the court has imposed a disqualification period for such a\nviolation. (2)\n\nWith respect to an\nFS-IPV, if a court fails to impose a disqualification period, the social\nservices district must impose the disqualification penalties specified in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, unless such imposition is contrary to the\ncourt order. With respect to a public assistance-IPV, if a court fails to\nimpose a disqualification period, the social services district may impose the\ndisqualification penalties for a public assistance-IPV as specified in\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section. (3)\n\nIf disqualification is ordered by a\ncourt, but a date for initiating the disqualification period is not specified, the social services district must initiate the disqualification period for\ncurrently eligible individuals within 45 days of the date the disqualification\nwas ordered. (4)\n\nIf\ndisqualification is not ordered by a court, but disqualification must be\nimposed as the result of a criminal or civil court determination finding that\nan individual has engaged in conduct that constitutes an intentional program\nviolation, the social services district must initiate the disqualification\nperiod for currently eligible individuals within 45 days of the date of the\ncourt determination. (5)\n\nNo\nindividual may be sanctioned for a public assistance-IPV on the basis of a\nconviction in a State or Federal court if that conviction is based on a plea of\nguilty unless the individual was advised on the record in the court proceeding\nthat his or her conviction may serve as the basis for disqualification from\nreceipt of public assistance benefits and in writing prior to or at the time of\nentry of the plea of the disqualification provisions contained in this section. An individual not so advised may, however, be subject to an administrative\ndisqualifi cation hearing on the same set of facts as the court proceeding, provided that neither the conviction itself nor the records of the court\nproceeding may be used in any manner in the administrative disqualification\nhearing, nor may the office or a social services district, any person acting on\nbehalf of the office or a social services district or any witness presented by\nthe office or a social services district, disclose the existence of the court\nproceeding in any manner to the hearing officer prior to the entry of the\nplea. (e) The social\nservices district must disqualify from the appropriate program(s) the\nindividual(s) found to have committed an intentional program violation, or who\nhave signed a waiver of right to an administrative disqualification hearing or\ndisqualification consent agreement in cases referred for prosecution, but not\nthe entire assistance unit or household of such individual(s), except as\nprovided in subdivision (f) of this section. (1)\nA disqualified individual is ineligible\nto participate in a program from which he or she is disqualified for the\nperiods provided in this section. (2)\n\nIf an individual signs a disqualification\nconsent agreement, the period of disqualification will begin within 45 days of\nthe date the individual signed the disqualification consent agreement unless\nthe disqualification consent agreement is incorporated into a court\ndetermination issued at a later date or a court determination has specified the\ndate for initiating the disqualification period, in which event the social\nservices district will disqualify the individual in accordance with the court\norder. (3)\n\nIf an individual signs a\nwaiver of right to an administrative disqualification hearing or has been found\nto have committed an intentional program violation through an administrative\ndisqualification hearing, the period of disqualification will begin with the\nfirst month which follows the date the individual receives written notification\nof disqualification after having been found to have committed an FS-IPV, and\nmust begin no later than the first day of the second month which follows the\ndate of the notice of disqualification after having been found to have\ncommitted any other intentional program violation. (f) The remaining members of the household\nwhich contained an individual who has been found to have committed an FS-IPV\nmust agree to make full restitution within 10 days of the date that the social\nservices district's demand letter is mailed, or the household's monthly\nallotment will be reduced. If the remaining household members agree to make\nfull restitution but fail to do so, the social services district must reduce\nthe household's monthly food stamp allotment. Restitution must begin during the\nperiod of disqualification imposed by the social services district or a court\nof law. Any public assistance overpayment must be recovered in accordance with\nthe provisions of section\n352.31\nof this Title. (g) If there is a determination that a member\nof the household or assistance unit has committed an intentional program\nviolation, the social services district must take immediate action to send the\nindividual a notice of disqualification as set forth in section\n359.10\nof this Part. (1)\n\nIn the case of an individual who is not\ncurrently in receipt of public assistance, the disqualification period will be\npostponed until after a reapplication for benefits has been approved. (2)\n\nThe disqualification period for a FS-IPV\nwill begin on the date of imposition of the FS-IPV regardless of whether the\nperson is currently a recipient of food stamp benefits. (3)\n\nOnce a disqualification penalty has been\nimposed against a member of the household or assistance unit, the period of\ndisqualification continues uninterrupted until completed regard less of the\neligibility of the other members of the household or assistance unit. However, the disqualified member's household or assistance unit continues to be\nresponsible for repayment of any overpayment or over-issuance which resulted\nfrom the disqualified member's intentional program violation regardless of the\nhousehold's or unit's eligibility for home relief, aid to dependent children or\nfood stamps. (h) Social\nservices districts must report to the department information on individuals who\nhave been found to have committed an intentional program violation by a hearing\ndecision or a court or who have signed a waiver of hearing or a DCA. The\nfollowing data must be submitted on each individual: (1)\nfull name; (2)\nsocial security number; (3)\ndate of birth; (4)\nnumber of disqualification(s) (1st, 2nd, 3rd, etc.); (5)\ndate\ndisqualification took effect for a currently otherwise eligible individual; and\n(6)\nlength of disqualification\nimposed or to be imposed. This information is to be submitted no later than 20 days\nafter the date the disqualification took effect, or would have taken effect for\na currently ineligible individual, the imposition of whose disqualification\npenalty will not be imposed until the individual becomes eligible for\nassistance or benefits. This information is to be updated by social services\ndistricts where appropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
