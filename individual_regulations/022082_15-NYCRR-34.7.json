  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 34.7 - System conversion\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Conversion background. It is necessary to\nprovide for an orderly transition from the Financial Security Certification\n\nProgram (FSCP), in operation prior to June 12, 2000, to the insurance\ninformation and enforcement system (IIES) which is set forth in this Part. Operating disparate electronic reporting programs in parallel is not viable. Accordingly, DMV shall not accept old format FSCP tapes after noon on May 19, 2000. All FSCP tapes received by DMV after this date and time shall be returned\nunprocessed to an insurance company or servicing agent. There will be a period\nbetween FSCP tape cut-off and initial loading where electronic transactions, including cancellations, cannot be submitted by an insurance company or\nservicing agent to DMV. IIES shall begin as a new system with individual\ninsurance companies notifying DMV of those vehicles registered in NYS that are\ninsured (reporting the NYS books of business) as of a designated point in time. After successful loading, cancellations and other required notices that occur\non or after such point in time that the initial load tape is created shall be\nsubmitted to DMV on a day-forward-basis in accordance with the time frames\nprescribed by this Part. Since IIES begins with the reporting of insured\npolicyholders and vehicles, cancellations that may have occurred during the\nperiod between the creation date of the last FSCP tape and the creation date of\nthe successful IIES initial load tape shall not be reported to DMV. Submission\nof such cancellation notices are detrimental to the success and viability of\nIIES. Following the deadline for initial loading of composite rated fleet\npolicies, an IIES conversion module (no insurance activity) shall begin\nidentifying all registration records without insurance company provided\nelectronic proof of insurance in DMV's insurance information database. Letters\nshall be sent to all such identified registrants. Required electronic proof of\nliability insurance coverage must be received by DMV within a prescribed period\nof time or administrative sanctions shall be taken against the registrant's NYS\nregistration and NYS driver's license, as applicable. Note: This subsection provides for an orderly transition\nfrom the FSCP to IIES for those insurance companies that are complying with or\nhave complied with the requirements of the FSCP and are complying with or will\ncomply with the requirements of IIES, including reporting time frames, as\nprescribed by this Part. Nothing herein shall relieve an insurance company not\nin compliance with this Part including DMV MVLIR specifications from any\nliability under NYS Law. (b) Conversion provisions for for-hire (FH)\nreporting. DMV's for hire (FH) unit within the insurance services bureau shall\naccept paper insurance certificate-for hire passenger vehicle forms and\ntermination notice- for hire passenger vehicle forms until an insurance company\nhas successfully loaded during the June 12, 2000 to September 12, 2000 window. Immediately upon successful loading, DMV shall no longer accept and/or process\nFH forms from that insurance company. Paper FH forms shall not be accepted for\ninsurance company reporting purposes after September 12, 2000. All FH forms\nsubmitted for reporting purposes not in compliance with this Part or Part 32 of\nthis Title shall be returned unprocessed to an insurance company. An insurance\ncompany shall continue to issue FH insurance certificates and DMV shall\ncontinue to require FH insurance certificates from registrants as paper proof\nof insurance, subject to electronic verification. (c) Conversion from manual (except for hire)\nand fleet (except for hire) reporting under the FSCP. DMV shall accept\ntermination and rescission of termination notices in accordance with former\nFSCP specifications until an insurance company has successfully loaded during\nthe June 12, 2000 to September 12, 2000 window. Immediately upon successful\nloading, DMV shall no longer accept and/or process FSCP paper notices from that\ninsurance company. FSCP paper notices shall not be accepted for reporting\npurposes after September 12, 2000, with no exceptions. All FSCP notices\nreceived by DMV after the successful initial loading or September 13, 2000, whichever occurs earlier, shall be returned unprocessed to an insurance\ncompany. (d) Initial loading. An\ninsurance company shall load its NYS book of business, as soon as practicable, in accordance with this Part. No electronic NBS, REI, XLC or NIS notices shall\nbe submitted by an insurance company or servicing agent or shall be accepted by\nDMV before an insurance company's successful initial loading, except as\nprovided for in this Part. An initial loading tape shall only contain LOD\nnotices. (e) Reporting of notices\nafter initial loading. Following successful initial loading, NBS, REI, XLC and\nNIS notices shall be reported in accordance with this Part. Notices shall not\nbe submitted to DMV by an insurance company or servicing agent that represent\nevents that may have occurred between the creation date of an insurance\ncompany's last FSCP tape and the creation date of an IIES initial load tape\nthat is successfully processed.
