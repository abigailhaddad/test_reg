  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8-3.1 - Computation of the property factor\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The percentage of the surcharge\ntaxpayer's real property and tangible personal property, whether owned by or\nrented to the surcharge taxpayer, that is within the MCTD is determined by\ndividing the average value of such property within the MCTD (without deduction\nof any encumbrances) by the average value of all such property within New York\n\nState (without deduction of any encumbrances). For purposes of this section, the value of real property owned by the surcharge taxpayer and the value of\ntangible personal property owned by the surcharge taxpayer means the adjusted\nbasis of such properties for Federal income tax purposes. (b) The term \"real property\" includes land, buildings, structures, and improvements thereon. In addition, it includes\nshares in a cooperative housing corporation, as defined in IRC section 216(b), in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold. Such\nshares in a cooperative housing corporation will be deemed to be owned within\n\nNew York State if the property owned or leased by such corporation, as\ndescribed in IRC section 216(b)(1)(B), is located in New York State, and such\nshares will be deemed to be owned within the MCTD if such property is located\nwithin the MCTD. (c) The term\n\"tangible personal property\" means corporeal personal property, such as\nmachinery, tools, implements, goods, wares and merchandise. It does not mean\nmoney, deposits in banks, shares of stock, bonds, notes, credits or evidences\nof any interest in property and evidences of debt. (d) (1)\n\nThe\naverage value of real property owned by the surcharge taxpayer and tangible\npersonal property owned by the surcharge taxpayer is determined in accordance\nwith the provisions of section\n3-2.4\nof this Subchapter\napplicable to the valuation of assets included in business capital. The same\nmethod of valuation must be used consistently with respect to property located\nwithin the MCTD and all property located in New York State. (2)\n\nFor purposes of paragraphs (3) and (4) of\nsubdivision (e) of this section, the average value of tangible personal\nproperty owned by the surcharge taxpayer that is in transit and is considered\nto be within the MCTD will be determined based on the value of such property\nduring the time that it is in transit. (e) For purposes of computation of the\nproperty factor, tangible personal property owned by the surcharge taxpayer: (1)\nis considered to be within the MCTD for\nas long as it remains physically situated or located within the MCTD, even\nthough it may be stored in a bonded warehouse; (2)\nis considered to be situated or located\nwithin the MCTD if held within the MCTD by an agent or other such person or\nentity acting on behalf of the surcharge taxpayer, or by a consignee; (3)\nthat is in transit between locations of\nthe surcharge taxpayer, is considered to be within the MCTD if its final\ndestination is within the MCTD; (4)\nthat is in transit between a buyer and a seller, is considered to be within the\nMCTD if its final destination is within the MCTD and the property is included\nby the surcharge taxpayer in the denominator of its property factor in\naccordance with its regular accounting practices. (f) For purposes of computation of the\nproperty factor, omnibuses and other rolling equipment, such as construction\nequipment or trucks, located within the MCTD and all such rolling equipment\nlocated in New York State must be apportioned to the MCTD by a fraction. Such\nfraction may be based on any of the following measures: miles operated within\nthe MCTD compared to total miles operated in New York State; time operated\nwithin the MCTD compared to total time operated in New York State; the number\nof pickup and delivery locations within the MCTD compared to the total of such\nlocations in New York State; or any other measure that fairly apportions such\noperations to the MCTD. Operations within the MCTD are included in the\nnumerator of the fraction, and 100% of operations in New York State are\nincluded in the denominator. Omnibus operations while engaged in school bus\noperations must be disregarded in determining the fraction. (g) For purposes of the property factor, the\nunderlying asset of a capital lease between the surcharge taxpayer and another\nparty (the lessor) is considered owned by the surcharge taxpayer.
