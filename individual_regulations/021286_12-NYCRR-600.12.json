(1)\n\nAny apprentice or applicant for\napprenticeship who believes that he or she has been discriminated against on\nthe basis of age, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or\nmarital status with regard to apprenticeship, or that the equal opportunity\nstandards with respect to his or her selection have not been followed in the\noperation of an apprenticeship program may, personally or through an authorized\nrepresentative, file a complaint with the State Division of Human Rights, or, at the apprentice's or applicant's election, with a private review body\nestablished pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision. The complaint shall\nbe in writing and shall be signed by the complainant. It must include the name, address and telephone number of the person allegedly discriminated against, the\nprogram sponsor involved, and a brief description of the circumstances of the\nfailure to apply the equal opportunity standards provided for in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe complaint must be\nfiled not later than one year from the date of the alleged discrimination or\nspecified failure to follow the equal opportunity standards; and, in the case\nof complaints filed directly with review bodies designated by program sponsors\nto review such complaints, any referral of such complaint by the complainant to\nthe State Division of Human Rights must occur within the time limitation stated\nabove or 30 days from the final decision of such review body, whichever is\nlater. The time may be extended by the State Division of Human Rights for good\ncause shown. (3)\n\nSponsors are\nencouraged to establish fair, speedy and effective procedures for a review body\nto consider complaints of failure to follow the equal opportunity standards. A\nprivate review body established by the program sponsor for this purpose should\nnumber three or more responsible persons from the community serving in this\ncapacity without compensation. Members of the review body should not be\ndirectly associated with the administration of an apprenticeship program. Sponsors may join together in establishing a review body to serve the needs of\nprograms within the community. (b) Processing of complaints. (1)\n\nWhen the sponsor has designated a review\nbody for reviewing complaints, the State Division of Human Rights, unless the\ncomplainant has indicated otherwise or unless the State Division of Human\n\nRights has determined that the review body will not effectively enforce the\nequal opportunity standards, shall upon receiving a complaint, refer it to the\nreview body. (2)\n\nThe State Division\nof Human Rights, shall, within 30 days following the referral of a complaint to\nthe review body, obtain reports from the complainant and the review body as to\nthe disposition of the complaint. If the complaint has been satisfactorily\nadjusted and there is no other indication of failure to apply equal opportunity\nstandards, the case shall be closed and the parties appropriately\ninformed. (3)\n\nWhen a complaint has\nnot been resolved by the review body within 90 days or where, despite\nsatisfactory resolution of the particular complaint by the review body, there\nis evidence that equal opportunity practices of the apprenticeship program are\nnot in accordance with this Part, the commissioner may conduct such compliance\nreview as found necessary, and shall take all necessary steps to resolve the\ncomplaint. (4)\n\nWhere no review body\nexists, the State Division of Human Rights may conduct such compliance review\nas found necessary in order to determine the facts of the complaint, and obtain\nsuch other information relating to compliance with this Part as the\ncircumstances warrant. (5)\n\nSponsors\nshall provide written notice of the above complaint procedure to all applicants\nfor apprenticeship and all apprentices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
