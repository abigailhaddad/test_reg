Where the vehicle is required to be inspected prior to sale, there will be entered in the book of registry the sticker number and date of\ninspection and, the odometer reading when the vehicle is sold.

If a temporary certificate\nof registration is issued, the name of the purchaser's insurance company, policy number and date shall be entered in the book of registry. (2)\n\nWhen a purchaser trades in a vehicle not\nsubject to the certificate of title law to a dealer, the registration renewal\nstub must be completely filled out, showing the transfer of the vehicle to the\ndealer and must be signed at the time of trade-in. If the vehicle is a titled\nvehicle, the certificate of title assigned to the dealer at the time of\ntrade-in must be obtained by the dealer. (b) Record of ownership of vehicles. The\ndealer must maintain proof of ownership of all vehicles transferred to him as\nlong as they remain the property of the dealer. A dealer may make copies of all\nproofs of ownership for his own records if he so desires, but the entries\nrequired to be made in the book of registry will constitute the official\nrecords of the dealer and must be kept for a period of three years from the\ndate of sale of the vehicle. (c) Retaining books of forms MV-50 and MV-53. The use of certificate of sale books\n(MV-50) and temporary certificate of registration books (MV-53) will be\ncontinued from year to year. Unused books should be retained when registration\nis renewed. However, on and after April 1, 1993, form MV-53 may not be used and\nform MV-TCR must be issued. A dealer must destroy any remaining, unused MV-53\nforms on that date. Dealer copies of issued MV-50 forms must be retained for at\nleast five years from the date of issuance, after which they may be\ndestroyed. (d) Inspection of\nrecords. Records required by the commissioner shall be open for inspection\nduring reasonable business hours. (e) Computerized book of registry.
