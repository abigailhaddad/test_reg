  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.2 - Access to and maintenance of decontamination systems and regulated abatement work area enclosures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Access. Entry to the personal and waste decontamination system enclosures shall\nbe restricted to the asbestos contractors involved with the asbestos project, appropriately certified employees of the asbestos contractors, authorized\nvisitors, police, fire and other public safety personnel. (b) Waiting periods. Prior to beginning Phase\nII B asbestos abatement work and upon completion of the construction of all\nsmall and large size regulated abatement work area enclosures and\ndecontamination system enclosures, including establishment of the negative air\nsystem, a four hour waiting period with negative air units operating shall be\nrequired to insure that all barriers shall remain intact and secured to the\nwalls, ceilings, floors and fixtures. (c) Waiting period exemption. The four hour\nwaiting period may be eliminated for exterior work where negative air is not\nrequired. (d) Inspection of\nbarriers. All barriers shall be inspected by the asbestos supervisor at least\ntwice daily, before the start of and following the completion of the day's\nabatement activities. Inspections are also required on days when there is no\n\nPhase II work or support activities scheduled. Inspections and observations\nshall be documented by the asbestos abatement contractor's supervisor in a\ndaily project log. (e) Repairs to\nbarriers and enclosures. Damage and defects in the barriers and enclosures\nshall be repaired immediately upon discovery and shall be documented by the\nasbestos abatement contractor's supervisor in a daily project log, prior to\nresumption of abatement activities. (f) Testing of barriers and enclosures. Smoke\ntube testing to ensure the effectiveness of all isolation barriers, personal\ndecontamination system enclosures, waste decontamination system enclosures and\nregulated abatement work area enclosures shall be performed prior to the\nbeginning of abatement activities and at least once a day thereafter until\nsatisfactory clearance air sampling results have been obtained. Negative air\npressure ventilation units shall be in operation during this testing. Testing\nof barriers and enclosures is not required on days when there are no Phase II B\nor cleaning activities scheduled. Test results, observations and any\nmodifications shall be documented by the asbestos abatement contractor's\nsupervisor in a daily project log. (g) Loss of enclosure integrity. If visible\nemissions or water leaks are observed outside of the regulated abatement work\narea, or if a glovebag, tent or enclosure of any type fails or loses its\nintegrity, work shall be stopped and the following procedures shall be\nfollowed: (1)\n\nIsolation and critical barrier\nconstruction. Isolation and critical barriers shall be constructed as follows: (i) Isolate HVAC systems. The HVAC systems\nshall be shut down immediately and all openings shall be sealed with at least\nsix mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting and duct tape. (ii)\n\nIsolate uncontaminated areas. Passageways to uncontaminated areas of the building or structure shall be\nsealed with at least six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting and duct\ntape. (iii)\n\nInstall critical\nbarriers. Critical barriers within 25 feet of the regulated abatement work area\nshall be installed as per section\n56-7.11\nof this Part. (2)\n\nNegative air pressure\nequipment ventilation. Negative air pressure equipment ventilation that\ncomplies with section\n56-7.8\nof this Part shall be\ninstalled and utilized. (3)\n\nCleanup. Cleanup shall be accomplished as follows: (i) Method, tools and equipment. All\naccumulations of asbestos waste material shall be containerized and removed. Non-metal shovels and HEPA-vacuums may be used to pick up or move waste except\nin the vicinity of isolation barriers which might be breached. The areas around\nisolation barriers shall be cleaned utilizing rubber or plastic dustpans, squeegees or shovels. HEPA-vacuums shall be used to clean all surfaces after\ngross cleanup. (ii)\n\nCleanup of\nsurfaces. All surfaces in the regulated abatement work area shall be\nwet-cleaned using rags, mops and sponges. (iii)\n\nSecond cleaning. After the first\ncleaning, at least 12 hours shall be allowed for asbestos to settle. Thereafter, all objects and surfaces in the regulated abatement work area shall\nbe HEPA-vacuumed and wet-cleaned. All windows, doors, HVAC system vents and all\nother openings shall remain sealed. (4)\n\nRemoval of contaminated equipment and\nwaste. All remaining contaminated equipment and containerized waste shall be\nremoved from the regulated abatement work area. (5)\n\nClearance air sampling. Clearance air\nsampling shall be conducted, as per the schedule for air sampling and\nanalysis. (6)\n\nIsolation barrier\nremoval. Isolation barriers shall be removed only after satisfactory clearance\nair sampling results have been achieved. (h) Daily cleaning of enclosures. The\nasbestos abatement contractor shall HEPA-vacuum or wet-clean the waste\ndecontamination system enclosures, the personal decontamination system\nenclosures, and airlocks when remote decontamination units are used, daily\nduring Phase II A through C abatement activities. This cleaning shall take\nplace at the end of each work shift and the asbestos abatement contractor's\nsupervisor shall document it in the daily project log. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-8.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
