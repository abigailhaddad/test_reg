  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 463.10 - Supplemental relocation payments, loss of favorable mortgage financing, incidental expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to other payments and benefits authorized by\n\nState law, individuals and families displaced from dwellings on real property\nacquired by the office, who were in occupancy on or after July 1, 1971, are\nentitled to supplemental relocation payments, payment for loss of favorable\nmortgage financing and incidental expenses in accordance with the following\ncriteria and eligibility standards. (a) General requirements to receive\nreplacement housing payments. (1)\n\nIn addition\nto the occupancy requirements as specifically enumerated herein, a displaced\nperson is otherwise eligible for the appropriate payments when he relocates and\noccupies a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling within one year, beginning on the\nlater of the following dates: the date on which he receives final payment from\nthe State for legal damages directly connected with the acquisition of his\ndwelling unit; or the date required to move from the dwelling acquired; or the\ndate on which he actually moves from the dwelling acquired, if in fact this\nlatter date is earlier than the date required to move. The date required to\nmove is here defined and elsewhere in this section as that date specified in\nwriting by the State, by which the property must be vacated. (2)\n\nApplication for payments under this\nsection shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the commissioner. The\napplication must be filed no later than six months after the expiration of the\none-year period specified immediately above, except that in cases litigated in\nthe Court of Claims, the six-month period shall start from the date of final\njudgment of that court. (3)\n\nIf two\nor more eligible families occupy the same single family dwelling unit, each\nfamily is eligible for a replacement housing payment if they relocate to\nseparate dwelling units. (4)\n\nIf two\nor more eligible individuals with no identifiable head of household occupy the\nsame single family dwelling unit, they are considered as one family for\nreplacement housing payment purposes. When all individuals do not relocate to\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing, the office shall determine and pay those\nindividuals who do relocate into decent, safe and sanitary housing a pro rata\nshare of the amount that would have been received if all of the individuals had\nrelocated together. (b) Supplemental payments; owner-occupants over 180 days who repurchase. (1)\nA displaced owner-occupant of a dwelling\nmay receive additional payments, the combined total of which may not exceed\n$15,000 for the additional cost necessary to purchase replacement housing; to\ncompensate the owner for the loss of favorable financing on his existing\nmortgage in the financing of replacement housing; and to reimburse the owner\nfor incidental expenses incident to the purchase of replacement housing when\nsuch costs are incurred as specified herein. (2)\n\nThe owner-occupant is eligible for such\npayments when: (i) he is in occupancy at the\ninitiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the real property, in whole\nor in part; or\n(ii)\nhe is in\noccupancy at the time he is given a written notice by the State that it is\ntheir intent to acquire the property by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least\n180 consecutive days immediately prior to the date of vacation or initiation of\nnegotiations, whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe purchases and occupies a decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nThe\nreplacement housing payment is the amount, if any, which when added to the\namount for which the State acquired his dwelling, equals the actual cost which\nthe owner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling, or the\namount determined by the office as necessary to purchase a comparable dwelling, whichever is less. The State's determination of the amount necessary to\npurchase a comparable dwelling may be made on the basis of either of the two\nfollowing methods: (i) The State may\nestablish a schedule of probable selling prices of comparable dwellings in the\nvarious types of dwellings being acquired. Such schedule may be prepared from\nan analysis of the current probable selling prices of dwellings available on\nthe market. (ii)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the probable selling price of a comparable dwelling by analyzing\nthose selected comparable dwellings available for sale which are most nearly\ncomparable to the property being acquired by the State. All calculations or supplemental relocation payments are\nto be predicted on the basis of the probable selling price of the available\ncomparable housing, not the asking prices. (4)\n\nAn owner-occupant desiring to retain his\nacquired dwelling may be paid a replacement housing payment according to the\nfollowing computations: (i) If the dwelling\nto be moved is decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be the amount by\nwhich the cost to relocate the dwelling exceeds the acquisition price of the\ndwelling. The costs to relocate may include the reasonable costs of acquiring\nthe dwelling, acquiring a new site and other expenses incident to retaining, moving the dwelling and restoring it to a condition comparable to that before\nthe move. (ii)\n\nIf the dwelling to\nbe moved is not decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be computed as\nabove except that the costs to cure the decent, safe and sanitary deficiencies\nshall be included in the costs to relocate. (iii)\n\nThe payments computed under\nsubparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph may not exceed the amount which the\nowner would have obtained had he purchased a replacement dwelling and his\npayment computed as per paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (c) Owner-occupant over 180 days\nwho rents replacement housing. An owner-occupant eligible for a replacement\nhousing payment under subdivision (b) of this section who elects to rent a\nreplacement dwelling is eligible for a rental replacement housing payment not\nto exceed $4,000. The payment shall be computed and disbursed according to the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\n\nThe payment shall be\ndetermined by subtracting, from the amount necessary to rent a comparable\ndwelling for the next four years, 48 times the economic rental of the dwelling\nunit occupied as computed by the State. (2)\n\nIn cases where the economic rental of the\nacquired dwelling exceeds 25 percent of the owner's gross monthly income and he\nelects to relocate into public subsidized rental housing, the computation of\nbenefits will be in accordance with paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual\nanalysis of comparable available rentals. (4)\n\nThe payment under this section may not\nexceed the maximum amount the owner would have received had he elected to\nrepurchase a dwelling unit under the provisions of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) Owner-occupant, less than 180 days but more than 90 days, who purchase. A\ndisplaced owner-occupant otherwise eligible under subdivision (b) of this\nsection, except that he has owned and occupied the dwelling for less than 180\ndays but more than 90 days, may receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to\nenable him to make a down payment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling and\nreimbursement for actual expenses incident to such purchase; or for additional\ncosts to relocate his retained dwelling in accordance with the following: (1)\n\nThe amount of the down payment shall be\ndetermined by the State as the amount required as a down payment on a\ncomparable dwelling if such purchase was financed with a conventional\nloan. (2)\n\nThe expenses incident to\nthe purchase of replacement housing as described in subdivision (j) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nUpon purchase and\noccupancy of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling by the relocatee within the\ntime limits specified in paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the relocatee may be\nreimbursed: (i) the full amount of the down\npayment determined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the eligible\nincidental expenses if such total amount does not exceed $2,000; or, if more\nthan $2,000: (ii)\n$2,000 plus 50\npercent of the amount in excess of $2,000, providing the relocatee contributes\n50 percent of the amount in excess of $2,000. (4)\n\nThe full amount of the down payment must\nbe applied to the purchase price of the replacement property and any down\npayment and incidental costs claimed must be shown in the closing statement. To\nprocess for payment, the State must be furnished a copy of the closing\nstatement. If the owner elects to retain his dwelling, the\nreplacement housing payment will be determined in accordance with paragraph\n(b)(4) of this section, except that such payment shall not exceed $4,000. If\nthe owner first elects to rent a replacement property, but later decides to\napply for a down payment on a purchase of a replacement property, any payments\nmade under the rental provisions are to be deducted from the payments\nauthorized under this paragraph.

The specific payment will be determined in accordance with the\nprovisions of paragraphs (c)(1)-(3) of this section. (f) Tenant-occupant, over 90 days, renting\nreplacement housing. (1)\nA displaced tenant is\neligible for a rental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, when: (i) he is in occupancy at the beginning of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property; or\n(ii)\nhe is in occupancy at the time he is\ngiven a written notice by the State that it is their intent to acquire the\nproperty by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least 90 consectutive days immediately prior to\nthe date of vacation or initiation of negotiations, whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe rented and occupied a\ndecent, safe and sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in\nparagraph (a)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nThe payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall\nbe determined by subtracting, from the amount necessary to rent a comparable\ndwelling for the next years, the following amount: (i) 48 times the average monthly rental paid\nby the relocated individual or family during the last three months; or\n(ii)\nif such average monthly\nrental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar dwellings, the\neconomic rent as established by the State shall be used; (iii)\nthe \"rent being paid\" shall include any\nrent supplements supplied by others except when, by law, such supplement is to\nbe discontinued upon vacation of the property. (3)\n\nWhen the average monthly rental being\npaid by the relocatee, not including supplemental rent by public agencies, exceeds 25 percent of the monthly gross income of such individual or family, the payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting 12 times\nthe average monthly income of the relocatee from: (i) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling if the relocatee\nmoves into private housing; or\n(ii)\nif the relocatee moves into public subsidized housing, the lesser of; (a) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling; or\n(b) 48 times the monthly rental the relocatee\nis required to pay if he relocates in the subsidized housing.

(2)\n\nThe State may determine the rental rates\nof comparable housing by a schedule or an individual analysis of comparable\navailable rentals. (3)\n\nThe down\npayment amount, including the expenses incident to purchase of the replacement\ndwelling, are to be computed in accordance with the provisions of subdivision\n(d) of this section.

(2)\n\nThe increased interest payment will be\nbased on and limited to the lesser of the following amounts: (i) the present worth of the right to receive\nthe monthly difference in mortgage payments on the existing mortgage using the\nold and new interest rates; or\n(ii)\nthe present worth of the right to receive the monthly difference in mortgage\npayments on the new mortgage using the old and new interest rates. (3)\n\nPayment computation. The\namount of increased interest payment will be computed in accordance with the\nfollowing procedures: (i) The monthly\nprincipal and interest payment differences caused by the change in interest\nrates is computed for both the existing mortgage and new mortgage for their\nrespective remaining terms and amounts. The old and new interest rates are used\nin each case. (ii)\n\nThe present\nworth of the monthly interest difference found in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph is computed for each mortgage by discounting the annual difference\n(the sum of the monthly difference for one year) at the savings deposit\ninterest rate for the remaining term of each mortgage. The lesser of the\namounts so derived is the increased interest payment. (4)\n\nInterest rate of replacement dwelling\nmortgage. (i) The interest rate on the\nmortgage for the replacement dwelling to be used in the computation shall be\nthe actual rate but may not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently\ncharged by mortgage-lending institutions in the vicinity. (ii)\n\nWhen the lending agency imposes debt\nservice charges as an incident to the extension of credit, and such charges are\nnormal to the market, the annual percentage rate shown in the truth in lending\nstatement shall be used in lieu of the mortgage interest rate in computing the\nmonthly principal and interest payments.

(6)\n\nTo whom payment made. The payment described in this paragraph may be made directly to the relocated\nindividual or family, or, upon written instruction from the relocated\nindividual or family, directly to the mortgagee of the replacement\ndwelling. (7)\n\nPartial acquisition. (i) Where the dwelling is located on a tract\nnormal for residential use in the area, the interest payment shall be reduced\nto the percentage ratio that the acquisition price bears to the before value; except the reduction shall not apply when the mortgagee requires the entire\nmortgage balance to be paid because of the acquisition, and it is necessary to\nrefinance. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract larger than normal for residential use in the area, the\ninterest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the value of the\nresidential portion bears to the before value. This reduction shall apply\nwhether or not it is required that the entire mortgage balance be\npaid. (8)\n\nMulti-use\nproperties. The interest payment on multi-use properties shall be reduced to\nthe percentage ratio that the residential value of the multi-use property bears\nto the before value. (9)\n\nOther\nhighest and best use. If a dwelling is located on a tract where the fair market\nvalue is established on a higher and better than residential use, and if the\nmortgage is based on residential value, the interest payment shall be computed\nas provided above. If the mortgage is obviously based on the higher use, however, the interest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the\nestimated residential value of the parcel bears to the before value. (j) Incidental expenses. (1)\n\nAn otherwise eligible owner-occupant or\ntenant-occupant who purchases a replacement dwelling is entitled to a payment\nfor the incidental expenses incident to the purchase of the replacement\ndwelling, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 and $4,000 limits as\notherwise established in this section.

(3)\n\nReimbursement for these\neligible incidental expenses shall be contingent upon showing the actual\nexpense and shall be accompanied by a copy of the closing statement for the\nreplacement dwelling. (k) Mobile homes; replacement housing\npayments; general provisions. (1)\nA mobile\nhome is considered to be decent, safe and sanitary if it meets the defined\nstandards in this Part. (2)\n\nWhere\nthe office determines that a sufficient portion of a mobile home park is taken\nto justify the operator of such park to move his business or go out of\nbusiness, and the operator does in fact move or go out of business, the owners\nand occupants of the mobile home dwellings not within the actual taking but who\nare forced to move are eligible to receive the same payments as though their\ndwellings were within the actual taking. (3)\n\nWhen a comparable home dwelling is not\navailable, the supplemental relocation payment is to be calculated on the basis\nof the next higher type dwelling that is available and meets the applicable\nrequirements and standards, i.e., a higher type mobile home or a conventional\ndwelling. (l) Mobile\nhomes; owner-occupants over 180 days. A displaced owner of a mobile home who\nhas occupied, for at least 180 days, the mobile home on the site from which he\nis being displaced, and is otherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph\n(b)(2) of this section, is eligible for payments, the total of which may not\nexceed $15,000, for the additional costs necessary to purchase replacement\nhousing under the following circumstances: (1)\n\nWhen owner-occupied owns both mobile home\nand site, the replacement housing payment will be the amount, if any, which\nwhen added to the amount for which the State acquired his mobile home and site\nequals the lesser of: (i) the amount the\nowner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary conventional dwelling\nor a decent, safe and sanitary replacement mobile home and site; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home and a site.

The calculated rental replacement payment may not exceed the amount\ndetermined by the State in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph, or\n$4,000, whichever is lesser. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. Upon acquisition of the site, and the mobile home is required to be moved, the\nreplacement housing payment will be determined as follows: The amount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his mobile homesite, equals the lesser of: (i) the amount the\nowner is required to pay for a comparable homesite; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile homesite. If the owner elects to rent, the rental replacement\npayment shall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to rent a comparable mobile homesite for a period of four years and\n48 times the economic rent of the site acquired.

(3)\n\nWhen owner-occupied\nowns mobile home, rents site. The replacement housing payment will be the\namount, if any, which when added to the amount for which the State acquired his\nmobile home, equals the lesser of: (i) the\namount the owner is required to pay for a replacement dwelling; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home, plus the difference in the\namount determined by the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile\nhomesite for a period of four years and 48 times the rent being paid on the\nsite acquired. If the owner elects to rent a replacement mobile home, the rental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for four years and 48 times the economic rent\nof the mobile home plus the actual rent of the site acquired. (4)\n\nIn addition to the replacement\nhousing payments specified above, the owner-occupant is entitled to compensate\nhim for the loss of favorable financing on his existing mortgage in the\nfinancing of replacement housing and payment for incidental expenses incident\nto the purchase of replacement housing. These payments will be calculated and\npaid in accordance with subdivisions (i) and (j) of this section. (m) Mobile homes; owner-occupants\nless than 180 days but not more 90 days.

If the owner purchases a replacement dwelling, the replacement\nhousing payment will be determined in accordance with the heretofore defined\nprovisions relating to down payment calculations, except that the amount of the\ndown payment shall be determined by the State as the amount required on the\npurchase of a comparable mobile home and site. If the owner-occupant elects to\nrent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for a period of four years and 48 times the\neconomic rental of the mobile home and site. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. If the owner purchases conventional housing or a site to which the mobile home\nis moved, the replacement housing payment will be in an amount determined in\naccordance with the provisions relating to down payment calculations, except\nthat the amount of the down payment shall be determined by the State as the\namount required as a down payment on the purchase of a comparable site. If the\nowner-occupant elects to rent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed\n$4,000, shall be the difference in the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to rent a comparable site for four years and 48 times the economic\nrent of the site acquired.

(o) Supplemental replacement housing payments; miscellaneous provisions. (1)\n\nInspection of replacement dwelling. In\norder to be eligible for and receive any supplemental relocation payments, the\n\nState must inspect the replacement dwelling and determine that it meets the\ndecent, safe and sanitary standards as defined in section\n463.2\nof this Part. In any application for payment, the individual or family must indicate that, to\nthe best of their knowledge and belief, the replacement dwelling meets the\ndefined standards for decent, safe and sanitary housing. (2)\n\nAdvanced replacement housing payments in\nlitigated cases. An advance replacement housing payment can be authorized and\npaid to a property owner if the determination of the State's acquisition price\nwill be delayed pending the outcome of a trial in the Court of Claims. A\nprovisional replacement housing payment may be calculated by deeming the\n\nState's maximum offer for the property as the acquisition price. Payment of\nsuch amount may be made upon the owner-occupant's agreement that: (i) upon final judgment of the Court of\n\nClaims, the replacement housing payment will be recomputed using the\nacquisition price determined by the court as compared to the actual price paid\nor the amount determined by the State necessary to acquire a comparable decent, safe and sanitary dwelling; and\n(ii)\nif the amount awarded by the court as\nthe fair market value of the property acquired plus the amount of the\nrecomputed replacement housing payment exceeds the price paid for, or the\n\nState's determined cost of, a comparable dwelling, the owner will refund to the\n\nState, from the judgment amount, an amount equal to the excess. In no event, however, shall he be required to refund more than the amount of the replacement\nhousing payment advanced; and\n(iii)\nif the property owner does not agree to such adjustment, the replacement\nhousing payment shall be deferred until the case is finally adjudicated and\ncomputed on the basis of the final determination, using the award as the\nacquisition price. (3)\n\nOwnership of replacement dwelling prior to displacement. Any person who has\nobtained legal ownership of a replacement dwelling any time after the\ninitiation of negotiations on the project, and occupies the replacement\ndwelling after being displaced but within the time limit specified in paragraph\n(a)(1) of this section, is eligible for a replacement housing payment if the\nreplacement dwelling meets decent, safe and sanitary standards. (4)\n\nPartial taking situations. (i) Where a dwelling is located on a tract\nnormal for residential use in the area, the maximum replacement housing payment\nshall be determined by subtracting the \"before value\" of the property from the\nestimated selling price of a comparable dwelling on a lot typical for the\narea. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract larger than normal for residential use in the area, the\nmaximum replacement housing payment shall be determined by estimating the value\nof the dwelling at the present location on a homesite typical in size for the\narea and deducting this amount from the selling price of a comparable dwelling\non a site typical for the area. (5)\n\nDwelling on land with higher and better\nuse. Where a dwelling is located on a tract where the fair market value is\nestablished on a higher and better than residential use, the maximum\nreplacement housing payment shall be determined by estimating the value of the\ndwelling at the present location on a homesite typical for the area and zoned\nfor residential use and deducting this amount from the selling price of a\ncomparable dwelling on a typical residential homesite for the area. (6)\n\nJoint residential and business use. Where\ndisplaced individuals or families occupy living quarters on the same premises\nas a displaced business, farm or nonprofit organization, such individuals or\nfamilies are separate displaced persons for purposes of determining entitlement\nto relocation payments. (7)\n\nPayments on assignments. Payments described herein may be made, upon written\ninstructions and assignment from the displaced person, directly to a lessor for\nrent or to a seller for application on a payment for decent, safe and sanitary\ndwelling. (8)\n\nOwner-occupant; prohibitions on double payments. If an owner-occupant eligible for the maximum\n$15,000 payment elects initially not to repurchase a replacement dwelling, but\nrather to claim benefits on the four-year rent differential basis, he cannot\nreceive double payment in excess of $15,000 if he later decides (within the\nallowable period) to purchase a replacement house. The amount of any payment\nmade on the rent differential basis is to be deducted from the calculated\ndifferential necessary to purchase a replacement dwelling. (9)\n\nAll rental replacement housing payments\nshall be paid in a lump sum except that it shall be paid in installments when\nthis method of payment is requested by the displaced person. Prior to any\npayment the tenant must certify to the State that he is occupying decent, safe\nand sanitary housing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
