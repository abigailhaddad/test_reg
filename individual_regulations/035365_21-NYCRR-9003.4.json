  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 9003.4 - Permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When any\nprovision of these rules requires a permit as a condition to the performance of\nan act or activity, no such act or activity shall be implemented or commenced\nprior to the receipt of a written permit authorizing such activity, from\n\nParksCorp or from its authorized designee or representative with respect to\nsuch activities. (b) A permit may be\ngranted upon such terms and conditions as ParksCorp shall reasonably impose, and shall authorize the permitted acts or activities only insofar as they are\nperformed in strict accordance with the terms and conditions thereof. All such\npermits are terminable at will by ParksCorp or the BPCA upon notice to the\npermit holder. (c) Permits shall be\napplied for on forms prepared and provided by ParksCorp, which forms shall\nrequire such information as ParksCorp may deem appropriate for the review and\nevaluation of the permit application. ParksCorp may require a permit fee\nestablished in accordance with section\n9003.45\nof this Part. Applications\nfor permits shall be evaluated based on: (1)\nwhether the activity is consistent with these rules, the plaza regulations and\nthe policies of ParksCorp and BPCA; (2)\nwhether the activity may interfere with\nthe general public's use and enjoyment of the parks or adjacent areas, the\nrepair, maintenance, construction, reconstruction, operation, or the staging of\nwork for the parks, and other matters related to the sound operation of the\nparks; and\n(3)\nany additional\nmatters referred to in section\n9003.25\n(d)(1) through\n(8)\nof this Part as may be applicable to this\nactivity. (d) Depending\non the type of activity which the permit application involves, considering such\nfactors as the number of persons likely to be involved, likelihood of\nmaintenance and operations costs, whether a commercial enterprise or\nsubstantial fund raising is involved, risks of damage, potential for liability, and other matters related to the sound operation of the parks, ParksCorp may\nrequire the permit holder to post an undertaking and/or to provide surety or\ninsurance. Such undertaking shall be in an amount sufficient to ensure full\ncompliance with the terms and conditions of the permit, and the surety or\ninsurance shall be of a type and in an amount reasonably necessary to protect\nthe ParksCorp, the BPCA, and other appropriate parties from claims. If, upon\nexpiration or termination of the permit, it is determined that a permit holder\nhas not complied with the terms and conditions of the permit, or has violated\nany law, ordinance, statute or rule, then the following rules shall apply: (1)\nany undertaking provided to ParksCorp as\nsecurity for a permit holder's performance shall be forfeited and retained by\n\nParksCorp to the extent necessary to remedy, or compensate ParksCorp, the BPCA\nor such other parties for the damages caused by such acts, omissions, or\nviolations; (2)\nthe permit holder, together with his agents and employees who violated such terms and conditions\nor provisions of the permit or law, ordinance, statute or rule, shall be\njointly and severally liable for any additional sum necessary to correct or\ncompensate ParksCorp, the BPCA or such other parties for such damages; and\n(3)\nneither forfeiture of any\nsecurity nor payment nor recovery for such damages shall in any way relieve the\npermit holder of civil or criminal liability arising from the violation of the\nterms and conditions of the permit or of any law, ordinance or rule.
