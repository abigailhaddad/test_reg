  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 398-4.5 - New York State living arrangements\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen the SSP recipient receives both SSP and SNAP\nbenefits, and there is an observed discrepancy between the state living\narrangement information reported to SSP by the recipient and that information\ncontained in the recipient's SNAP case record, the information with regard to\nhousehold composition in the SNAP case record will be used to determine the\nstate living arrangement for SSP purposes. The five categories of State living arrangements are: (a) Living alone. Living alone\nmeans living in a private household composed of\none SSP-eligible individual or one SSP- eligible couple. (1)\n\nAn individual or couple is considered to\nbe living alone, if the individual or couple: (i) rents a room in an apartment or a private\nhome, but pays a flat fee and takes the majority of their meals during the\nmonth outside the dwelling unit or prepares the majority of their meals during\nthe month separately; (ii)\npays a\nfixed, pre-established flat fee for both room and board in a commercial\nestablishment which meets no other SSP living arrangement criteria (e.g., not\nlicensed as a congregate care facility and not a public emergency\nshelter); (iii)\nlives with others, but takes the majority of their meals during the month outside the\ndwelling; (iv)\nlives with others, but separately prepares, or has someone separately prepare, the majority of\ntheir meals during the month; (v) receives a fixed, pre-established flat fee for room and board from all others\nin the dwelling; (vi)\nlives with\nonly a foster child; (vii)\nlives\nwith only a homemaker authorized by a social services district\n(district); (viii)\nlives with only\na family care resident placed by: the New York State Office of Mental Health\n(OMH), the New York State Office for Persons with Developmental Disabilities\n(OPWDD), or a district; (ix)\nlives\nwith only an aide paid for under the Medical Assistance program; or\n(x) has no permanent living arrangement\n(e.g., a transient person or homeless person) and is not living with an\nineligible spouse or a minor child for whom they have primary\nresponsibility. (2)\n\nAn\nindividual or couple is not considered to be living alone if: (i) the individual lives with an ineligible\nspouse; (ii)\nthe individual or\ncouple lives with a minor child for whom they have primary responsibility\n(unless the minor child is a foster child); (iii)\nthe individual is a minor child; or\n(iv)\nthe individual or couple\nresides in a dwelling with others and prepares food in common with at least one\nother person in the dwelling. (b) Living with others. Living with others\nmeans living in a private household\ncomposed of an eligible individual or couple and at least one other person. It\nincludes a person who: (1)\nresides in a\ndwelling with others and prepares food in common with at least one other person\nin the dwelling. An individual or couple which meets one of the following\nrequirements is considered to be living with others: (i) an individual living with an ineligible\nspouse, despite the separate preparation of food; or\n(ii)\nan individual or couple living with a\nminor child for whom he or she has primary responsibility (unless the minor\nchild is a foster child). (2)\nis a minor child who is not living in a\ncongregate care facility. (3)\nis a\nminor child living in a congregate care level III facility. (4)\nis living in a religious community and\nroom and/or board is provided in full or in part by the religious\ncommunity.

An\nindividual or couple is receiving family care if he, she or they have been\nplaced in a family type home certified by OCFS and supervised by a district. A\nminor child is receiving family care if placed in a family type home by OMH or\nOPWDD, or by their parents. (d) Congregate care level II.
