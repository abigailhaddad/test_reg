If anywhere on the container of any architectural coating, or any label sticker affixed to the container, or in any sales, advertising, or\ntechnical literature supplied by a manufacturer or anyone acting on the\nmanufacturer's behalf, including retailers who sell under a private label, representation is made that the coating meets the definition of or is\nrecommended for use or may be used for more than one of the coating categories\nlisted in subdivision (a) of this section, then the most restrictive VOC\ncontent limit shall apply. This provision does not apply to the coating\ncategories listed in paragraphs (1)-(21) of this subdivision: (1)\nlacquer coatings (including lacquer\nsanding sealers); (2)\nmetallic\npigmented coatings; (3)\nshellacs; (4)\nfire-retardant\ncoatings; (5)\npretreatment wash\nprimers; (6)\nindustrial maintenance\ncoatings; (7)\nlow-solids\ncoatings; (8)\nwood\npreservatives; (9)\nhigh temperature\ncoatings; (10)\ntemperature-indicator safety coatings; (11)\nantenna coatings; (12)\nantifouling coatings; (13)\nflow coatings; (14)\nbituminous roof primers; (15)\nthermoplastic rubber coatings and\nmastics; (16)\nspecialty primers, sealers, and undercoaters; (17)\ncalcimine recoaters; (18)\nimpacted\nimmersion coatings; (19)\nnuclear\ncoatings; (20)\nthermoplastic rubber\ncoatings and mastic; and\n(21)\nconcrete surface retarders. (c) Most restrictive VOC limit for\nproducts manufactured on or after January 1, 2021. If a coating is recommended for use in more than one of the\nspecialty coating categories listed in subdivision (a) of this section, the\nmost restrictive (or lowest) VOC content limit shall apply. This requirement\napplies to usage recommendations that appear anywhere on the coating container, anywhere on any label or sticker affixed to the container, or in any sales, advertising, or technical literature supplied by a manufacturer or anyone\nacting on their behalf. This provision does not apply to the coating categories\nlisted in paragraphs (1)-(17) of this subdivision: (1)\naluminum roof coatings; (2)\nbituminous roof primers; (3)\nhigh temperature coatings; (4)\nindustrial maintenance\ncoatings; (5)\nlow-solids\ncoatings; (6)\nmetallic pigmented\ncoatings; (7)\npretreatment wash\nprimers; (8)\nshellacs; (9)\nspecialty primers, sealers, and\nundercoaters; (10)\nwood\ncoatings; (11)\nwood\npreservatives; (12)\nzinc-rich\nprimers; (13)\ncalcimine\nrecoaters; (14)\nimpacted immersion\ncoatings; (15)\nnuclear\ncoatings; (16)\nthermoplastic rubber\ncoatings and mastic; (17)\nconcrete\nsurface retarders. (d) Painting practices. Any person who applies architectural coatings shall ensure\nthat all containers used to apply the contents therein to a surface directly\nfrom the container by pouring, siphoning brushing or rolling, padding, ragging\nor other means, shall be closed when not in use. These architectural coatings\ncontainers include, but are not limited to, drums, buckets, cans, pails, trays, or other application containers. Containers of any VOC-containing materials\nused for thinning and cleanup shall also be closed when not in use. (e) Thinning. No person who applies or solicits the application of any\narchitectural coating shall apply a coating that is thinned to exceed the\napplicable VOC limit specified in subdivision (a) of this section. (f) Rust preventive\ncoatings. No person shall apply or solicit the application of any\nrust preventive coating, manufactured before January 1, 2021, for industrial\nuse, unless such a rust preventive coating complies with the industrial\nmaintenance coating VOC limit specified in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (g) Coatings\nnot listed in subdivision (a) of this section. For any coating that does not meet any of the definitions\nfor the specialty coatings categories listed in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the VOC content limit shall be determined by classifying the coating\nas a flat coating, nonflat coating, or nonflat-high gloss coating as those\nterms are defined in section\n205.2\n(ac), (at) and\n(au)\nof this Part and the corresponding flat\nor nonflat coating VOC limit in subdivision (a) of this section shall\napply. (h) Sell through\nof coatings. A coating manufactured prior to the effective date\nspecified for that coating in subdivision (a) of this section, may be sold, supplied, or offered for sale until May 1, 2023, so long as the coating\ncomplied with standards in effect at the time the coating was\nmanufactured.
