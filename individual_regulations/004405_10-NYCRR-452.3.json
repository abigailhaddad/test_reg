  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 452.3 - Reporting principles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Accrual\nreporting. In order to provide complete, accurate and uniform financial data, all residential health care facilities, including governmental institutions, must report such data on the accural basis. If differences between the results\nof accruing an item and reporting that item on a cash basis are immaterial, accural reporting of that item would be waived. Within these guidelines, therefore, employee vacation, sick time, holidays and personal time must be\naccrued when there is reasonable assurance that a liability does exist and will\nbe liquidated. (b) Matching of\nrevenue and expenses. (1)\n\nSubject to the\nlimitations of subdivision (a) of this section, revenue must be reported in the\nperiod earned, i.e., when the services are rendered and a legal claim arises\nfor the services. Deductions from revenue, including contractual adjustments, are to be given accounting recognition in the same period that the related\nrevenues were recorded. (2)\n\nRevenue\nderived from services must be matched with the cost of providing those\nservices. (3)\n\nRevenue and expenses\nshould be matched for each cost center within the residential health care\nfacility. Therefore, the cost of functions and activities within each cost\ncenter are to be included in accounts designated for that cost center. Revenue\nrelative to such functions and activities must be included in the matching\nrevenue accounts. (4)\n\nFor those\ninstitutions that record charges on an all-inclusive rate basis (a flat charge\nregardless of services performed), a center-by-center matching of cost and\nrevenue at the cost center level would be impossible. Therefore, for these\ninstitutions, the matching of cost and revenue should be accomplished at the\nprogram level. This, however, does not preclude such institutions from\nrecording their costs in the proper cost center. In addition, revenue from\npatients should be reported at gross (the full established rate charged to a\nprivate patient) with a contractual allowance to reflect the difference between\nthe full rate and the amount received from third-party payors. If the\ninstitution is on an all-inclusive rate basis (a flat charge for all services), then the gross rate would be the all-inclusive flat charge. If, however, the\ninstitution utilized a fee-for-service basis (a separate charge for each\nservice provided), the gross charge for each service and patient must be\nreflected. (c) Fund\naccounting. Many residential health care facilities receive funds from donors\nwhich are restricted as to use. These funds must be accounted for separately as\nrestricted funds. This does not preclude the pooling of assets for investment\npurposes. Restricted funds generally fall into three categories: endowment\nfunds, plant replacement and expansion funds, and specific purpose funds. However, certain facilities may also have agency funds to account for funds\nheld for patients. The accounts within each restricted fund are self-balancing, as each fund requires separate fiduciary accountability. The following\nparagraphs outline the conditions and events which require separate\naccountability and the required accounting treatment for transactions within\nthe established funds. (1)\n\nUnrestricted Fund. (i) The Unrestricted Fund is used to account\nfor funds derived from the day-to-day activities of the residential health care\nfacility and unrestricted contributions. Funds which originate from\nunrestricted gifts or previously accumulated income may de desiggnated by the\ngoverning board for special uses. If the governing board designates funds in\nthis manner, it should be recognized that the board also has the authority to\nrescind its action. For this reason, such funds should be accounted for in the\n\nUnrestricted Fund as \"board-designated funds\". A separate structure of accounts\nin the Unrestricted Fund has been provided for these assets. (ii)\n\nThe term restricted should not be used\nin connection with board or other internal appropriations or designations of\nfunds. (2)\n\nEndowment\nfunds. (i) Funds classified as endowment\ninclude: (a) pure endowments (principal is to\nremain intact in perpetuity); and\n(b) term endowments (principal is available\nfor use upon the passage of time or the occurrence of an event). (ii)\n\nWhen term endowments become\navailable to the governing board for unrestricted purposes, they should be\nreported as nonoperating revenue; if these funds are restricted, they should be\ntransferred to the appropriate restricted fund. (iii)\n\nIncome earned on endowment fund\ninvestments should be accounted for in accordance with donors' instructions if\nrestricted, or as nonoperating revenue in the Unrestricted Fund if not\nrestricted. (iv)\n\nUnder section 513\nof the New York State Not-for-Profit Corporation Law, realized gains from the\nsale of endowment fund assets may be available for the general use of the\nresidential health care facility, provided that the amount of fair value of the\nprincipal of such assets as of the end of the fiscal year in which the gains\nare recorded is not less than the amount of fair value of such assets at the\ntime they were originally received by the home. Realized gains that were\ntreated as additions to principal before the effective date of this section of\nlaw, September 1, 1970, may be available to the residential health care\nfacility under the aforementioned conditions in an amount not to exceed 20\npercent of such gains in one year. (3)\n\nPlant Replacement and Expansion Funds. (i) Resources restricted by donors and other\nthird-parties for the acquisition or construction of plant assets or the\nreduction of related debt must be accounted for in the Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion Fund. (ii)\n\nWhen\nexpenditures for plant assets are made by the Unrestricted Fund for the Plant\n\nReplacement and Expansion Fund, a transfer must be made from the Plant\n\nReplacement and Expansion Fund to match such expenditures if such funds are\navailable. (iii)\n\nDue to/due from\naccounts are to be used only as an interim measure, and must be reduced within\na reasonable period of time by a transfer of physical assets (generally cash or\ninvestments) between the respective funds. (iv)\n\nIf expenditures for plant assets are\nmade in the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, the plant assets must be\ntransferred to the Unrestricted Fund, with the accompanying credit made to the\n\nOperating Fund Balance--Transfers from restricted funds for capital outlays. In\nthe Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund, fund balance would be debited, and a\ncash account credited. No entry would be made to the interfund payable or\nreceivable accounts. (v) Income\nearned and any net realized gains on investments should be reflected as an\naddition to the fund balance if so specified by the donor. If available for\ngeneral operating purposes, they should be included in nonoperating revenue in\nthe Unrestricted Fund. (4)\n\nSpecific Purpose Fund. (i) Funds received which are restricted for a\nspecific purpose should be accounted for in a separate restricted fund\n(Specific Purpose Fund). These resources must be recorded as other operating\nrevenue in the period in which expenditures are made for the purpose specified\nby the donor. (ii)\n\nIncome earned\nand any net realized gains on investments should be recorded as an addition to\nfund balance if required to conform to the donor's instructions or as\nnonoperating revenue of the Unrestricted Fund if such revenue is available for\ngeneral purposes. (d) Investments in marketable securities. Investments in marketable securities are to be valued at cost if purchased or, if acquired by donation, at the fair market value at the date of the gift. If\nthere is evidence of a permanent decline in value, an appropriate reduction in\ncarrying value must be made. (e) Pooled investments. (1)\n\nInvestments of\nvarious funds may be pooled unless prohibited by law or the terms of a donation\nor grant. Gains/losses and investment income on pooled investments should be\ndistributed to participating funds on a basis utilizing market value. (2)\n\nThe distribution of the income for the\nfirst year would be based on each participating fund's percentage of the pool, based on its contribution at market value at the initiation of the pool. For\nsubsequent periods, the distribution percentage for the income and gains on\npooled investments for each of the participating funds would be based on the\nmarket value of the investment pool as of the date of the last addition. Each\ntime an addition is made to the investment pool, a new distribution basis must\nbe calculated. This is also true for any reductions to the pool. All\ngains/losses and investment income from the beginning of the accounting period\nup to the date of the addition must be determined and distributed on the basis\nprior to the addition. Any gains/losses and investment income subsequent to an\naddition would be distributed on the new basis until another addition or\nreduction is made. (f) Inventories. (1)\n\nInventories reflect the cost\nof unused residential health care facility supplies and should be carried at\ncost or market, whichever is lower. Any generally accepted cost method (e.g., FIFO, LIFO, average, etc.) may be used as long as it is consistent with that of\nthe preceeding reporting period. Cost of inventories based on the last invoice\nprice is not an acceptable method for determining such cost. (2)\n\nPerpetual inventory record systems are\nrecommended. Physical valuations must be made at least once a year and the\naccounting records and perpetual records, if applicable, adjusted to such\nvaluations. Physical valuations on a cycle basis are acceptable if perpetual\ninventory record systems are used by the residential health care\nfacility. (3)\n\nInventory usage\nrecords of some sort should be maintained for all inventories that are\ndistributed and used by more than one department or cost center in the\nresidential health care facility. It is recommended that a formal requisition\nsystem be used for this purpose. (4)\n\nWhere inventory had not been recorded in\nthe past, the cumulative effect of establishing such amounts will be reflected\nin accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. (5)\n\nWhile the taking of a physical inventory\nis mandated, the independent public accountant shall determine whether or not\nthey should observe the physical evaluation of inventory for the purpose of\nexpressing an opinion on the financial statements. (g) Accounting for property, plant and\nequipment. (1)\n\nClassification of fixed asset\nexpenditures. Property, plant and equipment and related liabilities must be\nrecorded in the Unrestricted Fund, since segregation in a separate fund would\nimply the existence of restrictions on the use of the asset. Costs of\nconstruction in progress and related liabilities should be recorded in or\ntransferred to the Unrestricted Fund as incurred except for assets and\nliabilities related to the proceeds of debt. For those areas, refer to\nparagraph (n)(3) of this section. (2)\n\nBasis of valuation. Property, plant and\nequipment must be recorded on the basis of cost. Cost shall be defined as\nhistorical cost or fair market value at the date of gift, for donated property, less any applicable salvage value. (3)\n\nAccounting control. To maintain\naccounting control over capital assets of the residential health care facility, a plant asset ledger should be maintained as part of the general accounting\nrecords. Some items of equipment should be treated as individual units within\nthe plant ledger when their individuality and unit cost justify such treatment. Other items of equipment, if they are similar and are used in a single cost\ncenter, may be grouped together and treated as a single unit within the ledger. The plant ledger should be segregated by cost center so that the cost of\nequipment and the related depreciation for each center is available. Those\nproviders who are not able to identify historical costs and depreciation by\ndepartment for major movable acquisitions prior to January 1, 1978, may use\nsquare feet net to allocate depreciation by department. All additions to major\nmovable equipment as of January 1, 1978 and thereafter must be identified by\ncost center. (4)\n\nCapitalization\npolicy. Each residential health care facility must set a standard policy with\nrespect to the capitalization of its depreciable assets. This policy, excluding\nminor equipment, must meet the following specifications: (i) The minimum capitalization policy must\nfollow the guidelines and amounts required in the Medicare\nregulations. (ii)\n\nNormal repair and\nmaintenance and modernization to maintain depreciable assets should not be\ncapitalized if the life of the asset is not materially extended. (iii)\n\nSignificant alterations and renovations\nshould be capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives, which\nshould not exceed the lives of the assets to which they are fixed. (5)\n\nMinor equipment. Minor\nequipment includes such items as wastebaskets, bedpans, syringes, catheters, silverware, mops, buckets, etc. The general characteristics of this equipment\nare: (i) in general, no fixed location, and\nsubject to use by various departments within a residential health care\nfacility; (ii)\ncomparatively small\nin size and unit cost; (iii)\nsubject to inventory control; (iv)\nfairly large quantity in use; and\n(v) generally, a useful life of approximately\nthree years or less. The cost of minor equipment is to be reported in\naccordance with Medicare regulations. (6)\n\nInterest expense during period of\nconstruction. Frequently, residential health care facilities borrow funds to\nconstruct new facilities or to modernize and expand existing facilities. Interest costs incurred during the period of construction must be capitalized\nas a part of the cost of the construction. The period of construction is\nconsidered to extend to the date the constructed asset is put into use. When\nproceeds from a construction loan are invested and income is derived from such\ninvestments during the construction period, the amount of interest expense to\nbe capitalized must be reduced by the amount of such income. (7)\n\nDepreciation policies. (i) Depreciation on plant assets used in the\nresidential health care facility's operations should be recorded as an\noperating expense in the Unrestricted Fund. The straight-line method of\ndepreciation must be used for uniform reporting. (ii)\n\nThe estimated lives used in computing\ndepreciation should be taken from the recommendations made in the Estimated\n\nUseful Lives of Depreciable Hospital Assets, published by the American Hospital\n\nAssociation ( 1973), or other acceptable sources. However, with the rapidly\nchanging technology in residential health care facilities, these\nrecommendations may not be all-inclusive; in which case, the expertise of the\nmanufacturer or other reliable source may be considered subject to approval by\nthe New York State Department of Health. (iii)\n\nEach residential health care facility\nmust establish, and consistently follow, a policy relative to the amount of\ndepreciation to be taken in the year of acquisition on normal annual additions. Examples of acceptable policies are: (a) recording first-year depreciation based upon the number of actual months the\nasset was in use during the first year; (b) recording one half of the annual\ndepreciation expense in the years of acquisition and disposal, regardless of\nthe date of acquisition; (c) recording no depreciation in the year of acquisition and a full year's\ndepreciation in the year of disposal; or\n(d) recording a full year's depreciation\nexpense if the asset was acquired in the first half of the year. If the asset\nwas acquired in the last half of the year, no depreciation expense would be\nrecognized in the year of acquisition. The above alternatives are acceptable for normal annual\nadditions to plant assets. However, when major construction projects are\ncompleted and capitalized, first-year depreciation must be computed based upon\nthe actual number of months the asset was in use, if the application of any\nother method results in a material mismatching of revenue and expense in the\ninitial year. (8)\n\nDisposal of plant assets. Plant assets\nmay be retired voluntarily, or disposed of by sale, trade or abandonment, or\ninvoluntarily lost as a result of casualty such as fire or storm. At the date\nof the retirement or disposal, the cost of the asset and its related\naccumulated depreciation must be removed from the accounts. Any resulting gain\nor loss on the retirement or disposal is to be reported as nonoperating\nrevenue/expense. (h) Investment tax credit. (1)\n\nAs contained in\nAPB Opinion No. 2, issued by the American Institute of Certified Public\n\nAccountants, the investment tax credit may be accounted for in one of the\nfollowing manners: (i) the allowable\ninvestment credit may be taken as a reduction of Federal income taxes in the\nyear in which the credit arises (flow-through method); or\n(ii)\nthe allowable investment credit may be\nreflected in net income over the productive life of the asset and not in the\nyear in which it is placed in service (deferral method). (2)\n\nOnce a residential health care facility\nhas applied one of these methods, that method must be used consistently\nthereafter. (i) Leases. Often a facility will obtain the use of land, buildings, or equipment by\nentering into an agreement to lease them from an outside party. In some cases, a lease is merely obtaining the use of an asset for a specified period; however, under certain conditions a lease is considered to be, in substance, a\npurchase of property. For determination of the acceptable accounting treatment\nfor leases, reference should be made to Accounting for Leases--Statement of\n\nFinancial Accounting Standards No. 13. (j) Timing differences. Timing differences\nresult when accounting policies and practices used in an organization's\naccounting differ from those used for reporting operations to governmental\nunits collecting taxes or to outside agencies making payments based upon the\nreported operations. These differences must be recorded on the residential\nhealth care facility's records when they arise. The references relative to\ntheir acceptable accounting treatment are as follows: (1)\nincome tax allocation--accounting\nprinciples--Board Opinions Nos. 11, 23 and 24; (2)\nthird-party cost reimbursement--timing\ndifferences--Hospital Audit Guide. (k) Accounting for pledges. All pledges, less\na provision for amounts estimated to be uncollectible, should be included in\nthe residential health care facility's records. If unrestricted, they should be\nrecorded as nonoperating revenue. If restricted, they should be recorded as an\naddition to the appropriate restricted fund balance. (l) Self-insurance. Self-insurance by a\nresidential health care facility for potential losses due to malpractice\nclaims, asserted or otherwise, places all or part of the risk of such losses on\nthe residential health care facility rather than insuring against all or part\nof such losses with an independent insurer. Accruing for self-insured losses is\ngoverned by the Financial Accounting Standards Board's Statement No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. (1)\n\nParagraph 8\nof that statement indicates that \"an estimated loss from a loss contingency can\nonly be accrued as a charge to income if both of the following conditions are\nmet: (i) \"Information available prior to\nissuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an\nasset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the\nfinancial statements. It is implicit in this condition that it must be probable\nthat one or more future events will occur confirming the fact of the\nloss. (ii)\n\"The amount of loss can\nbe reasonably estimated.\"\n(2)\n\nParagraphs 29 and 30 of that statement\nstate: (i) \"An enterprise may choose not to\npurchase insurance against risk of loss that may result from injury to others, damage to the property of others, or interruption of its business operations. Exposure to risks of those types constitutes an existing condition involving\nuncertainty about the amount and timing of any losses that may occur, in which\ncase a contingency exists... (ii)\n\"Mere exposure to risks of those types, however, does not mean that an asset\nhas been impaired or a liability has been incurred. The condition for accrual\nin paragraph 8(a) is not met with respect to loss that may result from injury\nto others, damage to the property of others, or business interruption that may\noccur after the date of an enterprise's financial statements. Losses of those\ntypes do not relate to the current or a prior period but rather to the future\nperiod in which they occur. Thus, for example, an enterprise with a fleet of\nvehicles should not accrue for injury to others or damage to the property of\nothers that may be caused by those vehicles in the future, even if the amount\nof those losses may be reasonably estimable. On the other hand, the conditions\nin paragraph 8 would be met with respect to uninsured losses resulting from\ninjury to others or damage to the property of others that took place prior to\nthe date of the financial statements, even though the enterprise may not become\naware of those matters until after that date, if the experience of the\nenterprise or other information enables it to make a reasonable estimate of the\nloss that was incurred prior to the date of its financial\nstatements.\"\n(3)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this Article, a reasonable estimate of current and prior unasserted\nself-insurance claims can only be made by an independent professional qualified\nto make such valuations. If an estimate is obtained, such amount should be\nrecorded on the books of the residential health care facility. (m) Other related organizations. Auxiliaries, guilds, fund-raising groups and other related organizations\nfrequently assist residential health care facilities. If such organizations are\nindependent and are characterized by their own charter, bylaws, tax-exempt\nstatus and governing board, or a sufficient combination of these\ncharacteristics, to demonstrate their independent existence from the\nresidential health care facility, the financial reporting of these\norganizations should be separate from reports of the residential health care\nfacility. If such organizations are under the control of (or common control\nwith) residential health care facilities and handle residential health care\nfacility resources, their financial reports should be combined with those of\nthe residential health care facility. (n) Debt financing for plant replacement and\nexpansion purposes. Debt financing for plant replacement and expansion programs\nmay take many forms. Under the terms of most debt financing agreements, the\ndebtor is required to perform or is prohibited from performing certain acts. In\nmany instances, such financing gives rise to special accounting treatment\nbecause of discounts and premiums on bond issues, financing charges, formal\nrestrictions on debt proceeds, sinking and other required funds. (1)\n\nDiscounts and premiums on bond issues. Discounts and premiums arising from the issue of bonds must be amortized over\nthe life of the related issue(s). For reporting purposes, bond discounts must\nbe reported as a reduction of the related debt (Bonds Payable--New of\n\nUnamortized Discount). Bond premium must be reported as Other Deferred\n\nCredits. (2)\n\nFinancing charges. All\ncosts of obtaining debt financing other than discounts (e.g., legal fees, underwriting fees, special accounting costs) should be recorded as deferred\ncosts and amortized over the life of the related debt. (3)\n\nAccounting for debt proceeds. (i) Debt agreements which finance plant\nreplacement and expansion programs may or may not require formal segregation of\ndebt proceeds prior to their use. Proceeds which are not required to be\nformally segregated prior to their uses should be reported as other noncurrent\nassets in the unrestricted funds. However, proceeds which require formal\nsegregation have been recorded in several ways, specifically: (a) as a separate restricted fund which\nincludes all of the attendant liabilities and any required equity contribution, as in the case of financing through New York State Housing Finance Agency; or\n(b) as part of the restricted\nplant replacement and expansion funds, which include all of the attendant\nliabilities; or\n(c) the liabilities\nare reflected in the unrestricted fund and only the proceeds are reflected in a\nrestricted fund. The proceeds, however, are not considered as an addition to\nthe restricted fund balance but rather as a liability to the unrestricted fund. This liability is reduced as the proceeds are used for their intended\npurposes. (ii)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this Article, all funds received from debt arrangements which\nrequire formal segregation and/or separate accountability shall be reported in\nthe plant replacement and expansion funds until such time as the project is\ncompleted and used. This fund will include all construction in progress costs\nand all liabilities related to the debt arrangement and construction\nproject. (iii)\n\nThere may be\ninstances where a portion of a restricted project's costs are to be funded from\nunrestricted resources. In these instances, any unrestricted funds required for\nthe project will be transferred to the plant replacement and expansion funds\nand considered to be part of the depreciation funding requirement for the\nperiod in which the transfer of such assets will be accounted for as an\ninterfund receivable/liability between the unrestricted funds and the plant\nreplacement and expansion funds, rather than additions/reductions to the fund\nbalances of such funds. (iv)\n\nWhen\nthe project is completed, the assets and liabilities of the project will be\ntransferred to the appropriate unrestricted fund asset and liability accounts, except for any residual liquid assets that may be restricted for future\nspecified use under the debt agreement. Such excess restricted assets must\nremain in the plant replacement and expansion funds. However, if the source of\nsuch excess funds is the proceeds of the debt financing arrangement, an\ninterfund receivable/liability must be established between the unrestricted\nfund and the plant replacement and expansion funds, since the debt financing\nliability will be in the unrestricted funds. Any income generated from the\ninvestment of such funds will be either added to the appropriate plant\nreplacement and expansion fund balance if restricted, or added to nonoperating\nrevenue in the unrestricted funds if available for general purposes. (v) The aforementioned treatment of\nrestricted project funds would be applicable to New York State Housing\n\nFinancing Agency (article 28-A) financing, New York State Dormitory Authority\nfinancing, and any other financing which requires segregation and/or separate\naccountability of project funds. (4)\n\nSinking and other required funds. (i) These funds are usually established to\ncomply with loan provisions whereby specific deposits are to be used to insure\nthat adequate funds are available to meet future payments of: (a) interest and principal (retirement of\nindebtedness funds); or\n(b) property insurance, related taxes, repairs and maintenance costs, equipment\nreplacement (escrow funds). Funds of this nature may also be required to be\nheld by trustees outside the residential health care facility. Income generated\nfrom the investment of such funds may be immediately available to the\nresidential health care facility or such income may be held by the trustee for\nsome future designated purpose. (ii)\n\nFor the purpose of this Article, all\nsinking and other required funds will be accounted for in the following manner: (a) All fund assets, whether trusted or\notherwise, will be reported in the plant replacement and expansion funds. However, if the source of such funds is either the proceeds from debt financing\nand the liability is a part of the unrestricted funds, or previously\nunrestricted resources, then the transfer of such assets to the plant\nreplacement and expansion fund must be accounted for as an interfund\nreceivable/liability. (b) All\nincome generated from the investment of such funds will be reported, as earned, in appropriate plant replacement and expansion fund balance. When such income\nis available for the replacement of assets, reduction of debt or payment of\noperating expenditures, it will be reported as a transfer from the appropriate\nplant replacement and expansion fund balance to the unrestricted fund\nbalance. (5)\n\nArticle 28-A residential health care facilities. (i) Many residential health care facilities\nhave been organized under article 28-A of the Public Health Law and have\nbeen/are subject to the accounting treatment described in the Accounting Manual\nfor Nursing Home Companies, published by the New York State Department of\n\nHealth. Certain accounting procedures set forth in the article 28-A manual were\npromulgated to reflect reimbursement policies rather than Generally Accepted\n\nAccounting Principles (GAAP). This Article, as of its effective date, will\nprovide the accounting policies and procedures to be followed by all 28-A\nfacilities. (ii)\n\nThe major\ndifferences in accounting treatment between this Article and the 28-A manual\nhave been set forth below: (a) An article\n28-A residential health care facility accounts for a development period, which\nis the period from the inception of the residential health care facility to the\nday preceding the permanent financial occupancy date. Included in the\ndevelopment period in an initial occupancy period, which is the period\ncommencing with the first of the month prior to the admission of the first\npatient and ending with the day preceding the permanent financial occupancy\ndate. (1)\n\nThe permanent financial occupancy\ndate is declared by the Commissioner of Health or his designee after a facility\nhas had patients for several months. The development period may be as long as\nseveral years. (2)\n\nDuring the\ndevelopment period, certain costs, including interest, architect fees, legal\nfees, accounting fees, etc., are recorded as other development period costs and\nare capitalized and included on he facility's balance sheet. After receipt of\nthe permanent financial occupancy date, these costs are depreciated over a\ndetermined period of time. (3)\n\nFor\nthe purpose of reporting to the State under this Article, these development\nperiod costs must be allocated to the project assets and depreciated over the\nlife of the respective assets. (b) The Accounting Manual for Nursing Home\n\nCompanies suggests that retroactive adjustments from third-party payors be\nrecorded as other operating revenue. As set forth in the Hospital Audit\n\nGuide,published by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles require retroactive adjustments from\nthird-party payors to be recorded as an adjustment to the contractual allowance\naccount(s).
