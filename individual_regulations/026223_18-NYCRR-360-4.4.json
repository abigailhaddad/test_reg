(2)\n\nTransfers made by an applicant/recipient\nor his/her spouse on or after August 11, 1993. (i) Definitions. (a) Assets include all income and resources\nof the individual and of the individual's spouse, including income or resources\nto which the individual or the individual's spouse is entitled but does not\nreceive because of any action or inaction by: (1)\nthe individual or the individual's\nspouse; (2)\na person with legal\nauthority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual or the individual's\nspouse; (3)\na person acting at the\ndirection of or upon the behalf of the individual or the individual's spouse; or\n(4)\na court or administrative\nbody with legal authority to act in place of or on behalf of the individual or\nthe individual's spouse or at the direction or upon the request of the\nindividual or the individual's spouse.

(ii)\n\nGeneral\nrule.

(a) Any transfer made under this paragraph\nwill cause the applicant/recipient to be ineligible for nursing facility\nservices for a period of months equal to the total, cumulative, uncompensated\nvalue of all assets transferred during or after the look-back period divided by\nthe average cost of care to a private patient for nursing facility services in\nthe region in which such individual is institutionalized, on the date the\nindividual first applies or recertifies for MA as an institutionalized\nindividual. For purposes of this subparagraph, the cost of care to a private\npatient in the region in which the individual is institutionalized will be\npresumed to be 120 percent of the average MA rate for nursing facility care for\nthe facilities within the region. The average regional rate will be updated\neach January first by the department. The regions will be the same as those\nestablished by section\n2807-c\nof\nthe Public Health Law. (b) The\nperiod of ineligibility begins with the first day of the first month during or\nafter which assets have been transferred for less than fair market value, and\nwhich does not occur in any other period of ineligibility under this\nsubdivision. (v) Transfers for the sole benefit of a spouse. A transfer by an individual to\nanother is for the sole benefit of the individual's spouse if: the terms and\nconditions of the transfer are specified in a written instrument of transfer\n(such as a trust document, deed, or other signed and acknowledged statement), which is executed at or about the time of transfer, clearly limiting the use\nand enjoyment of the transferred property to the individual's spouse; or there\nis other evidence, including evidence demonstrating a continuous course of\nconduct by the person to whom the assets were transferred, establishing that\nthe use and enjoyment of the transferred property has been, and will continue\nto be, limited to the individual's spouse. Any subsequent action by the\nindividual's spouse, or by the person to whom the assets were transferred for\nthe spouse's benefit, which reduces or eliminates the spouse's beneficial use\nof the transferred property, or the ownership or control of the person to whom\nthe assets were transferred, may be considered a transfer of assets on the date\nsuch action is taken. The establishment of a trust for the benefit of a spouse\nwill not be considered a transfer for the sole benefit of such spouse if: during the life of the trust, the trustee has the authority to make\ndistributions for the benefit of anyone other than the spouse; or the trust\nprovides that upon its termination, all or part of the remaining principal and\nincome is to be distributed to someone other than the MA applicant/recipient, or the spouse's estate. (vi)\n\nJointly-owned assets. In the case of an asset held by an individual in common\nwith another person or persons in a joint tenancy, tenancy in common, or\nsimilar arrangement, the asset or the affected portion of the asset will be\nconsidered to be transferred by such individual when any action is taken, either by such individual or by any other person, that reduces or eliminates\nsuch individual's ownership or control of such asset. (vii)\n\nApportioning periods of ineligibility. In the case of a transfer by the spouse of an individual which results in a\nperiod of ineligibility for the individual, if the spouse becomes eligible for\nMA before such period of ineligibility ends, the remaining portion of the\nperiod of ineligibility will be divided equally between the individual and the\nspouse so long as both remain eligible for MA. (d) Income-producing property. Income-producing property includes but is not limited to real property, buildings, liquid business resources, motor vehicles, machinery, livestock, government permits, inventories, tools, and equipment which are used in a trade\nor business or which produce rents or land-use fees. Certain income-producing\nproperty is not considered an available resource for purposes of determining MA\neligibility. (1)\n\nFor needy individuals under\n21, persons ineligible for ADC solely because their income and resources exceed\nthe ADC eligibility standards, and parents described in section\n360-3.3\n(b)(7)\nof\nthis Part: (i) the total equity value of\nnonliquid resources which generate rental income, real property, and buildings\nis an available resource if the property produces an annual net return of less\nthan six percent of its equity value. If the property produces a net return on\nequity of six percent or more, the amount of equity value of the property above\n$12,000, if any, is an available resource; and\n(ii)\none-quarter of the amount of liquid\nresources needed annually to operate a trade or business is not considered an\navailable resource. However, if the applicant/recipient demonstrates that he or\nshe will have to expend a higher amount of liquid resources to operate his or\nher trade or business in the three-month period beginning with the month of MA\napplication, the higher amount will not be considered an available resource; and\n(iii)\nexcept as provided in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, all other income-producing property is not\nconsidered an available resource for this group of MA\napplicants/recipients. (2)\n\nFor aged, certified blind, or certified\ndisabled applicants/recipients, effective May 1, 1990: (i) the equity value of income-producing\nproperty used in a trade or business is not considered an available resource; and\n(ii)\nthe equity value of\nincome-producing property not used in a trade or business is considered an\navailable resource if the property: consists of real property or other\nnonliquid property which generates rental income, land-use fees, or other\nincome; and produces an annual net return of less than six percent of its\nequity value. If such property produces an annual net return of six percent or\nmore, the amount of equity value of the property above $12,000, if any, is\nconsidered an available resource; and\n(iii)\nexcept as provided in paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision, all other income-producing property is not considered an\navailable resource for this group of MA applicants/recipients. (3)\n\nFor all medically needy MA\napplicants/recipients, if the equity value of real property and buildings used\nto produce goods or services for personal use exceeds $12,000 is an available\nresource. All other property used to produce personal goods or services is not\nconsidered an available resource. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
