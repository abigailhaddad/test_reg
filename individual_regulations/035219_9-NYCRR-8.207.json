CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York and Section 28 of Article 2-B of the Executive Law, do hereby\nfind that a disaster is imminent for which the affected local governments are\nunable to respond adequately. Therefore, I hereby declare a State Disaster\n\nEmergency effective December 17, 2020 within the territorial boundaries of the\ncounties of Albany, Broome, Chenango, Columbia, Delaware, Dutchess, Greene, Montgomery, Orange, Otsego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady, Schoharie, Sullivan, Tioga, Ulster, Washington, and contiguous counties.
