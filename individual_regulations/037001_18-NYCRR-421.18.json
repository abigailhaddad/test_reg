  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 421.18 - Special provisions for adoptive placement\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach authorized agency shall: (a) Prior to placement of a child for\nadoption, inform prospective adoptive parents of the procedures necessary for\nfinalizing an adoption in accordance with section\n421.19\n(i)(5)\nof\nthis Part. (b) (1)\n\nAt the time prospective adoptive parents\nindicate a desire to adopt a particular child, inform such parents if the child\nhas minor siblings or half-siblings, and, if so, whether the minor siblings or\nhalf-siblings are free for adoption. Such parents must be asked if they would\nalso be willing to adopt the child's minor siblings or half-siblings who are\nfree for adoption. (2)\n\nDiscuss with\nthe adoptive parents their willingness to facilitate contact between the\nadopted child and any siblings or half-siblings of such child, and inform the\nadoptive parents of the availability of services, if any, to assist in\nestablishing and maintaining sibling contact. (c) Make an effort to place each child in a\nhome as similar to and compatible with his or her religious background as\npossible with particular recognition that section\n373\n(3)\nof the Social Services Law requires a\ncourt, when practicable, to give custody through adoption only to persons of\nthe same religious faith as that of the child. (d) Make placement decisions on the basis of\nthe best interests of the child, including but not limited to: (1)\nconsideration of the appropriateness of\nplacement in terms of the age of the child and of the adoptive\nparent(s); (2)\nconsideration of the\nphysical and emotional needs of the child in relation to the characteristics, capacities, strengths and weaknesses of the adoptive parent(s). When making\nplacement decisions, an authorized agency may consider the cultural, ethnic or\nracial background of the child and the capacity of the adoptive parent to meet\nthe needs of the child with such a background as one of a number of factors\nused to determine best interests. Race, color or national origin of the child\nor the adoptive parent may be considered only where it can be demonstrated to\nrelate to the specific needs of an individual child; and\n(3)\nthe requirement of authorized agencies to\nplace minor siblings or half-siblings together in accordance with section\n421.2\n(e) of this\n\nPart, unless the social services district, or the voluntary authorized agency\nwith the guardianship and custody, has determined such placement to be\ndetrimental to the best interests of one or more of the children. Such\ndetermination must establish that the placement would be contrary to the\nhealth, safety or welfare of one or more of the children. The determination\nmust be made after consultation with, or an evaluation by, other professional\nstaff, such as a licensed psychologist, psychiatrist, other physician, or\ncertified social worker. Factors to be considered in making a determination of\nwhether siblings or half-siblings may be placed separately must include, but\nare not limited to: (i) the age differences\namong the siblings; (ii)\nthe health\nand developmental differences among the siblings; (iii)\nthe emotional relationship of the\nsiblings to each other; (iv)\nthe\nindividual service needs of the siblings; and\n(v) the attachment of the individual siblings\nto separate families/locations. The factors used by the social services district to\ndetermine whether siblings or half-siblings are to be placed separately must be\ndocumented in the children's uniform case records in accordance with section\n428.6\nof this Title. In the case\nof a child in the guardianship and custody of a voluntary authorized agency, the factors used to determine whether the child and the child's siblings or\nhalf-siblings are to be placed separately must be documented in the children's\ncase records. (e) Prior to the initial visit, ensure that\nthe potential adoptive parent(s) have the opportunity to discuss and be fully\ninformed about the child and that information specified in subdivision (b) of\nthis section is provided. (f) Arrange the initial visit of the child with the prospective adoptive parent(s)\nat a time and place convenient for all. (g) Insure that placement occurs when child\nand parents are ready. (h) At the\ntime a child is placed in a prospective adoptive home, notify the prospective\nadoptive parent(s) in writing of his or her right to a fair hearing when a\nsocial services official fails to provide adoption services or assistance on\nbehalf of a child freed for adoption when such services or assistance are\nauthorized to be provided pursuant to section\n372-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law or the State Consolidated Services Plan. (i) Arrange for contact between the adoptive\nparents and the caseworker within five working days after placement. (j) Offer a personal interview to a family\nwho has refused a child in order to identify their reasons for refusal and to\nclarify their adoption plans. (k) At the time of placement require the adoptive parents and a duly appointed\nagency representative to sign an adoptive placement agreement that shall\ncontain a statement of rights and responsibilities of the parents and the\nagency. (l) At the time of\nplacement, enter the following information about the placement in a bound book\nin accordance with subdivision 5 of section\n384\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law: (1)\nthe date of\nplacement; (2)\nthe date of the\nplacement agreement; (3)\nthe name\nand address of the adoptive parents; and\n(4)\nthe first name of the child. (m) To the extent available, provide to prospective adoptive parent(s) the psychological and medical\nhistories, as described in section\n373-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, of a child legally freed for adoption as well as that\nof his or her biological parents. In the case of finalized adoptions, such\ninformation shall be provided, upon request, to the child's adoptive parents. In all cases, information identifying biological parents shall be eliminated\nfrom all such psychological and medical histories. Agencies shall provide\nassistance to prospective adoptive parent(s) and adoptive parent(s) to\nunderstand the psychological and medical reports and the implications of such\nreports for the child's health. (n) (1)\n\nWhere the person whose application to\nbecome an adoptive parent has been approved, but whose request to adopt a\nparticular child who is eligible for adoption has been denied or not acted upon\nwithin 60 days of the request, and where such person is a foster parent seeking\nto adopt a child in his or her care or where a person seeking to adopt a child\nwho is related within the second degree to the applicant or where the denial or\ndelay is based in whole or in part upon the location of such person outside of\nthe social services district or State of the authorized agency with custody of\nthe particular child, inform such person that he or she has a right to a\nhearing to review such denial or failure to act if the request is made within\n60 days of the denial or failure to act. Such hearing shall be conducted in\naccordance with section\n372-e\n(4)\nof the Social Services Law. (2)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, a child\nwho is related within the second degree to the applicant shall be the\napplicant's grandchild, nephew, niece, sibling, half-brother or\nhalf-sister. (o) Where a\nperson has been approved as the adoptive parent for a child in residential\ncare, comply with the requirements of section\n421.19\n(i) of this\n\nPart. (p) At the time of placement, inform the adoptive parents of the right of an adopted person 18 years of age\nor older, or if the adopted person is deceased, the adopted person's direct\nline descendants, or the lawful representative of such adopted person or lawful\nrepresentative of such deceased adopted person's direct line descendants, as\nthe case may be, either to receive from the commissioner of the New York State\n\nDepartment of Health, the commissioner of Health and Mental Hygiene of the City\nof New York, the applicable local registrar or any person authorized by such\ncommissioner or local registrar a certified copy of the adopted person's\noriginal long form birth certificate, including any change attached to that\ncertificate by a biological parent or parents and any information provided to\nsuch commissioner or local registrar in accordance with state law or, where it\nis impossible for such commissioner or local registrar to provide a copy of the\noriginal long form birth certificate of a person adopted in this state and such\ncertificate is not part of the records of such commissioner or local registrar, to receive from an authorized agency, as defined in paragraphs (a) and (b) of\nsubdivision 10 of section\n371\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law, identifying information regarding the adopted person and\nthe adopted person's biological parents that would otherwise appear on an\noriginal long form birth certificate in this state.
