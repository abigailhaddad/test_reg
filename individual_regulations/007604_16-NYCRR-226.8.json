  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 226.8 - Domestic meters-in-test programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Domestic meter in-test\nprogram. After installation, all domestic meters shall receive an\nin-test at least once every seven years, except as otherwise provided in\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. In-tests of meters shall be made at\nambient temperature conditions at the same open and check test flow rates as\nused for out-tests specified in section\n226.6\n(a) of this\n\nPart. Where possible, all in-tests shall be performed within 60 working days\nafter removal from customers' premises. (b) Alternate domestic meter in-test\nprogram. (1)\n\nInitial notification. In\nlieu of the schedule of testing set forth in subdivision (a) of this section, any utility may apply to department staff for approval to adopt the alternate\ndomestic meter in-test program described in this subdivision. The initial\napplication for approval and any subsequent revisions shall include full\nformulation of said program complying with paragraphs (2) through (9) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nCategories and\ntest groups. All meters in use shall be segregated into categories based on\ndelivered volume and grouped into test groups based upon performance. (i) All meters shall be first grouped into\ncategory A. Any utility having more than 100,000 domestic meters in service may\nfurther separate those meters servicing minimum bill customers into category B\nand those registering 360 CCF or less in the preceding calendar year into\ncategory C. A minimum bill customer shall be any customer whose average monthly\nconsumption registered on the meter during the preceding calendar year did not\nexceed the minimum consumption indicated in the initial block of the utility's\nrate schedule for residential customers. (ii)\n\nThe meters in each category shall be\ngrouped into test groups as follows: Test group\n\nCalculated annual test rate\n(%)\n0\n2.00\n1\n4.00-4.99\n2\n5.00-5.99\n3\n6.00-7.99\n4\n8.00 and above\n5\n\nApproved retirement program\n\nTest group five shall be composed of all meters included in\nan approved retirement program. In the event that a utility has more than one\nretirement program in progress each program will be clearly identified and\nreported on separate forms. The total number of meters required for test within\ntest groups one, two, three and five in any category shall be determined on the\nbasis of the combined calculated test rate of all meter types within the group. Each type of meter within test group four shall be tested at its calculated\ntest rate in accordance with table 1 of Appendix 7-A of this Title, infra. (iii)\n\nMeter types within each test group\nshall be identifiable by manufacturer and size. In addition, each participating\nutility shall maintain test data segregated by manufacturer, case, size, and\nage group to assist in the analysis of meter performance. (3)\n\nMeters in use shall be segregated into\nage groups in one-year increments as follows: \"Age Group 1\" will include meters\nlast tested within 0 - 12 months, \"Age Group 2\" will include meters last tested\nwithin 13 - 24 months, etc. (4)\n\nMinimum overall test rate. Except as provided in paragraph (6) of this\nsubdivision, the required annual test rate will be used to determine the\nminimum number of meters to be tested from each test group for each approved\nutility in an ensuing calendar year and shall be based upon meter performance\nat the check rate during the preceding calendar year. For example, the\nperformance of meters at each approved utility in calendar year 1993 will\ndetermine the test rate for each meter test group and the number of meters\nrequired to be tested at the utility in calendar year 1995. (i) Category A. Each approved utility shall\ntest its domestic meters as follows: (a) Except as provided for in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, the required\nannual rate of test for each meter type shall not be less than four percent. The annual rate of test shall be determined by using a base of 4.0 percent of\nsuch meters in service where 100 percent of the meters are within ±2.0\npercent of 100 percent proof. For each one percent of the meters found over 2.0\npercent slow, the test rate shall increase 0.133 percent. For each one percent\nof the meters found over 2.0 percent fast, the test rate shall increase 0.267\npercent. (b) The required annual\nrate of test for a meter type in an ensuing year shall be based on the\npreceding year's check rate performance of those meters last tested eight or\nmore years prior. For those meter types in category A where the utility submits\ndata indicating that more than 50 percent of the in-service meters were last\ntested within the previous eight years, the required annual rate of test for a\nmeter type in the ensuing calendar year shall be based on the performance of\nmeters in all age groups tested in the preceding calendar year. (c) Where the calculated test rate is between\n8 and 14 percent, the test rate shall be determined from table 1 of Appendix\n7-A of this Title, infra. (d) Where the calculated test rate exceeds 14\npercent in table 1 of Appendix 7-A of this Title, infra, the\nfollowing test rate shall apply: test rate = 2x+y36, where x = percentage of\nmeters fast and y = percentage of meters slow. (ii)\n\nCategory B. Each approved utility may\ninclude meters servicing minimum bill customers separately in category B and\ntest them as follows: (a) The minimum number\nof category B meters to be tested on an annual basis shall be two percent of\nthe utility's total number of minimum bill meters in service. In addition, on\nan annual basis, two percent of the total number of such meters in service\nshall be inspected for physical integrity and labeled on the customer's\npremises by qualified personnel. The meters inspected and labeled shall be\nthose in service 10 or more years, the majority to be selected from those\nlongest in service. In lieu of the number required for inspection, an equal\nnumber in service 10 or more years may be tested. (b) The utility shall submit an annual\nsummary report of those meters removed for fault and found to be faulty. Each\nreason for removal shall be segregated and reported separately, and will\ninclude the following: leak, does not pass gas, does not register, and meters\nfound on inspection to be unserviceable. (iii)\n\nCategory C. With the exclusion of those\nmeters qualifying for the option provided in category B, each approved utility\nmay include meters registering 360 CCF or less in the preceding calendar year\nseparately in category C and test them as follows: (a) Except as provided for in subparagraph\n(iv) of this paragraph, the annual rate of test for each meter type in an\nensuing year shall be determined by using a base of 3.5 percent of the\nqualifying meters in service where 100 percent of the meters in the preceding\nyear are within ± 2.0 percent of 100 percent proof. For each one percent\nof the meters found over 2.0 percent slow, the test rate shall increase 0.067\npercent. For each one percent of the meters found over 2.0 percent fast, the\ntest rate shall increase 0.133 percent. (b) Where the calculated annual test rate is\nbetween 5.5 and 8.5 percent, the test rate shall be determined from table 2 of\n\nAppendix 7-A of this Title, infra. (c) Where the calculated annual test rate\nexceeds 8.5 percent in table 2 of Appendix 7-A of this Title, infra, the following test rate shall apply: test rate =\n2x+y41.5, where x = percentage of meters fast and y = percentage of meters\nslow. (iv)\n\nFor meter\ntypes where 98 percent upon in-test are found to be within ± 1.5 percent\nof 100 percent proof in a preceding year, the test rate for the ensuing year\nshall be 2.0 percent of those type meters in service. (5)\n\nThe meters tested shall be from all age\ngroups, the majority to be selected from those longest in service. (6)\n\nThe required meter tests for categories A\nand B shall include a minimum of one percent or 100 meters, whichever is less, for each age group in service. In addition, a sufficient number of meters shall\nbe selected from the oldest age groups to comply with paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (7)\n\nMeters removed\nfrom service for reasons other than the requirements set forth in paragraphs\n(4) and (6) of this subdivision may be included for compliance therewith, provided that: (i) the number of meters\nremoved for fault or found faulty that may be credited against the test\nrequirements for any meter type shall not exceed the number of the meters\ntested and found to be in sound condition; and\n(ii)\nmeters that are removed and found to be\ninoperative or leaking shall be reported as such. (8)\n\nUpon submission of a program satisfactory\nto the department staff, as described in subdivision (c) of this section, any\nutility may retire, or accelerate the repair of, any group of meters\nidentifiable by make, type, or any other factor which affects performance. The\nnumber of meters that are removed in excess of the number that is required may\nbe credited to those meters with a history of superior test rates. The number\ncredited to each test group shall be limited to quantities which will assure a\ntwo-percent sample of the superior performing meters. (9)\n\nAny utility that does not meet its annual\ntest requirements, in any test group, shall schedule such deficits in the\nfollowing year's test requirements. Where a utility has exceeded its test\nrequirements in any test group, such meters may be credited toward any deficits\nin the current year requirements, providing that the credits are applied to\nthose meters with a history of superior test rates. A maximum of two percent or\n200 meters, whichever is less, in any test group, may be credited towards the\nfollowing year's test requirements. (c) Retirement program. If a utility files with the department staff a satisfactory\nretirement program for any group of meters identifiable by make, type or any\nother factor which affects performance, the annual testing requirements of said\ntype meter may be made as follows for the program's duration as set forth in\nthe filing: Period of retirement program, years\n\nMinimum percent of\nretired meters to be tested per year\n\nNot more than 15\n20.0\n\nNot more than 10\n15.0\n\nNot more than 5\n10.0\n\nNot more than 2\n0.0\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
