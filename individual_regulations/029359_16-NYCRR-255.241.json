  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.241 - Inspection and test of welds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Visual\ninspection of welding must be conducted by an individual qualified by\nappropriate training and experience to ensure that the welding is performed in\naccordance with the welding procedure and the weld is acceptable under\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (b) The butt welds on each pipeline with a\nnominal diameter greater than two inches (51 millimeters) to be operated at 125\npsig (862 kPa) or more must be nondestructively tested in accordance with\nsection\n255.243\nof this Part. (c) The acceptability of a weld that is\nnondestructively tested or visually inspected is determined according to the\nstandards in section 9 of API Standard 1104 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). However, if a\ngirth weld is unacceptable under those standards for a reason other than a\ncrack, and if the Appendix A to API Standard 1104 applies to the weld, the\nacceptability of the weld may be further determined under that\n\nAppendix. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.241\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
