  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2302.13 - Dissemination-part c\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The primary\npurpose of the New York State title IV of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act dissemination effort is to collect, store, retrieve, and\ndisseminate information needed to identify, validate, replicate, and adopt\neducational programs which address high priority documented need areas. The\ntotal dissemination effort is a systematic one involving close cooperation\namong staff members of the State Education Department, the 44 intermediate\nunits, and local educational agencies. It is carefully linked to and\ncoordinated with all other specific elements of this title IV of the Elementary\nand Secondary Education Act plan. (b) The dissemination effort undertaken will\ninclude the following procedures: (1)\n\nNeeds\nassessment. Documented needs assessments covering the entire State of New York\nand including the perspectives of officials at the local, intermediate, and\n\nState levels will be analyzed to determine what kind of program should receive\na high priority in the dissemination effort. Responsibility for the conduct of\ndesirable needs assessment activities will rest in the State Education Agency\nthrough the Office of ESC General Program Planning. Planning, leadership and\nmanagement for carrying out essential needs assessment activities will\noriginate in that unit. Much of the needs assessment process, however, will be\nconducted in a systematic decentralized manner through the office of the\ndistrict superintendent serving on behalf of the commissioner within each of\nthe 44 education regions in the State. These multi-district-oriented field\nagents and other State Education Department officials will work with local\nschool officials to identify specific target areas, school districts and\nmulti-district regions where high priority needs exist. Information gathered\nthrough the conduct of this needs assessment will serve to focus the\ndissemination effort--and, hence, make it more efficient and effective--by\nidentification of audiences and sub-audiences which can each benefit from\ninformation and experience relative to particular programs. (2)\n\nRequests for proposals (RFP's). The\ndocumented needs assessment will provide a focus for developing RFP's. The\nplanning, program, evaluation and fiscal specifications of the RFP's will be\ndeveloped to insure that projects which are funded under title IV of the\n\nElementary and Secondary Education Act have been designed in such a way that\ninformation about the project needed for its eventual dissemination will be\ncollected systematically throughout its life in an efficient and reliable way. Whenever possible, comparable data will be collected from LEA's allowing more\naccurate analyses of project results and a more reliable set of data for\ndissemination. (3)\n\nProject\nmonitoring. Projects funded with title IV of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act monies will be closely monitored. This monitoring will be carried\nout by teams of SED program specialists (whose membership will be determined by\nthe focused need which the project addresses), locally-oriented field agents, and other consultants as needed. The title IV of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act--part C management system described earlier provides for planned\ninteraction between and among SED field officers, local district officials, and\nappropriate SED staff, coordinated by the Division of ESC General Program\n\nPlanning. This planned exchange of information will include provision for the\nexchange of information about projects at any stage in the\nneed/identification/validation/demonstration/adoption process. SED specialists\nwill be charged with leadership responsibility and skill development in facets\nof information management essential to make the dissemination system work. The\nsystem will make it possible for the documented need of any district in the\n\nState to be cross-checked against all title IV of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act projects in the State: past, ongoing, and planned. (4)\n\nInformation storage and retrieval. (i) The New York State Education Department's\n\nEducational Program and Studies Information Services (EPSIS) will continue to\nplay a critical role in the entire dissemination effort. This unit is charged\nwith coordinating and integrating the State Education Department's\ndissemination activities. At the same time it serves as the central locus in\nthe continuing development of a statewide dissemination network for the\ngathering, storage, transmission and retrieval of information. Currently, there\nare 42 such locally-oriented sub-centers operating as information linkages\nbetween one another and the State Education Department. (ii)\n\nSpecifically, through EPSIS one may\nminimally store an abstract and critical descriptors of all Title IV projects. Similar descriptors of documented educational needs will permit a rapid scan to\ndetermine if any programs exist that address themselves to special needs. Additionally, EPSIS serves as the SEA unit with access to the National ERIC\nData Base. LEA's planning projects will be able to request reviews of research\nand literature which will serve as a basis to insure that their projects\nreflect the latest knowledge and practices known to the national community of\neducators. (5)\n\nTechnical\nassistance. The State Education Department will make technical assistance\navailable to eligible school districts in general (see section\n2302.32\nof this Title) and to\ndistricts addressing specific high priority needs with title IV of the\n\nElementary and Secondary Education Act, part C funds. This technical assistance\nwill include orientation to and instructions about the variety of information\nand dissemination sources noted above, and it will also include another\nopportunity for the officials performing the technical assistance to play an\nactive role in the exchange of information between a school district having a\nspecific need and the total information resources described in this entire\ntitle IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act plan. (6)\n\nOther. (i) The New York State system of education is\nan extremely comprehensive one comprising thousands of agencies and units as\ncomponents of the University of the State of New York. It includes all\neducation agencies within the State as well as such educative agencies as all\nlibraries and library systems, museums, historical societies, cultural\nagencies, ETV networks, etc. (ii)\n\nThe State Education Department is responsible for leadership in planning and\noperation. The department has available to it a vast array of resources and\nopportunities which can routinely be blended to lend themselves to any\nsystematic dissemination effort. This includes internal and external\ncommunication mechanisms, a host of advisory and steering committees, a\nwell-organized public information office, numerous regular publications and\nclose working relations with education-oriented agencies operated on behalf of\nschool board members, teachers, administrators, business, labor, industry, etc. (c) These avenues for dissemination will be used on a formal or ad hoc basis\nwhenever a specific aspect of title IV of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act--part C is in need of clarification or elaboration, or whenever a\nparticular project is deemed worthy of a special dissemination effort. The\nstaff of the department is capable of planning and coordinating special\ndissemination activities as events warrant. These can include, but need not be\nlimited to, education fairs, workshops, seminars, and conferences. Additionally, the staff of the department works in close liaison with many\nprofessional organizations which provide access to educators across the State\nfor specific purposes. Among them are the Association for Supervision and\n\nCurriculum Development, Phi Delta Kappa, Council of School District\n\nAdministrators, the Association of School Business Officials, and other groups\nof education professionals.
