  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 195-4.3 - For the benefit of the employee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Deductions shall be for the benefit of\nthe employee when the deduction is for one of the items expressly listed in\nsection\n193\n(1)(b)\nof Labor Law. More generally, deductions are for the benefit of the employee when they provide financial or\nother support for the employee, the employee's family, or a charitable\norganization. Such support shall be limited to the following categories: health\nand welfare benefits; pensions and retirement benefits; child care and\neducational benefits; charitable benefits; dues and assessments; transportation; and food and lodging. (b) Convenience is not a benefit. Each wage\ndeduction may provide some level of convenience to employees in facilitating\npayments, but convenience itself is not a recognized benefit for purposes of\ndetermining whether any given deduction is for the benefit of the employee. For\nexample, an employer who offers to cash an employee's paycheck may not deduct a\nfee for providing that service because the convenience of having the paycheck\ncashed by the employer does not provide any benefit to the employee, but only\nease in cashing his or her paycheck. (c) Every deduction may provide some\ngeneralized indirect benefit to employers by helping to attract and maintain a\nstable and productive workforce. However, deductions that result in financial\ngain to the employer at the expense of the employee call into question whether\nthe deduction provides a benefit to the employee. Employers are not precluded\nfrom making deductions in all cases where there is a benefit to the employer. Employers may make deductions for the sale of their own goods and services to\ntheir employees at a discounted rate as long as the deduction is in compliance\nwith section\n193\nof the Labor Law\nand this Part. Similarly, where employees are provided the direct benefit of a\nreduced price for goods or services from an outside vendor, the employer is not\nprecluded from availing themselves of the same benefit of the reduced priced\ngoods or services. Nothing herein shall be construed as permitting an employer\nto receive a direct payment from an outside vendor as part of the sale of goods\nand services to the employees except for deductions made pursuant to section\n193\n(1)(b)(iv)\nof the Labor Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n195-4.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
