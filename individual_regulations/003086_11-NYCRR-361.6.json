Tit. 11 § 361.6 - Pooling of variations of costs attributable to high cost claims beginning in 2006 through 2013 for individual and small group policies, other than Medicare supplement and Healthy New York policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In each pool area a risk adjustment pool is established in connection with individual and small group health insurance policies, other than Medicare supplement insurance policies and Healthy New York health insurance policies. Each pool shall operate independently; that is, all calculations and payments described below are made for each pool independently of any other pool. (b) The annual funding amount for all pool areas combined is as follows: (1)\n$80,000,000 for 2007; (2)\n$120,000,000 for 2008; and\n(3)\n$160,000,000 for 2009 and each calendar year thereafter. (c) The annual funding amount for each pool area is in proportion to the annualized premiums in that pool area. For 2007 and each calendar year thereafter, each pool participant shall provide to the superintendent annualized premium information on or before February 28th. The superintendent shall advise carriers of the funding amount for each pool area within 60 days of receipt of annualized premium information from all carriers. (d) (1)\n\nEach carrier's share of the total funding payable to or from the pools shall be determined based on the carrier's high cost claims in its areas of operation. (2)\n\nIn order to implement the phase in of the new specified medical condition pooling process, on or before November 10, 2006 each carrier shall report to the superintendent its annualized premium amount as of December 31, 2005 and its cumulative calendar year claims paid in 2005 for individual standardized direct payment health maintenance organization policies, individual standardized direct payment point of service policies, all other individual health insurance policies, and small group health insurance policies, using the form in subdivision (h) of this section for each pool area. The superintendent will provide carriers with an estimate of potential pool receivables or liabilities using this 2005 data for advisory purposes only. (3)\n\nEach following year, beginning in 2007, on or before February 28th, each carrier shall report to the superintendent its annualized premium amount as of December 31st of the preceding year and its cumulative calendar year claims paid in the preceding year for individual standardized direct payment health maintenance organization policies, individual standardized direct payment point of service policies, all other individual health insurance policies, and small group health insurance policies, using the form in subdivision (h) of this section for each pool area. In 2007, the superintendent provided carriers with a second estimate of potential pool receivables or liabilities using 2006 data, for advisory purposes. Payments to the pools, or collections from the pools, shall be required beginning in 2008 and shall be based upon the data from the preceding calendar year. (4)\n\nCumulative calendar year claims paid shall include the total of all claim payments on behalf of an insured individual from January 1st through December 31st of the preceding year, regardless of when the services were provided. (5)\n\nCumulative calendar year claims paid shall include payments for hospital and medical services, prescription drug payments, capitation payments, and regional covered lives assessments paid pursuant to section\n2807-t\nof the Public Health Law or percentage surcharges paid pursuant to section\n2807-j\nor section\n2807-s\nof the Public Health Law. Carriers that include the covered lives assessments shall convert the family covered lives assessment into a per member assessment component in order to be included with claims expenses attributable to any one member. (6)\n\nCumulative calendar year claims paid shall not include amounts paid in satisfaction of the percentage surcharge requirement set forth in section\n2807-j (2)(b)(i)(B)\nof the Public Health Law or interest paid out by a carrier pursuant to section\n3224-a (c)\nof the Insurance Law. (7)\n\nEach carrier's submission shall be signed by an officer of the carrier certifying that the information is accurate. (8)\n\nIf a carrier makes a submission after February 28th and the carrier is a pool payer, the carrier's payment into the pool will be increased by one percent interest per month. If a carrier makes a submission after February 28th and the carrier is a pool receiver, the carrier's distribution will be reduced by one percent per month. (e) The superintendent shall calculate each carrier's share of the total funding payable to or from the pools pursuant to the example in subdivision (i) of this section for each pool area as follows: (1)\n\nIdentify the total claims paid by each carrier for the following types of policies: individual standardized direct payment health maintenance organization policies, individual standardized direct payment point of service policies, all other individual health insurance policies, and small group health insurance policies, other than Medicare supplement and Healthy New York insurance policies. (2)\n\nIdentify the total claims paid in excess of $20,000 for each insured by type of policy. (3)\n\nFor each carrier for each type of policy, divide the claims paid in excess of $20,000 by the total claims paid (the amount specified in paragraph [2] of this subdivision divided by the amount specified in paragraph [1] of this subdivision) to determine the high cost claim ratio. (4)\n\nCalculate the average high cost claim ratio for all carriers for all types of policies combined and multiply that ratio by the total claims paid for each carrier for each type of policy (a carrier's amount specified in paragraph [1] of this subdivision multiplied by the average high cost claim amount specified in paragraph [3] of this subdivision). (5)\n\nSubtract the amount calculated in paragraph (4) of this subdivision from the amount in paragraph (2) of this subdivision for each carrier for each type of policy to determine the adjustment needed to equalize high cost claims and determine if the carrier is a net contributor or receiver. (6)\n\nSum the net contributions of all carriers who are net contributors in the pool area to determine the total net contribution. (7)\n\nDivide the pool area funding amount by the total of paragraph (6) of this subdivision and multiply by the amount identified for each carrier for each type of policy in paragraph (5) of this subdivision to determine the carrier's net pool contribution or distribution. (f) Billings will be done by the superintendent beginning in 2008 within 30 days of receipt of submissions from all carriers, and payments will be due from carriers within five business days from the date billed. Payments made after the due date shall include interest at a rate of one percent per month. Subsequent to the billing date, but within the calendar year, carrier data that formed the basis of the billing will be audited. In the event audits necessitate post-billing adjustments, the adjustments will be charged or credited in the next year's billing or distribution. Additional payments due from any carrier whose data errors caused it to underpay, or refunds due back from any carrier whose data errors caused it to be overpaid shall include a one percent interest charge per month from the original due date or payment date. (g) A carrier shall, with respect to distributions from the pools attributable to each type of policy, as determined in paragraph (e)(7) of this section, without reduction for contributions owed on other types of policies: (1)\nrefund the distributions directly to insureds based upon the type of policy that caused the payments to be received without consideration of minimum loss ratio provisions; or\n(2)\nsubmit a detailed plan to the superintendent for approval: (i) demonstrating how the distribution will be applied to reduce future premium rates for the type of policy whose insureds caused the payments to be received; or\n(ii)\nproviding a detailed explanation as to how the distribution was considered in the development of premium rates for that year.
