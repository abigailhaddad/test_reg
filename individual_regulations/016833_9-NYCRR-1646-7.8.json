  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-7.8 - Schedule of contract awards\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach quarterly financial report submitted by a local\nagency shall include a schedule of contract awards, substantially in the same\nform as shown in Exhibit 26 of Appendix S-11. This schedule shall continue to\nbe submitted until all obligations represented by contract commitments have\nbeen liquidated. The information for the preparation of the schedule of\ncontract awards will be derived from the contractors ledger (see §\n1642-3.12\n) and it follows that the\ntotals of the schedule will always be in agreement with the general ledger\ncontrol accounts for Contract Awards (account 2400) and Contract Retentions\n(account 2112). The information as to the contract payments for advances for\nmaterials stored is obtained from line 16 of the periodical estimate for\npartial payment (see Exhibit 14 of Appendix S-11). Each periodical estimate\nwill have the current figure shown on this line, until by the end of\nconstruction, the amount should be zero. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-7.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
