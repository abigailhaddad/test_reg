  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8005.21 - Relevant Nonprofit Service Providers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where a\nnonprofit service provider has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board\nand Department that it is currently capable of offering relevant\ncommunity-based services to releasees, it may be permitted to attend\npreliminary and final parole revocation hearings where there is no disruption\nto the proceedings and the health and safety of any participant or of the\nprovider's representatives is not otherwise threatened. The nonprofit service\nprovider shall not be considered a party to the revocation proceedings and\nshall have no independent right to participate therein. (b) The presiding officer at a final parole\nrevocation hearing may, in their discretion, permit the releasee or their\ncounsel to communicate with the nonprofit service provider during a reasonable\nrecess of the proceeding where the communications are expected to aid in\nascertaining an appropriate revocation disposition, including, but not limited\nto, any relevant conditions of release that might be a part thereof. It is\nassumed, however, that communications between the releasee or their counsel and\nthe nonprofit service provider may freely occur outside of the time of such\nproceedings without direction and involvement of the presiding officer or any\nother employee of the Board or Department. (c) The presiding officer at a final parole\nrevocation hearing may, in their discretion, permit a representative of the\nprovider to directly offer, on or as a part of the record, case-specific\ninformation regarding relevant community-based services that such provider is\nwilling to provide and is currently capable of providing to the releasee who is\nthe subject of the proceeding. Nothing within this subdivision shall prohibit\nsuch information from being offered by a party at a final hearing. (d) In determining whether a nonprofit\nservice provider is currently capable of offering relevant community-based\nservices to releasees within the meaning of this section, the Board and\n\nDepartment may consider any relevant information including, but not necessarily\nlimited to, the provider's verifiable services and resources, record with\nrespect to delivering such services successfully, history of cooperating with\nand providing timely information to the Board and Department, history of\ncompliance with subpoenas, and responses to any inquiries made of them by the\npresiding officer or any party in any revocation proceedings. (e) The provisions of this section shall not\ncreate or confer any new or additional right in favor of the releasee, and\nnoncompliance with any such provisions shall not be a basis for the vacating of\na notice of violation or warrant, or for any other form of challenge to or\ndismissal of the revocation case.
