  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 70.8 - Interest subsidies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Maximum\namount of interest subsidy. (1)\n\nInterest\nsubsidies on loans shall be available to program recipients on loans from\nfinancing institutions in principal amounts up to $500,000. (2)\n\nThe interest subsidy rate which the\ndepartment shall pay on loans to program recipients by financing institutions\nshall be equal to the difference between the loan interest rate and the base\nrate established by the Department. The base rate shall initially be five\npercent, provided, however, that such base rate shall at no time exceed 75\npercent of the prime rate published daily in the Wall Street Journal. (b) Term. The term of an interest\nsubsidy shall be determined by the department, in its sole discretion, but\nshall not exceed 10 years. (c) Calculation of interest subsidy amount. (1)\n\nThe amount of an interest subsidy shall be the difference between the total\ninterest due on a loan over the term of the loan, calculated at the financing\ninstitution's lending rate at the time of closing, and the interest due on such\nloan over such period, calculated at the base rate, multiplied by a fraction\nequal to the interest subsidy term divided by the term of the loan. The total\namount of the interest subsidy may be discounted to reflect the payment of\ninterest subsidies in advance of their becoming due. (2)\n\nFor variable rate loans, the amount of\nthe interest subsidy will not change during the subsidy period, regardless of\nfluctuations in the financing institution's lending rate on that loan, except\nin cases where such lending rate drops to a level where the interest subsidy\nwould result in the program recipient receiving a negative net interest rate. In such cases, the amount of the interest subsidy will be reduced\naccordingly. (d) Default\non interest subsidized loan. Except as otherwise provided for in this\nsubdivision, where a program recipient defaults on an interest subsidized loan, interest subsidies shall be terminated and any interest subsidy payments being\nheld by the financing institution shall be returned to the department. The\nfinancing institution shall notify the department, in writing, of the default\nwithin 30 calendar days of its occurrence. The department, in its sole\ndiscretion, may authorize the financing institution to continue to receive\ninterest subsidies on behalf of the program recipient for a period of time\nmutually agreed upon by the department and the financing institution, in order\nfor the financing institution to work out a revised payment schedule with the\nprogram recipient. If continued interest subsidies are authorized by the\ndepartment and loan payments are not resumed by the program recipient within 90\ndays of the initial default, then all subsidy payments will be terminated\nimmediately. Where a new payment schedule is established between the financing\ninstitution and the program recipient, the total interest subsidy originally\napproved by the department will remain unchanged; provided, however, the\ndepartment may establish a revised schedule of interest subsidy payments on\nbehalf of the program recipient. (e) Prepayment of loan. In the event of the\nprepayment of a loan, the financing institution shall promptly return to the\ndepartment any unapplied portion of the interest subsidy being held by the\nfinancing institution.
