Notwithstanding the limitations set forth under Workers' Compensation Law\nsection 137(9), an independent medical examiner who has evaluated a claimant at\nthe request of the employer, carrier or claimant may conduct a subsequent\nindependent medical examination of the claimant for the same injury or\nillness. (9)\n\nRegular business\nhours. Independent medical examinations shall be conducted between the hours of\n8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m., Monday through Friday except that they shall not be\nconducted on official and officially recognized religious holidays. An\nexamination may be scheduled outside of regular business hours only with the\nconsent and for the convenience of the claimant. (10)\n\nUnreasonable burden. Where an insurance\ncarrier, third party administrator or claimant finds that it would place an\nunreasonable burden to arrange for an independent medical examination or review\nof records, or to attend an independent medical examination by an authorized\nexaminer, the employer, carrier or claimant shall arrange for such examination\nor review of records to be performed by a qualified provider. Upon request by\nthe board, the person or entity requesting such examination or review of\nrecords by a qualified provider must demonstrate the existence of the\nunreasonable burden to the satisfaction of the board. Where a person or entity\nis unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that an unreasonable\nburden existed which required the examination or review of records to be\nconducted by a qualified provider rather than an authorized examiner, the\nreport based upon such examination or review of records by a qualified provider\nshall not be admissible as evidence in a workers' compensation\nproceeding. (11)\n\nAbility of\nclaimant to appear. The physical capability of a claimant to present himself or\nherself for examination, and the observations of the examiner in relation to\nthe claimant's ability to present for such examination shall not constitute\ndispositive evidence in determining a claimant's disability, degree of\ndisability or eligibility for compensation or benefits under the Workers'\nCompensation Law. However, refusal by the claimant to submit to an independent\nmedical examination requested by an employer or carrier in accordance with\nsubdivision 4(B) of section 13-a, subdivision 3(B) of section 13-k, subdivision\n3(B) of section 13-l, or subdivision 4(B) of section\n13-m\nof the Workers' Compensation Law, for a purpose described under paragraph\n(b)(4) of this section, shall bar the claimant from recovering compensation for\nany period during which he or she has refused to submit to such\nexamination. (12)\n\nNo waiver of\nclaimant's rights. Except as otherwise provided, a claimant may not waive any\nof the rights provided under Workers' Compensation Law section 137 in relation\nto independent medical examinations. A report of an examination that does not\nsubstantially comply with the requirements of Workers' Compensation Law section\n137 and this section, shall not be admissible as evidence for any of the\npurposes described in paragraph (b)(4) of this section in a workers'\ncompensation proceeding, unless the party raising an objection to the\nadmissibility of the report does not raise such objection in a timely manner. Except for a waiver that is expressly authorized by the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw or this section or by a Workers' Compensation Law judge, and is knowingly\nexecuted by the claimant, no agreement between an employee and employer, or\nemployee and carrier shall be binding upon the board; nor shall any such\nagreement in any way excuse compliance with said section 137 or this section. In no event shall a collective bargaining agreement be binding upon the board\nor excuse compliance with respect to said section 137 or this section; nor\nshall a claimant be required or permitted to waive any of the requirements of\nsection 137 or this section pursuant to such agreement. (13)\n\nSelection of examiners in a P.P.O. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary: (i) an employer retains its right as\npermitted under section\n354\nof the Workers' Compensation Law and 10 NYCRR\n732-2.2\n(k)(2) to require a second\nopinion from a provider within a P.P.O. in the event that an employee seeks\nmedical treatment outside the P.P.O.; and\n(ii)\na claimant retains his or her right as\npermitted under 10 NYCRR\n732-2.2\n(g) to access a second opinion from a provider\nwithin a P.P.O. where the claimant has previously been evaluated or treated by\nanother provider within the P.P.O. (14)\nA written report of an independent\nmedical examination, duly sworn to, shall be filed with the board, and copies\nthereof furnished to all parties as may be required under the Workers'\nCompensation Law, within 10 business days after the independent medical\nexamination, or sooner if directed, except that in cases of persons examined\noutside the State, such reports shall be filed and furnished within 20 business\ndays after the independent medical examination. A written report is filed with\nthe board when it has been received by the board pursuant to the requirements\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. (15)\n\nCopies of written reports of medical\nexperts, made on behalf of any party without physician examination of the\nclaimant, to be used for reference at a hearing, must be furnished to the\nreferee and to all other parties or their representatives, if any, prior to\nthat hearing.
