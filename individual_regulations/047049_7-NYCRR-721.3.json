  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 721.3 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nNote: Unless otherwise provided for in this directive, the general\ncorrespondence procedures set forth in Part 720 of this Title, \"Inmate\n\nCorrespondence Program,\" (such as the requirement to put return addresses on\nthe front and back of outgoing envelopes) shall be followed. (a) Outgoing privileged\ncorrespondence. (1)\n\nFor the purpose of\nthis directive, outgoing mail will not be considered to be privileged\ncorrespondence until it has been placed in the control of the facility\nadministration for processing. (2)\n\nOutgoing privileged correspondence may be sealed by the inmate, and such\ncorrespondence shall not be opened, inspected, or read without express written\nauthorization from the facility superintendent as specified in subdivision (c)\nof this section. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this\n\nChapter, outgoing mail to the Secretary of State, Department of State, corporation division or uniform commercial code unit of any state shall be\nsubmitted by the inmate unsealed and is subject to inspection. (3)\n\nPostage for privileged correspondence. (i) Inmate letters addressed to the\ncommissioner or other central office staff shall be mailed by the facility at\nno cost to the inmate. This service shall only apply to regular letters; special handling charges for services such as certified mail, return-receipt, or express mail must be paid for by the inmate. (ii)\n\nEach inmate will receive a weekly free\npostage allowance equivalent to five domestic first class one ounce letters to\npay for first class postage on outgoing privileged correspondence. (a) This allowance may not be used to pay for\nany special handling charges such as for certified, return-receipt, express\nmail, etc., unless such mail services are required by statute, court rule or\ncourt order. (b) Any unused\nallowance will not be accumulated from week to week. Inmates will have to pay\nfor postage costs which exceed this weekly allowance. (iii)\nA postage-prepaid envelope received\nwithin correspondence from a court or an attorney which has been pre-addressed\nby the court or attorney may be received (subject to inspection by the security\nstaff) and used by the inmate for the intended return correspondence. (iv)\n\nTo ensure that indigent inmates maintain\ntheir right of access to the courts, the facility shall approve and IAS 2708\nadvance request to pay for first class mail postage if the inmate has\ninsufficient funds and if the following conditions are met: (a) the mail is legal mail\n(\ne.g., it is addressed to a judge, clerk of court, attorney, or authorized legal representative; or is directly related to a potential or\nongoing legal matter); (b) any\nbalance of the inmate's free weekly postage allowance is applied to the legal\nmail postage costs; and\n(c) the\nrequested advance and the balance of unpaid previous advances for legal mail\npostage do not exceed $20, except as may be approved under subparagraph (vi) of\nthis paragraph. (v) Advances for \"special handling\" (\ne.g., certified mail, return\nreceipt, express mail, etc.) will not be approved unless required by a statute, court rule or court order. (vi)\n\nExceeding the $20 limit shall only be approved if the inmate can show by court\nrule, court order, a statute of limitations, or other legal deadline applicable\nto his or her individual circumstance that the legal mail must be sent prior to\nreceipt of the next week's free postage allowance. The inmate must provide\njustification for such advance. (vii)\n\nNo request for a legal mail advance\nwill be denied by facility staff without prior consultation with the\ndepartment's office of counsel. Any question whether a particular item\nqualifies as \"legal mail,\" or whether an advance is allowable should be\ndirected to such office. (b) Incoming privileged\ncorrespondence. (1)\n\nIncoming privileged\ncorrespondence shall not be opened outside the presence of the inmate to whom\nit is addressed, and shall not be read without express written authorization\nfrom the facility superintendent (see subdivision [c] of this\nsection). (2)\nA log entry should\ndocument any incoming privileged correspondence erroneously opened outside the\npresence of the inmate to whom it is addressed (see paragraph [3] of this\nsubdivision). If appropriate, a photocopy of an erroneously opened envelope\nshall be included. (3)\n\nIncoming\nprivileged correspondence shall be given priority handling and shall be\ndelivered in a consistent manner at a time when the inmates are available to\nreceive it and which does not interfere with programming. If the inmate to whom\nprivileged correspondence is addressed is not currently at the facility, the\nprovisions of Part 722 of this Title shall be followed. (4)\nA log shall be created to record receipt\nand delivery of incoming privileged mail. It shall identify the sender and\ninclude the inmate's name and number, the delivery date and time, the title of\nthe delivery person, and note if the inmate refused to sign a receipt, refused\ndelivery of the mail, or would not respond to delivery calls. If privileged\nmail is erroneously opened outside the presence of the inmate, that fact and\nany relevant explanation shall be noted in the log. (5)\n\nInspection. (i) Where x-ray capability exists, incoming\nprivileged correspondence should be x-rayed prior to being opened. (ii)\n\nExcept as provided in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, all incoming privileged correspondence shall be opened and\ninspected, in the presence of the inmate to whom it is addressed, for the\npresence of cash, checks, money orders, and contraband and to verify, as\nunobtrusively as possible, that the correspondence does not contain material\nthat is not entitled to the privilege. (iii)\n\nWhen, in the course of inspection, cash, checks, or money orders are found, they shall be removed and credited to\nthe inmate's account. (iv)\n\nWhen, in\nthe course of inspection, contraband is found, it shall be removed and\nforwarded to the security office, with appropriate chain-of-custody\ndocumentation. When appropriate, the State Police shall be notified. (v) When, in the course of inspection, material is found that does not appear to be entitled to the privilege, all\nparts of the correspondence shall be forwarded directly to the superintendent\nwithout further inspection, and a report from the person opening and inspecting\nshall detail the circumstances. (vi)\nA postage-prepaid envelope received\nwithin correspondence from a court or an attorney which has been pre-addressed\nby the court or attorney may be received (subject to inspection by the security\nstaff) and used by the inmate for the intended return correspondence. (6)\n\nReceipt. (i) The inmate to whom privileged\ncorrespondence is addressed shall sign a receipt for such correspondence. All\nreceipts for incoming privileged correspondence shall be retained in an\nappropriate file. (ii)\n\nIf the\ninmate refuses to sign a receipt, the delivering employee shall so indicate on\nthe receipt, note the date and time of the refusal to sign, and deliver the\ncorrespondence to the inmate. (7)\n\nRefusal. (i) If the inmate refuses to accept the\nprivileged correspondence when it is offered, the delivering employee shall\nnote the refusal in the log and any known reason for non-acceptance. The\nprivileged correspondence should be returned to the sender stamped \"addressee\nrefused to accept.\"\n(ii)\n\nIf the\ninmate refuses to respond to the privileged mail delivery call, a second\nattempt should be made to deliver the letter. If the inmate again refuses to\nrespond, note the date and time, and any known reason for not responding to\nprivileged mail calls in the privileged mail log. The receipt with this\ninformation shall be retained in an appropriate file. The privileged\ncorrespondence should be returned to the sender stamped \"addressee refused to\naccept.\"\n(8)\n\nPrivileged\ncorrespondence originally sent out of the facility by an inmate, but\nsubsequently returned to the inmate sender by the postal service, shall be\nprocessed as incoming privileged correspondence in accordance with the\nprocedures as set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision. (c) Authorization to read privileged mail. (1)\n\nThe superintendent shall not authorize\nthe reading of incoming or outgoing privileged correspondence unless there is a\nreason to believe that the provisions of this or any directive or rule or\nregulation have been violated, that any applicable State or Federal law has\nbeen violated, or that the content of such correspondence threatens the safety, security, or good order of a facility or the safety or well being of any\nperson. Such authorization by the superintendent shall be in writing and shall\nset forth facts forming the basis for the action. (2)\n\nThe superintendent is advised to consult\nwith the department's office of counsel before issuing such authorization. If\nthe facility superintendent authorizes the reading of privileged\ncorrespondence, it shall be read only by the superintendent, a deputy\nsuperintendent or central office staff. (3)\n\nIf after reading the contents of\nprivileged correspondence there is reason to believe that the provisions of\nthis or any directive or rule or regulation have been violated, or that any\n\nState or Federal law has been violated, or that the content of such\ncorrespondence threatens the safety, security good order of a facility or the\nsafety or well-being of any person, then the correspondence may be confiscated, and the inmate must be given written notice of the confiscation, unless doing\nso would be inconsistent with the need to safeguard an investigation. The\nnotice must include the reason(s) for the confiscation, and it must inform the\ninmate of the right to appeal the confiscation to the deputy commissioner for\nprogram services. In the case of incoming correspondence, the correspondent\nmust also be given a copy of such notice and accorded the right to appeal, unless doing so would be inconsistent with the need to safeguard an\ninvestigation. Reason to believe that privileged correspondence is being used\nto introduce contraband or other materials not entitled to the privilege shall\nbe sufficient reason for confiscation. (4)\n\nThis subdivision shall not be deemed to\nrequire the express written authorization of the superintendent to inspect\nincoming privileged correspondence, in the presence of the inmate, to ensure\nthat the materials contained in the correspondence are entitled to the\nprivilege.
