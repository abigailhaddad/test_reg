Tit. 6 §§ 383-10.5 - Monitoring of disposal units\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\napplicant must submit a disposal unit monitoring plan as part of the complete\npermit application. (b) The\npermittee must establish and conduct a disposal unit monitoring program as\nrequired by this section and in accordance with the disposal unit monitoring\nplan approved by the department in the permit. The permittee must begin the\ndisposal unit monitoring program when construction of the first disposal unit\nis completed and, except for underground mined repositories, must continue it\nuntil the end of the institutional control period. For underground mined\nrepositories, disposal unit monitoring must be conducted during the operation\nperiod, and, as necessary to safely perform facility closure, during the\nclosure period. (c) During the\noperation period, the disposal unit monitoring program must include provisions\nfor: (1)\ndetecting infiltration of water into\nthe disposal units; (2)\nsampling\nand analysis, for the presence of radioactive materials and hazardous\ncomponents, of any liquids discharged from the disposal units or collected in\nthe internal drainage system or the external foundation drainage system; and\n(3)\nmonitoring for the\ngeneration of methane and other gases within the disposal units. (d) During the closure, post-closure, and institutional control period, the disposal unit monitoring\nprogram must provide for the detection of significant releases of radioactive\nmaterial to the environment. In addition, the disposal unit monitoring program\nmust include the provisions described in paragraphs (c)(1)-(3) of this section\nto the extent that such provisions are feasible and will not adversely affect\nthe ability of the land disposal facility to meet the performance\nobjectives. (e) A separate and\nindependent monitoring system must be provided for each disposal\nunit. (f) Any liquids discharged\nfrom the disposal units or collected in the internal leachate collection system\nor the external foundation drainage system must be treated as necessary to\ncomply with section\n382.11\nof this Title and any other\nrequired permits. (g) The permittee\nmust, at least once a year, review the plan for the disposal unit monitoring\nprogram and revise it as necessary, subject to the approval of the department. At minimum, the plan must be revised when the permittee or the department\ndetermines that: (1)\nthe disposal unit\ndesigns or operations have changed and the disposal unit monitoring program is\nno longer appropriate for the changed conditions; (2)\nthe disposal unit monitoring program is\nno longer sufficient to accurately demonstrate that the performance objectives\nare being met; or\n(3)\nthe disposal\nunit monitoring program no longer meets the requirements of this\n\nSubpart.
