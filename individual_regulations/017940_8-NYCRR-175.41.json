Tit. 8 § 175.41 - Analysis of average interest rates applied to capital debt incurred by the city of new york for school purposes, or by the new york city transitional finance authority for school purposes if no such capital debt is incurred by the city of new york, for use in the apportionment of building aid to the city school district of the city of new york\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For the purpose of this\nsection, the following definitions shall apply: (1)\n\nObligation shall mean any amortized debt\nincurred by the City of New York for the funding of capital expenditures for\nschool purposes of the city and its departments, agencies or subdivisions, including but not limited to the city school district of the City of New York\nand the School Construction Authority of the City of New York. In the event\nthat no amortized debt is incurred by the City of New York for the funding of\ncapital expenditures for school purposes, obligation shall mean any amortized\ndebt incurred by the New York City transitional finance authority for the\nfunding of capital expenditures for school purposes of the city and its\ndepartments, agencies or subdivisions, including but not limited to the City\n\nSchool District of the City of New York and the School Construction Authority\nof the City of New York. (2)\n\nTotal\nprincipal for school purposes shall mean that portion of the original proceeds\nreceived by the City of New York from the sale of an obligation that is\nexpended for school purposes. (3)\n\nTerm shall mean the number of years represented by the amortization of an\nobligation, expressed to the nearest whole number of years. (4)\n\nTotal net proceeds shall mean the sum of\nthe total principal for school purposes less costs of issuance (including\nunderwriters discount and bond insurance), less original issue discount, plus\noriginal issue premium attributable to such total principal for school\npurposes. Bond insurance, original issue discount and original issue premium\nshall be allocated to such principal on the basis of actual cost for that\nportion of principal. Costs of issuance, including underwriters discount, but\nnot bond insurance, shall be allocated pro rata on the basis of the ratio of\nproceeds (adjusted for original issue discount and premium only) attributable\nto school purposes to total proceeds (adjusted for original issue discount and\npremium only) in the bond series. (5)\n\nAverage interest rate shall be determined\nby doubling the semi-annual interest rate, compounded semi-annually, necessary\nto discount the debt service payments (including interest, principal and\nmandatory redemptions) from the payment dates to the dated date such that the\nsum of such discounted payments equal the total net proceeds. (i) When a particular maturity of bonds has\nmore than one interest rate, the principal amount allocated to school purposes\nshall be allocated pro rata based on the ratio of principal amount of an\ninterest rate in a maturity to the total principal amount of the\nmaturity. (ii)\n\nWhen there are\nproceeds of more than one series of bonds in a calculation period, then the\naverage interest rate shall be determined by doubling the semi-annual interest, compounded semi-annually, necessary to discount the debt service payments\n(including interest, principal and mandatory redemptions) from the payment\ndates to the dated date of the series of bonds with the earliest dated date\nsuch that the sum of such discounted payments equals the sum of the net\nproceeds discounted to the dated date of the series of bonds with the earliest\ndated date. (iii)\n\nThe interest rate\nfor adjustable rate bonds shall be determined by taking the municipal swap\nindex selected by the commissioner (or if such index is no longer available, using comparable data) averaged over the last 10 years, plus the costs of\ncredit facilities, remarketing fees, broker-dealers fees and auction agent\nfees, as applicable, that are in effect at the time of the issuance of the\nbonds. (iv)\n\nIf there is an interest\nrate swap associated with the adjustable rate bonds that creates a synthetic\nfixed rate, then the interest rate shall be determined by the sum of the fixed\nswap rate plus the cost of credit facilities, remarketing fees, broker-dealers\nfees and auction agent fees, as applicable, that are in effect at the time of\nthe issuance of the bonds. (b) The analysis of the actual average\ninterest rate and of the estimated average interest rate which must be\nsubmitted by the Comptroller of the City of New York to the commissioner by\n\nSeptember 1st of the current year pursuant to section\n3602 (6)(e)(1)(c) and\n(2)(a)(ii)\nof the Education Law shall include\nsuch data as is prescribed by the commissioner, including but not limited to\nthe following: (1)\nA listing of all\nobligations incurred by the City of New York for the period from July 1st of\nthe prior calendar year to June 30th of the current calendar year.

(2)\nA\nstatement certifying that the data provided pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision reasonably reflects anticipated obligations to be incurred by the\n\nCity of New York for the period from July 1st of the current calendar year to\n\nJune 30th of the next calendar year, or, in the alternative, a listing of all\nanticipated obligations to be incurred by the City of New York for such period\nthat shall include for each obligation listed and for that portion of each\nobligation listed that is for school purposes: (i) the total principal; (ii)\nthe term; (iii)\nthe total net proceeds; (iv)\nthe average interest rate; (v) the total interest; (vi)\nif the bonds are floating-rate bonds or\nattached to swap(s), include the swap rate, the cost of credit facilities, remarketing fees, broker-dealers fees and auction agent fees, as\napplicable; (vii)\ncosts of\nissuance, including breakout of underwriters discount and bond insurance; and\n(viii)\noriginal issue premiums\nand discounts. (c) Upon review and approval of the listing\nprovided by the Comptroller of the City of New York pursuant to paragraph\n(b)(1) of this section, the commissioner shall determine the actual average\ninterest rate applied to all obligations incurred by the City of New York\nduring the base year, as required by section\n3602\n(6)(e)(2)\nof the Education Law.
