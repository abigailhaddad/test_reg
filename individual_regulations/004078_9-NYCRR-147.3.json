  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 147.3 - Performance evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annual\nsalaried employees covered by this Part are evaluated annually with evaluations\ndue on July 1st. Employees will have a formal rating assigned at each\nevaluation. (b) An employee must be\non the payroll for a minimum of six pay periods during the annual evaluation\nperiod to be eligible for a rating. An employee with fewer than six pay periods\nof creditable service shall not be formally evaluated. Otherwise eligible\nemployees with six or more pay periods but fewer than 24 pay periods of\ncreditable service shall receive partial advances as follows: 18 through 23 pay\nperiods, three fourths of an advance amount; 12 through 17 pay periods, one\nhalf of the advance amount; and 6 through 11 pay periods, one fourth of the\nadvance amount. Employees must have 20 pay periods of creditable service to be\neligible for performance awards, which will not be prorated. Any complete pay\nperiod during which an employee is on leave, without pay or in less than full\npay status, shall not be creditable toward the service requirement. Education\ndirectors, as defined in section\n136\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, being paid over 10 months will receive credit for a full\nyear of continuous service if they were on the payroll for 10 months. Their\nservice and eligibility will be calculated proportionately for periods when\nthey were not paid between September 1st and June 30th. (c) An employee on leave with or without pay\nat the time the evaluation is due, who has six or more pay periods of\ncreditable service, shall be evaluated. Any salary increase resulting from a\nperformance advance or longevity performance award shall be paid upon the\nemployee's return to the payroll. Any resulting lump sum performance award or\nmerit payment shall be paid in a timely manner regardless of whether the\nemployee has returned to the payroll. Employees who are separated from State\nservice on July 1st, and are subsequently reinstated, who had six or more pay\nperiods of creditable service prior to separation, will have their salary\nadjusted upon return to the payroll. In making this adjustment, a rating of\n\"Effective\" or its equivalent will be used. (d) For the evaluations due July 1, 1986, the\nevaluation period shall be the period between the due date of the previous\nevaluation and July 1, 1986. Advance payments shall be prorated as described in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, but full performance awards shall be paid to\nthose employees last evaluated October 1, 1985 who have 15 subsequent pay\nperiods of creditable service. Employees last rated July 1, 1985 will still\nrequire 20 pay periods of creditable service to be eligible for an\naward. (e) (1)\n\nService in a lower grade in a position\nwhich has been reallocated is creditable toward the service requirement in the\ngrade to which the position has been reallocated for any performance evaluation\nor payment due on or after July 1, 1986. (2)\n\nService in a higher grade by employees\nwho are appointed or demoted to a lower salary grade is creditable toward the\nservice requirement for a performance evaluation in the lower salary\ngrade. (f) The\nperformance evaluation will be based on a system developed by the Office of\n\nEmployee Relations and approved by the Director of the Budget. The plan will\ninclude a mechanism for evaluating employees who during a rating period move\nlaterally (i.e., without a change in grade) between agencies and/or facilities, or who are appointed or demoted to a lower salary grade. The system will also\ninclude a performance evaluation appeals process; provided however, that dollar\namounts of performance advances, performance awards and merit payments are not\nsubject to appeal.
