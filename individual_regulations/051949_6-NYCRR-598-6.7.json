Tit. 6 §§ 598-6.7 - Corrective action plan\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At any point after reviewing the\ninformation submitted in compliance with sections\n6.2\nthrough\n6.4\nof this Subpart, the department\nmay require the facility to submit additional information or to develop and\nsubmit a corrective action plan for responding to contaminated soils and\ngroundwater. If a plan is required, the facility must submit the plan according\nto a schedule and format established by the department. Alternatively, the\nfacility may, after fulfilling the requirements of sections\n6.2\nthrough\n6.4\nof this Subpart, choose to\nsubmit a corrective action plan for responding to contaminated soil and\ngroundwater. In either case, the facility is responsible for submitting a plan\nthat provides for adequate protection of public health and the environment as\ndetermined by the department and must modify the facility's plan as necessary\nto meet this standard. (b) The\ndepartment will approve the corrective action plan only after ensuring that\nimplementation of the plan will adequately protect public health, safety, and\nthe environment. In making this determination, the department will consider the\nfollowing factors as appropriate: (1)\nthe\nphysical and chemical characteristics of the hazardous substance, including its\ntoxicity, persistence, and potential for migration; (2)\nthe hydrogeologic characteristics of the\nfacility and the surrounding area; (3)\nthe proximity, quality, and current and\nfuture uses of nearby surface water and groundwater; (4)\nthe potential effects of residual\ncontamination on nearby surface water and groundwater; (5)\nan exposure assessment; and\n(6)\nany information assembled in compliance\nwith this Subpart. (c) Upon approval of the corrective action plan or as directed by the department, the facility must implement the plan, including modifications to the plan made\nby the department. The facility must monitor, evaluate, and report the results\nof implementing the plan in accordance with a schedule and in a format\nestablished by the department. (d) The facility may, in the interest of minimizing environmental contamination and\npromoting more effective cleanup, begin cleanup of soil and groundwater before\nthe corrective action plan is approved provided that the facility: (1)\nnotifies the department of the facility's\nintention to begin cleanup; (2)\ncomplies with any conditions imposed by the department, including halting\ncleanup or mitigating adverse consequences from cleanup activities; and\n(3)\nincorporates these\nself-initiated cleanup measures in the corrective action plan that is submitted\nto the department for approval.
