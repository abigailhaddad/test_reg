(II) (A) Bending properties. For pipe 2 inches (51 millimeters) or less in diameter, a\nlength of pipe must be cold bent through at least 90 degrees around a\ncylindrical mandrel that has a diameter 12 times the diameter of the pipe, without developing cracks at any portion and without opening the longitudinal\nweld. For pipe more than 2 inches (51 millimeters) in diameter, the\npipe must meet the requirements of the flattening tests set forth in ASTM\nSpecification A53/A53M (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), except that\nthe number of tests must be at least equal to the minimum required in paragraph\nII-D of this Appendix to determine yield strength........ (II) (B) Weldability. A girth weld must be made in the pipe by\na welder who is qualified under this Part. The weld must be made under the most\nsevere conditions under which welding will be allowed in the field and by means\nof the same procedure that will be used in the field. On pipe more than 4\ninches (102 millimeters) in diameter, at least one test weld must be made for\neach 100 lengths of pipe. On pipe 4 inches (102 millimeters) or less in\ndiameter, at least one test weld must be made for each 400 lengths of pipe. The\nweld must be tested in accordance with API Standard 1104 (as described in\nsection\n10.3\nof this Title). If the\nrequirements of API Standard 1104 (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title) cannot be met, weldability may be established by making chemical tests for carbon and\nmanganese, and proceeding in accordance with section IX of the ASME Boiler and\n\nPressure Vessel Code. The same number of chemical tests must be made as are\nrequired for testing girth weld. (II) (C) Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit\nadequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is\nreasonably round and straight and there are no defects which might impair the\nstrength or tightness of the pipe. (II) (D) Tensile properties. If the tensile properties of the\npipe are not known, the minimum yield strength may be taken as 24,000 psi (165\nMPa) or less, or the tensile properties may be established by performing\ntensile tests as set forth in API Specification 5L. All test specimens shall be\nselected at random and the following number of tests must be performed: Number of Tensile Tests-All\n\nSizes\n10 lengths or less....... 1 set of tests for each length. 11 to 100 lengths....... 1 set of tests for each 5 lengths, but not less than 10\ntests. Over 100 lengths....... 1 set of tests for each 10 lengths, but not less than 20\ntests. If the yield-tensile ratio, based on the properties determined\nby those tests, exceeds 0.85, the pipe may be used only as provided in section\n255.55\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. (III) Steel pipe manufactured before November 12, 1970, to\nearlier editions of listed specifications. Steel pipe manufactured before\n\nNovember 12, 1970, in accordance with a specification of which a later edition\nis listed in section I of this Appendix, is qualified for use under this Part\nif the following requirements are met: (III) (A) Inspection. The pipe must be clean enough to permit\nadequate inspection. It must be visually inspected to ensure that it is\nreasonably round and straight and that there are no defects which might impair\nthe strength or tightness of the pipe. (III) (B) Similarity of specification requirements. The edition\nof the listed specification under which the pipe was manufactured must have\nsubstantially the same requirements with respect to the following properties as\na later edition of that specification listed in section I of this\nappendix: (III) (1) Physical (mechanical) properties of pipe, including\nyield and tensile strength, elongation, and yield to tensile ratio, and testing\nrequirements to verify those properties. (III) (2) Chemical properties of pipe and testing requirements\nto verify those properties. (III) (C) Inspection or test of welded pipe. On pipe with\nwelded seams, one of the following requirements must be met: (III) (1) The edition of the listed specification to which the\npipe was manufactured must have substantially the same requirements with\nrespect to nondestructive inspection of welded seams and the standards for\nacceptance or rejection and repair as a later edition of the specification\nlisted in section I of this Appendix. (III) (2) The pipe must be tested in accordance with this Part\nto at least 1.25 times the maximum allowable operating pressure if it is to be\ninstalled in a class 1 location and to at least 1.5 times the maximum allowable\noperating pressure if it is to be installed in a class 2, 3, or 4 location. Notwithstanding any shorter time period permitted under this Part, the test\npressure must be maintained for at least 8 hours. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
