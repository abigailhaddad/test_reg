  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.6 - Departmental action on applications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applications must be\nsubmitted to the regional permit administrator listed in section\n621.19\nof this Part for a\ndetermination of completeness and initiation of review. For permit applications\nreviewed by the department's central office, applications must be submitted to\nthe chief permit administrator for a determination of completeness and\ninitiation of review. (b) In\nreviewing an application for a permit, department staff ordinarily inspects the\nproject site or facility and surrounding area to verify existing conditions, determine the accuracy of materials submitted in the application, assess\nimpacts of a project on the environment in the immediate and surrounding area, and determine whether the project satisfies applicable permitting standards. During an inspection, among other things, measurements may be made, physical\ncharacteristics of the site may be analyzed, including but not limited to soils\nand vegetation, and photographs may be taken. Ordinarily, site visits will\noccur between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Monday through Friday. Unusual circumstances\nincluding (but not limited to) emergencies or disasters may require site\ninspections outside of these hours. Failure of an applicant, or the property\nowner if different than the applicant, to allow access to the site or facility\ncan be grounds for, and may result in, the department deeming the application\nincomplete or permit denial. (c) The department must mail notice of its determination of completeness or\nincompleteness to the applicant for: (1)\ndelegated permits: on or before 60 days after receipt of the application, except for minor modifications to Title V facility permits as described in Part\n201 of this Title which shall follow the timeframe under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision; (2)\nall other permits: on or before 15 days after receipt of the application; and\n(3)\nprojects requiring both delegated and\nnondelegated permits: on or before 60 days after receipt of the\napplication. (d) If the\napplication is determined to be incomplete, the notice must include a\ndescription of the deficiencies and a listing of all identified areas of\nincompleteness. Nothing in this section precludes the department from\nrequesting additional information in accordance with Section\n621.14\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (e) Applications will remain\nincomplete until all requested items are received by the department. A partial\nsubmission of requested material does not change the incomplete status. Department staff must notify the applicant of the continued incomplete status\nof its application within the timeframes specified in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (f) Failure of the\napplicant to respond in writing to the department's notice may result in the\napplication being deemed withdrawn without prejudice pursuant to the procedures\nin paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nIf an applicant fails to respond to a\nnotice of incomplete application within one year, the department may mail a\nfollow-up notice of incomplete application requesting the necessary items for a\ncomplete application or an explanation for the delay. The notice must state\nthat the department will deem the application withdrawn for failure by the\napplicant to respond within 15 days of mailing or by a later date specified in\nthe notice. (2)\n\nIf the department\nsends notification pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the\napplicant fails to respond to the follow-up notice of incomplete application\nwithin 15 days of mailing or by the date specified in the notice, the\ndepartment will deem the application withdrawn. (g) When an application for a major project\nis determined to be complete, a Notice of Complete Application must be\nprepared. Notice requirements for content and publication are in section\n621.7\nof this Part. (h) If the department fails to mail notice of\nits determination of completeness or incompleteness to the applicant within the\ntime limit specified in subdivision (c) of this section, the application will\nbe deemed complete. Nothing in this section waives any applicable statutory\nrequirements of article 8 of the ECL (SEQR), article 14 of Parks, Recreation\nand Historic Preservation Law (New York State Historic Preservation Act of\n1980) or precludes the department from requesting additional information in\naccordance with section\n621.14\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (i) If an application is\nresubmitted or the applicant submits a response to a notice of incomplete\napplication, a new completeness review period of 15 days (60 days for delegated\npermits and those projects requiring both delegated and nondelegated permits)\nshall commence from the date of receipt by the department.
