  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 57.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The forensic\nmental health system offers care to New Yorkers pursuant to Mental Hygiene, Criminal Procedure, and Correction Laws. The office ensures that mental health\nservices are available to members of this population at multiple geographical\npoints throughout the forensic system. In addition to the Mid-Hudson Forensic\n\nPsychiatric Center and Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, the office operates\ntwo maximum security regional forensic units: the Rochester Regional Forensic\n\nUnit, located on the grounds of the Rochester Psychiatric Center, and the\n\nNortheast Regional Forensic Unit, located at Central New York Psychiatric\n\nCenter. (b) These forensic\nfacilities and units offer a range and variety of programs and services for the\ncare, treatment, and rehabilitation of persons age 16 and over with mental\nillness, comparable with those offered at other hospitals in the Office of\n\nMental Health. In addition, they have the staff and physical surroundings to\nenable them to offer such programs and services to patients requiring closer\nsupervision than can be given at other hospitals. (c) Patients whose behavior is such as to\nraise the likelihood of their causing harm to others cannot be given the care\nand treatment they require at such other hospitals operated by the Office of\n\nMental Health since, for the protection of other patients and staff of such\nhospitals, they must be kept in closed wards while in a civil\nfacility. (d) The Mid-Hudson\n\nForensic Psychiatric Center, Kirby Forensic Psychiatric Center, Rochester\n\nRegional Forensic Unit and Northeast Regional Forensic Unit have specially\ntrained staff and a secure perimeter. As such, these settings permit freer\nmovement, within facility grounds, of patients who pose a risk of harm to\nothers, as well as offer them an opportunity for rehabilitation, recreation, and therapies which, because of their need for close supervision, would not be\navailable for them at the other hospitals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n57.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
