  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 635-6.3 - Leases for real property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This\nsubdivision applies to allowability of costs for leases for real property\nexcept for continuing residential lease arrangements as specified in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (1)\n\nIn order\nfor lease costs to be considered for allowability, the provider or individual\nlessee must submit the lease to OPWDD for approval. In deciding whether to\napprove a lease, OPWDD shall consider whether the lease is in the best\ninterests of the programs and the persons it serves and whether the lease in\nany way violates public policy. In deciding whether to approve an amount for\nrent, OPWDD shall consider whether the provider's rate, fee or price, as a\nwhole, including the amount of rent to be approved, would result in payment\nwhich is consistent with efficiency and economy. (2)\n\nIf an approved lease (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part) or approved proprietary lease (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part) is between the provider or individual lessee and a\nparty which is not a related party, allowable lease costs shall be the lesser\nof contract rent or fair market rent. (3)\n\nIf an approved lease or approved\nproprietary lease is between the provider or individual lessee and a related\nparty, allowable lease costs shall be the least of: (i) contract rent (see glossary, Subpart\n635-99 of this Part); (ii)\nfair\nmarket rent (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part); or\n(iii)\nthe landlord's net cost (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part). (4)\n\nThe commissioner may waive the\nlimitations on allowable costs as stated in paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nupon a showing that such limitations would jeopardize the opening or continued\noperation of the program or services and that the negotiations for the lease or\nproprietary lease were conducted as though the parties were not\nrelated. (5)\n\nThe commissioner may, upon application from a provider, allow lease costs in an amount equal to\ncontract rent and greater than fair market rent if all of the conditions in\nsubparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph are met. (i) The commissioner will allow such lease\ncosts only for as long as it is necessary for the provider to relocate the\nprogram or services located on the lease property; and\n(a) the lease is a renewal that is not\npursuant to an option to renew; (b) the lease is a renewal of a lease for an existing program or services; and\n(c) the provider has shown\nthat: (1)\nthe provider has made diligent\nefforts to negotiate a lease renewal for fair market rent or less; (2)\nthe provider has been unable to negotiate\na lease renewal for less than the current rent; (3)\nthe parties to the lease renewal are not\nrelated; and\n(4)\nallowance of lease\ncosts in the amount of contract rent is necessary to ensure the continued\noperation of the program or services; or\n(ii)\nA substitute provider (see section\n635-99.1\n[bp]\nof\nthis Part) is designed to operate the program at the same physical location, and OPWDD determines that allowing such lease costs: (a) is an economic and efficient use of\nresources; and\n(b) is necessary to\nprotect the health, safety, or welfare of the persons who are receiving or will\nreceive services at the facility or program in question. (6)\n\nContract rent incurred\npursuant to an approved lease or approved proprietary lease which is renewed\npursuant to an option to renew is allowable. (7)\n\nCosts incurred pursuant to an approved\nlease or approved proprietary lease which is renewed other than pursuant to an\noption to renew (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part) shall be allowable\nas follows: (i) If the lease is between\nparties who are not related, allowable costs are determined in accordance with\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nIf the lease is between parties who are\nrelated, allowable costs are determined in accordance with paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. (iii)\nOPWDD shall\ndecide whether to approve any such renewal at least 30 days before the last day\nthe lease may be renewed, if the provider or individual lessee has notified\nOPWDD in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. (iv)\n\nWhenever possible, the provider or\nindividual lessee shall submit to OPWDD a request for approval of lease\nrenewals at least 120 days prior to the last date for renewing the\nlease. (b) This subdivision governs the allowability of lease costs applicable to\ncontinuing residential lease arrangements for periods after December 31, 2011, for which periods OPWDD has not approved lease costs for an entire calendar\nyear. This subdivision applies to residential lease renewals which are not\nrenewals pursuant to an option to renew. (1)\n\nThere shall be an allowable lease cost, exclusive of any ancillary costs, for\nan entire calendar year. The allowable lease cost, exclusive of any ancillary\ncosts, for a calendar year shall be the base lease amount for such calendar\nyear adjusted by an annual percentage for such calendar year. (2)\n\nBase lease amount. The base lease amount\nfor a calendar year shall be the allowable lease cost calculated in accordance\nwith this section in effect on December 31st of the prior calendar year, exclusive of any ancillary costs (see paragraph [3] of this\nsubdivision). (3)\n\nAncillary costs. Ancillary costs are those charges identified in a lease in addition to monthly\nrent. These include but not limited to: special assessments, taxes, co-op or\ncondominium maintenance fees, utility payments assessed by the lessee by the\nlessor pursuant to the terms of the lease, and lessor-financed renovations\nbilled as additional rent. (4)\n\nFor\nancillary costs under the terms of the lease to be allowable the lessee must\nsubmit an application to OPWDD specifying the nature and amounts of the\nancillary costs. OPWDD may approve or disapprove the request or adjust the\namount to be reimbursed based on whether the ancillary costs are reasonable and\nnecessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
