  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 941.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Item\nno. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Upper Hudson River watershed in 1932 and has been closely followed in\nconnection with the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of\nstreams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department\nat the time of its 1932 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Upper Hudson River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from The Battery, New York City. H-301\n\nBatten Kill\n\nThe 301st tributary entering the Hudson River, numbering consecutively upstream from the mouth at The Battery. H-301-17\n\nWhittacker Brook\n\nThe 17th tributary entering the Batten Kill\nnumbering upstream from the mouth. H-301-17-P 79\n\nCossayuna Lake\n\nThe 79th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in the\nbiological survey of the Upper Hudson River watershed, and specifically located\nin the drainage basin of Whittacker Brook. H-301-17-P 79-4\n\nUnnamed tributary\n\nThe 4th tributary entering Cossayuna Lake numbering\nclockwise from the outlet of the lake. H-301-17(3.8)\n\nWhittacker Brook\nA point on Whittacker Brook measured three and\neight-tenths miles upstream from the mouth, which point is a road crossing at\nthe hamlet of Cossayuna. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after\nthe waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. The following maps were produced from original maps which may be\nprocured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref.
