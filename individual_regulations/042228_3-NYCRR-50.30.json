  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 50.30 - Basis and time of investments and redemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of investment and\nredemption of shares of the mutual trust investment company, the principal of\nthe fund shall be determined by adding to the value of the investments, as\ndetermined in accordance with the provisions of sections\n50.20\n-50.22 of this Part, the\nuninvested cash principal and other items of principal, and by deducting from\nthe total thereof any liabilities, due or accrued, chargeable to principal. For\nthe purpose of computing the value per share, the principal thus determined\nshall be divided by the number of existing shares and such share value, together with a sum equal to the proportionate share of any income held or\naccrued and remaining undistributed at the valuation date, shall be the basis\nfor investment in and redemption of shares of the mutual trust investment\ncompany. In determining the value of a share, fractions less than one-hundredth\npercent of the original share value may be omitted. No investment in or\nredemption from the mutual trust investment company shall be permitted except\non the basis of such valuation and as of such valuation date. A reasonable\nperiod, not to exceed seven calendar days, following each valuation date may be\nused to make the computations necessary to determine the value of the fund and\nof the shares therein. No investment in or redemption from the mutual trust\ninvestment company shall be permitted unless a written request for, or notice\nof intention of, taking such action as of a specified valuation date shall have\nbeen received by the transfer agent for the mutual trust investment company\nshares on or before the last business day prior to the specified valuation\ndate. (b) When redemptions of\nshares are made by the mutual trust investment company, distributions may be\nmade in cash or rateably in kind, or partly in cash and partly rateably in\nkind, provided that all distributions as of any one valuation date shall be\nmade on the same basis. Before any distribution in cash is made, the mutual\ntrust investment company shall determine whether any investment remaining in\nthe mutual trust investment company has ceased to be eligible as a new\ninvestment of such mutual trust investment company, and no distribution shall\nbe made in cash until any such investment shall have been eliminated from the\nmutual trust investment company either through sale, distribution in kind, or\nsegregation as provided in sections\n50.50\n-50.52 of this\n\nPart.
