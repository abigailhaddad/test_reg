  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 7B.15 - School Speed Limit Assembly (S4-1P, S4-2P, S4-3P, S4-4P, S4-6P, S5-1) and END SCHOOL SPEED LIMIT Sign (S5-3)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section. INSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 00A A New York School Speed Limit assembly (see Figure\n7B-101) shall be used to indicate the speed limit where a reduced school speed\nlimit zone has been established based upon an engineering study or where a\nreduced school speed limit is specified for such areas by statute. The New York\n\nSchool Speed Limit assembly shall be placed at or as near as practical to the\npoint where the reduced school speed limit zone begins. 00B The S5-1 sign and the S4-1P, S4-2P, S4-4P, and S4-6P\nplaques shall not be used in New York. Support: 00C Section\n2B.13\ncontains information\nregarding placement of additional speed limit signs within a speed zone. 00D The New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law (Sections\n1620(a), 1622, 1630, 1643, 1662-a, 1180(c)) specifies the maximum length of a\nschool speed limit zone and the locations where school speed limits may be\nestablished, the times when the limits are allowed to be in effect, and the\nmanner in which the speed limits must be posted. A school is considered to be\nevery place of academic, vocational or religious services or instruction for\npersons under the age of 21 years, except places of higher education. It shall\ninclude every child care center, every institution for the care or training of\nthe mentally or physically handicapped; and every day camp. (17 NYCRR\n720.1\n(s))\n\nStandard: 00E If a reduced school speed limit zone has been\nestablished, a School (S1-1) sign (see Figure 7B-1) shall be installed in\nadvance (see Table NY2C-4 for advance placement guidelines) of the first School\n\nSpeed Limit sign assembly that is encountered in each direction as traffic\napproaches the reduced school speed limit zone (see Figure 7B-102). 00F In order for a school speed limit to be established, all of the following conditions shall be met: A. The facility is a school; and\nB. Some of the children walk or bicycle to or\nfrom the facility; or the facility and related facilities (e.g., classrooms, cafeteria, gymnasium, playground, athletic fields, parking lots) are separated\nby a highway and require the children to cross the highway on foot to access\nthe facilities; and\nC. The facility\nand the jurisdiction responsible for the highway provide written documentation\nof their support for a school speed limit. Guidance: 00G Where a school speed limit is established and if\nstudents must cross a highway at a school, the following conditions should be\nmet: A. The school speed limit zone\ncontains a marked crosswalk; and\nB. The crosswalk is supervised by an adult crossing guard; and\nC. There is no nearby traffic control signal, pedestrian overpass or underpass, or bridge suitable for pedestrian use within\nthe designated school speed zone. 00H The numerical value of a school speed limit should be\napproximately 10 MPH below the normally prevailing 85th percentile speed on the\nhighway, or at approximately the actual 85th percentile speed within the zone\nduring school crossing periods. Standard: 00I In accordance with the New York State Vehicle and\n\nTraffic Law, school speed limits shall not be set below 15 MPH. 00J The maximum length of a school speed limit zone, as\nestablished in the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law, shall not be greater\nthan 1320 feet (0.25 mile) on a highway passing a school building, entrance or\nexit of a school abutting on the highway. Guidance: 00K The reduced speed limit zone should begin at a point\neither 200 feet upstream from the crosswalk, or 300 feet upstream from the\nschool property line, whichever is encountered first as traffic approaches the\nschool. The minimum length of a school speed limit zone should be 400\nfeet. Option: 00L Longitudinal distances may be slightly adjusted to fit\nfield conditions. Standard: 00M The hours of operation of a school speed limit as\nestablished by the New York State Vehicle and Traffic Law shall be effective\nonly on \"school days\" at times indicated by the school speed limit sign. The\nhours of operation shall be one of the following: A. Between the core hours of 7:00 AM and 6:00\nPM, inclusive; or\nB. Alternative\ntimes within such core hours (e.g., 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM, 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM and\n2:00 PM to 4:00 PM); or\nC. A period\nwhen beacons attached to the school speed limit assembly are flashing, and such\nsign is equipped with a WHEN FLASHING (NYR7-13P) plaque (see Sign Drawing\nSD-R11) indicating that the school speed zone is in effect when such beacons\nare flashing. The beacons shall only flash during student activities at the\nschool, and up to 30 minutes immediately before and up to 30 minutes\nimmediately after such student activities. 00N A School Speed Limit assembly shall consist of one of\nthe following configurations: A. Standard School Speed Limit Assembly -- A Speed Limit (R2-1) sign (see Section\n2B.13\n) with a SCHOOL (S4-3P)\nplaque (see Figure 7B-1) mounted above it. In addition, the assembly shall\ncontain one of the following: A time (NYR7-4P) plaque (see Sign Drawing SD-R11)\nindicating the times the school speed limit is in effect mounted below the\n\nSpeed Limit sign; or\nA time (NYR7-4P) plaque indicating the times the school\nspeed limit is in effect mounted below the Speed Limit sign, with Speed Limit\n\nSign Beacons (see Section\n4L.04\n) that are operated only when\nthe school speed limit is in effect; or\nA WHEN FLASHING (NYR7-13P) plaque (see Sign Drawing SD-R11)\nmounted below the Speed Limit sign, and Speed Limit Sign Beacons that are\noperated only when the school speed limit is in effect; B. Blank-Out School Speed Limit Assembly --\nIdentical to the Standard School Speed Limit assembly, except that the Speed\n\nLimit (R2-1) sign contains a blank-out message device which displays a numeric\nspeed value when the school speed limit is in effect and no message at other\ntimes. When no numeric value is displayed, Speed Limit Sign Beacons, if\nprovided, shall not be operated; or\nC. Changeable School Speed Limit Assembly --\nA Speed Limit (R2-1) sign with a changeable message element for the numerals, with a SCHOOL (S4-3P) plaque mounted above it. The assembly shall also contain\na WHEN FLASHING (NYR7-13P) plaque mounted below the Speed Limit sign, and Speed\n\nLimit Sign Beacons that are operated only when the school speed limit is in\neffect. If the changeable message device is used to display a speed limit other\nthan the school speed limit, the SCHOOL plaque shall be a blank-out device that\nis not illuminated when the school speed limit is not in effect. If no\nnumerical speed is displayed, the school speed limit shall not be in effect, and the Speed Limit Sign Beacons shall not be operated; or\nD. Overhead School Speed Limit Assembly --\nSimilar to the Standard School Speed Limit Assembly or the Blank-Out School\n\nSpeed Limit assembly, except that the Speed Limit sign and SCHOOL plaque are\nintegrated into a single sign (NYR2-8) (see Sign Drawing SD-R2), and\nsupplemented with either a time (NYR7-4) plaque or WHEN FLASHING (NYR7-13aP)\nplaque. If a WHEN FLASHING (NYR7-13aP) plaque is used, Speed Limit Sign Beacons\nshall also be installed and shall only operate when the school speed limit is\nin effect. The NYR2-8 sign shall only be installed overhead. A post-mounted\nsign shall not be required where a NYR2-8 sign is used. 00O White pixels on a black background shall be used when\nthe numerals for a speed limit are displayed on a changeable message sign or a\nblank-out sign in a school speed limit assembly. 00P Fluorescent yellow-green pixels on a black background\nshall be used when the SCHOOL (S4-3P) plaque is a blank-out sign as part of a\nschool speed limit assembly. Guidance: 00Q A confirmation light or device to indicate that the\nspeed limit message is in operation should be considered for inclusion on the\nback of the changeable or blank-out message sign. Option: 00R Changeable message signs that display the speed of\napproaching drivers (see Section\n2B.13\n) may be used in a school\nspeed limit zone. Standard: 00S Except as provided in Paragraph 00T, the downstream end\nof an authorized and posted reduced school speed limit zone shall be identified\nwith an END SCHOOL SPEED LIMIT (S5-3) sign (see Figure 7B-102). Option: 00T A standard Speed Limit sign showing the speed limit for\nthe section of highway that is downstream from the authorized and posted\nreduced school speed limit zone may be mounted on the same post above the END\nSCHOOL SPEED LIMIT (S5-3) sign.
