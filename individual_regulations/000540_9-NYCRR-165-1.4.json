(1)\n\nEligibility. Youth\ndevelopment funding shall be distributed by the office to eligible\nmunicipalities that have an approved comprehensive plan for youth development\nprograms. (2)\n\nDistribution\nmethodology. Youth development funding shall be limited to the funds\nspecifically appropriated for youth development programs. The distribution of\nyouth development funding shall be based on the number of youth under the age\nof 21 residing in each municipality, as shown by the last published Federal\ncensus and certified in the manner provided for by section\n54\nof the\n\nState Finance Law, as well as on other factors determined by the office, which\nmay include, but are not limited to: (i) the\npercentage and/or number of youth living in poverty within each\nmunicipality; (ii)\nthe amount of\nprevious allocations; (iii)\nthe\namount of previous claims; and\n(iv)\nsuccess in achieving previous targeted performance outcomes. (3)\n\nMunicipal youth bureaus\nserving more than one county.

(4)\n\nStatewide training and technical\nassistance. The office may use a portion of youth development funding to enter\ninto contracts to provide statewide training for youth development programs, to\nassist municipalities in obtaining performance data that can be used to improve\nyouth development programming, and/or for other efforts that directly support\nyouth development programs. (b) Reimbursable expenditures and\nclaims. (1)\n\nExpenditures of youth\ndevelopment funding by a municipality must be in accordance with the\ninformation contained in the municipality's approved comprehensive plan for\nyouth development programs. (2)\n\nYouth development program funding must directly support the establishment, operation and/or maintenance of a youth development program. Youth development\nfunding must be used to provide community-level services designed to promote\npositive youth development. These may include, but are not limited to, services\nthat: (i) promote physical and emotional\nwellness, educational achievement or civic, family and community\nengagement; (ii)\nprovide family\nsupport; (iii)\nprevent juvenile\ndelinquency and/or child abuse and neglect; (iv)\navert family crises; (v) provide support services to youth in an\napproved runaway or transitional independent living support program; and\n(vi)\nassist youth in need of\ncrisis intervention or respite services.

(4)\n\nAll\nclaims for youth development funding must be submitted in the manner and format\nrequired by the office. This may include electronic submission. (5)\n\nThe office may establish policies and\nprocedures regarding reimbursement of expenditures. (c) Municipal youth bureaus serving\nmore than one municipality. In accordance with Executive Law section 422(5), two or\nmore municipalities may join together to establish, operate and maintain a\nmunicipal youth bureau. (1)\n\nSuch\nmunicipalities must establish agreements that include provisions for the\nproportionate costs to be borne by each municipality and for the manner of\nemployment of personnel. (2)\n\nSuch\nmunicipalities may establish agreements designating a fiscal officer of one of\nthe participating municipalities to be the custodian of all moneys available\nfor such purposes by all such municipalities; the fiscal officer may make\npayments upon audit by the appropriate auditing body or officer of his or her\nmunicipality. (3)\n\nIn making claims\nfor youth development program expenditures, each such municipality must claim\nfor its proportionate share of the total joint expenditures. However, where\nthere is a disbursing municipality as described in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, the disbursing municipality may claim for the total joint program\nexpenditures and disburse the youth development funding to each participating\nmunicipality based upon its proportionate share of expenditures. The disbursing\nmunicipality must inform the office of the amount of all such\ndisbursements. (d) Funding of local youth bureaus. A municipality's comprehensive plan for youth development\nprograms may provide funding for a municipal youth bureau and for one or more\nlocal youth bureaus that have been approved by the municipality in accordance\nwith section\n165-1.5\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart after April 1, 2013. Any local youth bureau approved by the office on\nor before April 1, 2013 shall be an approved youth bureau for funding purposes. A municipality may not provide youth development funding to a local youth\nbureau prior to approval by the office of its comprehensive plan for youth\ndevelopment programs that describes the local youth bureau and the activities\nthat it will conduct. Youth development funding for local youth bureaus is\nsubject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nIn order to receive youth development\nfunding, a local youth bureau must be providing, operating, administering, or\nmonitoring youth development programs. (2)\n\nNo more than 15 percent of the youth\ndevelopment funds that a municipality provides to a local youth bureau may be\nused for administrative functions performed by the local youth\nbureau. (e) Limitations on reimbursable expenditures and claims. (1)\n\nThe office may determine whether claims\nfor youth development funding are reasonable, and therefore reimbursable, taking into consideration the number of youth served, the type and quality of\nservices provided, and the program cost. (2)\n\nIf a municipality does not allocate youth\ndevelopment funding pursuant to its approved comprehensive plan, the office may\nwithhold reimbursement to the municipality and/or disallow claims. (3)\n\nFailure of the municipality to comply\nwith applicable laws, rules and regulations may result in termination of youth\ndevelopment funding, disapproval of claims, and/or non-payment of\nclaims. (4)\n\nThe office may not\nreimburse claims for youth development funding for the costs of administrative\nstaff where such staff lacks the qualifications necessary for the work or where\nsuch staff has demonstrated through their work that they are unable to perform\ntheir duties in such manner as to provide a satisfactory youth development\nprogram, as determined by the office. (f) Financial reports. The office may require municipalities receiving youth\ndevelopment funding to submit reports no more often than once per year\nconcerning expenditures for the planning, operation, administration, and\nmonitoring of its youth development programs, to be submitted in the time, manner, and form prescribed by the office and to provide information as\nspecified by the office.
