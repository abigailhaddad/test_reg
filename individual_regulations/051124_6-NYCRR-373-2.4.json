  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.4 - Contingency plan and emergency procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Purpose and implementation of\ncontingency plan. (1)\n\nEach owner or\noperator must have a contingency plan for his facility. The contingency plan\nmust be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from\nfires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or nonsudden release of hazardous\nwaste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil or surface water. (2)\n\nThe provisions of the plan must be\ncarried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion or release of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human\nhealth or the environment. (c) Content of contingency plan. (1)\n\nThe contingency plan must describe the\nactions facility personnel must take to comply with subdivisions (b) and (g) of\nthis section in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or\nnonsudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil or surface water at the facility. (2)\n\nIf the owner or operator has already\nprepared a spill prevention, control and countermeasures (SPCC) plan, as\ndefined in section\n610.2\n(j) of this\n\nTitle and 40 CFR part\n300\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), or some other emergency or contingency plan, that plan need only be\namended to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are\nsufficient to comply with the requirements of this Subpart (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle). The owner or operator may develop one contingency plan which meets all\nregulatory requirements. When modifications are made to the non-Part 370\nthrough 374 and Part 376 provisions in an integrated contingency plan, the\nchanges do not trigger the need for a Part 373 permit modification. (3)\n\nThe plan must describe arrangements\nagreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate\nemergency services, pursuant to section\n373-2.3\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart. (4)\n\nThe plan must list\nnames, addresses and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified\nto act as emergency coordinator (see subdivision [f] of this section), and this\nlist must be kept up-to-date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be\nnamed as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order\nin which they will assume responsibility as alternates. For new facilities, this information must be supplied to the commissioner at the time of\ncertification, rather than at the time of permit application. (5)\n\nThe plan must include a list of all\nemergency equipment at the facility (such as fire-extinguishing systems, spill\ncontrol equipment, communications and alarm systems [internal and external], and decontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list\nmust be kept up-to-date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a\nphysical description of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its\ncapabilities. (6)\n\nThe plan must\ninclude an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility\nthat evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe signal(s) to be\nused to begin evacuation, evacuation routes and alternate evacuation routes (in\ncases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous waste\nor fires). (d) Copies of contingency plan. A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the\nplan must be: (1)\nmaintained at the\nfacility; and\n(2)\nsubmitted to all\nlocal police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local\nemergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency services. Note: The contingency plan must be submitted to the\ncommissioner with the permit application and, after modification or approval, will become a condition of any permit issued. (e) Amendment of contingency\nplan. All amendments to the contingency plan must be approved\nby the commissioner in accordance with section\n373-1.7\nof this Part (permit\nmodifications). The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately amended, if necessary, whenever: (1)\nthe\nfacility permit is revised; (2)\nthe\nplan fails in an emergency; (3)\nthe\nfacility changes-in its design, construction, operation, maintenance or other\ncircumstances-in a way that materially increases the potential for fires, explosions or releases of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or\nchanges the response necessary in an emergency; (4)\nthe list of emergency coordinators\nchanges; or\n(5)\nthe list of\nemergency equipment changes. Note: A change in the lists of facility emergency coordinators\nor equipment in the contingency plan constitutes a minor modification to the\nfacility permit to which the plan is a condition. (f) Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either\non the facility premises or on call (\ni.e., available to\nrespond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of time)\nwith the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response measures. This\nemergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all aspects of the\nfacility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at the facility, the\nlocation and characteristics of waste handled, the location of all records\nwithin the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this person must\nhave the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the contingency\nplan. Note: The emergency coordinator's responsibilities are more\nfully spelled out in subdivision (g) of this section. Applicable\nresponsibilities for the emergency coordinator vary, depending on factors such\nas type and variety of waste(s) handled by the facility, and type and\ncomplexity of the facility. (g) Emergency procedures. (1)\n\nWhenever there is an imminent or actual\nemergency situation, the emergency coordinator (or the emergency coordinator's\ndesignee when the emergency coordinator is on call) must immediately: (i) activate internal facility alarms or\ncommunication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and\n(ii)\nnotify appropriate State\nor local agencies with designated response roles if their help is\nneeded. (2)\n\nWhenever\nthere is a release, fire or explosion, the emergency coordinator must\nimmediately identify the character, exact source, amount and aerial extent of\nany released materials. The emergency coordinator may do this by observation or\nreview of facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical\nanalysis. (3)\n\nConcurrently, the\nemergency coordinator must assess possible hazards to human health or the\nenvironment that may result from the release, fire or explosion. This\nassessment must consider both direct and indirect effects of the release, fire\nor explosion (\ne.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating or\nasphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface\nwater runoff from water or chemical agents used to control fire and\nheat-induced explosions). (4)\n\nIf\nthe emergency coordinator determines that the facility has had a release, fire\nor explosion which could threaten human health or the environment outside the\nfacility, the findings must be reported as follows: (i) If the emergency coordinator's assessment\nindicates that evacuation of local areas may be advisable, appropriate local\nauthorities must be immediately notified. The emergency coordinator must be\navailable to help appropriate officials decide whether local areas should be\nevacuated. (ii)\n\nThe emergency\ncoordinator must immediately notify both the department (using the New York\n\nState 24-hour oil and hazardous material spill notification number, 518/457-7362) and either the government official designated as the on-scene\ncoordinator for that geographical area in the applicable regional contingency\nplan under 40 CFR part\n300\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), or the National Response Center (using their 24-hour toll-free number, 800/424-8802). The report must include: (a) name and telephone number of reporter; (b) name and address of facility; (c) time and type of incident\n(\ne.g., release, fire); (d) name and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved, to the extent known; (e) the extent of injuries, if any; and\n(f) the possible hazards to human health, or\nthe environment, outside the facility. (5)\n\nDuring an emergency, the emergency\ncoordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions and releases do not occur, recur or spread to other hazardous waste\nat the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping\nprocesses and operations, collecting and containing released waste, and\nremoving or isolating containers. (6)\n\nIf the facility stops operations in\nresponse to a fire, explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must\nmonitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation or ruptures in valves, pipes or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate. (7)\n\nImmediately after an emergency, the\nemergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing or disposing of\nrecovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that\nresults from a release, fire or explosion at the facility. Comment: Unless the owner or operator\ncan demonstrate, in accordance with section\n371.1\n(d)(3) or (4)\nof this Title, that the recovered material is not a hazardous waste, the owner\nor operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in\naccordance with all applicable requirements of Part 372 of this Title and this\n\nSubpart. (8)\n\nThe emergency\ncoordinator must ensure that, in the affected area(s) of the facility: (i) no waste that may be incompatible with\nthe released material is treated, stored or disposed of until cleanup\nprocedures are completed; and\n(ii)\nall emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for\nits intended use before operations are resumed. (9)\n\nThe owner or operator must notify the\ncommissioner, and appropriate State and local authorities, that the facility is\nin compliance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision before operations are\nresumed in the affected area(s) of the facility. (10)\n\nThe owner or operator must note in the\noperating record the time, date and details of any incident that requires\nimplementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, the owner\nor operator must submit a written report on the incident to the commissioner. The report must include: (i) name, address and\ntelephone number of the owner or operator; (ii)\nname, address and telephone number of\nthe facility; (iii)\ndate, time and\ntype of incident (\ne.g., fire, explosion); (iv)\nname and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved; (v) the extent of\ninjuries, if any; (vi)\nan\nassessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and\n(vii)\nestimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the\nincident.
