  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 7.7 - Purchase orders involving labor and service contracts\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen labor is a major part of a purchase order or contract\n(exclusive of contracts for construction and repair work which are covered in\n\nPart 4 of this Title) such purchase orders or contracts do not require approval\nof the Office of General Services and shall therefore be forwarded directly to\nthe Comptroller. Competition is required on all such transactions which lend\nthemselves to competition, and prior approval of the Comptroller is also\nrequired when the amount thereof exceeds $1,000. When it can predetermined from\npast experience or knowledge of anticipated cost that charges in the aggregate\nfor a certain service will exceed $1,000 in a given fiscal year, such\ntransactions also shall be subject to contract, competitive bid requirements\nand prior approval of the Comptroller. It is an administrative agency\nresponsibility to obtain competitive quotations or bids on transactions of\n$1,000 or less when it is deemed in the best interest of the State to do so. However, prior approval of the Comptroller is not required. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n7.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
