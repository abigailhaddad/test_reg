  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 182.4 - Listing of species of special concern\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Criteria for listing. The department will\nconsider one or more of the following factors to determine whether a native\nspecies should be listed as a species of special concern in New York: (1)\nthe species is designated as a federal\ncandidate species under the Federal Endangered Species Act or is listed as\nthreatened or endangered in any adjacent state or province; (2)\nthe species is determined to be in some\njeopardy due to adverse trends to which it is vulnerable, and if not monitored\nor ameliorated, could lead to more serious decline and listing as either an\nendangered or threatened species in New York; (3)\nthe species appears to have undergone a\nserious, non-cyclical decline or could do so if protection or proactive\nmanagement steps are not undertaken; and\n(4)\nthe species is sufficiently uncommon or\nseverely restricted in its range in New York that any reduction in its\npopulation or habitat may cause it to become threatened in the foreseeable\nfuture. (b) Criteria for\nde-listing. A species will be removed from the list of species of special\nconcern when, after applying the factors set forth in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the department determines that the species no longer qualifies as a\nspecies of special concern.
