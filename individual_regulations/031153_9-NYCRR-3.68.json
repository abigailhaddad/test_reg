  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.68 - Executive Order No. 68: Directing the implementation of alternative work schedules in agencies of government\n\nState Regulations\n\nAgencies of government must constantly seek to maximize\nproductivity of operations and the quality of services provided to the people\nof the State, and at the same time, enhance employment opportunities for\nqualified persons unable to obtain employment under conventional work\nschedules. It is hereby declared to be the policy of this State to\nencourage and promote the implementation of alternative work schedules such as\n\"flextime\" and year-round part-time work schedules in those agencies of\ngovernment where it is demonstrated that the use of such alternative work\nschedules: -will provide increased availability of public service or\notherwise enhance the productivity of State government operations; and\n-will increase the number and caliber of individuals\navailable for recruitment into State services; and\n-will increase employee morale and reduce absenteeism\nand/or tardiness and enhance the delivery of necessary care and services to\npersons dependent upon the State, without compromising effective\nsupervision. Each State agency shall identify those organizational units\nand positions for which alternative work schedules may be appropriate. The\n\nDepartment of Civil Service shall provide each State Agency with information on\nways of implementing various types of alternative work schedules, shall assist\nthe management of each agency in determining the extent to which it is feasible\nto adopt alternative work schedules and at the same time to increase hours of\noperation and/or the productivity of operations, and shall review the\nperformance of State agencies in complying with the Order. Prior to implementing alternative work schedules, State\nagencies shall file a brief statement with the Director of the Budget, the\n\nPresident of the Civil Service Commission, and the Director of Employee\n\nRelations describing the nature of the change in the work schedule, the extent\nto which the change is consistent with existing attendance rules and\ncontractual provisions, the means by which continued employment for incumbent\nemployees is ensured, the method for maintaining accurate time records under\nthe proposed work schedule, any added costs to be generated by the change in\nwork schedule, and the specific benefits in terms of expanded hours of\noperation and/or improved productivity that will be associated with the change\nin work schedule. If the proposed change in work schedule involves the\ncreation of any new positions or reclassification of any existing positions, it\nshall not be implemented until the new positions and/or reclassifications have\nbeen approved pursuant to existing procedures by the Department of Civil\n\nService and the Division of the Budget. The Department of Civil Service and the\n\nDivision of the Budget shall act on such requests as expeditiously as\npossible. If the change in work schedule proposed in such a statement\ndoes not involve the creation of any new positions or the reclassification of\nany existing positions, it may be implemented thirty working days after the\nfiling of the statement unless the Director of the Budget disapproves the\nproposal in writing (copies of any such written disapprovals shall be filed\nwith the Department of Civil Service and the Office of Employee Relations); provided, however, that before implementing any changes in work schedules\npursuant to the provisions and intent of this Order, a State agency shall first\nconsult the Office of Employee Relations and, with Office of Employee Relations\nconcurrence, enter into appropriate discussions with duly designated\nrepresentatives of the State employees who will be affected by the work\nschedule. Prior to April 1, 1978, each State agency shall provide a\nwritten report to the Secretary to the Governor outlining specific alternative\nwork schedule proposals that it has implemented or intends to implement. Not later than September first of each year, the President\nof the Civil Service Commission shall submit a report to the Governor\ndescribing the impact of alternative work schedules on the quality of State\noperations and on employment opportunities for minorities, women, the elderly\nand the disabled and all agencies of State government; recommending areas to be\nexplored during the coming year to determine where alternative work schedules\nmight be used effectively to meet the obligations and objectives expressed in\nthis Order; and proposing any necessary changes in law, regulation or policy\ngrowing out of the Department's experience in carrying out its responsibilities\nunder this Order. Copies of such report, which shall be available for use in\nconjunction with the Governor's review of current operations and the\ndevelopment of his program and budgetary recommendations for the coming fiscal\nyear, shall be filed with the Division of the Budget and the Office of Employee\n\nRelations. The Department of Civil Service may make such inspections and\nrequire such reports as may be necessary to fulfill its responsibilities under\nthis program. Signed: Hugh L.
