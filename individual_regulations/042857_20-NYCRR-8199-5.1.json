  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8199-5.1 - Aggregate additional assessments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For Adirondack Park parcels: (1)\nA cumulative change in level of\nassessment shall be determined by consecutive multiplication of the respective\nchanges in level of assessment for each final assessment roll subsequent to the\n1960 roll up to and including the prior roll, and the current roll where the\nchange in level on the current roll is two percent or more. (2)\n\nThe approved assessments, by taxing unit, for the assessment roll completed in 1960 for parcels which were on the 1960\nroll and which are also on the current roll shall be added together. (3)\n\nThe sum obtained for each taxing unit in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision shall be multiplied by the accumulated change\nin level of assessment to obtain the Adirondack Park minimum. (4)\n\nThe approved assessments for the current\nroll, by taxing unit, for Adirondack Park parcels shall be added\ntogether. (5)\nA comparison shall be\nmade, by taxing unit, of the Adirondack Park minimum in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision to the sum of the approved assessments for Adirondack Park parcels\nin paragraph (4) of this subdivision. If the Adirondack Park minimum is greater\nthan the sum of the approved assessments, an aggregate additional assessment\nshall be computed for that taxing unit by subtracting the sum of the approved\nassessments from the Adirondack Park minimum and rounding to the nearest\n$10. (b) For River\n\nRegulating District (RRD) parcels: (1)\nA\ncumulative change in level of assessment shall be determined by consecutive\nmultiplication of the respective changes in level of assessment for each final\nassessment roll: (i) for RRD parcels acquired\nprior to 1959, from the 1959 roll, up to and including the prior roll; and by\nthe change in level for the current roll where the change in level on the\ncurrent roll is two percent or more; and\n(ii)\nfor each parcel acquired after 1959, for\neach final roll subsequent to acquisition by the RRD, up to and including the\nprior roll; and by the change in level for the current roll where the change on\nthe current roll is two percent or more. (2)\n\nThe final assessments for RRD parcels\nshall be added, by taxing unit, for: (i) RRD\nparcels acquired prior to 1959 for the assessment roll completed prior to the\nacquisition of the RRD parcels as having been increased proportionately with\nthe increase of other real property in such tax district through 1959; and\n(ii)\neach RRD parcel acquired\nsubsequent to 1959 for the assessment roll completed prior to the acquisition\nof the RRD parcels. (3)\n\nThese sums by taxing unit, shall be multiplied by the corresponding cumulative\nchange in level of assessment for: (i) RRD\nparcels acquired prior to 1959; and\n(ii)\neach RRD parcel acquired subsequent to\n1959. (4)\n\nThe RRD\nminimum is the sum of the products obtained in subparagraphs (3)(i) and (ii) of\nthis subdivision. (5)\n\nThe approved\nassessments for the current roll, by taxing unit, for RRD parcels shall be\nadded together. (6)\nA comparison\nshall be made of the RRD minimum to the sum of the approved assessments for RRD\nparcels by taxing unit. If the RRD minimum is greater than the sum of the\napproved assessments for a taxing unit, an aggregate additional assessment is\ncomputed for that taxing unit by subtracting the sum of the approved\nassessments from the RRD minimum and rounding to the nearest $10.
