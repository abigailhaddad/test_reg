  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 142.1 - Definition of terms\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor the purpose of these regulations, certain terms used in\nsubdivision 7, section\n130\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law are defined as follows: (a) Community wage practices in private or\nother public employment. Refers to the wage rates paid by a significant number\nof employers in the area or location who employ substantial numbers of workers\nin the occupation involved. (b) Area or location. Consists of an identifiable place in the State, as specified\nby the Director of Classification and Compensation, on the basis of\ngeographical or other physical boundaries, with reference to the particular\noccupation involved and to related labor market considerations. (c) Occupation. Class (title) or series of\nclasses in the New York State service. (d) Similar occupation in private or public\nemployment. An occupation or occupations having duties and responsibilities\nsubstantially the same as those of the occupation or occupations in the State\nservice which become the subject of review under this section of law. (e) Substantially higher. This term in its\nstatutory context is the measure by which rates for a given occupation in\nprivate or other nonstate employment in one or more areas of the State exceed\nthe rates for the same occupation in State service. Substantiality here shall\nbe construed to mean a difference in the salaries paid by nonstate employers\nfor a particular occupation in a high rate area, and the salary paid for the\nsame occupation by the State, sufficiently large as to reasonably support a\nfinding by the Director of Classification and Compensation that the State will\nbe at a competitive disadvantage in the employment of qualified persons for\npositions in the occupation in the high rate area without the authorization of\na geographic area pay differential. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n142.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
