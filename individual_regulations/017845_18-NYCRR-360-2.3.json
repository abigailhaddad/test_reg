  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-2.3 - Investigation of eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Generally. (1)\n\nThe social services district has a\ncontinuing obligation to collect, verify, record and evaluate factual\ninformation concerning an MA applicant's/recipient's eligibility for\nMA. (2)\n\nThe MA applicant/recipient\nhas a continuing obligation to provide accurate and complete information on\nhis/her income, resources, and other factors that affect eligibility. The\napplicant/recipient must also provide information on the income and resources\nof a nonapplying legally responsible relative, even if the relative is not\nliving with the applicant/recipient; if the applicant/recipient does not\npossess this information, he/she must cooperate with the social services\ndistrict in obtaining it. An applicant/recipient will not have eligibility\ndenied or discontinued solely because he/she does not possess and cannot obtain\ninformation about the income or resources of a nonapplying legally responsible\nrelative who is not living with him/her. (3)\n\nThe applicant/recipient is the primary\nsource of eligibility information. When an applicant/recipient is unable to\ndocument the information provided, the social services district must conduct an\ninvestigation to verify such information. The social services district must\nalso conduct such an investigation if it believes that information provided by\nan applicant/recipient is inaccurate. The district may examine records, other\nthan public records, only with the applicant's/recipient's permission. If the\napplicant/recipient refuses such permission and the social services district is\nunable to verify information through public records, the applicant/recipient\nwill be informed that the district is unable to determine MA eligibility. The\napplication then will be denied, or eligibility will be discontinued. (4)\n\nPart 351 of this Title sets forth\nadditional requirements which must be met in the investigation\nprocess. (b) Nonfinancial eligibility requirements. The social services district must verify\nthat applicants and recipients meet the nonfinancial eligibility requirements\ncontained in Subpart 360-3 of this Part.

The\ndistrict must consider the income and resources of all legally responsible\nrelatives. The review will be based on information in the application and from\na personal interview with the applicant/recipient or the person applying on\nhis/her behalf. The district must consider only available income and resources, as defined in Subpart 360-4 of this Part. To be eligible for MA, the applicant\nmust pursue any potential income and resources that may be available. As soon\nas income or resources become available, the applicant must report them to the\ndistrict. The district must reevaluate the applicant's eligibility for MA based\non the new financial information. (2)\n\nVerification of income. The applicant\nmust submit with his/her application documentation of wages received by all\nemployed family members who are included in the application and by all legally\nresponsible relatives living with the applicant. Acceptable forms of\ndocumentation are pay envelopes, wage stubs, or an employer's statement of\nwages. If the applicant's income varies, the documentation must show all wages\nearned in the past four weeks. If the applicant cannot supply such\ndocumentation, the social services district can accept other forms of\ninformation which it determines will verify the wages earned.
