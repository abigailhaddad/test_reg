The provisions of this section shall not apply to mechanical means\nof demolition. (b) Demolition of\nwalls and partitions. (1)\n\nThe demolition of\nwalls and partitions shall proceed in a systematic manner and all demolition\nwork above each tier of floor beams shall be completed before any demolition\nwork is performed on the supports of such floor beams. (2)\n\nMasonry shall not be loosened nor\npermitted to fall in such masses as to endanger the structural stability of any\nfloor or structural support which such masonry may strike in falling. (3)\n\nWalls, chimneys and other parts of any\nbuilding or other structure shall not be left unguarded in such condition that\nsuch parts may fall, collapse or be weakened by wind pressure or\nvibration. (4)\n\nEmployers shall not\nsuffer or permit any person to work while such person is standing on top of a\nwall or any similar elevated structure of small area. (5)\n\nIn the demolition by hand of exterior\nwalls, all persons performing such work shall be provided with safe footing in\nthe form of sound flooring or scaffolds constructed and installed in compliance\nwith this Part (rule). (6)\n\nWalls or\npartitions which are being demolished by hand shall not be left standing more\nthan one story or 15 feet, whichever is less, above the uppermost floor on\nwhich persons are working. Such walls or partitions shall be removed before the\naggregate area of the openings in such floor exceeds 25 percent of the total\nfloor area. (c) Inspection. During hand demolition operations, continuing inspections shall be\nmade by designated persons as the work progresses to detect any hazards to any\nperson resulting from weakened or deteriorated floors or walls or from loosened\nmaterial. Persons shall not be suffered or permitted to work where such hazards\nexist until protection has been provided by shoring, bracing or other effective\nmeans. (d) Boarding of wall\nopenings. Where windows and other exterior wall openings in buildings or other\nstructures being demolished are more than 25 feet in height above the ground or\ngrade level and are within 20 feet of any floor opening used for the removal of\ndebris from floors above, such windows and other openings shall be solidly\nboarded up during demolition operations to prevent the accidental passage of\ndebris. (e) Methods of operation. Where the demolition of any building or other structure is being performed by\nhand, debris, bricks and any other materials shall be removed as follows: (1)\n\nBy means of chutes constructed and\ninstalled in compliance with this Part (rule); (2)\n\nBy means of buckets or hoists; or\n(3)\n\nThrough openings in the\nfloors of the building or other structure in compliance with this\nsection. (f) Access to\nfloors. There shall be provided at all times safe access to and egress from\nevery building or other structure in the course of demolition. Such safe means\nof access and egress shall consist of entrances, hallways, stairways or ladder\nruns so protected as to safeguard the persons using such means from the hazards\nof falling debris or materials. (g) Protection in other areas. Every floor or equivalent area within the building\nor other structure that is subject to the hazard of falling debris or materials\nfrom above shall be boarded up to prevent the passage of any person through\nsuch area, or shall be fenced off by a substantial safety railing constructed\nand installed in compliance with this Part (rule) and placed not less than 20\nfeet from the perimeter of such floor opening or such area shall be provided\nwith overhead protection in the form of tight planking at least two inches\nthick full size, exterior grade plywood at least three-quarters inch thick or\nmaterial of equivalent strength. (h) Demolition of structural steel by hand. Steel construction shall be demolished column length by column length and floor\nby floor. Every structural member which is being dismembered shall not be under\nany stress other than its own weight and such member shall be chained or lashed\nin place to prevent its uncontrolled swinging or dropping. Large structural\nmembers shall not be thrown or dropped from the building or other structure, but shall be carefully lowered. Where a derrick is used in the demolition of\nbuildings or other structures of skeleton steel construction, the floor upon\nwhich the derrick rests shall be completely planked over with planking of\nadequate size. Where other methods are used, the persons engaged in the\ndismantling of structural steel members shall be protected by solidly planked\nflooring not less than two inches thick full size or sound floor arches not\nmore than two stories or 30 feet, whichever is less, below and directly under\nthat portion of any tier of beams where such persons are at work. (i) Demolition of floor arches. Before\ndemolishing any floor arch, debris and other materials shall be removed from\nsuch arch and from other adjacent floor areas. Planks not less than two inches\nthick by nine inches in cross-section full size shall be provided for and shall\nbe used by the persons to stand on while breaking down floor arches between\nbeams. Such planks shall be so located as to provide safe supports for such\npersons should the arches between the beams collapse. Any open spaces between\nsuch planks shall not exceed 16 inches. (j) Floor openings. (1)\n\nPermissible aggregate area. During the\ndemolition of any building or other structure by hand, the aggregate area of\nopenings in the floor immediately beneath the floor being demolished shall not\nexceed 25 percent of the total area of such floor. (2)\n\nRequired protection. (i) Every opening used for the removal of\ndebris or materials on every floor not closed to access, except the top working\nfloor, shall be provided with an enclosure from floor to ceiling equivalent to\nthat afforded by planking not less than two inches thick full size. Such\nenclosure shall be solid except for portions openable for loosening blocked\ndebris. Alternatively, the opening shall be fenced off by a substantial safety\nrailing constructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule) and\nplaced not less than 20 feet from the perimeter of such opening. Every opening\nnot used for the removal of debris or other materials in any floor to which\naccess is permitted shall be protected by a solid enclosure as described above, by a substantial safety railing constructed and installed at least two feet\nfrom the perimeter of the opening and otherwise in compliance with this Part\n(rule) or such opening shall be solidly planked over with planks not less than\ntwo inches thick full size. (ii)\n\nOpenings in the top or working floor more than 16 inches in least dimension\nshall be protected on all sides, except the side at which debris or other\nmaterials is deposited, by a substantial safety railing constructed and\ninstalled at least two feet from the perimeter of the opening and otherwise in\ncompliance with this Part (rule) or by a rope not less than five-eighths inch\ndiameter or an equivalent chain placed not less than two feet from the\nperimeter of such opening. Such rope or chain shall be not less than 36 inches\nnor more than 42 inches above the floor surface. That portion of any floor\nopening adjacent to and immediately below a point where persons are employed in\nany work upon a wall or equivalent structure shall be provided with solid\nflooring not less than five feet in width measured from the inside face of such\nwall or equivalent structure. Such flooring shall consist of planking not less\nthan two inches thick full size, exterior grade plywood not less than\nthree-quarters inch thick or material of equivalent strength. (k) Storage of\nmaterials. (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) Materials shall not be stored on catch\nplatforms, scaffold platforms, floors or stairways of any building or other\nstructure being demolished, except that any such floor may be used for the\ntemporary storage of materials when such floor is of such strength as to safely\nsupport the load to be imposed. (ii)\n\nStorage areas shall not interfere with\naccess to any stairway or passageway used by any person as a means of ingress\nor egress. Suitable barricades shall be provided to prevent stored materials\nfrom sliding or rebounding into any area where any person is located or\npassing. All materials shall be safely piled in such locations as will not\ninterfere with any work operations nor present any hazard to any person\nemployed at or frequenting the demolition site. (2)\n\nStorage of debris or materials in\ncellars. When debris or materials are stored in the cellar or basement of any\nbuilding or other structure being demolished, such debris or materials shall\nnot be in piles which extend higher than the top of the foundation wall. The\nperson in charge of the demolition operations shall provide sheet-piling, shoring, bracing or such other means as may be necessary to insure the\nstability of such foundation walls and to prevent any such wall from collapsing\ndue to the pressure of the accumulated debris or materials. (l) Safe footing required. Any\nperson working above the first floor or ground level in the demolition of any\nbuilding or other structure shall not be suffered or permitted to use\naccumulated debris or piled materials as a footing in the performance of his\nwork. Every person shall be provided with safe footing consisting of sound\nflooring, planking not less than two inches thick full size, adequately\nsupported exterior grade plywood at least three-quarters inch thick or other\nmaterial of equivalent strength. (m) Catch platform required. During the\ndemolition of any exterior masonry wall or a roof from a point more than 75\nfeet above the adjoining ground, grade or equivalent level where persons are\nexposed to falling debris, materials or objects, a catch platform shall be\nconstructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule). Such catch\nplatform shall be located at a level not more than 20 feet below the working\nlevel. Exceptions:: (1)\nA catch platform is not required where a chimney is being demolished. Exceptions:: (2)\nA catch platform is not required where a\nscaffold, constructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule), provide equivalent protection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
