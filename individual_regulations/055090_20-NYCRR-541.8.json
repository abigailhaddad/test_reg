  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.8 - Charges for temporary facilities at construction sites\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(c)(3), (5)\n(a) General. Subcontracts to provide temporary facilities at\nconstruction sites, which are a necessary prerequisite to the construction of a\ncapital improvement to real property, are considered a part of the capital\nimprovement to real property. Charges for installation of materials and the\nlabor to provide temporary heat, temporary electric service, temporary\nprotective pedestrian walkways, and temporary plumbing by a subcontractor are\ntherefore not subject to tax provided the subcontractor receives a copy of the\nproperly completed certificate of capital improvement issued by the customer to\nthe contractor. Example: A subcontractor agrees to furnish to the prime contractor\nthe materials and labor necessary to furnish temporary light and electrical\nfacilities throughout a building under construction so that the various trades\nmay have light, communication and power facilities necessary for them to\nperform their work and operate their tools. The charges are a constituent part\nof the capital improvement and are not subject to tax. (b) The subcontractor is liable, however, for\nthe tax on the purchase of the materials used to provide the temporary\nfacilities at construction sites described in subdivision (a) of this section. Cross-reference: For agency contracts, see sections\n541.2\nand\n541.5\nof this Part. For agency contracts with exempt organizations, see section\n541.3\nof this Part. Example 1: A subcontractor agrees to furnish temporary site plumbing\nservice to the prime contractor engaged in the construction of an office\nbuilding. The subcontractor must purchase a quantity of pipes, pumps, and\nfittings in order to provide the temporary service. The service is a\nconstituent part of the capital improvement, thus, the subcontractor's charge\nfor the temporary plumbing services are not subject to tax. However, the\nsubcontractor is liable for the tax due on his purchase of all materials needed\nto provide the temporary plumbing service. Example 2: The same situation prevails as in example one, except the\noffice building is being built under an agency agreement with the contractor\nand all subcontractors. The purchases of all materials required to provide the\ntemporary site service are subject to tax when purchased by the\nsubcontractor-agent for the principal. (c) Charges by the utility furnishing gas, electricity, refrigeration or telephone, and for the purchase of fuel for the\noperation of any temporary site services are not part of a capital improvement\nto real property and are subject to the applicable sales and use taxes. Guard\nand protective services are subject to the New York City sales and use taxes\nimposed pursuant to the authority of section\n1212-A\nof the Tax Law. Example: Electricity used to operate the temporary site electrical\ninstallation service is metered and billed directly to the construction\ncontractor by the utility company supplying the electricity. Such charges are\nnot part of the capital improvement and are fully taxable to the\ncontractor/purchaser. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
