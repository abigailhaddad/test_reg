Tit. 10 § 447.5 - Occupational therapy services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) ACCOUNT NUMBER COST CENTER TITLE................................................................................................ 7530 Occupational\n\nTherapy................................................................................................ (1)\n\nThe standard unit of measure will be the\nrelative value units developed by the American Occupational Therapy\n\nAssociation. Relative value units should be counted during a patient visit for\nall assessment, treatment or other activities which use the resources of the\noccupational therapy department, and for which a charge is made. Fifteen\nminutes is the smallest increment of time for which a unit of service should\noccur. After the initial 15 minutes, patient contact for less than 15 minutes\nshould be rounded to the nearest whole 15-minute period. (2)\n\nFor patient groups of two or more, the\nappropriate relative value units listed in the schedule should be counted for\neach patient in the group. Different codes should be used to indicate the same\ntreatment given to different size groups. (3)\n\nSince a charge for only one treatment for\na 15-minute period can be made, concurrent or combination treatments should be\nhandled by selecting the most significant or longest treatment determined by\nthe the therapist. (4)\n\nOccupational\ntherapy services provided in the home will have a unit value equivalent to that\nshown in the schedule for the service provided, plus the applicable unit value\nfor travel time to and from the home. (5)\n\nRelative value units for unlisted\nprocedures should be reasonably estimated on the basis of other comparable\nprocedures, or estimated by qualified personnel. If your facility has a\nstandard set of treatments that all patients receive unique to your facility, using the system as a guide, relative value units should be\ndeveloped. (6)\n\nThe system includes\nseveral definitions of activities not listed on the Relative Value Schedule, as\nthe schedule is designed only for direct treatment.

Thus, where a series of code numbers are listed, each code\nnumber in the series is to be used for a different patient group category. For\nexample, code numbers 98001 through 98003 are given for screening: 98001 would\nbe used for screening one patient, 98002 for screening a group of two to five\npatients, and 98003 for screening a group of six to eight patients.
