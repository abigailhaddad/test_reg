In the latter case, the new buildings or\nstructures shall only be required to make provision for a greater number of\nself-contained family units than there are apartments contained in the\nstructure to be demolished; (2)\nthat such demolition is to be made for the purpose of constructing other than\nhousing accommodation; or\n(3)\nthat\nsuch demolition is to be made for the purpose of carrying out a program of\nclearance, replanning, reconstruction and neighborhood rehabilitation of\nsubstandard and unsanitary areas pursuant to and under the conditions imposed\nby article XV of the General Municipal Law, and the landlord is required to\nrelocate tenants under the supervision of the New York City Division of Real\n\nProperty or any other public agency having jurisdiction.
