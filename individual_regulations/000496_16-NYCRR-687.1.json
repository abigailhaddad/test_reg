  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 687.1 - Stenciling and numbering poles (second district)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each and every electrical corporation, municipality, telephone corporation, telegraph corporation, railroad\ncorporation, and street railroad corporation owning poles, towers, or frames, hereinafter termed structures, in streets, highways, or public places, or on\nprivate rights of way, for supporting and carrying overhead electric wire\nsystem for the transmission or distribution of electric energy for light, heat, or power, or for the operation of electric cars or trains, or for telephoning\nor telegraphing, or for supporting electric lamps or fixtures, shall on or\nbefore January 1, 1913, stencil each such structure, except as hereinafter\nprovided, as follows: to wit, (1)\nwith the\ninitials of its name, abbreviation of its name, corporate symbol, or other\ndistinguishing mark by which the owner of each such structure readily and\ndefinitely may be determined; (2)\nwith a number by which the location of each such structure may be\ndescribed. (b) The\nmanner of making such stencils shall be preferably with paint, otherwise with\nmetal tags, badges, or stamps as each such corporation may elect to use; and\nthat the characters of the stencil shall be of such size and so spaced and\nhereafter maintained as to be easily read from the surface of the ground at a\ndistance of six feet from the structure. (c) In the case of two or more companies\njointly owning any such structure, the distinguishing mark of each company\nshall be placed on such structure but not more than one number necessarily\nshall be placed thereon. (d) In the\ncase of such structures carrying or supporting overhead trolley wires where\nthere is a double line of structures, one on each side of the railroad track, such stencil need be affixed to but one line of such structures. (e) In the case of such structures erected\nupon private rights of way or on the public highways, of such character that\nthe construction may be deemed to be a through or trunk line, such stencil need\nbe affixed only to every fifth structure; provided however that each and every\nsuch structure situate within the limits of any city, village, or hamlet shall\nbe stenciled, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (d) herein. Where\nevery fifth structure is stenciled, the commission suggests that that number of\nthe mile from the starting point of the construction be placed on the structure\nstenciled, and also the number of every fifth structure within that mile. And\nthe commission further suggests that all such structures situate within the\nlimits of every city, village, and hamlet shall be numbered consecutively along\neach street, avenue, or highway for the distance upon which structures are\nlocated. (f) The requirements\nherein shall apply to all existing and future constructed structures and to all\nchanges in the ownership of structures. (g) Every such corporation shall file with\nthis commission on or before May 1, 1912, a statement showing--\n(1)\n\nThe initials, abbreviations of name, corporate symbol, or other distinguishing mark intended to be used; (2)\n\nThe means of stenciling to be employed: to wit, paint, metal tags, badges, or stamps; (3)\n\nThe method intended to be followed in\nnumbering structures: to wit, within the limits of cities, villages, and\nhamlets; and upon through or trunk lines.
