  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-6.1 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application of Subpart. The general requirements of this Subpart shall apply to\nall material hoisting equipment except cranes, derricks, aerial baskets, excavating machines used for material hoisting and fork lift trucks. (b) Maintenance. Material hoisting equipment shall at all times be\nmaintained in good repair and proper operating condition with sufficient\ninspections to insure such maintenance. All defects affecting safety shall be\nimmediately corrected either by necessary repairs or replacement of parts, or\nsuch defective equipment shall be immediately removed from the job site. (c) Operation. (1)\n\nOnly trained, designated persons shall\noperate hoisting equipment and such equipment shall be operated in a safe\nmanner at all times. (2)\n\nOperators\nof material hoisting equipment shall remain at the controls while any load is\nsuspended. (d) Loading. Material hoisting equipment shall not be loaded in excess\nof the live load for which it was designed as specified by the manufacturer. Where there is any hazard to persons, all loads shall be properly trimmed to\nprevent dislodgment of any portions of such loads during transit. Suspended\nloads shall be securely slung and properly balanced before they are set in\nmotion. (e) Signal\nsystem required. (1)\n\nOperators and\nsignalmen. Material hoists shall be operated only in response to a signal\nsystem and all operators and signalmen shall be able to comprehend the signals\nreadily and to execute them properly. (2)\n\nSignal transmittal. Such signal system shall consist of manual signals, telephone communications or a visual or audible signal code. Such signaling\nmethods may be used separately or in combination. Where manual or visual\nsignals are used, the signalman shall have a clear and unobstructed view of the\nhoist operator at all times and the hoist operator shall have a clear and\nunobstructed view of the signalman at all times. The maximum distance between\nthe signalman and the operator shall be 80 feet. Where persons are loading or\nunloading at more than one level or where the signalman cannot be readily seen\nby the hoist operator, an electrically- or mechanically-operated bell system\nshall be provided and used. Where audible signals are used, such signals shall\nbe capable of being heard at all times above the normal sound level in the\narea. Intercommunication or telephone systems shall be provided in addition to\nmanually-operated electrical or mechanical bell signal systems where necessary\nfor safe operation of the hoist. Weatherproof electrical connections and\nfittings shall be used for electrically-operated signal or communication\nsystems on hoist towers that are exposed to the elements. (3)\n\nVisual and audible signal code. Where a visual or audible signal system is used in the\noperation of any material hoist, the following signal code shall be\nemployed: Signal\n\nAction\n1 bell or light....... Stop\n2 bells or lights....... Raise\n3 bells or lights....... Lower\n4 bells or lights....... Lower slowly\n(4)\n\nPosting of signal code. Where a visual or audible signal code is used, a copy of\nsuch code shall be posted in a conspicuous location adjacent to the hoisting\ncontrols, clearly visible to the hoist operator from his operating position. Where there is a car attendant, such code shall also be posted in a conspicuous\nposition in the hoist car. (f) Protection of hoist\noperator. (1)\n\nWhere an overhead hazard\nexists, the operator of a hoisting machine shall be provided with overhead\nprotection equivalent to tight planking not less than two inches thick which is\nsupported to develop its full strength. (2)\n\nThe area or space occupied by the\nhoisting machine and its operator shall be protected from the elements and\nshall be heated in cold weather to a temperature of at least 60 degrees\n\nFahrenheit at all times such area or space is occupied. (g) Protection of moving parts. Gears, belts, sprockets, drums, sheaves and points of\ncontact between moving parts of power-driven hoist equipment, when not guarded\nby location, shall be guarded in compliance with this Part (rule) and with\n\nIndustrial Code Part (rule) 19. (h) Tag line. Loads which have a tendency to swing or turn freely\nduring hoisting shall be controlled by tag lines. (i) Riding. Riding on loads, buckets, slings, balls or hooks or\nmaterial hoisting equipment is prohibited. (j) Hoisting machine. (1)\n\nHoist brakes. Hoist brakes, capable of stopping and holding 150 percent\nof the rated capacity of the hoist, shall be provided for every material hoist. Each manually-operated material hoist shall be equipped with an effective pawl\nand ratchet capable of holding the rated load capacity when such a load is\nsuspended. Each electric motor-driven material hoist shall be provided with a\nmechanical automatic motor brake or an electrical or mechanical device which\nwill stop and hold 150 percent of the rated capacity of the hoist automatically\nin case of power failure. (2)\n\nHoisting machine anchorage. Hoisting machines shall be so constructed, installed and\nsecured in place as to prevent tipping or dislodgment. (k) Repairs and\nlubrication. No repairing, cleaning or lubricating of machinery shall\nbe done unless such machinery is at rest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
