This section describes the requirements governing the provision\nof relocation payments to a person displaced from a mobile home and/or mobile\nhome site who meets the basic eligibility requirements of this Part. Except as\nmodified by this section, such a displaced person is entitled to a moving\nexpense payment in accordance with section\n277.4\nand a replacement housing\npayment in accordance with section\n277.5\nto the same extent and\nsubject to the same requirements as persons displaced from conventional\ndwellings. (b) Moving and related\nexpenses-mobile homes. (1)\nA\nhomeowner-occupant displaced from a mobile home or mobile home site is entitled\nto a payment for the cost of moving the mobile home on an actual cost basis in\naccordance with section\n277.4\n(a). A\nnon-occupant owner of a rented mobile home is eligible for actual cost\nreimbursement under section\n277.4\n(c). However, if the mobile home is not acquired, but the homeowner-occupant obtains a\nreplacement housing payment under one of the circumstances described in\nsubparagraph (c)(1)(iii) of this section, the owner is not eligible for payment\nfor moving the mobile home. (2)\n\nThe\nfollowing rules apply to payments for actual moving expenses under section\n277.4\n(a): (i) A displaced mobile homeowner, who moves\nthe mobile home to a replacement site, is eligible for the reasonable cost of\ndisassembling, moving and reassembling any attached appurtenances, such as\nporches, decks, skirting and awnings which were not acquired, anchoring at the\nunit and utility \"hook-up\" charges. (ii)\n\nIf a mobile home requires repairs and/or\nmodifications so that it can be moved and/or made decent, safe and sanitary, and the agency determines that it would be economically feasible to incur the\nadditional expense, the reasonable cost of such repairs and/or modifications is\nreimbursable. (iii)\nA nonreturnable\nmobile home park entrance fee is reimbursable to the extent it does not exceed\nthe fee at a comparable mobile home park, if the person is displaced from a\nmobile home park or the agency determines that payment of the fee is necessary\nto effect relocation. (c) Replacement housing payment for 180-day\nmobile homeowner-occupants. (1)\nA displaced\nowner-occupant of a mobile home is entitled to a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $22,500, under section\n277.5\n(a) if: (i) the person both owned the displacement\nmobile home and occupied it on the displacement site for at least 180 days\nimmediately prior to the initiation of negotiations; (ii)\nthe person meets the other basic\neligibility requirements of section\n277.5\n(a)(1); and\n(iii)\nthe agency acquires the\nmobile home and/or mobile home site, or the mobile home is not acquired by the\nagency, but the owner is displaced from the mobile home because the agency\ndetermines that the mobile home: (a) is not\nand cannot economically be made decent, safe and sanitary; or\n(b) cannot be relocated without substantial\ndamage or unreasonable cost; or\n(c) cannot be relocated because there is no available comparable replacement site; or\n(d) cannot be relocated because\nit does not meet mobile home park entrance requirements. (2)\n\nIf the mobile home is not\nacquired and the agency determines that it is not practical to relocate it, the\nacquisition cost of the displacement dwelling used when computing the price\ndifferential amount, described at section\n277.5\n(a)(3), shall\ninclude the salvage value or trade-in value of the mobile home, whichever is\nhigher. (d) Replacement\nhousing payment for 90-day mobile home occupants. A displaced tenant or\nowner-occupant of a mobile home is eligible for a replacement housing payment, not to exceed $5,250, under section\n277.5\n(b) if: (1)\nthe person actually occupied the\ndisplacement mobile home on the displacement site for at least 90 days\nimmediately prior to the initiation of negotiations; (2)\nthe person meets the other basic\neligibility requirements at section\n277.5\n(b)(1); and\n(3)\nthe agency acquires the\nmobile home and/or mobile home site, or the mobile home is not acquired by the\nagency but the owner or tenant is displaced from the mobile home because of one\nof the circumstances described at subparagraph (c)(1)(iii) of this\nsection. (e) Additional\nrules governing relocation payments to mobile home occupants. (1)\n\nReplacement housing payment based on\ndwelling and site. Both the mobile home and mobile home site must be considered\nwhen computing a replacement housing payment. For example, a displaced mobile\nhome occupant may have owned the displacement mobile home and rented the site\nor may have rented the displacement mobile home and owned the site. Also, a\nperson may elect to purchase a replacement mobile home and rent a replacement\nsite, or rent a replacement mobile home and purchase a replacement site. In\nsuch cases, the total replacement housing payment shall consist of a payment\nfor a dwelling and a payment for a site, each computed under the applicable\nsubdivision in section\n277.5. However, the total\nreplacement housing payment under sections\n277.5\nshall not exceed the maximum\npayment (either $22,500 or $5,250) permitted under the applicable subdivision. (See also section\n277.5\n[c].)\n(2)\n\nCost of comparable replacement dwelling. (i) If a comparable replacement mobile home\nis not available, the replacement housing payment shall be computed on the\nbasis of the reasonable cost of a conventional comparable replacement\ndwelling. (ii)\n\nIf the agency\ndetermines that it would be practical to relocate the mobile home, but the\nowner-occupant elects not to do so, the agency may determine that, for purposes\nof computing the price differential under section\n277.5\n(a)(3), the\ncost of a comparable replacement dwelling is the sum of: (a) the value of the mobile home; (b) the cost of any necessary repairs or\nmodifications; and\n(c) the\nestimated cost of moving the mobile home to a replacement site. (3)\n\nInitiation of\nnegotiations. If the mobile home is not actually acquired, but the occupant is\nconsidered displaced under this Part, the \"initiation of negotiations\" is the\ninitiation of negotiations to acquire the land, or, if the land is not\nacquired, the written notification that the person is a displaced\nperson. (4)\n\nPerson moves mobile\nhome. If the owner is reimbursed for the cost of moving the mobile home, the\nperson is not eligible to receive a replacement housing payment to assist in\npurchasing or renting a replacement mobile home. The person may, however, be\neligible for assistance in purchasing or renting a replacement site. (5)\n\nPartial acquisition of mobile home park. The acquisition of a portion of a mobile home park property may leave a\nremaining part of the property that is not adequate to continue the operation\nof the park. If the agency determines that a mobile home located in the\nremaining part of the property must be moved as a direct result of the project, the owner and any tenant shall be considered a displaced person who is entitled\nto relocation payments and other assistance under this Part.
