Tit. 18 § 369.4 - Determination of continuing eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n\nContinuing eligibility for FA shall be determined in\naccordance with the policies and procedures generally applicable in public\nassistance. Personal contacts and redeterminations of eligibility shall be made\nin accordance with office regulations, Part 351 of this Title. This\nredetermination shall include reconsideration of all variable factors, including financial need of child and parent or other relative, welfare of\nchild or minor, living with a parent or other relative, the employment status\nof employable individuals, and the 60- month durational limit applicable to the\nFA program. (a) Financial need. There\nshall be a reevaluation of all needs and resources of the child and parents or\nother relative in accordance with approved standards of assistance. Extent of\nneed shall be determined in accordance with agency policy for the family group\neach time a member of it is out of the home temporarily. The part of the grant\nwhich is necessary to retain the child's home shall be provided. (b) Reconsideration of the welfare of the\nchild. As part of the periodic redetermination of eligibility, there shall be a\nreevaluation of the welfare of the child. Where there is concern for a child's\nwelfare, referral shall be made to children's services for assessment of the\nchild's home situation. (c) Living\nwith a parent or other relative. (1)\n\nExcept\nas provided in section\n369.3\n(a)(2)(ii)\nof this Part, temporary absence from the home or from the district of a child, a grantee, or both, shall not affect a previous determination that the child is\nliving with an eligible relative when it is determined that the parent or\nrelative retains full responsibility for control of the child and the absence\ncannot be interpreted as a change in the child's home. (2)\n\nWhen the absence of the child from the\nhome extends for a consecutive period of 45 days or more, or when the parent or\ncaretaker relative expects the absence of the child to extend for a consecutive\nperiod of 45 days or more, the provisions for establishing good cause for the\nabsence shall apply pursuant to section\n351.2\n(k) of this\n\nTitle. (d) Family\nassistance durational time limit. (1)\n\nGeneral\nrule. Family assistance may not be granted to a family that includes an adult\nwho has received a cumulative total of 60 months of assistance, whether or not\nsuch months are consecutive, from any combination of the following sources: (i) assistance funded under the Federal\ntemporary assistance to needy families (TANF) block grant in New York State\nsince December 2, 1996, including assistance under the former ADC program; and/or\n(ii)\nnon-TANF-funded\nassistance in cash through the safety net assistance (SNA) program after August\n4, 1997. (2)\n\nIndividual\ntime limit status. Each regular contact with the family shall include an\nevaluation of the individual time limit status of each family member who is\nincluded in the calculation of the grant for the family, or who would be\nincluded in the grant calculation except for a sanction, and who meets one of\nthe following criteria: (i) the individual is\n19 years of age or older; or\n(ii)\nthe individual has reached age 18 but is not yet 19 and is not a student\ncompleting a secondary education or its equivalent; or\n(iii)\nthe individual is not yet 19 and is the\nhead of the household, or is the spouse of the head of the household, regardless of the individual's student status; or\n(iv)\nthe individual is under 18 years old and\nis a minor parent residing in an adult- supervised living arrangement, and is\nthe direct payee of the assistance grant. The time limit status of each such individual shall be\ndetermined by a review of the history of TANF-funded assistance and any\nnon-TANF-funded SNA cash assistance provided to such individual to determine\nthe cumulative number of months that must be counted towards the FA durational\nlimit of 60 months for that individual. (3)\n\nTime limit months defined. A \"month\"\nshall be counted toward the durational limit of 60 months for each calendar\nmonth in which the adult individual was a member of a family to which\nTANF-funded assistance or non-TANF-funded SNA cash assistance was issued during\nthe calendar month. A month shall not be counted toward the durational limit\nfor an individual who is a member of a family for whom no benefits are issued\nduring the month, with the exception of the situation in which no payment is\nmade for the family because a recoupment is being taken which reduces the grant\nto zero, and no other payment is made in the month. A month shall not be\ncounted for an individual who is a member of a household for which non-cash\nonly SNA benefits were issued, provided that these SNA benefits were not\nTANF-funded. (4)\nassistance received outside New York State. When it is determined that an\nindividual in a FA family has received TANF-funded assistance in another state\nwhile the individual was an adult or minor head of household or spouse of the\nhead of household, as specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, a\ndetermination shall be made as to the number of months of assistance from the\nother state that shall count toward the individual time limit of 60\nmonths.

Eligibility of the family for FA shall not continue beyond the calendar month\nin which any such individual as specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nhas received TANF-funded assistance or non-TANF SNA cash assistance for a total\nof 60 months, whether or not these months are consecutive. (6)\n\nAuthorization under the time limit.

(7)\n\nExemption to\napplication of time limit. The district shall exempt a family from the\napplication of the 60-month limit on FA and federally participating safety net\nassistance on the basis of hardship.
