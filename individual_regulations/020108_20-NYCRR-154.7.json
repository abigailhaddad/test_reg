  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 154.7 - Capital gain or loss and capital loss carryover\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where an individual or a trust changes\nresident status during the taxable year, the net capital gains and losses\nattributable to such individual or such trust are to be computed separately for\nthe resident period and for the nonresident period covered by the New York\n\nState income tax returns required under this Part. In each case the computation\nof the capital gain or loss to be reported is to be made in the same manner as\nthe corresponding Federal computation and on the same basis as if the taxable\nyear of such individual or such trust for Federal income tax purposes were\nlimited to the taxable period covered by the applicable New York State income\ntax return, except that: (1)\nthe separate\ncomputations applicable to the respective periods of residence and nonresidence\nmust include any special accruals required by section\n154.10\nof this\n\nPart; and\n(2)\nthe capital gain or\nloss to be reported on the New York State nonresident income tax return for the\nperiod of nonresidence includes only those capital gains and losses reported\nfor Federal income tax purposes which are derived from or connected with New\n\nYork State sources during the nonresident period (see section\n132.7\nand Part 138 of this Title). (b) See section\n154.5\nof this Part concerning New York minimum taxable income where an individual or\na trust has a Federal item of tax preference for a capital gain deduction which\nis attributable to either the period of New York State residence or\nnonresidence. (c) (1)\nA short-term capital loss carryover\nand/or a long-term capital loss carryover from a prior year to the year the\nchange of resident status occurred will retain its original character and be\ntreated in the same manner as for Federal income tax purposes in determining\nthe net capital gain or loss attributable to the respective periods of\nresidence and nonresidence. (2)\n\nThe\namount available as a carryover loss from a preceding year to the year the\nchange of residence occurred must, in accordance with Federal rules and\npractice, be applied in chronological order to the New York State income tax\nreturns required under this Part as if separate Federal income tax returns had\nbeen filed for corresponding taxable periods, except that where the change of\nresidence is from a nonresident to a resident, effect shall be given in any\nsubsequent year to any short-term and/or long-term capital loss carryover\ncomputed on the New York State income tax return for the period subsequent to\nthe change of residence to the extent to which such short-term and/or long-term\ncapital loss carryover is includible in computing Federal adjusted gross income\nof an individual or Federal taxable income of a trust for the subsequent year\nor years. (3)\n\nThe amount available\nas a carryover to the resident period in the year of the change of residence is\nthe same amount which would be available as a short-term and/or long-term\ncapital loss carryover if a Federal income tax return were being filed for the\nperiod of residence. (4)\n\nThe\nprovisions of section\n132.7\nof this Title apply in determining the New York adjusted gross income of an\nindividual on the New York State nonresident personal income tax return for the\nperiod of nonresidence. The provisions of Part 138 of this Title apply in\ndetermining the New York taxable income of a trust on the New York State\nfiduciary return for the period of nonresidence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n154.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
