  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.8 - Contracts of employment for officers of savings banks-deferred compensation\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was presented with the following facts: A\nsavings bank was contemplating an agreement with one of its officers to provide\nhim with deferred compensation computed at a specified rate for a two year\nperiod. The amount attributable to the deferred compensation was to be invested\nin property or securities eligible for investment by savings banks. Any\nappreciation or depreciation was to be reflected in the amount ultimately\npayable to the officer and the deferred compensation was to be paid at a\npredetermined rate until paid in full. Two questions were asked: (a) Would the deferred compensation\nconstitute salary rather than retirement benefits? (b) Could the amount of the\ndeferred compensation be considered in determining the amount of the retirement\nbenefits to which the officer would be entitled?\nThe department stated its view that a contract of employment\nwith an officer of a savings bank may include a provision for deferred\ncompensation so long as the agreement was entered into with the approval of the\nboard of trustees and the deferred payment represented compensation for\nservices actually performed by the officer. Thus, the first question was\nanswered in the affirmative. In response to the second question, the department\nstated that the salary on which the retirement benefits would be based could\ninclude the portion of the salary deferred pursuant to the agreement. The\ndepartment noted, however, that a retirement plan may require contributions\nbased upon salary and if such contributions do not take into consideration the\namount of the deferred compensation, it is quite likely that the amount of\ndeferred compensation could not be included in determining the retirement\nbenefits under the formula set forth in section\n250\n(3)\nof the Banking Law. Finally, the department called attention to its policy that\nofficer employment contracts either extend for no longer than one year or\nauthorize termination at any time by the board of trustees. The reason for the\npolicy was stated to be that the management of the business of the bank, including the right to hire and fire officers, must remain in the hands of the\nboard. A contract of employment for more than one year which does not permit\nthe board to terminate the contract at will would violate that policy. The\ndepartment, therefore, recommended that the agreement be modified\naccordingly. DATED: November 18, 1969\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
