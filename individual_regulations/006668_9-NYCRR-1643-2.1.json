  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-2.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The accounting\nprocedure which follows is designed to record and disclose the essential facts\nwith respect to financing, both temporary and permanent, on the books of\naccount and in the financial statements of the local agency with the minimum\nnumber of entries consistent with the aims of simplicity, accuracy, and full\ndisclosure. Some accounts and entries, indicated by the full application of\naccounting theory to the design, have been eliminated in the interests of\nsimplicity. Basic to the design is the fact that all borrowing by a local\nagency, or commitments to borrow, must be authorized, in advance, by passage of\nappropriate resolutions by the local agency. The accounting entries thus\nreflect not only the borrowing transactions themselves but also the\nauthorizations therefor. The local agency's borrowing is, further, identified\nwith the uses to which the borrowed funds are to be put so that the financial\ndocuments (certificate of indebtedness, temporary loan notes, requisition\nagreements, advance loan notes, etc.) are supported not only by the authorizing\nresolutions, but also by the requisition papers, which include the Housing Loan\n\nVoucher (form HLV) and the Certificate of Purposes (form DH-216). The\npreparation of the latter is described in Part 1646, Development Period\n\nAccounting. All borrowing by the local agency must have the prior approval of\nthe division and no accounting entries reflecting the authorization for and the\nissue of obligations by the local agency should be made until the terms of the\nfinancing and the supporting resolutions and documents have been reviewed and\napproved by the division. Financing transactions should be submitted to the\ndivision for review in advance of the date the funds will be required. A\nschedule will be provided the authority prior to the initial\nfinancing. (b) Brief descriptions\nof the transactions involved and the authorizations required in financing a\n\nState-aided project, together with the accounting entries to be made and\nillustrative examples, are contained in this Subpart. The steps, transactions, and entries are summarized as Exhibit 1 of Appendix S-9. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1643-2.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
