Tit. 4 § 55.2 - Subject of appeals\n\nState Regulations\nA committee on appeals shall consider only such appeals as\nclearly demonstrate a manifest material error or mistake appearing in a rating\nkey or scale or in the application of such key or scale to candidate test\npapers or other records of examination performance or eligibility for\nappointment and only if such error or mistake affects the eligibility or\nrelative standing of candidates.
