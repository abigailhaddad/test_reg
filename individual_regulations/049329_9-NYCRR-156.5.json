  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 156.5 - Performance advance eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Only employees whose basic annual salary is below the job rate for their\nposition and whose performance has been evaluated and who received an\nappropriate summary rating for the preceding one-year evaluation period, shall\nbe eligible to receive performance advances except as indicated below. Employees whose positions are unallocated but are equated to salary grades by\nthe Director of the Budget, shall be eligible for performance advances as if\nallocated to the equated grade. (b) Employees who are eligible for a performance advance in a lower salary grade\nbut are promoted or appointed to a higher salary grade before receiving their\nnext advance in the lower grade, and who did not receive an advance in the\nhigher grade prior to the date when an evaluation in the lower grade would have\nbeen due, are entitled to a reconstructed promotion salary reflecting the\nperformance advance which they would have received in the lower grade. Such\nreconstructed promotion salary shall be effective on the date that the\nperformance advance would have been paid in the lower grade. The performance\nadvance used to reconstruct the promotion salary of such employees shall be\nbased on a presumptive rating of effective or an equivalent rating. (c) Service in a lower salary grade in a\nposition which has been reallocated is creditable toward the service\nrequirement in the grade to which the position has been reallocated for any\nperformance advance due on or after April 1, 1985. (d) Service in a higher salary grade by\nemployees who are appointed or demoted to a lower salary grade is creditable\ntoward the in-grade service requirement for a performance advance in the lower\nsalary grade.
