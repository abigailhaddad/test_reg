Unless otherwise\nexpressly stated or unless the context requires a different meaning, the\nfollowing terms as used in this section shall be construed as set forth herein: (1)\n\nThe term reassignment means\nthe change, without further examination, of a permanent employee from his or\nher present permanent title, position and location to another similar position\nin the same promotion unit. (2)\n\nThe term transfer means the change, without further examination, of a permanent employee from his or her present\npermanent title, position and location within one promotion unit to a similar\nposition within another promotion unit. (b) General provisions. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in\nsubdivision (e) of this section, no employee shall be transferred to a position\nfor which there is required by this Part an examination involving essential\ntests or qualifications different from or higher than those required for the\nposition held by such employee. (2)\n\nThe Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts and the State and municipal civil service commissions may adopt rules\ngoverning transfers between positions in their respective jurisdictions and may\nalso adopt reciprocal rules providing for the transfer of employees from one\ngovernmental jurisdiction to another. (3)\n\nNo employee shall be transferred\nwithout his or her consent, except upon the transfer of functions as provided\nin this section. (4)\nA transfer may not be made to a position for which a preferred list exists\ncontaining the name of an eligible willing to accept reinstatement to such\nposition, unless the vacancy created by such transfer is in the same\ngeographical area as the position to which transfer is made and such eligible\nis simultaneously offered reinstatement to such vacancy. (5)\nA transfer may be made only\nif the position to which transfer is sought is at the same or substantially the\nsame or a lower salary level than the position from which transfer is\nsought. (6)\n\nEvery\ntransfer shall require the approval of the Chief Administrator. (7)\nA person appointed to a\nposition in the Unified Court System in any particular court or court agency\nmay not, during the life of the eligible list from which he or she was\nappointed or for at least one year, whichever is longer, be transferred or\nreassigned to a similar position in another court or court agency unless he or\nshe is reachable for appointment to such other position from such eligible\nlist, except under a reassignment program approved by the Chief\n\nAdministrator. (c) Transfer of personnel upon transfer\nof functions. Upon the transfer of a function from a department or agency of\nthe State or from a civil division of the State to the Unified Court System, or\nvice versa, provision shall be made for the transfer of necessary employees. Employees so transferred shall be transferred without further examination or\nqualification, and shall retain their respective civil service or court service\nclassifications and status. For the purpose of determining the employees\nholding permanent appointments in competitive class positions to be\ntransferred, such employees shall be selected within each class of positions in\nthe order of their original appointment, with due regard to the right of\npreference in retention of disabled and nondisabled veterans. All employees so\ntransferred shall, thereafter, be subject to the rules of the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts or the civil service commission having jurisdiction\nover the agency to which transfer is made. Employees holding permanent\nappointments in competitive class positions who are not so transferred shall\nhave their names entered upon an appropriate preferred list for reinstatement\nto the same or similar positions in the service of the governmental\njurisdiction from which transfer is made and in the office or agency to which\nsuch function is transferred. Employees transferred to another governmental\njurisdiction pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall be entitled\nto full seniority credit for all purposes for service rendered prior to such\ntransfer in the governmental jurisdiction from which transfer is\nmade. (d) Transfers\nbetween Unified Court System positions and State or local positions. (1)\nA transfer may be made\nbetween positions in the Unified Court System and positions in the State\nservice or in the service of a civil division, provided the prospective\ntransferee meets all of the requirements, if any, applicable to the position to\nwhich transfer is sought. (2)\nA transfer pursuant to this\nsubdivision shall require the approval of the Chief Administrator of the Courts\nand the State Department of Civil Service or the municipal civil service\ncommission having jurisdiction over the position to or from which transfer is\nmade. (e) Transfer and change of title. Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (b)\nof this section or any other provision of law, any permanent employee in the\ncompetitive class who meets all the requirements for a competitive examination, and is otherwise qualified as determined by the Chief Administrator, shall be\neligible for participation in a noncompetitive examination in a different\nposition classification, provided, however, that such employee is holding a\nposition deemed to be of a comparable level.
