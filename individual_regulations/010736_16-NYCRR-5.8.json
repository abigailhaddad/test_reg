  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 5.8 - Scope of discovery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Discovery\nrequests should be tailored to the particular proceeding and commensurate with\nthe importance of the issues to which they relate. They should be limited to\nmaterials or information that: (1)\nthe\nrequesting party expects to use in cross-examination or in preparing its\ncase; (2)\nare not already possessed\nby or readily available to that party; and\n(3)\nare not conveniently obtainable\nelsewhere. Unduly broad requests will not be allowed. (b) Discovery that is unreasonably\ncumulative, repetitive, or duplicative will not be allowed. (c) In general, a party will not be required\nto develop information or prepare a study for another party. In unusual\ncircumstances, however, where a party from which discovery is sought uniquely\npossesses the information needed for a study and the ability to prepare the\nstudy (for example, computerized data and a program for manipulating them), a\nrequest to develop information may be granted if the information appears\nmaterial and the request, considered on its own and in the context of other\nsimilar requests in the proceeding, does not appear unduly burdensome or\ncostly. The presiding officer may condition the granting of such a request on\nthe requesting party's agreement to bear specified costs of performing the\nstudy. In no event would a party preparing a study for another be required to\ntestify in support of the study or be constrained in its presentation of its\nown position on that account. (d) Claims of evidentiary privilege may be raised by parties in their objections to\ndiscovery requests. In resolving claims that information is privileged or\nexempt from discovery, the presiding officer shall be guided but not bound by\nthe Civil Practice Law and Rules and case law pursuant to it and may conduct in\ncamera examinations, issue protective orders, and adopt other measures suited\nto the particular situation. (e) Claims that information is exempt from discovery on the grounds it is a trade\nsecret, confidential commercial information or critical infrastructure\ninformation shall be treated in accordance with section\n6-1.4\nof this Title. (f) Requests for documents in the control of\ntrial staff shall be subject to the provisions of this Part. If trial staff\nasserts the \"official information privilege\" pursuant to section\n87\n(2)(g)\nof the Public Officers Law, that\nassertion will be sustained only upon a showing that the interest in the\nconfidentiality of the document at issue outweighs the interest of the\nrequesting party in its disclosure. Documents within the control of trial staff\ninclude those prepared by persons currently or previously designated to serve\non it and those prepared by other employees of the department and reviewed by, or in the possession of, a trial staff member in the course of his or her\nparticipation in the case in which the discovery request is made. (g) Denial of discovery pursuant to this Part\ndoes not preclude the granting of a request for a document pursuant to the\n\nFreedom of Information Law, where warranted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n5.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
