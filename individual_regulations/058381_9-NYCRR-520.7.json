  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.7 - Reduction of offenders in grades e-7, e-8 and e-9\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOnly the commander, NYANG is authorized to impose a reduction, suspended or\nunsuspended, in a non-judicial punishment action where the offender is in the\ngrade of E-7, E-8 or E-9. Likewise, only the commander, NYANG is authorized to\nvacate a suspended reduction of an offender in grades E-7, E-8 or\nE-9. (2)\n\nAll procedures previously\ndescribed in this regulation apply to any action involving the reduction of an\noffender in grades E-7, E-8 or E-9, subject to the following: (i) Any non-judicial punishment imposed on an\noffender in grade E-7, E-8 or E-9, not involving reduction, shall be imposed at\nthe unit level by the commander authorized to imposed such non-judicial\npunishment on offenders in grade E-7, E-8 or E-9. (ii)\n\nIf the commander authorized to\nnon-judicially punish (other than reduction) such offenders, intends to impose\nreduction, the notification of offense from such commander to the offender\nshall state that he \"intends to recommend to the commander, NYANG the\nimposition of non-judicial punishment.\" The notification of offense shall not\ninclude a recommendation of the type or severity of punishment to be\nimposed. (iii)\n\nThe notification of\noffense shall direct that all replies and matters in extenuation, mitigation or\ndefense be submitted to the commander who mailed or delivered the notification\nof offense. (iv)\n\nAfter all\nrequirements in this regulation preliminary to the actual imposition of\nnon-judicial punishment are met, the commander who would have otherwise been\nauthorized to impose the punishment, shall, by indorsement, forward the record\nthrough the Wing or Group commander (if the action is not commenced by the Wing\nor Group commander) and the unit JA for preliminary legal sufficiency review, to the commander, NYANG for determination of imposition of non-judicial\npunishment. (v) The Wing or Group\ncommander should indicate his approval or disapproval of the recommendation if\nhe has not commenced the action, but shall not recommend the type or severity\nof punishment to be imposed in his forwarding indorsement to the commander, NYANG. (a) If the Wing or Group Commander\ncommences the action, he shall, by indorsement, forward the record through the\nunit JA to commander, NYANG, with no recommendation of type or severity of\npunishment, as stated above. (vi)\n\nAfter the notification of offense is\nmailed or delivered and before the record is forwarded to the commander, NYANG, the commander authorized to non-judicially punish (other than reduction) these\noffenders, may terminate the action without imposition of any type of\npunishment, if the offense has not been satisfactorily proven to him, or he may\nimpose a type of punishment other than reduction, if he determines that the\ninitially intended reduction is no longer warranted. (a) In either of these events, the action\nshall be further processed as stated in this regulation for actions that are\nterminated at the unit level, or for actions where punishment is imposed at the\nunit level, as the case may be. (vii)\n\nWhere the commander, NYANG is forwarded\nthe record to initially determine whether or not to impose non-judicial\npunishment, he takes the place of the commander at the unit level with all his\nauthority for non-judicial punishment actions (i.e., imposition of punishment, termination without punishment, or termination of action and processing by\ncourt-martial). (viii)\n\nIf\ncommander, NYANG imposes a reduction (although he may impose any type of\nnon-judicial punishment he deems appropriate) only he, his\nsuccessor-in-command, or superior authority may suspend, vacate a suspension, mitigate, remit or set aside the reduction. (a) Whatever remedial action the commander, NYANG takes, once the appellate process is completed, the record shall be\nmaintained at the unit level, and the commander, NYANG shall be notified of any\nfurther misconduct committed by such offender during any suspension\nperiod. (b) Any vacation action\nshall be commenced by the unit commander or Wing or Group commander\nrecommending the vacation action to the commander, NYANG and mailing or\ndelivering the notification to the offender in accordance with this\nregulation. (ix)\n\nAll\nappeals from punishment imposed by commander, NYANG are to be forwarded through\nDMMA/MNJA to the Chief of Staff to the Governor who is the appellate\nauthority. (x) Whether or not the\noffender appeals from punishment imposed by the commander, NYANG, the SJA, NYANG shall review the record for legal sufficiency. (xi)\n\nOnce the appeal has been decided by the\n\nChief of Staff to the Governor, the record shall be forwarded through the\ncommander, NYANG back to the Wing or Group commander who will further process\nthe record pursuant to this regulation.
