Tit. 12 § 257.1 - Impasses in collective bargaining and assignment of mediators\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the event that an employer and a labor organization have\nfailed to achieve an agreement, either the employer or the labor organization, or both acting jointly, may notify the board in writing of the existence of an\nimpasse. The notification, or declaration of impasse, must be signed by the\nrepresentative of the declaring party, or where the parties are jointly\ndeclaring impasse, the representative of each party. The notification shall be\nfiled electronically with the director of conciliation (see section\n250.11\nof this Title). Upon\nreceipt of the notification of an impasse in collective bargaining, the board\nmay appoint a mediator from a list of qualified persons maintained by the board\nto assist the parties to effectuate a voluntary resolution of the impasse. It\nis the policy of SERA that the board shall consider and make the parties aware\nof the availability of federal and other mediation services, and shall give\npriority in providing mediation services to those parties without access to\nthose other services.
