  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 102.4 - Advantage-disadvantage analysis\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe advantage-disadvantage analysis\nrequired by this section is designed to provide a framework by which the\nfeatures or facts which support one or another mode of construction can be\nidentified clearly. Particular circumstances which reduce or enhance the\nbenefits or affect the costs of underground construction, identified in the\nadvantage-disadvantage analysis, will provide the basis for decision. Examples\nof factors which may affect a decision to underground would include the\navailability of suitable existing corridors, or the likelihood of pronounced\nvisual impact. (2)\n\nThe\nadvantage-disadvantage analysis required by this section shall include at a\nminimum the items enumerated in section\n102.4\nof this Part. Data and/or\nall pertinent information for each item must be presented for both the\nunderground and overhead alternative. The analysis of cost should be made on a\npresent-worth basis for both alternatives over a period long enough to allow\nfor appropriate incremental construction. Each submission shall contain an\nexplanation of why the proposed transmission facility or portion thereof should\nbe placed overhead or underground. (b) The analysis shall include: (1)\n\nAvailability of existing corridors\nsuitable for additional transmission facilities. (The availability of suitable\nexisting corridors through a priority area, for example, may reduce the\nrelative benefits of underground construction.)\n(2)\n\nCapital construction costs. (Costs that\nmay be capitalized under the uniform system of accounts.)\n(3)\n\nConstruction expense costs. (Costs that\nmay not be capitalized.)\n(4)\n\nRight-of-way acquisition costs. (5)\n\nAnticipated total operation and maintenance costs including power losses for\nthe depreciable life of the plant, discounted to present-worth, when the\npresent worth of such losses is significant in comparison to other costs\n(section\n102.2\n[a][2][ii], [iii], and [iv] of this Part). (6)\n\nRelevant technological\nconsiderations. (7)\n\nThe relative\neffect on vegetation, wildlife, soils, erosion, streams, and other such natural\nfeatures (as noted in biological surveys, water quality ratings, and land\nmanagement policies and practices) of the construction methods\nproposed. (8)\n\nThe relative visual\nimpact including incremental impact compared to existing\nsurroundings. (9)\n\nRelative\navailability of right-of-way for other uses: e.g., parks, recreation, farming, transportation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n102.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
