  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 350-2.1 - Food scraps generation methodology\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department will use proxy food scraps generation\nfactors and public and private databases available that provide information\nsuch as number of employees, college students, inmates, etc per location that\nequate to food scraps generation, to estimate the amount of food scraps\ngenerated from a source. Those calculations will be available on the\ndepartment's website. If factors are not available or are not appropriate, the\ndepartment will use other information, such as phone interviews and publicized\nresearch, to estimate food scraps generation. If more accurate site-specific\ndata, such as weight receipts are available for a certain designated food\nscraps generator or type of generator (franchise stores, etc.), that data will\nbe used by the department to estimate the amount of food scraps\ngenerated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
