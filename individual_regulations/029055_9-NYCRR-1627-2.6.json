  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-2.6 - Determination of income\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An object of income projection is to determine anticipated income for\ncoming 12 months, current rate of pay per stated unit (i.e., hour, day, week, month) shall be multiplied by number of stated units in coming 12 months; this\ntotal shall be modified by any conditions which past experience indicates are\nlikely to occur during 12 month projected period. Such projection will apply to\nboth fixed and nonfixed income when possible. Under interim rent adjustment\npolicy, projections for non-fixed income shall be reviewed quarterly with most\nrecent quarter added while income of least recent quarter is dropped. Total of\nnew four consecutive quarters is then projected as anticipated income for\ncoming 12 months. Additional information on income projection is contained in\nfollowing paragraphs. (b) Fixed\nincome. (1)\n\nAnnual salaries. Anticipated\nincome will be projected on basis of annual salary as of date of income\nprojection. Such projection will not include any expected raise or increment\nbefore it is actually received. (2)\n\nWeekly, daily and hourly rate of pay. Anticipated income will be projected by\ndetermining the income for a current normal week and multiplying by the number\nof work weeks in the year. This number is usually 52 although it can be less as\nin the case of vacation without pay, yearly close down for model change over, etc. (3)\n\nOvertime. (i) Overtime which occurs on a regular basis, as evidenced by past experience or notation on employer's report of earnings, will be included in projecting anticipated income by multiplying weekly\novertime earnings by 52. (ii)\n\nOvertime which occurs irregularly or seasonally will not be included in\nprojecting anticipated income unless prior annual income indicates that such\novertime exceeds $200 per year in which case the amount in excess of $200 per\nyear will be included in anticipated income. (iii)\n\nIn reviewing prior annual income, care\nshould be taken to note overtime as it may not be separately stated. The\nreported gross earnings less computed straight time earnings will give tenants\novertime earnings during stated period. (iv)\n\nIncome from secondary employment will be\nconsidered and treated as regular or irregular overtime depending on whether\nsuch secondary employment is regular or irregular. Sporadic secondary\nemployment, i.e. of short duration and not likely to be repeated, will not be\nincluded in projecting anticipated income. (4)\n\nPay raises and increments. (i) Under interim rent adjustment policy, expected pay raises and increments will not be included in anticipated income\nuntil effective date of such raise or increment. However, if raise or increment\nis granted retroactively, effective date will be first day of pay period\nreflecting retroactive pay increase. (ii)\n\nUnder noninterim rent adjustment policy, expected pay raises and increments will not be included in anticipated income. These pay raises and increments will be projected only at time of annual\nreexamination following date on which such increase was received and no\nretroactive charge will be levied against tenant. (c) Nonfixed income. (1)\n\nDetermination of nonfixed income. (i) The determination as to whether income is\nin fixed or nonfixed category must be made with regard to particular job of\nemployee. Following, are examples of occupations generally associated with\nnonfixed income: (a) Seasonal work. (b) Piece work. (c) Work on commission basis or on\ncombination salary and commission. (d) Work where employee is subject to call as\na substitute worker. (e) Work on a\nper diem basis. (f) Self-employed\nwork. (ii)\n\nProjection of\nnonfixed income should be based on an average week's earnings multiplied by 52\nthe number of work weeks in year. This number is usually 52 but it can be less\nas in the case of vacation without pay, yearly close down for model changeover, etc. The period on which weekly average is based should be at least of 12 weeks\nduration, if possible. Under the interim made at end of succeeding calendar\nquarters. Earnings during such quarters rent adjustment policy, reexamination\nof such nonfixed earnings should be shall be added to previous earnings and a\nnew weekly average obtained based on this extended period. Notice of\nineligibility for excess income will not be sent to a tenant whose total income\nreflects earnings from nonfixed employment until four full quarters in nonfixed\nemployment have been completed and over-income status thereby sustained. Under\nnoninterim rent adjustment policy, at time of annual reexamination, anticipated\nincome shall be based on either average weekly earnings from nonfixed\nemployment multiplied by 52 or total income from all sources during previous\n12-month period, whichever sum more closely reflects tenant's probable income\nduring coming 12 months. (2)\n\nTips and other considerations. Value of\ntips and other considerations will be included in income determination. Amount\nprojected should be greatest value given in either tenants certificate, employer's report, Social Security Board findings or in following list which is\nto be used as a guide in ascertaining actual value. (i) Taxicab drivers--45 percent of\ncommissions. (ii)\n\nTaxicab\nowners--20 percent of bookings. (iii)\n\nBarbers--20 percent of\nsalary. (iv)\n\nManicurists, beauty\nparlor workers--25 percent of salary. (v) Waiters--from not less than three dollars\nin tips per working day in less expensive restaurants, to not less than $12 in\ntips per working day in finest grade restaurants and night clubs. For all\nwaiters, earnings, including tips, should equal a minimum of $12 a\nday. (vi)\n\nBusboys--from two dollars\nto four dollars in tips per working day. (vii)\n\nBellhops, pullman porters, baggage\nporters--not less than four dollars in tips per working day. (viii)\n\nDoormen--from not less than one dollar\nin tips per working day for apartment houses to two dollars in tips per working\nday in hotels and clubs. (3)\n\nBonuses. Bonuses of a recurring nature in\na fixed amount shall be included in anticipated income. Such bonuses include\nnight work differential, Christmas bonuses in those businesses where such\nbonuses are an established practice of employment, and similar bonuses which\nfollow a discernible pattern as to frequency and amount. A bonus which is\nearned regularly but varies in rate or amount, such as a production incentive\nbonus, is a variable bonus and shall be treated as irregular overtime. A bonus\nwhich is given without any indication that it will recur is a nonrecurring\nbonus. It will not be included in anticipated income. (4)\n\nOvertime. Overtime earnings in nonfixed\nemployment are usually included in totals from which average weekly rate is\nascertained. Consequently, projection of average weekly rate will reflect such\novertime. However, if there is a pattern to the overtime indicating that it is\nnot of a regular or predictable nature, it will be treated the same as\nirregular overtime in fixed income employment, i.e. only the amount in excess\nof $200 per year will be included in anticipated income. (5)\n\nWelfare assistance Rents for households\nreceiving monetary welfare assistance will be determined as indicated below\nunless the local housing authority requests otherwise and such alternate is\napproved by the division. (i) Rents for\nhouseholds all of whose members are covered by the monetary welfare assistance\n(whether full or supplemental) shall be determined in accordance with a\nschedule of fixed rents based upon the size, by number of bedrooms, of the\ndwelling unit occupied, but not in excess of the following schedule except when\na modified schedule is approved by the New York State Department of Social\n\nServices and the division for a specific housing authority: Apartment size Monthly rent\n(by number of bedrooms) (dollars)\n0 65\n1 77\n2 90\n3 101\n4 107\n5 110\n(ii)\n\nRent for a non-welfare family having\nwelfare recipients in the household. The rent for a non-welfare family having\nwelfare recipients in the household will be their normal rent plus a proportion\nof the fixed welfare rent applicable to the occupied apartment. The normal rent\nwill be based on the income of the family of the tenant of record excluding any\nincome or allowances of the welfare recipients. The proportion of the fixed\nwelfare rent will be the ratio that the number of welfare recipients in the\nhousehold bears to the total number of persons in the household. (iii)\n\nIncome reviews are optional where all\nof the members of the household are receiving monetary welfare assistance\n(whether full or supplemental). Close liaison should be maintained with the\nappropriate local social services agency furnishing assistance for exchange of\ninformation as to start or discontinuance of welfare assistance, income, household composition, nonpayment of rent, problems of tenancy and other\nmatters. Income reviews are required where some of the members of the household\nare receiving monetary welfare assistance and others of them are not. (iv)\n\nOther public assistance. Tenants\nreceiving Federal supplemental security income are to be charged rent as\nprovided below: (a) Tenants who are\ntransferred to the SSI program from welfare on January 1, 1974, shall continue\nto be treated as public assistance recipients, for purpose of determining\nscheduled rent, until the time of their next income review after which they\nshall be treated as nonwelfare tenants. (b) Tenants who become eligible for SSI for\nthe first time after January 1, 1974, whether or not they were previously on\nwelfare, shall be treated as nonwelfare tenants for purpose of determining\nscheduled rent. (c) Tenants who are\nSSI recipients who move in after January 1, 1974 shall be treated as nonwelfare\ntenants. (d) Changes in rents\nstemming solely from receipt of SSI should be made at the time of regular\nannual review. Interim changes should not be made unless they would have been\nmade for some other prescribed reason. (6)\n\nIncome from own business and\nself-employment. (i) General. Income from own\nbusiness or self-employment will be projected on basis of income and expense\nstatement properly prepared from books of accounts adequately maintained. However, income from own business or self-employment will automatically be\nconsidered as in excess of maximum admission or continued occupancy limits if\nany one of following conditions exist: (a) Gross receipts from a business engaged predominately in personal services are\nin excess of $6,000 for admission or $9,000 for continued occupancy (i.e., a\nbusiness where value of personal service rather than cost of goods is dominant\nprice factor). (b) Gross receipts\nfrom a business engaged predominately in other than personal services are in\nexcess of $12,000 for admission or $18,000 for continued occupancy. (c) If tenant or applicant employs one or\nmore regular full-time persons in his business, it shall be considered prima\nfacie evidence of ineligibility for either admission or continued\noccupancy. (ii)\n\nBasis\nfor projecting income. Projection of income must be based on examination of\napplicant's or tenant's books of accounts. Books of accounts must cover\nbusiness or self-employment for a period of one year immediately preceding date\nof income projection. If applicant has been in business for less than one year\nor does not have properly prepared books of accounts for required period, application shall be deferred and reconsidered when necessary figures are\navailable. If tenant initiates business or self-employment, his income shall be\nprojected and rent established on basis of either his prior earnings or his\nestimated [earnings] in business, whichever is higher. Under noninterim rent\nadjustment policy, rent shall not be adjusted until time of annual\nreexamination or on occasion of one of the three sets of conditions listed\nunder this policy. Under interim rent adjustment policy, however, a report of\nincome and expense will be furnished quarterly by tenant until at least four\nfull quarters have been reported. Tenants income will be projected on basis of\nthese quarterly statements and interim rent changes will be based on these\nprojections. However, no determination of ineligibility for continued occupancy\nwill be made until four full quarters have been completed. (iii)\n\nDetermination of present income from\nself-employment. Net income from self-employment shall be determined by\ndeducting only expenses which are directly connected with business and which\nare necessary for producing of income therefrom, except that depreciation and\nprovisions for reserves are not allowable deductions. Any expenses which are\njointly personal and business shall be apportioned on a pro rata basis. Incomes\nfrom self-employment require close scrutiny. Records and income tax returns\nshould be reviewed in complete detail. Note that deductions for depreciation\nand reserves permitted on income tax returns are not deductible in determining\nnet income for purposes of admission or continued occupancy. The Division of\n\nHousing, upon request, will offer assistance in any case where there is doubt\nas to income from self-employment. (7)\n\nWorkmen's compensation. Income from a\nworkmen's compensation award will be projected on a 52-week basis; that is, 52\ntimes current weekly rate of award. If award is in form of lump sum, amount\nwill be considered as a lump sum addition to assets and will not be projected. Under interim rent adjustment policy, however, when compensation rate changes\nor payments cease, an interim rent change is made. Under this policy, income is\nalso reviewed quarterly to determine if benefits are still being\nreceived. (8)\n\nDisability benefits. Income from New York State disability benefits covering off-the-job accidents\nand sickness will be projected on 52-week basis. Under interim rent adjustment\npolicy, tenant is responsible for reporting any change in status. Under this\npolicy, income is also reviewed quarterly to determine if any change in\nsituation has occurred. (9)\n\nUnemployment insurance benefits. Income from unemployment insurance benefits, Korean veterans' readjustment assistance and from unemployment benefits\naccruing to members from unions, fraternal organizations, etc., will be\nprojected on 52-week basis. Under interim rent adjustment policy, tenant is\nresponsible for advising of any change in status. In addition, income should be\nreviewed quarterly to ascertain that tenant is still unemployed. (10)\n\nServicemen's pay. All income received by\na serviceman, including basic pay, extra pay (i.e., flight pay, hazardous\nservice, unusual responsibility, special proficiency, etc.), subsistence\nallowance, allowance for quarters, and government's share of family allotment, if any, will be included in projection of his income. Exemptions and deductions\nare same as those applicable to any applicant or tenant. Total income of a\nserviceman who is head of a family will be included in total family income\nwhether he is residing at home or not. However, where he is residing away from\nhome because of his service assignment, a deduction not exceeding $50 per month\nmay be allowed for extra costs incurred by his residing away from home. Total\nincome of a serviceman who is not head of family will be included in total\nfamily income only if he is residing at home. If he is away from home, only\nthat income, including government's share of any allotment, which he sends home\nwill be included in family income. (11)\n\nOther income. All other income of tenant\nor any member of his family shall be included in projection of annual income. Such miscellaneous income includes alimony, pensions from any source (note\nexemptions), dividends, interest and regular contributions by a relative or any\nother person to support of family. (12)\n\nPayments for foster children. Payments\nmade to tenants for child care by State, county or other governmental agencies\nfor care of foster children in tenants homes constitute reimbursement to foster\nparents for money expended by the foster parent on behalf of the child. Such\nmonies are therefore not to be included when determining probable aggregate\nannual income. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
