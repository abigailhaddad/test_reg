[l. 19 67, chs. 86, 170; l. 1969, ch. 1126]l. 1967, chs. 86, 170; l. 1969, ch. 1126\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection 6-d of the State Finance Law, as added by chapter\n1126 of the Laws of 1969, authorizes the reimbursement of certain expenses\nincurred by new technical, scientific, education, professional, or\nadministrative appointees to a department or agency of the State in\ntransporting themselves and their families and household effects to their new\nplaces of residence. It is the policy of the State that such reimbursement may\nbe approved when, in the opinion of the Department of Civil Service, there\nexists in New York State a shortage of qualified candidates for the position to\nwhich the appointment would be made and when, in the opinion of the appointing\nofficer concerned, providing for such reimbursement would improve the State's\nability to consummate an appointment. It is not the policy of the State to\nreimburse such appointees for related expenses in relocation, such as selling\nand buying a house or renting temporary living quarters. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n140.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
