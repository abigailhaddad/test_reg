  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.45 - Batch pasteurization-item 16p (a)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All indicating and recording thermometers\nused in connection with the batch pasteurization of milk or milk products shall\ncomply with the applicable specifications set forth in Appendix 3 of this\n\nTitle. Specifications for test thermometers and other test equipment appear in\n\nAppendix 4 of this Title. (b) Time\nand temperature controls for batch pasteurizers. (1)\n\nTemperature difference. The pasteurizer\nshall be so designed that the simultaneous temperature difference between the\nmilk or milk product at the center and the coldest milk or milk product in the\nvat will not exceed a margin of one degree Fahrenheit (one-half degree Celsius)\nat any time during the holding period. The vat shall be provided with adequate\nagitation, operating throughout the holding period. No batch of milk or milk\nproduct shall be pasteurized unless it covers a sufficient area of the agitator\nto insure adequate agitation. (2)\n\nLocation and required readings of indicating and recording thermometers. Each\nbatch pasteurizer shall be equipped with both an indicating and a recording\nthermometer. The thermometers shall read not less than the required\npasteurization temperature throughout the required holding period. The plant\noperator shall check daily the temperature shown by the recording thermometer\nagainst the temperature shown by the indicating thermometer; this comparison\nshall be noted on the recording thermometer chart. The recording thermometer\nshall not read higher than the indicating thermometer. No batch of milk or milk\nproducts shall be pasteurized unless it is sufficient to cover the bulbs of\nboth the indicating and the recording thermometers. (3)\n\nAssurance of minimum holding periods. Batch pasteurizers shall be so operated that every particle of milk or milk\nproduct will be held at not less than the minimum pasteurization temperature\ncontinuously for at least 30 minutes. When milk or milk products are raised to\npasteurization temperature in the vat, and cooling is begun in the vat, simultaneously with or before the opening of the outlet valve, the recorder\nchart shall show at least 30 minutes at not less than minimum pasteurization\ntemperature. When milk or milk products are preheated to pasteurization\ntemperature before entering the vat, the recorder chart shall show a holding\nperiod of at least 30 minutes at not less than the minimum pasteurization\ntemperature plus the time of filling from the level of the recorder bulb. When\ncooling is begun in the holder after the opening of the outlet valve, or is\ndone entirely outside the holder, the chart shall show at least 30 minutes at\nnot less than the minimum pasteurization temperature plus the time of emptying\nto the level of the recording thermometer bulb. When the recorder time interval\non the recorder chart at the pasteurization temperature includes filling and/or\nemptying time, such intervals shall be indicated on the recorder chart by the\noperator, by removing the recording thermometer bulb from the milk for a\nsufficient time to depress the pen, or by turning cold water into the vat\njacket at the end of the holding period, or by inscribing the holding time on\nthe chart. The filling time and the emptying time for each holder so operated\nshall be determined by the commissioner, initially and after any change which\nmay affect these times. No milk shall be added to the holder after the start of\nthe holding period. (c) Airspace heating. (1)\n\nMeans shall be provided\nand used in batch pasteurizers to keep the atmosphere above the milk and milk\nproducts at a temperature not less than five degrees Fahrenheit (three degrees\n\nCelsius) higher than the minimum required temperature of pasteurization during\nthe holding period (Appendix 3 of this Title). (2)\n\nEach batch pasteurizer shall be equipped\nwith an airspace thermometer. The surface of the milk or milk product shall be\nat least one inch below the bottom of the thermometer bulb when the vat is in\noperation. (3)\n\nThe temperature\nshown by the airspace thermometer shall be recorded on the recording\nthermometer chart each time the pasteurizer is in operation. (d) Inlet and outlet valves and\nconnections. The following definitions shall apply to inlet and outlet valves\nand connections: (1)\n\nValve stop shall mean a\nguide which permits turning the valve plug to, but not beyond, the fully closed\nposition. (2)\n90° stop shall mean a\nstop so designed as to prevent turning the plug more than 90 degrees. (3)\n120° stop shall mean a stop which\nprevents turning the plug more than 120 degrees. (4)\n180° stop shall mean a stop which\nprevents turning the plug more than 180°, but which permits two fully closed\npositions, each diametrically opposite the other. (5)\n\nValve with an irreversible plug shall\nmean one in which the plug cannot be reversed in the shell. (6)\n\nSingle-quadrant stop shall mean a\n90-degree stop in a valve with an irreversible plug. (7)\n\nThe fully open position shall mean that\nposition of the valve seat which permits the maximum flow into or out of the\npasteurizer. (8)\n\nThe closed\nposition shall mean any position of the valve seat which stops the flow of milk\ninto or out of the pasteurizer. (9)\n\nThe fully closed position shall mean that closed position of the valve seat\nwhich requires the maximum movement of the valve to reach the fully open\nposition. (10)\n\nThe just-closed\nposition shall mean that closed position of a plug-type valve in which the flow\ninto or out of the holder is barely stopped, or any closed position within\n0.078 inch thereof as measured along the maximum circumference of the valve\nseat. (11)\n\nLeakage shall mean the\nentrance of unpasteurized milk onto a batch pasteurizer during the holding or\nemptying period, or the entrance of unpasteurized milk into any pasteurized\nmilk line at any time. (12)\n\nLeak-protector valve shall mean a valve provided with a leak-diverting device, which, when the valve is in any closed position, will prevent leakage of milk\npast the valve or, in the case of batch pasteurizers filled or emptied by\nsuction or compressed air, will prevent leakage of milk past the valve or the\nleakage of milk due to the leakage of air past the suction valve or the\ncompressed air valve, as the case may be. (13)\n\nClosed-coupled valve shall mean a valve, the seat of which is either flush with the inner wall of the pasteurizer, or so\nclosely coupled that no milk in the valve inlet is more than one degree\n\nFahrenheit (one-half degree Celsius) colder than the milk at the center of the\npasteurizer at any time during the holding period. A close-coupled valve which\nis not truly flush shall be considered as satisfying this requirement when: (i) the vat outlet is so flared that the\nsmallest diameter of the large end of the flare is not less than the diameter\nof the outlet line plus the depth of the flare; and\n(ii)\nthe greatest distance from the valve\nseat to the small end of the flare is not greater than the diameter of the\noutlet line; and\n(iii)\nin the case\nof batch pasteurizers, the outlet and the agitator are so placed as to insure\nthat milk currents will be swept into the outlet. (e) Design and installation of\nvalves and connections. All valves and connections shall comply with the\nfollowing requirements. (1)\n\nValves and\npipeline connections shall meet the requirements of section\n2.38\nof this Part (Item\n10p). (2)\n\nAll pipelines and\nfittings shall be so constructed and so located that leakage will not occur. Dependence shall not be placed on soldered joints to prevent leakage. (3)\n\nTo prevent clogging, and to promote\ndrainage, all leak-protector grooves shall be at least 0.187 inch wide, and at\nleast 0.094 inch deep at the center. Mating grooves shall provide these\ndimensions throughout their combined length whenever the valve is in, or\napproximately in, the fully closed position. All single-leak grooves, and all\nmating leak grooves when mated, shall extend throughout the entire depth of the\nseat, so as to divert leakage occurring at all points throughout the depth of\nthe seat, and so as to prevent air bindings. Washers or other parts shall not\nobstruct leak-protector grooves. (4)\nA stop shall be provided on all plug-type\noutlet valves and on all plug-type inlet valves in order to guide the operator\nin closing the valve so that unpasteurized milk may not inadvertently be\npermitted to enter the outlet line or the holder, respectively. The stop shall\nbe so designed that the plug will be irreversible when the plug is provided\nwith any grooves or their equivalent, unless duplicate, diametrically opposite\ngrooves are also provided. In the case of two-way, plug-type valves (i.e., those having only one inlet and one outlet), a 180-degree stop, or any\ncombination of stops permitting two fully closed positions, may be substituted\nfor a 90-degree stop, provided that there are no air-relief grooves in the plug\nand that all leak grooves are located symetrically with respect to the valve\ninlet. Stops shall be so designed that the operator cannot turn the valve\nbeyond the stop position, either by raising the plug or by any other\nmeans. (5)\n\nOutlet valves, in\naddition to the requirements listed above, shall be so designed as to prevent\nthe accumulation of unpasteurized milk in the milk passages of the valve when\nthe valve is in any closed position. (6)\n\nAll inlet pipelines and outlets from vat\npasteurizers shall be equipped with leak-protector valves; provided, that\ninstallations not equipped with leak-protector inlet valves shall be accepted\nwhen the piping is so arranged that only one vat can be connected to the inlet\nline at a time, and such piping is disconnected during the holding and emptying\nperiods. (7)\n\nInlet and outlet\nconnections other than through closed-coupled valves shall not enter or leave\nthe pasteurizer below the level of the milk therein. (8)\n\nIn cases where the inlet line enters the\nholder above the milk level, and in which the inlet line may be submerged and\nthus prevent its complete emptying when the inlet valve is closed, the inlet\nline shall be provided with an automatic air-relief, or vent located either at\nthe valve or elsewhere, and so designed as to function in every closed position\nof the valve. A vent may be provided by drilling a hole at least 0.125 inch in\ndiameter in the vat pipe, below the vat cover, but above the maximum milk\nlevel. (9)\n\nAll leak-protector\nvalves shall be installed in the proper position to insure the function of the\nleak-diverting device. Inlet valves shall not be located in vertical pipelines, unless they can be so installed that one of the groove systems is at the lowest\nlevel of the valve; and pipelines between the inlet valve and the pasteurizer\nshall be as short as practicable and shall be so sloped to drain. (10)\n\nAll outlet valves shall be kept fully\nclosed during filling, heating and holding periods; and all inlet valves shall\nbe kept fully closed during holding and emptying periods. (f) Recording charts. All recording\nthermometer charts shall comply with the applicable requirements of section\n2.48\nof this Part (Item\n16p[D]). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n2.45\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
