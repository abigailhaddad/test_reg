  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 462.4 - Securities owned\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Securities of\nothers acquired by the utility shall be recorded in these accounts at cost at\nthe time of acquisition. Cost does not include any amount paid for accrued\ninterest or dividends. (b) The\nutility may write down the cost of any security in recognition of a decline in\nthe value thereof. Securities shall be written off or written down to a nominal\nvalue if there be no reasonable prospect of substantial value. Fluctuations in\nmarket value shall not be recorded, but a permanent impairment in the value of\nthe securities shall be recognized in the accounts. When securities are written\noff or written down, the amount of the adjustment shall be charged to account\n538, Miscellaneous Income Deductions, or to account 414, Miscellaneous Debits\nto Surplus, or to an appropriate reserve account. (c) When securities with a fixed maturity\ndate are purchased at a discount (that is, when the total cost, including\nbrokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is less than par), such discount may\nbe amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic debits\nto the account in which the securities are carried (preferably coincident with\nentries recording interest accruals) and credits to the same account in which\nthe interest revenue is recorded. No debits shall be made in respect to\ndiscount upon securities held as investments or in special funds if there is\nreason to believe that such securities will be disposed of by redemption or\notherwise at less than par or will not be paid at date of maturity. (d) When securities with a fixed maturity\ndate are purchased at a premium (that is, when the total cost, including\nbrokerage fees, taxes, commissions, etc., is in excess of par), such premium\nmay be amortized over the remaining life of the securities through periodic\ncredits to the account in which the securities are carried (preferably\ncoincident with entries recording interest accruals) and debits to the same\naccount in which the interest revenue is recorded.
