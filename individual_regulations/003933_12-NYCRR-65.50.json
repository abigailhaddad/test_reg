An application\nto take the deposition of a witness in lieu of oral testimony must be in\nwriting and must set forth the reasons such deposition should be taken, the\nname and address of the witness, the matters concerning which it is expected\nthey will testify and the time and place proposed for the taking of the\ndeposition, together with the name and address of the officer before whom it is\ndesired that the deposition be taken. Such application must be filed with the\n\nBoard, with proof of service on all other parties. If the application is\ngranted, the Board will make and serve on the parties an order which specifies\nthe name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken and the time, place and\ndesignation of the officer before whom the witness is to testify. (b) Such deposition, when permitted by the\n\nBoard, may be taken before any officer authorized to administer oaths by the\nlaws of the State of New York, or of the place where the examination is\nheld. (c) At the time and place\nspecified in the order, the officer designated to take such deposition will\npermit the witness to be examined and cross-examined under oath or affirmation\nby all parties appearing, and the questions asked of and answers given by the\nwitness will be recorded verbatim and reduced to typewriting by the officer\nbefore whom the deposition is taken or under his or her direction. (d) All objections to questions or evidence\nare deemed waived unless made at the examination. The officer does not have\npower to rule upon any objection, but they shall note them upon the deposition. The testimony will be subscribed by the witness in the presence of the officer, who shall attach his or her certificate stating that the witness was duly\nsworn, that the deposition is a true record of the testimony and exhibits given\nby the witness, and that the officer is not of counsel or attorney to any of\nthe parties nor interested in the proceeding. If the deposition is not signed\nby the witness because they are ill, dead, cannot be found, or refuse to sign\nit, such fact will be included in the certificate of the officer and the\ndeposition may be used as fully as though signed. The officer will immediately\ndeliver, in accordance with sections\n65.16\nand\n65.17\nof these rules, a copy of\nthe transcript, together with the officer's certificate, in person or by\ncertified mail to the Board at its Albany office.

(f) The right to object to any error or\nirregularity that does not comply with the provisions of this rule shall be\ndeemed waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part thereof\nis made with reasonable promptness after such defect is, or with due diligence\nmight have been, discovered. (g) If\nthe parties so stipulate in writing, the deposition may be taken before any\nperson at any time or place, upon any notice and in any manner, and when so\ntaken may be used as other depositions.
