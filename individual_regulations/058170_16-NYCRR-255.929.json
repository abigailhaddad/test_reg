  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.929 - Direct assessment for stress corrosion cracking (sccda)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. Stress Corrosion Cracking Direct Assessment (SCCDA) is a process to assess a\ncovered pipe segment for the presence of SCC primarily by systematically\ngathering and analyzing excavation data for pipe having similar operational\ncharacteristics and residing in a similar physical environment. (b) General requirements. An operator using\ndirect assessment as an integrity assessment method to address stress corrosion\ncracking in a covered pipeline segment must have a plan that provides, at\nminimum, for: (1)\n\nData gathering and\nintegration. An operator's plan must provide for a systematic process to\ncollect and evaluate data for all covered segments to identify whether the\nconditions for SCC are present and to prioritize the covered segments for\nassessment. This process must include gathering and evaluating data related to\nSCC at all sites an operator excavates during the conduct of its pipeline\noperations where the criteria in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), Appendix A3.3\nindicate the potential for SCC. This data includes at minimum, the data\nspecified in ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A3. (2)\n\nAssessment method. The plan must provide\nthat if conditions for SCC are identified in a covered segment, an operator\nmust assess the covered segment using an integrity assessment method specified\nin ASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A3, and remediate the threat in accordance with\nASME/ANSI B31.8S, Appendix A3, section A3.4. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.929\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
