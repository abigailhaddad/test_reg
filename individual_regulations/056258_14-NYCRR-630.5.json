  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 630.5 - Eligibility for OPWDD services\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following policy of OPWDD entitled \"Eligibility for OPWDD\nServices\" is hereby inserted into this Part. New York State Office for People With Developmental\n\nDisabilities\nELIGIBILITY FOR OPWDD SERVICES\nImportant Facts\n\nRevised December, 2008\nOPWDD, through its local Developmental Disabilities Services\n\nOffices (DDSO), determines whether a person has a developmental disability and\nis eligible for OPWDD funded services. This fact sheet describes the Three-Step\nprocess used by OPWDD to make an eligibility determination of developmental\ndisability. NOTE: A determination of developmental disability does not\nmean the person is eligible for all OPWDD funded services. Some OPWDD funded\nservices have additional eligibility criteria. For example, Intermediate Care\n\nFacilities, and Home and Community Based (HCBS) waiver programs include an\nadditional level of care determination, and individuals are eligible for HCBS\nservices only when they reside in appropriate living arrangements. These and\nother additional criteria for eligibility of specific OPWDD services are not\nreviewed through this process\nELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION PROCESS\nEligibility Request\n\nAn OPWDD Transmittal Form must accompany all requests\nsubmitted to the DDSO for eligibility determinations. The Transmittal Form\nincludes the name of the person, the name of the person's representative, and\nrelevant contact information. Documentation of the person's developmental\ndisability must also be included as part of the eligibility request\n1st Step Review\nDDSO staff review the eligibility request for completeness\nand share the information with other staff designated by the Director, as\nnecessary. After this review, the DDSO notifies the person in writing\nthat: (a) Eligibility or provisional\neligibility has been determined; or\n(b) The request is incomplete and requires\nadditional documentation; or\n(c) The request has been forwarded for a 2nd Step Review\n2nd Step Review\nDDSO clinicians designated by the DDSO Director conduct a 2nd\n\nStep Review of the eligibility request forwarded by the 1st Step Review, along\nwith any additional documentation provided by the person. If these clinicians\nrequire additional medical information, psychological test results, or\nhistorical documentation, the person is notified in writing of the type of\ninformation needed and the date by which it must be submitted to the\nDDSO\nFollowing the 2nd Step Review, the DDSO provides the person\nwith written notification of its determination. If the person is found\nineligible for OPWDD services because he or she does not have a developmental\ndisability, the letter shall offer the person and his or her representative the\nopportunity to: (a) Meet with DDSO\nstaff to discuss the determination and documentation reviewed; and\n(b) Request a 3rd Step Review; and\n(c) Request a Medicaid Fair Hearing in cases\nwhere Medicaid funded services are sought\n\nNote that a Notice of Decision informing the person of his or\nher right to request a Medicaid fair hearing is sent only when the Transmittal\n\nForm indicates that the person is interested in receiving Medicaid funded OPWDD\nservices if determined eligible. If the person has not indicated Medicaid\nfunded services, no fair hearing is offered and the decision of the DDSO is\nfinal\n\nThe person may choose one, two or all three of the above\noptions. If a fair hearing is requested, a 3rd Step Review will automatically\nbe conducted\n3rd Step Review\n3rd Step Eligibility Determination Committees established by\nOPWDD in NYC and Albany conduct the 3rd Step Reviews. Committee members include\nlicensed practitioners who are not directly involved in the determinations made\nat the 1st and 2nd Step Reviews. The Committee reviews the submitted\neligibility request and any additional documentation provided by or on behalf\nof the person. The Committee forwards its recommendations to the DDSO\nEligibility Coordinator. The DDSO Director or designated staff person considers\nthe 3rd Step recommendations and informs the person of any change in the DDSO's\ndetermination. 3rd Step Reviews will be made prior to any fair hearing\ndate.
