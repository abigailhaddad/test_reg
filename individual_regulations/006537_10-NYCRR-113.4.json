(2)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a well is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the wells. (c) Privies adjacent to any well. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Village of North Collins. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle, which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of any well of the public water supply of this Village of North Collins. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nWhenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy.

(5)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removal, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any well of the public water supply of the Village of North Collins. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacles or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any well, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground, nor shall such human excreta, compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil nor within a distance of 500 feet of any well; and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 100 feet of any well of the public water supply of the Village of North Collins.
