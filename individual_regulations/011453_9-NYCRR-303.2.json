(b) Each State agency shall\nendeavor to provide and maintain on-site at each of its public buildings a\nsufficient number of functional cardiac AED devices, and shall endeavor to\nprovide a sufficient number of trained AED operators for emergencies, in\naccordance with these regulations, unless conditions exist in a certain\nstructure that prevent a State agency from reasonably complying with the\nrequirements of these regulations. (c) Each agency will be responsible for the\nphased-in installation of AEDs in its respective facilities. Such phase-in\nperiod shall not extend beyond March 31, 2010, absent extraordinary\ncircumstances that warrant a longer phase-in period. Any such extraordinary\ncircumstances resulting in exemption from or noncompliance with these\nregulations shall be detailed in the agency's report pursuant to subdivision\n(h) of this section. (d) In the\nevent that a specific building space is shared between agencies, then memoranda\nof understanding (MOU) may be made between such agencies relative to the\ndevelopment and funding of an AED program for the shared space, as well as the\njoint administration of all aspects of the AED program. (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis Part, a State agency is located in building space owned or managed by OGS, OGS will be responsible for installing AEDs in the building and for managing\nAED maintenance and AED operator training. Otherwise, it shall be the\nresponsibility of the agency occupying OGS space to comply with all other\nprovisions of this Part, including recruiting agency personnel as AED operators\nand coordinators. (f) In the case\nof public buildings owned and/or managed by an agency other than OGS, or public\nbuildings managed by OGS by virtue of an agreement with another agency or a\nprivate entity, the occupying agencies will be responsible for the installation\nof AEDs in the building and for the management of AED maintenance and AED\noperator training. (g) If an agency\noperates a medical facility that provides alternative services for the purpose\nof addressing emergency defibrillation, that agency shall file with the\ncommissioner a written notification explaining how the medical facility\naddresses emergency defibrillation in a sufficient manner so as to be\nconsistent with the health and safety objectives of these regulations. Agencies\noperating such an alternative services plan which has been approved by DOH will\nbe deemed to have fulfilled the requirements of sections\n303.5, 303.6, 303.7, and\n303.8\nof this Part respecting the\npublic buildings at which the alternative services plan is effective. Upon\nreceipt of such written notification(s), the commissioner will provide the\nagency with an acknowledgment of receipt, and will also provide a copy of such\nwritten notification(s) to DOH. (h) From the date of adoption of these regulations, each State agency shall\ncommence the planning process for implementation of an AED program. By April 1, 2006 all State agencies shall file with the commissioner a written report\nsetting forth the details of the agency's AED program plan. The report shall\ninclude specific reference to the individual requirements set out in these\nregulations, including, but not limited to, a proposed schedule for\nimplementation at each public building. If an agency has previously commenced\nan AED program in its buildings, then that agency's report should identify\nthose buildings that currently have AEDs and should demonstrate how those\nbuildings comply with the standards promulgated in these regulations. All such\nreports shall be updated annually, commencing April 1, 2007, and shall detail\nthe status of the agency's AED program respecting compliance with these\nregulations. Once full implementation is achieved, such annual reports shall be\nrequired only for years in which substantive changes to the agency's plan or\nits compliance therewith have developed. Upon receipt of such report(s), the\ncommissioner will provide the agency with an acknowledgment of receipt, and\nwill also provide a copy of such report(s) to DOH. A State agency may commence\ninstallation of AEDs prior to submitting its written report to the\ncommissioner. (i) If during the\nprocess of developing its AED program, a State agency is unable to fulfill all\nthe requirements of these regulations at its public buildings as a result of\ninsufficient staff or other restrictive conditions, a written report explaining\nthe reasons for such circumstances shall be provided to the commissioner. A\nState agency shall include in such report an alternative implementation program\ndesigned to provide AED protection at the public building(s) referenced in the\nreport or an explanation as to why there is no feasible method of\nimplementating an AED program for the subject public building(s). The filing of\nsuch an explanatory report shall temporarily suspend an agency's obligation to\nfulfill other requirements of this Part for such public building(s) until the\nunderlying prohibitive condition(s) may be corrected. Upon receipt of such\nreport(s), the commissioner will provide the agency with an acknowledgment of\nreceipt, and will also provide a copy of such report(s) to DOH. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
