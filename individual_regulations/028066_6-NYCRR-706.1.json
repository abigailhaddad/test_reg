This Appendix provides procedures to\nderive standards and guidance values to protect aquatic life from acute and\nchronic effects. Tier I procedures, sections III through XI, are used where the\nrequired data described in section III.B for freshwater species or section\nIII.C for saltwater species are available. Tier II procedures, sections XII\nthrough XVI, are used where the data requirements in sections III.B or III.C\nare not met. II. APPLICABILITY\nA. These procedures\nwill generally be used to derive statewide standards or guidance values\naccording to the classified uses described in section\n702.9\nof this Title. Site-specific\nmodifications to such statewide standards or guidance values are required or\nallowed as described below. B. Site-specific modifications to chronic or acute aquatic life values may be\ndeveloped where: (1)\n\nThe local water quality\ncharacteristics such as pH, hardness, temperature, color, etc., alter the\nbiological availability or toxicity of a pollutant; or\n(2)\n\nThe sensitivity of the aquatic organisms\nspecies that occur at the site differs from the species actually tested in\ndeveloping the criteria. The phrase\noccur at the site\nincludes\nthe species, genera, families, orders, classes, and phyla that: are usually\npresent at the site; are present at the site only seasonally due to migration; are present intermittently because they periodically return to or extend their\nranges into the site; were present at the site in the past, are not currently\npresent at the site due to degraded conditions, and are expected to return to\nthe site when conditions improve; are present in nearby bodies of water, are\nnot currently present at the site due to degraded conditions, and are expected\nto be present at the site when conditions improve. The taxa that occur at the\nsite cannot be determined merely by sampling downstream and/or upstream of the\nsite at one point in time. Occur at the site\ndoes not include\ntaxa that were once present at the site but cannot exist at the site now due to\npermanent physical alteration of the habitat at the site resulting, for\nexample, from dams, etc. C. Site-specific modifications also may be\ndeveloped to acute and chronic aquatic life values to reflect local physical\nand hydrological conditions. D. Endangered species considerations. (1)\n\nAny\nsite-specific modifications that result in less stringent values must not be\nlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of endangered or threatened\nspecies or result in the destruction or adverse modification of such species'\ncritical habitat. (2)\n\nMore\nstringent modifications shall be developed to protect endangered or threatened\nspecies where such modifications are necessary to ensure that water quality is\nnot likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such species or result in\nthe destruction or adverse modification of such species' critical habitat. Procedures for Deriving Aquatic Life Tier I\nStandards and Guidance Values; Sections III-XI\nIII. REQUIRED\nDATA\nA. Certain data should be\navailable to help ensure that each of the major kinds of possible adverse\neffects receive adequate consideration. B. To derive an acute or chronic standard or\nguidance value for freshwater aquatic organisms and their uses, the following\nmust be available: 1. Results of acceptable\nacute tests (see section IV or VI of this Appendix) with at least one species\nof freshwater animal in at least eight different families such that all of the\nfollowing are included: a. The family\n\nSalmonidae in the class Osteichthyes; b. One other family (preferably a\ncommercially or recreationally important, warmwater species) in the class\n\nOsteichthyes (\ne.g., bluegill, channel catfish); c. A third family in the phylum Chordata\n(\ne.g., fish, amphibian); d. A planktonic crustacean\n(\ne.g., a cladoceran, copepod); e. A benthic crustacean\n(\ne.g., ostracod, isopod, amphipod, crayfish); f. An insect (\ne.g., mayfly, dragonfly, damselfly, stonefly, caddisfly, mosquito, midge); g. A family in a phylum other than Arthropoda\nor Chordata (\ne.g., Rotifera, Annelida, Mollusca); h. A family in any order of insect or any\nphylum not already represented. 2. Acute-chronic ratios (see section VI of\nthis Appendix) with at least one species of aquatic animal in at least three\ndifferent families provided that of the three species: a. At least one is a fish; b. At least one is an invertebrate; and\nc. At least one species is an\nacutely sensitive freshwater species (the other two may be saltwater\nspecies). 3. Results of\nat least one acceptable test with a freshwater alga or vascular plant is\ndesirable but not required for standard or guidance value derivation (see\nsection VIII of this Appendix). If plants are among the aquatic organisms most\nsensitive to the material, results of a test with a plant in another phylum\n(division) should also be available. C. To derive a standard or guidance value for\nsaltwater aquatic organisms and their uses, the following must be available: 1. Results of acceptable acute tests (see\nsection IV or VI of this Appendix) with at least one species of saltwater\nanimal in at least eight different families such that all of the following are\nincluded: a. two families in the phylum\n\nChordata; b. a family in a phylum\nother than Arthropoda or Chordata; c. either the Mysidae or Penaeidae\nfamily; d. three other families not\nin the phylum Chordata (may include Mysida or Penaeidae, whichever was not used\nabove); e. any other\nfamily. 2. Acute-chronic\nratios (see section VI of this Appendix) with species of aquatic animals in at\nleast three different families provided that of the three species: a. at least one is a fish; b. at least one is an invertebrate; and\nc. at least one is an acutely\nsensitive saltwater species (the other two may be freshwater\nspecies). 3. Results of\nat least one acceptable test with a saltwater alga or vascular plant is\ndesirable but not required for standard or guidance value derivation (see\nsection VIII of this Appendix). If plants are among the aquatic organisms most\nsensitive to the material, results of a test with a plant in another phylum\n(division) should also be available. D. If all required data are available, a\nnumerical standard or guidance value can usually be derived except in special\ncases. For example, derivation of a chronic standard or guidance value might\nnot be possible if the available ACRs vary by more than a factor of 10 with no\napparent pattern. Also, if a standard or guidance value is to be related to a\nwater quality characteristic (see sections V and VII of this Appendix), more\ndata will be required. E. Confidence in a standard or guidance value usually increases as the amount of\navailable pertinent information increases. Thus, additional data are usually\ndesirable. IV. FINAL ACUTE VALUE\nA. Appropriate\nmeasures of the acute (short-term) toxicity of the material to a variety of\nspecies of aquatic animals are used to calculate the Final Acute Value (FAV). The Final Acute Value is a calculated estimate of the concentration of a test\nmaterial such that 95 percent of the genera (with which acceptable acute\ntoxicity tests have been conducted on the material) have higher Genus Mean\n\nAcute Values (GMAVs). An acute test is a comparative study in which organisms, that are subjected to different treatments, are observed for a short period\nusually not constituting a substantial portion of their life span. However, in\nsome cases, the Species Mean Acute Value (SMAV) of a commercially or\nrecreationally important species is lower than the calculated FAV, then the\nSMAV replaces the calculated FAV in order to provide protection for that\nimportant species. B. Acute\ntoxicity tests shall be conducted using acceptable procedures. C. Except for results with saltwater annelids\nand mysids, results of acute tests during which the test organisms were fed\nshould not be used, unless data indicate that the food did not affect the\ntoxicity of the test material. D. Results of acute tests conducted in unusual dilution water, e.g., dilution water in which total organic carbon or\nparticulate matter exceeded five mg/L, should not be used, unless a\nrelationship is developed between acute toxicity and organic carbon or\nparticulate matter, or unless data show that organic carbon or particulate\nmatter, etc., do not affect toxicity. E. Acute values must be based upon endpoints\nwhich reflect the total severe adverse impact of the test material on the\norganisms used in the test. Therefore, only the following kinds of data on\nacute toxicity to aquatic animals shall be used: 1. Tests with daphnids and other cladocerans\nmust be started with organisms less than 24 hours old and tests with midges\nmust be started with second or third instar larvae. It is preferred that the\nresults should be the 48-hour EC50 based on the total percentage of organism\nkilled and immobilized. If such an EC50 is not available for a test, the\n48-hour LC50 should be used in place of the desired 48-hour EC50. An EC50 or\nLC50 of longer than 48 hours can be used as long as the animals were not fed\nand the control animals were acceptable at the end of the test. An EC50 is a\nstatistically or graphically estimated concentration that is expected to cause\none or more specified effects in 50 percent of a group of organisms under\nspecified conditions. An LC50 is a statistically or graphically estimated\nconcentration that is expected to be lethal to 50 percent of a group of\norganisms under specified conditions. 2. It is preferred that the results of a test\nwith embryos and larvae of barnacles, bivalve molluscs (clams, mussels, oysters\nand scallops), sea urchins, lobsters, crabs, shrimp and abalones be the 96-hour\nEC50 based on the percentage of organisms with incompletely developed shells\nplus the percentage of organisms killed. If such an EC50 is not available from\na test, of the values that are available from the test, the lowest of the\nfollowing should be used in place of the desired 96-hour EC50: 48- to 96-hour\nEC50s based on percentage of organisms with incompletely developed shells plus\npercentage of organisms killed, 48- to 96-hour EC50s based on percentage of\norganisms with incompletely developed shells, and 48-hour to 96-hour\nLC50s. 3. It is preferred that the\nresult of tests with all other aquatic animal species and older life stages of\nbarnacles, bivalve molluscs (clams, mussels, oysters and scallops), sea\nurchins, lobsters, crabs, shrimp and abalones be the 96-hour EC50 based on\npercentage of organisms exhibiting loss of equilibrium plus percentage of\norganisms immobilized plus percentage of organisms killed. If such an EC50 is\nnot available from a test, of the values that are available from a test the\nlower of the following should be used in place of the desired 96-hour EC50: the\n96-hour EC50 based on percentage of organisms exhibiting loss of equilibrium\nplus percentage of organisms immobilized and the 96-hour LC50. 4. Tests whose results take into account the\nnumber of young produced, such as most tests with protozoans, are not\nconsidered acute tests, even if the duration was 96 hours or less. 5. If the tests were conducted properly, acute values reported as \"greater than\" values and those which are above the\nsolubility of the test material should be used, because rejection of such acute\nvalues would bias the Final Acute Value by eliminating acute values for\nresistant species. F. If\nthe acute toxicity of the material to aquatic animals has been shown to be\nrelated to a water quality characteristic such as hardness or particulate\nmatter for freshwater animals, refer to section V of this Appendix. G. The agreement of the data within and\nbetween species must be considered. Acute values that appear to be questionable\nin comparison with other acute and chronic data for the same species and for\nother species in the same genus must not be used. For example, if the acute\nvalues available for a species or genus differ by more than a factor of 10, rejection of some or all of the values would be appropriate, absent\ncountervailing circumstances. H. If\nthe available data indicate that one or more life stages are at least a factor\nof two more resistant than one or more other life stages of the same species, the data for the more resistant life stages must not be used in the calculation\nof the SMAV because a species cannot be considered protected from acute\ntoxicity if all of the life stages are not protected. I. For each species for which at least one\nacute value is available, the SMAV shall be calculated as the geometric mean of\nthe results of all acceptable flow-through acute toxicity tests in which the\nconcentrations of test material were measured with the most sensitive tested\nlife stage of the species. For a species for which no such result is available, the SMAV shall be calculated as the geometric mean of all acceptable acute\ntoxicity tests with the most sensitive tested life stage, i.e., results of flow-through tests in which the\nconcentrations were not measured and results of static and renewal tests based\non initial concentrations (nominal concentrations are acceptable for most test\nmaterials if measured concentrations are not available) of test material. A\nrenewal test is a test with aquatic organisms in which either the test solution\nin a test chamber is removed and replaced at least once during the test or the\ntest organisms are transferred into a new test solution of the same composition\nat least once during the test. A static test is a test with aquatic organisms\nin which the solution and organisms that are in a test chamber at the beginning\nof the test remain in the chamber until the end of the test, except for removal\nof dead test organisms. Note 1: Data reported by original\ninvestigators must not be rounded off. Results of all intermediate calculations\nmust not be rounded off to fewer than four significant digits. Note 2: The geometric mean of N numbers\nis the Nth root of the product of the N numbers. Alternatively, the geometric\nmean can be calculated by adding the logarithms of the N numbers, dividing the\nsum by N, and taking the antilog of the quotient. The geometric mean of two\nnumbers is the square root of the product of the two numbers, and the geometric\nmean of one number is that number. Either natural (base e) or common (base 10)\nlogarithms can be used to calculate geometric means as long as they are used\nconsistently within each set of data, i.e., the antilog used\nmust match the logarithms used. Note 3: Geometric means, rather than\narithmetic means, are used here because the distributions of sensitivities of\nindividual organisms in toxicity tests on most materials and the distributions\nof sensitivities of species within a genus are more likely to be lognormal than\nnormal. Similarly, geometric means are used for ACRs because quotients are\nlikely to be closer to lognormal than normal distributions. In addition, division of the geometric mean of a set of numerators by the geometric mean of\nthe set of denominators will result in the geometric mean of the set of\ncorresponding quotients. J. For each genus for which one or more SMAVs are available, the GMAV shall be\ncalculated as the geometric mean of the SMAVs available for the\ngenus. K. Order the GMAVs from high\nto low. L. Assign ranks, R, to the\nGMAVs from \"1\" for the lowest to \"N\" for the highest. If two or more GMAVs are\nidentical, assign them successive ranks. M. Calculate the cumulative probability, P, for each GMAV as R/ (N + 1). N. Select the four GMAVs which have cumulative probabilities closest to 0.05 (if\nthere are fewer than 59 GMAVs, these will always be the four lowest\nGMAVs)\nO. Using the four selected\nGMAVs, and Ps, calculate\n\nClick\nto view image\nP. If for a commercially or recreationally important species the geometric mean of\nthe acute values from flow-through tests in which the concentrations of test\nmaterial were measured is lower than the calculated Final Acute Value (FAV), then that geometric mean must be used as the FAV instead of the calculated\nFAV. Q. See section VI of this\n\nAppendix. V. FINAL\nACUTE EQUATION\nA. When enough data are\navailable to show that acute toxicity to two or more species is similarly\nrelated to a water quality characteristic, the relationship shall be taken into\naccount as described in sections V.B through V.G of this Appendix or using\nanalysis of covariance. The two methods are equivalent and produce identical\nresults. The manual method described below provides an understanding of this\napplication of covariance analysis, but computerized versions of covariance\nanalysis are much more convenient for analyzing large data sets. If two or more\nfactors affect toxicity, multiple regression analysis shall be used. B. For each species for which comparable\nacute toxicity values are available at two or more different values of the\nwater quality characteristic, perform a least squares regression of the acute\ntoxicity values on the corresponding values of the water quality characteristic\nto obtain the slope and its 95 percent confidence limits for each species. Note: Because the best documented\nrelationship is that between hardness and acute toxicity of metals in fresh\nwater and a log-log relationship fits these data, geometric means and natural\nlogarithms of both toxicity and water quality are used in the rest of this\nsection. For relationships based on other water quality characteristics, such\nas pH, temperature, no transformation or a different transformation might fit\nthe data better, and appropriate changes will be necessary throughout this\nsection. C. Decide whether\nthe data for each species are relevant, taking into account the range and\nnumber of the tested values of the water quality characteristic and the degree\nof agreement within and between species. For example, a slope based on six data\npoints might be of limited value if it is based only on data for a very narrow\nrange of values of the water quality characteristic. A slope based on only two\ndata points, however, might be useful it it is consistent with other\ninformation and if the two points cover a broad enough range of the water\nquality characteristic. In addition, acute values that appear to be\nquestionable in comparison with other acute and chronic data available for the\nsame species and for other species in the same genus should not be used. For\nexample, if after adjustment for the water quality characteristic, the acute\nvalues available for a species or genus differ by more than a factor of 10, rejection of some or all of the values would be appropriate, absent\ncountervailing justification. If useful slopes are not available for at least\none fish and one invertebrate or if the available slopes are too dissimilar or\nif too few data are available to adequately define the relationship between\nacute toxicity and the water quality characteristic, return to section IV.G of\nthis Appendix, using the results of tests conducted under conditions and in\nwaters similar to those commonly used for toxicity tests with the\nspecies. D. For each species, calculate the geometric mean of the available acute values and then divide each\nof the acute values for the species by the geometric mean for the species. This\nnormalizes the acute values so that the geometric mean of the normalized values\nfor each species individually and for any combination of species is\n1.0. E. Similarly normalize the\nvalues of the water quality characteristic for each species individually using\nthe same procedure as above. F. Individually for each species perform a least squares regression of the\nnormalized acute values of the water quality characteristic. The resulting\nslopes and 95 percent confidence limits will be identical to those obtained in\nsection V.B. of this Appendix. If, however, the data are actually plotted, the\nline of best fit for each individual species will go through the point 1,1 in\nthe center of the graph. G. Treat\nall of the normalized data as if they were all for the same species and perform\na least squares regression of all of the normalized acute values on the\ncorresponding normalized values of the water quality characteristic to obtain\nthe pooled acute slope, V, and its 95 percent confidence limits. If all of the\nnormalized data are actually plotted, the line of best fit will go through the\npoint 1,1 in the center of the graph. H. For each species calculate the geometric\nmean, W, of the acute toxicity values and the geometric mean, X, of the values\nof the water quality characteristic. (These were calculated in sections V.D and\nV.E of this Appendix). I. For each\nspecies, calculate the logarithm, Y, of the SMAV at a selected value, Z, of the\nwater quality characteristic using the equation: Y = ln W - V(ln X - ln Z)\nJ. For each species calculate the SMAV at X\nusing the equation: SMAV = exp(y)\n\nNote: Alternatively, the SMAVs at Z can\nbe obtained by skipping step H above, using the equations in steps I and J to\nadjust each acute value individually to Z, and then calculating the geometric\nmean of the adjusted values for each species individually. This alternative\nprocedure allows an examination of the range of the adjusted acute values for\neach species. K. Obtain the\nFAV at Z by using the procedure described in sections IV.J through IV.O of this\n\nAppendix. L. If, for a commercially\nor recreationally important species the geometric mean of the acute values at Z\nfrom flow-through tests in which the concentrations of the test material were\nmeasured is lower than the FAV at Z, then the geometric mean must be used as\nthe FAV instead of the FAV. M. The\n\nFinal Acute Equation is written as: FAV = exp (V[ln(water quality char.)] + A - V[ln\nZ])\nwhere: V = pooled acute slope, and A = ln (FAV at Z). Because V, A, and Z are known, the FAV can be calculated\nfor any selected value of the water quality characteristic. VI. FINAL CHRONIC\nVALUE\nA. There are two methods for\ncalculating a Final Chronic Value (FCV). Selection of the appropriate\nmethodology is dependent upon the availability of chronic toxicity data. If\nchronic toxicity data for the species described in section III.B.1 for\nfreshwater species or section III.C.1 for saltwater species are available, the\nFCV can be calculated in the same manner as the FAV. Otherwise, the FCV can be\ncalculated by dividing the FAV by the Final Acute-Chronic Ratio (FACR). The\ndata requirements for calculating the FACR are identified in sections III.B.2\nand III.C.2 for freshwater and saltwater species respectively. In some cases, it might not be possible to calculate a FCV. The FCV is (a) a calculated\nestimate of the concentration of a test material such that 95 percent of the\ngenera (with which acceptable chronic toxicity tests have been conducted on the\nmaterial) have higher GMCVs or (b) the quotient of an FAV divided by an\nappropriate ACR, or (c) the SMCV of a commercially or recreationally important\nspecies, if the SMCV is lower than the calculated estimate or the quotient, whichever is applicable. Note: As the name implies, the ACR is a\nway of relating acute and chronic toxicities. B. A chronic standard or guidance value shall\nbe based on results of flow-through (except renewal is acceptable for daphnids)\nchronic tests in which the concentrations of test material in the test\nsolutions were properly measured at appropriate times during the test. A\nchronic test is a comparative study in which organisms, that are subjected to\ndifferent treatments, are observed for a long period or a substantial portion\nof their life span. C. Results of\nchronic tests in which survival, growth, or reproduction in the control\ntreatment was unacceptably low shall not be used. The limits of acceptability\nwill depend on the species. D. Results of chronic tests conducted in unusual dilution water, e.g., dilution water in which total organic carbon or\nparticulate matter exceeded five mg/L, should not be used, unless a\nrelationship is developed between chronic toxicity and organic carbon or\nparticulate matter, or unless data show that organic carbon, particulate\nmatter, etc., do not affect toxicity. E. Chronic values must be based on endpoints\nand lengths of exposure appropriate to the species. Therefore, only results of\nthe following kinds of chronic toxicity tests shall be used: 1. Life-cycle toxicity tests consisting of\nexposures of each of two or more groups of individuals of a species to a\ndifferent concentration of the test material throughout a life cycle. To ensure\nthat all life stages and life processes are exposed, tests with fish should\nbegin with embryos or newly hatched young less than 48 hours old, continue\nthrough maturation and reproduction, and should end not less than 24 days (90\ndays for salmonids) after the hatching of the next generation. Tests with\ndaphnids should begin with young less than 24 hours old and last for not less\nthan 21 days, and for ceriodaphnids not less than seven days. Tests with mysids\nshould begin with young less than 24 hours old and continue until seven days\npast the median time of first brood release in the controls. For fish, data\nshould be obtained and analyzed on survival and growth of adults and young, maturation of males and females, eggs spawned per female, embryo viability\n(salmonids only), and hatchability. For daphnids, data should be obtained and\nanalyzed on survival and young per female. For mysids, data should be obtained\nand analyzed on survival, growth, and young per female. 2. Partial life-cycle toxicity tests consist\nof exposures of each of two more groups of individuals of a species of fish to\na different concentration of the test material through most portions of a life\ncycle. Partial life-cycle tests are allowed with fish species that require more\nthan a year to reach sexual maturity, so that all major life stages can be\nexposed to the test material in less than 15 months. A life-cycle test is a\ncomparative study in which organisms, that are subjected to different\ntreatments, are observed at least from a life stage in one generation to the\nsame life-stage in the next generation. Exposure to the test material should\nbegin with immature juveniles at least two months prior to active gonad\ndevelopment, continue through maturation and reproduction, and end not less\nthan 24 days (90 days for salmonids) after the hatching of the next generation. Data should be obtained and analyzed on survival and growth of adults and\nyoung, maturation of males and females, eggs spawned per female, embryo\nviability (salmonids only), and hatchability. 3. Early life-stage toxicity tests consisting\nof 28- to 32-day (60 days post hatch for salmonids) exposures of the early life\nstages of a species of fish from shortly after fertilization through embryonic, larval, and early juvenile development. Data should be obtained and analyzed on\nsurvival and growth. Note: Results of an early life-stage\ntest are used as predictions of results of life-cycle and partial life-cycle\ntests with the same species. Therefore, when results of a life-cycle or partial\nlife-cycle test are available, results of an early life-stage test with the\nsame species should not be used. Also, results of early life-stage tests in\nwhich the incidence of mortalities or abnormalities increased substantially\nnear the end of the test shall not be used because the results of such tests\nare possibly not good predictions of comparable life-cycle or partial\nlife-cycle tests. F. A chronic value may be obtained by\ncalculating the geometric mean of the lower and upper chronic limits from a\nchronic test or by analyzing chronic data using regression analysis. 1. A lower chronic limit is the highest\ntested concentration: a. In an acceptable\nchronic test; b. Which did not\ncause an unacceptable amount of adverse effect on any of the specified\nbiological measurements; and\nc. Below which no tested concentration caused an unacceptable effect. 2. An upper chronic limit is the\nlowest tested concentration: a. In an\nacceptable chronic test; b. Which\ndid cause an unacceptable amount of adverse effect on one or more of the\nspecified biological measurements; and, c. Above which all tested concentrations also\ncaused such an effect. Note: Because various authors have used\na variety of terms and definitions to interpret and report results of chronic\ntests, reported results should be reviewed carefully. The amount of effect that\nis considered unacceptable is often based on a statistical hypothesis test, but\nmight also be defined in terms of a specified percent reduction from the\ncontrols. A small percent reduction (\ne.g., three percent)\nmight be considered acceptable even if it is statistically significantly\ndifferent from the control, whereas a large percent reduction\n(\ne.g., 30 percent) might be considered unacceptable even if it\nis not statistically significant. G. If the chronic toxicity of the material to\naquatic animals has been shown to be related to a water quality characteristic\nsuch as hardness or particulate matter for freshwater animals, refer to section\nVII of this Appendix. H. If chronic\nvalues are available for the species in eight families\nas\ndescribed in section III.B.1 or section III.C.1 of this Appendix, respective\nSMCVs shall be calculated for each species for which at least one chronic value\nis available by calculating the geometric mean of the results of all acceptable\nlife-cycle and partial life-cycle toxicity tests with the species; for a\nspecies of fish for which no such result is available, the SMCV is the\ngeometric mean of all acceptable early life-stage tests. Appropriate GMCVs\nshall also be calculated. A GMCV is the geometric mean of the SMCVs for the\ngenus. The FCV shall be obtained using the procedure described in sections IV.J\nthrough IV.O of this Appendix, substituting SMCV and GMCV for SMAV and GMAV\nrespectively. See section VI.M of this Appendix. Note: Section VI.I through VI.L are for\nuse when chronic values are not available for freshwater species in eight\ntaxonomic families as described in section III.B.1 of this Appendix, or for\nsaltwater species in eight taxonomic families as described in section III.C.1\nof this Appendix. I. For\neach chronic value for which at least one corresponding appropriate acute value\nis available, calculate an ACR, using for the numerator the geometric mean of\nthe results of all acceptable flow-through (except static is acceptable for\ndaphnids and midges) acute tests in the same dilution water in which the\nconcentrations are measured. For fish, the acute test(s) should be conducted\nwith juveniles. The acute test(s) should be part of the same study as the\nchronic test. If acute tests were not conducted as part of the same study, but\nwere conducted as part of a different study in the same laboratory and dilution\nwater, then they may be used. If no such acute tests are available, results of\nacute tests conducted in the same dilution water in a different laboratory may\nbe used. If no such acute tests are available, an ACR shall not be\ncalculated. J. For each species, calculate the SMACR as the geometric mean of all ACRs available for that\nspecies. If the minimum ACR data requirements for calculation of a freshwater\nchronic standard or guidance value (as described in section III.B.2 of this\n\nAppendix are not met with freshwater data alone, saltwater data may be used\nalong with the freshwater data. Conversely, if the minimum ACR data\nrequirements for calculation of a saltwater chronic standard or guidance value\n(as described in section III.C.2 of this Appendix) are not met with saltwater\ndata alone, freshwater data may be used along with the saltwater\ndata. K. For some materials, the\nACR seems to be the same for all species, but for other materials the ratio\nseems to increase or decrease as the SMAV increases. Thus the FACR can be\nobtained in three ways, depending on the data available: 1. If the species mean ACR seems to increase\nor decrease as the SMAVs increase, the FACR shall be calculated as the\ngeometric mean of the ACRs for species whose SMAVs are close to the\nFAV. 2. If no major trend is\napparent and the ACRs for all species are within a factor of ten, the FACR\nshall be calculated as the geometric mean of all of the SMACRs. 3. If the most appropriate SMACRs are less\nthan 2.0, and especially if they are less than 1.0, acclimation has probably\noccurred during the chronic test. In this situation, because continuous\nexposure and acclimation cannot be assured to provide adequate protection in\nfield situations, the FACR should be assumed to be two, so that the FCV is\nequal to the Aquatic (Acute) value A(A). (See section X.B of this Appendix.) If\nthe available SMACRs do not fit one of these cases, a FACR may not be obtained\nand a Tier I FCV probably cannot be calculated. L. Calculate the FCV by dividing the FAV by\nthe FACR. FCV = FAV ÷ FACR\nIf there is a Final Acute Equation rather than a FAV, see\nalso section V of this Appendix. M. If the SMCV of a commercially or\nrecreationally important species is lower than the calculated FCV, then that\nSMCV must be used as the FCV instead of the calculated FCV. N. See section VIII of this\n\nAppendix. VII. FINAL CHRONIC EQUATION\nA. A Final\n\nChronic Equation can be derived in two ways. The procedure described in section\nVII.A of this Appendix will result in the chronic slope being the same as the\nacute slope. The procedure described in sections VII.B through N of this\n\nAppendix will usually result in the chronic slope being different from the\nacute slope. 1. If ACRs are available for\nenough species at enough values of the water quality characteristic to indicate\nthat the ACR appears to be the same for all species and appears to be\nindependent of the water quality characteristic, calculate the FACR as the\ngeometric mean of the available SMACRs. 2. Calculate the FCV at the selected value Z\nof the water quality characteristic by dividing the FAV at Z (see section V.M\nof this Appendix) by the FACR. 3. Use V = pooled acute slope (see section V.M of this Appendix), and L = pooled\nchronic slope. 4. See section VII.M\nof this Appendix. B. When\nenough data are available to show that chronic toxicity to at least one species\nis related to a water quality characteristic, the relationship should be taken\ninto account as described in sections C through G below or using analysis of\ncovariance. The two methods are equivalent and produce identical results. The\nmanual method described below provides an understanding of this application of\ncovariance analysis, but computerized versions of covariance analysis are much\nmore convenient for analyzing large data sets. If two or more factors affect\ntoxicity, multiple regression analysis shall be used. C. For each species for which comparable\nchronic toxicity values are available at two or more different values of the\nwater quality characteristic, perform a least squares regression of the chronic\ntoxicity values on the corresponding values of the water quality characteristic\nto obtain the slope and its 95 percent confidence limits for each species. Note: Because the best documented\nrelationship is that between hardness and acute toxicity of metals in fresh\nwater and a log-log relationship fits these data, geometric means and natural\nlogarithms of both toxicity and water quality are used in the rest of this\nsection. For relationships based on other water quality characteristics, such\nas pH, temperature, no transformation or a different transformation might fit\nthe data better, and appropriate changes will be necessary throughout this\nsection. It is probably preferable, but not necessary, to use the same\ntransformation that was used with the acute values in section V of this\n\nAppendix. D. Decide whether\nthe data for each species are relevant, taking into account the range and\nnumber of the tested values of the water quality characteristic and the degree\nof agreement within and between species. For example, a slope based on six data\npoints might be of limited value if it is based only on data for a very narrow\nrange of values of the water quality characteristic. A slope based on only two\ndata points, however, might be more useful if it is consistent with other\ninformation and if the two points cover a broad range of the water quality\ncharacteristic. In addition, chronic values that appear to be questionable in\ncomparison with other acute and chronic data available for the same species and\nfor other species in the same genus in most cases should not be used. For\nexample, if after adjustment for the water quality characteristic, the chronic\nvalues available for a species or genus differ by more than a factor of 10, rejection of some or all of the values is, in most cases, absent countervailing\ncircumstances, appropriate. If a useful chronic slope is not available for at\nleast one species or if the available slopes are too dissimilar or if too few\ndata are available to adequately define the relationship between chronic\ntoxicity and the water quality characteristic, it might be appropriate to\nassume that the chronic slope is the same as the acute slope, which is\nequivalent to assuming that the ACR is independent of the water quality\ncharacteristic. Alternatively, return to section VI.H of this Appendix, using\nthe results of tests conducted under conditions and in waters similar to those\ncommonly used for toxicity tests with the species. E. Individually for each species, calculate\nthe geometric mean of the available chronic values and then divide each chronic\nvalue for a species by the mean for the species. This normalizes the chronic\nvalues so that the geometric mean of the normalized values for each species\nindividually, and for any combination of species, is 1.0. F. Similarly, normalize the values of the\nwater quality characteristic for each species individually. G. Individually for each species, perform a\nleast squares regression of the normalized chronic toxicity values on the\ncorresponding normalized values of the water quality characteristic. The\nresulting slopes and the 95 percent confidence limits will be identical to\nthose obtained in section VII.B of this Appendix. Now, however, if the data are\nactually plotted, the line of best fit for each individual species will go\nthrough the point 1,1 in the center of the graph. H. Treat all of the normalized data as if\nthey were all the same species and perform a least squares regression of all of\nthe normalized chronic values on the corresponding normalized values of the\nwater quality characteristic to obtain the pooled chronic slope, L, and its 95\npercent confidence limits. If all normalized data are actually plotted, the line of\nbest fit will go through the point 1,1 in the center of the graph. I. For each species, calculate the\ngeometric mean, M, of the toxicity values and the geometric mean, P, of the\nvalues of the water quality characteristic. (These are calculated in sections\nVII.E and F of this Appendix.)\nJ. For each species, calculate the logarithm, Q, of the SMCV at a selected value, Z, of the water quality characteristic using the equation: Q = ln M - L(ln P - ln Z)\n\nNote: Although it is not necessary, it\nis recommended that the same value of the water quality characteristic be used\nhere as was used in section V of this Appendix. K. For each species, calculate a SMCV at Z\nusing the equation: SMCV = exp(Q)\n\nNote: Alternatively, the SMCV at Z can\nbe obtained by skipping section VII.J of this Appendix, using the equations in\nsections VII.J and K of this Appendix to adjust each chronic value individually\nto Z, and then calculating the geometric means of the adjusted values for each\nspecies individually. This alternative procedure allows an examination of the\nrange of the adjusted chronic values for each species. L. Obtain the FCV at Z by using the procedure\ndescribed in sections IV.J through O of this Appendix. M. If the SMCV at Z of a commercially or\nrecreationally important species is lower than the calculated FCV at Z, then\nthat SMCV shall be used as the FCV at Z instead of the calculated\nFCV. N. The Final Chronic Equation\nis written as: FCV = exp (L[ln(water quality characteristic)] + lnS -\nL[lnZ])\nwhere: L = pooled chronic slope and S = FCV at Z. Because L, S, and Z are known, the FCV can be calculated\nfor any selected value of the water quality characteristic. VIII. FINAL PLANT\nVALUE\nA. A Final Plant Value (FPV) is\nthe lowest plant value that was obtained with an important aquatic plant\nspecies in an acceptable toxicity test for which the concentrations of the test\nmaterial were measured and the adverse effect was biologically important. Appropriate measures of the toxicity of the material to aquatic plants are used\nto compare the relative sensitivities of aquatic plants and animals. Although\nprocedures for conducting and interpreting the results of toxicity tests with\nplants are not well-developed, results of tests with plants usually indicate\nthat criteria which adequately protect aquatic animals and their uses will, in\nmost cases, also protect aquatic plants and their uses. B. A plant value is the result of a 96-hour\ntest conducted with an alga or a chronic test conducted with an aquatic\nvascular plant. Note: A test of the toxicity of a metal\nto a plant shall not be used if the medium contained an excessive amount of a\ncomplexing agent, such as EDTA, that might affect the toxicity of the metal. Concentrations of EDTA above 200 ug/L should be considered excessive. C. The FPV shall be obtained by\nselecting the lowest result from a test with an important aquatic plant species\nin which the concentrations of test material are measured and the endpoint is\nbiologically important. IX. OTHER DATA\nPertinent information that could not be used in earlier\nsections might be available concerning adverse effects on aquatic organisms. The most important of these are data on cumulative and delayed toxicity, reduction in survival, growth, or reproduction, or any other adverse effect\nthat has been shown to be biologically important. Delayed toxicity is an\nadverse effect to an organism that results from, and occurs after the end of, its exposure to one or more test materials. Especially important are data for\nspecies for which no other data are available. Data from behavioral, biochemical, physiological, microcosm, and field studies might also be\navailable. Data might be available from tests conducted in unusual dilution\nwater (see sections IV.D and VI.D of this Appendix), from chronic tests in\nwhich the concentrations were not measured (see section VI.B of this Appendix), from tests with previously exposed organisms, and from tests on formulated\nmixtures or emulsifiable concentrates. Such data might affect a criterion if\nthe data were obtained with a commercially or recreationally important species, the test concentrations were measured, and the endpoint was biologically\nimportant. X. STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE VALUES, TIER I\nA. Standards or guidance values to protect\naquatic life include: the Aquatic (Acute) or A(A) and the Aquatic (Chronic) or\nA(C). B. The A(A) is equal to\none-half the FAV. The A(A) is an estimate of the highest concentration of a\nmaterial in the water column to which an aquatic community can be exposed\nbriefly without resulting in an unacceptable effect. C. The A(C) is equal to the lowest of the FCV\nor the FPV (if available) unless other data (see section IX of this Appendix)\nshow that a lower value should be used. The A(C) is an estimate of the highest\nconcentration of a material in the water column to which an aquatic community\ncan be exposed indefinitely without resulting in an unacceptable effect. If\ntoxicity is related to a water quality characteristic, the A(C) is obtained\nfrom the Final Chronic Equation or FPV (if available) that results in the\nlowest concentrations in the usual range of the water quality characteristic, unless other data (see section IX) show that a lower value should be\nused. D. Round both the A(A) and\nthe A(C) to two significant digits. XI. FINAL REVIEW\nA. The derivation of the standard or guidance\nvalue should be carefully reviewed by rechecking each step of the guidance in\nthis part. Items that should be especially checked are: 1. If unpublished data are used, are they\nwell documented?\n2. Are all\nrequired data available?\n3. Is the\nrange of acute values for any species greater than a factor of 10?\n4. Is the range of SMAVs for any genus\ngreater than a factor of 10?\n5. Is\nthere more than a factor of 10 difference between the four lowest\nGMAVs?\n6. Are any of the lowest\nGMAVs questionable?\n7. Is the FAV\nreasonable in comparison with the SMAVs and GMAVs?\n8. For any commercially or recreationally\nimportant species, is the geometric mean of the acute values from flow-through\ntests in which the concentrations of test material were measured lower than the\nFAV?\n9. Are any of the chronic\nvalues used questionable?\n10. Are\nany chronic values available for acutely sensitive species?\n11. Is the range of acute-chronic ratios\ngreater than a factor of 10?\n12. Is\nthe FCV reasonable in comparison with the available acute and chronic\ndata?\n13. Is the measured or\npredicted chronic value for any commercially or recreationally important\nspecies below the FCV?\n14. Are any\nof the other data important?\n15. Do\nany data look like they might be outliers?\n16. Are there any deviations from the\nguidance in this part? Are they acceptable?\nB. On the basis of all available pertinent\nlaboratory and field information, determine if the standard or guidance value\nis consistent with sound scientific evidence. If it is not, another standard or\nguidance value, either higher or lower, shall be derived consistent with the\nguidance in this part. Procedures for Deriving Aquatic Life Tier II\nStandards and Guidance Values, Sections XII-XVII\nXII. SECONDARY ACUTE\nVALUE\nIf all eight minimum data requirements for calculating an\nFAV using Tier I are not met, a Secondary Acute Value (SAV) shall be calculated\nfor a chemical as follows: To calculate a SAV, the lowest GMAV in the database is\ndivided by the Secondary Acute Factor (SAF) (Table 1 of this Appendix)\ncorresponding to the number of satisfied minimum data requirements listed in\nthe Tier I methodology (section III.B.1 of this Appendix for freshwater species\nand section III.C.1 for saltwater species). Data requirements contained in\nsections I, II, and IV shall be applied to calculation of a SAV. If all eight\nminimum data requirements are satisfied, a Tier I value calculation may be\npossible. In order to calculate a freshwater SAV, the database must contain, at\na minimum, a genus mean acute value (GMAV) for one of the following three\ngenera in the family Daphnidae -\nCeriodaphnia sp., Daphnia\nsp., or\n\nSimocephalus sp. In order to calculate a\nsaltwater SAV, it would be desirable if the database contained, at a minimum: a\ngenus mean acute value (GMAV) for a species or genus in one of the following\nfamilies - Mysidae or Penaeidae; and a GMAV for a saltwater fish. If appropriate, the SAV shall be made a function of a\nwater quality characteristic in a manner similar to that described in Tier\nI. Table 1. Secondary Acute Factors\n\nNumber of minimum data requirements\nsatisfied\n\nSecondary Acute\n\nFactor\n1\n21.9\n2\n13.0\n3\n8.0\n4\n7.0\n5\n6.1\n6\n5.2\n7\n4.3\nXIII. SECONDARY ACUTE-CHRONIC\nRATIO\nIf three or more experimentally determined ACRs, meeting\nthe data collection and review requirements of section VI of this Appendix, are\navailable for the chemical, determine the FACR using the procedure described in\nsection VI. If fewer than three acceptable experimentally determined ACRs are\navailable, use enough assumed ACRs of 18 so that the total number of ACRs\nequals three. Calculate the Secondary Acute-Chronic Ratio (SACR) as the\ngeometric mean of the three ACRs. Thus, if no experimentally determined ACRs\nare available, the SACR is 18. XIV. SECONDARY CHRONIC VALUE\nCalculate the Secondary Chronic Value (SCV) using one of\nthe following: A. SCV = FAV ÷\nSACR (use FAV from Tier I)\nB. SCV =\nSAV ÷ FACR\nC. SCV = SAV\n÷ SACR\nIf appropriate, the SCV will be made a function of a\nwater quality characteristic in a manner similar to that described in Tier\nI. XV. COMMERCIALLY OR RECREATIONALLY IMPORTANT SPECIES\nIf for a commercially or recreationally important species\nthe geometric mean of the acute values or chronic values from flow-through\ntests in which the concentrations of the test materials were measured is lower\nthan the calculated SAV or SCV, then that geometric mean must be used as the\nSAV or SCV instead of the calculated SAV or SCV. XVI. STANDARDS AND GUIDANCE VALUES, TIER II\nA. Standards or guidance values\nto protect aquatic life shall include: the Aquatic (Acute) or A(A) value and\nthe Aquatic (Chronic) or A(C) value. B. The A(A) is equal to one-half of the\nSAV. C. The A(C) is equal to the\nlowest of the SCV or the Final Plant Value, if available, unless other data\n(see section IX of this Appendix) show that a lower value should be used. If toxicity is related to a water quality characteristic, the A(C) is obtained from the Secondary Chronic Equation or FPV, if available, that results in the lowest concentrations in the usual range of the water\nquality characteristic, unless other data (see section IX of this Appendix)\nshow that a lower value should be used. D. Round both the A(A) and the A(C) to two\nsignificant digits. XVII. APPROPRIATE MODIFICATIONS\nOn the basis of all available pertinent laboratory and\nfield information, determine if the Tier II value is consistent with sound\nscientific evidence. If it is not, another value, either higher or lower, shall\nbe derived consistent with the guidance in this Appendix. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
