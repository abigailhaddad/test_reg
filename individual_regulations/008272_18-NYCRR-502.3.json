  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 502.3 - Determination of ownership or control percentages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Indirect ownership interest. The amount\nof indirect ownership interest is determined by multiplying the percentages of\nownership in each entity. For example, if A owns 10 percent of the stock in a\ncorporation which owns 80 percent of the stock of the disclosing entity, A's\ninterest equates to an eight-percent indirect ownership interest in the\ndisclosing entity and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 80 percent of the\nstock of a corporation which owns five percent of the stock of the disclosing\nentity, B's interest equates to a four-percent indirect ownership interest in\nthe disclosing entity and need not be reported. (b) Persons with an ownership or control\ninterest. In order to determine percentage of ownership, mortgage, deed of\ntrust, note, or other obligation, the percentage of interest owned in the\nobligation is multiplied by the percentage of the disclosing entity's assets\nused to secure the obligation. For example, if A owns 10 percent of a note\naccrued by 60 percent of the provider's assets, A's interest in the provider's\nassets equates to six percent and must be reported. Conversely, if B owns 40\npercent of a note secured by 10 percent of the provider's assets, B's interest\nin the provider's assets equates to four percent and need not be\nreported. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n502.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
