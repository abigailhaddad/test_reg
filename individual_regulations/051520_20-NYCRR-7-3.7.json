  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 7-3.7 - Short taxable years\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 213-b(g))\n\nIn the case of a short taxable year of a taxpayer for\nwhich a declaration of estimated tax is required to be made and filed, the\nestimated tax, after deducting the amount, if any, paid as a mandatory first\ninstallment for such period, must be paid in equal installments. One such\ninstallment must be paid at the time of filing the declaration, one on the 15th\nday of the ninth month of the current taxable year (unless the short taxable\nyear closed prior to such ninth month, in which case the installment will be\neliminated), and one on the 15th day of the last month of the current taxable\nyear. (a) Example. Corporation A has a short taxable year of 10 months, from\n\nJanuary 1, 2021, to October 31, 2021. If there is a reasonable expectation\nbefore June 1, 2021, that Corporation A's estimated tax will exceed $1,000 for\nsuch short taxable year, the declaration is required to be made and filed on or\nbefore June 15, 2021. The estimated tax (after deducting the amount of\nmandatory first installment paid, if any) is payable in three equal\ninstallments: one on the date of filing the declaration and one each on\n\nSeptember 15, 2021, and October 15, 2021. If, instead, there is a reasonable expectation on or\nafter June 1, 2021, but before September 1, 2021, that Corporation A's\nestimated tax will exceed $1,000, the declaration is required to be made and\nfiled on or before September 15, 2021. The estimated tax (after deducting the\namount of mandatory first installment paid, if any) is payable in two equal\ninstallments: one on the date of filing the declaration and one on October 15, 2021. If there is a reasonable expectation on or after\n\nSeptember 1, 2021, but not before such date, that Corporation A's estimated tax\nwill exceed $1,000, the declaration is required to be made and filed on or\nbefore October 15, 2021. The estimated tax (after deducting the amount of\nmandatory first installment paid, if any) is payable in full on the date of\nfiling the declaration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n7-3.7\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
