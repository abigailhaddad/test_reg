  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1631-1.2 - Electrical hazards\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe electrical systems of projects are properly\ndesigned and installed to eliminate all fire hazards. The danger generally\ndevelops from improper use. Special note should be made of the following\nitems: (a) Fuses. Only fuses of the\nproper amperage for the control of the circuit are to be used. To prevent the\nuse of improper size fuses by tenants, authorities should install fustats and\nadapters of the proper amperage, usually 15 amperes, in the fuse box located in\napartments. Tenants should also be cautioned on use of electrical appliances so\nas not to overload circuit. (b) Electrical equipment. All electrical equipment should be kept in a state of\ngood repair. All motors, including oil burner and heat distribution motors, should be cleaned, oiled and checked at frequent intervals as recommended by\nthe manufacturer. Electrical equipment having heating elements should be used\nwith care and safely placed so as not to set fire to adjoining surfaces. All\nelectrical equipment should bear the Underwriters' Label of Approval. Frayed or\nworn cords on portable devices should be replaced. Extension cords should be\nused only to meet temporary requirements and should not be used as a substitute\nfor permanent wiring. (c) Grounding\nof equipment. Electrical equipment, such as washing machines, dryers, commercial refrigerators, ranges, etc., present a shock hazard unless grounded\nin an acceptable manner. Certain portable electric tools, such as drills, saws, etc., also present a shock hazard unless properly grounded, usually by means of\na multi-prong plug properly connected to the electrical source. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1631-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
