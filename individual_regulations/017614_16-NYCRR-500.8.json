  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 500.8 - Adjustment of bills due to over-registration of meter\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Displacement meters. (1)\n\nIf upon test of displacement meters upon\ncomplaint (except as herein provided for meters tested in place), it be found\nthat the weighted average percentage of accuracy of the meter, determined as\nhereinafter specified, exceeds 100 percent, the bills of the consumer shall be\nadjusted to the extent of such excess for one-half of the quantity registered\nsince the last test unless it can be shown that the error is due to an accident\nor other cause, the approximate date of which can be determined, in which case\nit shall be figured back to such date; or unless the consumer has suffered no\ndamage from said error by virtue of the fact that the meter has registered a\nquantity of water less than that allowed for the minimum rate of the applicable\nrate schedule. (2)\n\nFor the purpose\nof adjustment of consumers' bills, the weighted average percentage of accuracy\nof a displacement meter, except as herein provided for meters tested in place, shall be determined by giving a weight of two to the percentage at the rate at\nwhich the percentage of accuracy is a maximum and a weight of unity to each of\nthe percentages at approximately the low and high rates of flow within \"normal\ntest flow limits\". (b) Meters other than displacement type. The adjustment of bills, upon complaint of\nconsumers, where current, compound, and fire-service meters, or meters of all\ntypes tested in place on premises are involved, will be determined from an\naccuracy curve, developed from tests of the meter in question, properly\naveraged. If the average percentage of accuracy so determined exceeds 100\npercent, the bills of the consumer shall be adjusted in the manner hereinbefore\nprovided for displacement meters. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n500.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
