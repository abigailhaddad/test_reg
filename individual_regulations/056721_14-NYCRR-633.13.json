  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.13 - Research involving persons in OPWDD facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nThe understanding, prevention and\namelioration of developmental disabilities are significantly enhanced by\nknowledge gained through research (see glossary). This section seeks to ensure\nthe protection of participants (see glossary) in research while, at the same\ntime, facilitating research into the very conditions and disorders from which\nthey suffer and which underlie their impairment. (2)\n\nRequirements for conducting research in\nfacilities operated or certified by OPWDD involving persons with developmental\ndisabilities. (i) All research. (a) Subsequent to the effective date of this\nsection, all facilities or entities (see glossary) which will conduct research\ninvolving participants with developmental disabilities must submit to the\ncommissioner a copy of their federally approved assurance of compliance with\nregulations for the protection of human subjects (see glossary), or an\nalternate assurance certifying compliance with the provisions of 45 CFR\n46, in\na format specified by the commissioner. (1)\n\nInitial and updated assurances shall be submitted at times specified by the\ncommissioner. (2)\n\nNo research may\nbe initiated unless a current approved assurance is on file with the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nIf a State\noperated facility has been included under OPWDD's federally approved assurance\nof compliance, it shall be deemed to have met the above requirements. State\noperated facilities that have not been included as of the date of promulgation\nof this section will meet the requirements upon submission of appropriate\ndocumentation to the Research Foundation for Mental Hygiene, Inc., and approval\ntherefrom. (4)\n\nThe\n\nCode of\n\nFederal Regulations\n(CFR) is published by the Office of the\n\nFederal Register, National Archives and Records Service, General Services Administration, and is available for purchase from the\n\nSuperintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC\n20402; or it is available for review during business hours and by appointment\nat the following locations: (i) the Department\nof State, Division of Information Services, 11th Floor, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12207; and\n(ii)\nthe\n\nOffice for People With Developmental Disabilities, Attention: Public Access\n\nOfficer, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. (b) Participation as a subject in any\nresearch project or activity shall not deprive any participant of the rights, privileges and protections provided to all other persons in facilities. Included in these rights is the right to give informed consent (see glossary)\nor withhold such consent for proposed research, except as provided for in\nsubclauses (\n8\n) and (\n9\n) of this clause; or to\nhave an authorized surrogate (see glossary), as specified in clauses\n(a)(3)(ii)(\nb\n) and (a)(3)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection, consent or withhold consent for research involving a participant who\nlacks the capacity to consent. (1)\n\nIf a\nparticipant has sufficient capacity to give informed consent, the decision of\nthe participant shall be honored, and consent or objection by a surrogate shall\nnot be considered. (2)\n\nNo\nparticipant, regardless of capacity to consent or lack of capacity to consent, shall take part in research over his/her objection except as provided in clause\n(a)(3)(i)(\ne\n) of this section. (3)\n\nParticipants may only take part in\nresearch which does not come into substantive conflict with their individual\nplan of services. (4)\n\nAll research\nproposals must be approved by, and the ensuing research be subject to the\nongoing review and monitoring of, a State or federally approved Institutional\n\nReview Board (IRB) (see glossary). (5)\n\nAll research proposals shall be reviewed\nand approved by the chief executive officer of the facility responsible for the\nparticipant(s). (6)\n\nProposed\nresearch projects or activities involving participants in OPWDD operated\nfacilities and research which is conducted by or at OPWDD operated facilities, are to be approved by OPWDD. (7)\n\nThese requirements shall not diminish the obligation of researchers, facilities, and institutional review boards to comply with applicable Federal\nor State laws, rules or regulations. (8)\n\nThe requirements for obtaining informed\nconsent can be waived by a State or federally approved IRB if the research\ninvolves only the review of records, and the researcher will have no personal\ncontact with any of the subjects of the research in the facility. In this\ninstance, the commissioner can consent to the release of information to\nqualified researchers upon the approval of a State or federally approved\n\nInstitutional Review Board, provided that the researcher shall in no event\ndisclose information tending to identify any person in the facility. (9)\n\nThe requirements for obtaining informed\nconsent can be waived by a State or federally approved IRB if the research\ninvolves only the analysis of previously collected tissue specimens or bodily\nfluids provided that the subjects cannot be identified directly or through\nidentifiers attached to the material. (c) In addition to meeting the general\nrequirements for approval, research which involves adult participants who lack\nthe capacity to give informed consent may not be approved unless the IRB has\ndetermined and documented that the study could not be carried out without the\ninvolvement of participants who lack the capacity to give informed consent. (ii)\n\nResearch involving\nmore than minimal risk (see glossary). (a) Informed consent shall always be obtained in conformance with paragraphs (3)\nand (4) of this subdivision. (b) Research involving more than minimal risk which takes place in or involves\nparticipant(s) from an OPWDD residential or day services facility shall only\ninclude participants who have been duly admitted to that facility. (c) A person's program planning team shall\nmake the determination as to whether research which involves more than minimal\nrisk comes in substantive conflict with the person's individual plan of\nservices. The determination shall be documented in the plan of\nservices. (d) Research which\ninvolves more than minimal risk and/or invasive procedures may only involve\npersons who lack the capacity to consent if the IRB has also determined and\ndocumented that the project is likely to produce knowledge which has overriding\ntherapeutic importance for the understanding or treatment of a condition which\nis presented by the person(s) who will be participating. Concurrence of the\nchief executive officer of the facility is also required prior to\nimplementation. (3)\n\nInformed consent requirements by or for\nadult persons in facilities. (i) All\nresearch. (a) The informed consent of adult\nparticipants, or their legally authorized surrogates as specified in clauses\n(a)(3)(ii)(\nb\n) and (a)(3)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection, shall be obtained and documented in accordance with, and to the extent\nrequired by, the provisions of 45 CFR\n46. At the time of promulgation of this\nsection, 45 CFR\n46.116,.117 and.408 contain the pertinent\ninformation. (b) The IRB shall be\nresponsible for the initial and continuing review and monitoring of research\nprojects. The IRB shall review the consent procedures proposed by the\nresearcher(s) and satisfy itself that all of the required elements are\nincorporated under circumstances that promote informed consent as specified in\n45 CFR\n46.116. (c) A participant shall have the right to\nwithdraw consent. If a participant lacks the capacity to consent, the\nparticipant's legally authorized surrogate may also withdraw consent to\ncontinue. Withdrawal from participation shall be conducted in a manner\nconsistent with good clinical practice. (d) No capable participant shall become or\nremain a research subject over his or her objection. (e) No participant who lacks the capacity to\ngive informed consent shall become or remain a research subject over his or her\nobjection or the objection of a surrogate party authorized under clause\n(a)(3)(ii)(\nb\n) or (a)(3)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection to consent on behalf of the participant, unless such research is\nspecifically authorized by a court of competent jurisdiction. If application is\nmade to a court subsequent to the objection of one of the above parties, notice\nof such application shall be given to the objecting party and the Mental\n\nHygiene Legal Service. Application to a court to override the objection of a\nparticipant or party authorized to consent shall be made only if it is\nconsidered to be in the best interest of the participant. Objection by a\nparticipant may be conveyed in whatever manner is typically utilized by the\nperson to communicate a meaningful decision. (f) If a party, other than the surrogate\nparty authorized to consent on behalf of the participant under clause\n(a)(3)(ii)(\nb\n) or (a)(3)(iii)(\nb\n) of this\nsection, objects to the participant's involvement in the research, the\nprocedures for objection and appeal contained in section\n633.12\nof this Part shall\napply. (ii)\n\nResearch\ninvolving no more than minimal risk. (a) For\nresearch which involves no more than minimal risk, and with the approval of the\nchief executive officer, the IRB may permit the researcher to assess the\npotential subject's capacity to consent. The IRB and/or the chief executive\nofficer may require parties other than the researcher to assess a participant's\ncapacity to consent. If there is a doubt about a participant's capacity to give\ninformed consent in relation to a specific research project which involves no\nmore than minimal risk, an assessment of capacity to consent shall be made by\nthe chief executive officer of the facility or his or her designee. (b) If a participant lacks the capacity to\nconsent, and the research involves no more than minimal risk, consent may be\nobtained from a party authorized under clause (a)(3)(iii)(\nb\n)\nof this section. In the absence of a party from this list, consent may be\nobtained from a court of competent jurisdiction or from a party recommended by\nthe IRB and appointed by the facility or entity's (see glossary) governing body\n(by whatever title known), for the purpose of acting as a surrogate in the\nconsent process on behalf of a person who lacks the capacity to consent. (1)\n\nThis party shall have no interest that\nconflicts with the interest of the person being represented and shall have\nknowledge and skills that insure adequate representation of the\nperson. (2)\n\nThe party appointed by\nthe governing body shall not be associated in any way (except in this role or\nas a non-affiliated member of the IRB) with the research, the researcher(s) or\nthe facility or entity. (iii)\n\nResearch involving more than minimal\nrisk. (a) For research which involves more\nthan minimal risk, the assessment of a person's capacity to consent (see\nglossary) to a particular research project shall be made by the person's\nprogram planning team, in consultation with the researcher. If doubt exists\nabout the person's capacity to consent, the following provisions shall apply: (1)\n\nThe chief executive officer of a facility\nor entity shall obtain, from a consultant, an independent written opinion and\nanalysis of a person's capacity to give or withhold informed consent to\nparticipate in the research project. The consultant shall be a New York State\nlicensed psychologist or physician, or a psychiatrist holding appropriate\nlicensure in New York State; have experience in treating persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities; and shall not be an employee of the facility or\nentity. (2)\n\nAfter considering the\nopinions of the consultant, the program planning team, and the researcher, the\nchief executive officer shall then determine whether the participant lacks the\ncapacity to consent. (3)\n\nThe\nopinions of the program planning team, the researcher and the consultant, together with the chief executive officer's decision, shall be documented in\nthe person's clinical record. The chief executive officer's decision shall be\ncommunicated to the person and his/her parent, other nearest relative, guardian\nor correspondent. (b) For research which involves more than minimal risk, if a person lacks the\ncapacity to consent to participation, informed consent may be obtained from a\nperson's court appointed guardian who is legally empowered to give consent to\nresearch; or an actively involved (see glossary) spouse, parent, adult child, or other actively involved adult family member (see glossary). Consent shall be\nsought from the parties on this list in the order stated. If the first\navailable party on this list objects or if no party from the list is available\nor willing to give consent, application may be made to a court of competent\njurisdiction. (4)\n\nInformed consent for minors. (i) All research. (a) If a participant is under 18 years of\nage, informed consent shall be obtained from a parent, legal guardian, or\nactively involved family member. A participant under the age of 18 who is\nmarried or the parent of a child shall, for the purposes of this section, be\nconsidered an adult, and the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subdivision\nshall apply. If no parent, legal guardian, or actively involved family member\nis available, consent may be obtained from: (1)\na party appointed in conformance with\nclause (ii)(\na\n) of this paragraph; or\n(2)\na court of competent\njurisdiction. (b) The\nassent (see glossary) of participants under 18 years of age must be obtained, and shall be sought and documented in a manner approved by the IRB. This shall\nbe in addition to the informed consent required pursuant to paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision. When practicable the assent should be in writing. However, the IRB may waive the requirement to obtain the assent of a minor if the\ncapacity of the child to assent is so limited that he or she cannot reasonably\nbe consulted. The waiver may be granted for a category of minors if, as a\ngroup, their age or other characteristics indicate that they uniformly lack\nsufficient capacity to assent. (c) A minor's objection to participation in a research project must be honored, except when: (1)\na surrogate party, specified\nin clause (4)(i)(\na\n) of this subdivision consents; and\n(2)\nthe child's program\nplanning team finds and documents: (i) that\nthe intervention or procedure involved in the research is necessary treatment; and\n(ii)\nthat the intervention or\nprocedure involved in the research is available only in the context of the\nresearch; and\n(iii)\nthat the\nintervention or procedure involved in the research holds out a prospect of\ndirect benefit that is important to the health or well-being of the\nminor. (ii)\n\nResearch involving no more than minimal\nrisk. (a) If the research involves no more\nthan minimal risk, and a parent or legal guardian is not available, informed\nconsent may be obtained from a party recommended by the IRB and appointed by\nthe facility or entity's governing body (by whatever title known), for the\npurpose of acting as a surrogate in the consent process by giving or\nwithholding consent to participation in a research project, on behalf of a\nminor. (1)\n\nThis party shall have no interest\nthat conflicts with the interest of the minor being represented, and shall have\nknowledge and skills that insure adequate representation of the\nminor. (2)\n\nThe party appointed by\nthe governing body shall not be associated in any way (except in this role or\nas a nonaffiliated member of the IRB) with the research, the researcher(s) or\nthe facility or entity. (b) Standards of certification. (1)\n\nIf the facility has participated or is\nparticipating in a research project in which the researcher accessed clinical\nrecords only, and had no contact with persons in the facility, there is project\nspecific documentation that: (i) The facility\nor entity conducting the research has a Federal or OPWDD approved assurance of\ncompliance with regulations for the protection of human subjects. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner authorized access to\nclinical records. (iii)\n\nThere is a\ncurrent institutional review board approval. (iv)\n\nThere is a current approval from the\nchief executive officer. (2)\n\nIf the facility has participated or is\nparticipating in a research project which involved more than access to clinical\nrecords, there is project specific documentation that: (i) The facility or entity conducting the\nresearch has a Federal or OPWDD approved assurance of compliance with\nregulations for the protection of human subjects. (ii)\n\nThere is a current institutional review\nboard approval. (iii)\n\nThere is a\ncurrent approval from the chief executive officer. (iv)\n\nUnless there is a waiver of informed\nconsent or a waiver of the need to document consent, written informed consent\nwas obtained for each person participating in the research project.
