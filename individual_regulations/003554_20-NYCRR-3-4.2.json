  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-4.2 - Constitutionally protected investment capital\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(5)(e))\n\nIn the case of a corporation incorporated and\ncommercially domiciled outside New York State, the United States Constitution\nprohibits the state from apportioning income or gain from intangible assets\nwhen such income or gain lacks a sufficient connection to activities or\npresence in the state by the corporation. For example, the income or gain from\nan intangible asset (i.e., a debt obligation or other security) is\napportionable where the underlying activities of the recipient of the\nintangible income and the source of the income constitute a unitary business; or where the intangible asset or the income from the intangible asset serves an\noperational function in the taxpayer's business. Whether an intangible asset\nserves an operational function depends on the nature of the asset's use and its\nrelation to the corporation and the corporation's activities in the state. For\nexample, an intangible asset would serve an operational function if the asset\nis held to meet currently identified needs of the business, including, but not\nlimited to, the use of the asset's income stream to pay the business's\noperating expenses or finance the business's functions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n3-4.2\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
