  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-5.8 - Standards for Stream Crossings and Stream Bed Disturbances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following criteria shall apply to all\nstream crossings and stream bed disturbances. (1)\n\nStream crossing, channelization, or\npiping is allowed only for utility crossings, logging roads, public roads\n(including subdivision roads to be accepted), approved private roads, and\ndriveways to access private real property. (2)\n\nSeparate road and utility crossings shall\nnot be approved when the consolidation of the proposed crossings is\nfeasible. (3)\n\nWhen separate road\nand utility crossings are necessary, the preferred methodology for utility\nestablishment shall be by directional boring under the stream bed. (4)\n\nThe number of crossings shall be limited\nto one per site per stream. (5)\n\nWhen culverts or arches are used, they shall be used so as to maintain the\nnatural course and bed of the stream. (6)\n\nCulverts and arches must be sized and\ndesigned in accordance with standard design practices, including allowing for\nsafe passage for wildlife and floodplain flows. (7)\n\nAll stream crossings shall be designed to\nsafely pass the fifty (50)-year, peak storm event. The Commission may require\nadditional design features it determines necessary to prevent a hazard to\ndownstream property and natural resources. (8)\n\nStream crossings shall not impound water\nduring the 10-year storm event. (9)\n\nStream crossing structures shall be designed to span one and one-fourth (1.25)\ntimes the stream bed width. (10)\n\nCulverts shall be embedded twenty-percent (20%) along their entire linear\nlength. (11)\n\nAny stream bed\ndisturbance shall promote the natural shape, slope, and substrate of a\nstream. (12)\n\nAny stream bed\ndisturbance shall be limited to the minimum disturbance necessary. (13)\n\nCreation of land disturbance and\nimpervious areas for driveways and roads shall be limited to a maximum width of\ntwenty (20) feet and thirty (30) feet, respectively. If this standard conflicts\nwith standards at 6 NYCRR\n646-5.7\n(a) (1-3), this provision shall\ncontrol. (14)\n\nCrossings that convey\nwastewater shall be depicted on a survey map prepared and stamped by a\nprofessional surveyor licensed to operate in New York State. The survey map\nshall be filed with the Office of the County Clerk in the county where the\nproperty is located. (15)\n\nNo permit\nshall be issued pursuant to this Subpart unless the Commission first determines\nthat the activity is reasonable and necessary, will not endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, and will not cause damage to downstream\nproperties or the natural resources of the Lake George Park.
