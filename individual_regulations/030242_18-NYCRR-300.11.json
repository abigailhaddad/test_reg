Prior to application\nfor Federal grant funds, the local district shall submit to the department for\napproval a narrative description of such project, specifying the goals of such\nproject, a list containing the departmental rules, regulations, bulletins, procedures and guidelines for which waivers are needed, and a statement\nprojecting the fiscal effects of such project. Upon approval by the department, the local district shall furnish the department with copies of all materials\nand/or correspondence sent to or received from the grant-awarding agency or\nofficer(s) relating to such project. The department may request such additional\nsubmittals as it deems necessary. (2)\n\nLocally initiated projects. When a local\nsocial services district wishes to conduct, sponsor or participate in a\nresearch or demonstration project, such local district shall notify the\ncommissioner of the department, in writing, of its intent to conduct, sponsor\nor participate in such project.

Upon completion of such project, the local district shall furnish the\ndepartment with a final summation of the project, listing its key activities, a\nreport of project results, findings or recommendations, and a statement\nassessing the fiscal effects of such project.
