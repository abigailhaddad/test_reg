  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 4.3 - Crediting dividends on date of deposit-date of withdrawal accounts\n\nState Regulations\nA savings bank inquired whether section\n245\n(3)(b)\nof the Banking Law may fairly be read\nto allow the crediting of dividends on date of deposit-date of withdrawal\n(DOD/DOW) accounts during, rather than after the close of, business on the last\nday of the bank's regular dividend period. The department answered in the affirmative stating that the\nabove interpretation would not be inconsistent with the language of the statute\nor the intent of the Legislature so long as the bank did not view the\ninterpretation as sanctioning grace days on DOD/DOW accounts. The department\nobserved that grace days are not permitted on DOD/DOW accounts, and cautioned\nthe savings bank that if it chose to avail itself of the advantages of this new\ninterpretation, it must be careful not to violate the grace day\nproscription. DATED: September 20, 1968\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n4.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
