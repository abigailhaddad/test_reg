  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 177.3 - Mandatory overtime prohibition\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nlaw, a health care employer shall not require a nurse to work overtime. On-call\ntime shall be considered time spent working for purposes of determining whether\na health care employer has required a nurse to work overtime. No employer may\nuse on-call time as a substitute for mandatory overtime. (b) The following exceptions shall apply to\nthe prohibition against mandatory overtime for nurses: (1)\n\nHealth care disaster. The prohibition\nagainst mandatory overtime shall not apply in the case of a health care\ndisaster, such as a natural or other type of disaster unexpectedly affecting\nthe county in which the nurse is employed or in a contiguous county that\nincreases the need for health care personnel or requires the maintenance of the\nexisting on-duty personnel to maintain staffing levels necessary to provide\nadequate health care coverage. A determination that a health care disaster\nexists shall be made by the health care employer and shall be reasonable under\nthe circumstances. Examples of health care disasters within the meaning of this\n\nPart include unforeseen events involving multiple serious injuries (e.g., fires, auto accidents, a building collapse), chemical spills or releases, a\nwidespread outbreak of an illness requiring hospitalization for many\nindividuals in the community served by the health care employer, or the\noccurrence of a riot, disturbance, or other serious event within an institution\nwhich substantially affects or increases the need for health care\nservices. (2)\n\nGovernment\ndeclaration of emergency. The prohibition against mandatory overtime shall not\napply in the case of a Federal, State or local declaration of emergency in\neffect pursuant to State law or applicable Federal law in the county in which\nthe nurse is employed or in a contiguous county. (3)\n\nPatient care emergency. The prohibition\nagainst mandatory overtime shall not apply in the case of a patient care\nemergency, which shall mean a situation that is unforeseen and could not be\nprudently planned for and, as determined by the health care employer, that\nrequires the continued presence of the nurse to provide safe patient care, subject to the following limitations: (i) Before requiring an on-duty nurse to work beyond his or her regularly scheduled\nwork hours in connection with a patient care emergency, the health care\nemployer shall make a good faith effort to have overtime covered on a voluntary\nbasis or to otherwise secure nurse coverage by utilizing all methods set forth\nin its nurse coverage plan required pursuant to section\n177.4\nof this Part. The health\ncare employer shall document attempts to secure nurse coverage through use of\nphone logs or other records appropriate to this purpose. (ii)\nA patient care emergency cannot be\nestablished in a particular circumstance if that circumstance is the result of\nroutine nurse staffing needs due to typical staffing patterns, typical levels\nof absenteeism, and time off typically approved by the employer for vacation, holidays, sick leave, and personal leave, unless a nurse coverage plan which\nmeets the requirements of section\n177.4\nof this Part is in place, has been fully implemented and utilized, and has failed to produce staffing to\nmeet the particular patient care emergency. Nothing is this provision shall be\nconstrued to limit an employer's right to deny discretionary time off (e.g., vacation time, personal time, etc.) where the employer is contractually or\notherwise legally permitted to do so. (iii)\nA patient care emergency will not\nqualify for an exception to the provisions of this Part if it was caused by the\nhealth care employer's failure to develop or properly and fully implement a\nnurse coverage plan as required under section\n177.4\nof this Part. (4)\n\nOngoing medical or surgical\nprocedure. The prohibition against mandatory overtime shall not apply in the\ncase of an ongoing medical or surgical procedure in which the nurse is actively\nengaged and in which the nurse's continued presence through the completion of\nthe procedure is needed to ensure the health and safety of the patient. Determinations with regard to whether the nurse's continued active engagement\nin the procedure is necessary shall be made by the nursing supervisor or nurse\nmanager supervising such nurse. (c) Nothing in this Part shall prohibit a\nnurse from voluntarily working overtime. A nurse may signify his or her\nwillingness to work overtime by either: (1)\nagreeing to work a particular day or shift as requested; (2)\nagreeing to be placed on a voluntary\novertime list or roster; or\n(3)\nagreeing to prescheduled on-call time pursuant to a collective bargaining\nagreement or other written contract or agreement to work.
