  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 414.9 - Behavior management\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The program must establish and follow a\nwritten plan for behavior management that is acceptable to the office. This\nplan must include how the staff will approach challenging behaviors, help\nchildren solve problems and encourage acceptable behaviors. (b) The staff must use acceptable techniques\nand approaches to help children solve problems. (c) The program must provide copies of the\nbehavior management plan to all staff and parents of children in care at the\nschool age child care program. (d) Behavior management must promote self-esteem in children and guide children in\nsuch a way as to help each child develop self-control and assume responsibility\nfor his or her actions through clear and consistent rules and limits\nappropriate to the ages and development of the children in care. (e) Any discipline used must relate to the\nchild's action and be handled without prolonged delay on the part of the staff\nso that the child is aware of the relationship between his or her actions and\nthe consequences of those actions. (f) Isolating a child in a closet, darkened\narea, or any area where the child cannot be seen and supervised by a staff\nmember is prohibited. (g) Where a\nchild's behavior harms or is likely to result in harm to the child, others or\nproperty, or seriously disrupts or is likely to seriously disrupt group\ninteraction, the child may be separated briefly from the group, but only for as\nlong as is necessary for the child to regain enough self-control to rejoin the\ngroup. The child must be placed in an area where he or she is in the view of, and can be supervised and supported by, a staff member. Interaction between a\nstaff member and the child must take place immediately following the separation\nto guide the child toward appropriate group behavior. Separation of a child\nfrom the group in a manner other than that provided for herein is\nprohibited. (h) Physical restraint\nis prohibited. Physical restraint\nis the act of using force to\nextremely limit a child's body movements for a lengthy period of time. It\ninvolves holding a child against his/her will and putting pressure on the\nchild's chest and/or extremities in an effort to significantly restrict his/her\nmovement, thereby making it extremely difficult for a child to move. It may\nalso involve holding a child flat on the ground and restricting his/her body\nfrom movement. (i) Physical\nintervention is permitted. Physical intervention\nis the act of\nusing bodily contact as a short-term immediate response to prevent children\nfrom incurring substantial or serious injury to themselves or injuring others. It may involve: picking a child up and moving him or her away from danger or\nconflict, holding the child's hands or gently touching the body to direct their\nmovement, rocking a child to soothe them, blocking a child's path when they are\nabout to injure themselves or others or destroy property. This technique allows\nthe child to regain self-control as quickly and safely as possible. A\nconsultation with a child's parent is required if the child is not receptive to\nphysical intervention. (j) Corporal\npunishment is prohibited. For the purposes of this Part, the term\ncorporal punishment\nmeans punishment inflicted directly on the\nbody including, but not limited to, physical restraint, spanking, biting, shaking, slapping, twisting or squeezing; demanding excessive physical\nexercise, prolonged lack of movement or motion, or strenuous or bizarre\npostures; and compelling a child to eat or have in the child's mouth soap, foods, hot spices, irritants or the like. (k) Withholding or using food, or rest as a\npunishment is prohibited. (l) A\nchild may only be disciplined by a director, group teacher or assistant\nteacher. (m) Methods of discipline\nor interaction which frighten, demean or humiliate a child are\nprohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
