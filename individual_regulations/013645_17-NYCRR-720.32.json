(b) Notwithstanding any regulation of the\ndepartment to the contrary, the commissioner may immediately suspend or revoke\nthe authority of any motor carrier of passengers operating pursuant to a\ncertificate or permit issued by the commissioner pursuant to article 6 or\narticle 7 of the Transportation Law if such motor carrier of passengers\noperates concurrently under any authority issued by the United States\n\nDepartment of Transportation, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, and\nsuch Federal operating authority has been revoked or a Federal out of service\norder is in effect, or if such motor carrier of passengers operates\nconcurrently in interstate commerce without the requisite operating\nauthority. (c) The suspension of\noperating authority as provided in subdivision (a) or (b) of this section shall\nbe effective 10 business days after the date of issuance of the notice of\nsuspension.

(e) Service may be made\npersonally or by certified mail, return receipt requested, and a hearing shall\nbe conducted pursuant to the provisions of section\n503.2\nof this Title, except that\nnotice shall be provided in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection.
