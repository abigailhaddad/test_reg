Tit. 15 § 79.9 - Station requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Official inspection station licenses will\nbe issued only to reputable applicants who possess the required\nqualifications. (b) Space. (1)\n\nThe space requirements for official\ninspection stations, by class of station, are as follows: (i) Class 1 station: In a city or village\nhaving a population of less than 10,000, and in an area outside a city or\nvillage, in any county of the State, a minimum enclosed area of 300 square feet\nis required. (ii)\n\nClass 2 station: In a city or village with a population of 10,000 or more, a minimum enclosed\narea of 600 square feet is required. (iii)\n\nClass 3 station: A motorcycle\ninspection station must have a minimum enclosed area of 120 square\nfeet. (2)\n\nWhen\ndetermining the area available to meet space requirements, office space, vehicle display area, supply area, or any unusual obstructions, shall not be\npart of the minimum area available to meet the above requirements. (3)\n-(4) [Reserved]\n(5)\n\nThe enclosed area of any station must be\nlarge enough to accommodate any vehicle in the group or groups which the\nstation is permitted to inspect as indicated on the station's application and\nlicense. For a heavy vehicle inspection station licensed to inspect\nsemi-trailers, this requires a door and service bay height of at least 13 feet, 6 inches and a bay length of at least 50 feet. For a heavy vehicle inspection\nstation not licensed to inspect semi-trailers, this requires a door and service\nbay height of at least 13 feet, 6 inches and a bay length of at least 35\nfeet. (6)\n\nTemporary expedients for\nobtaining additional space or facilities, such as tents, sheds or so-called\ncurb service will not be permitted. (7)\n\nIf after approval, the minimum space\nrequirements are not maintained, inspections may not be performed at that\nstation until the minimum space requirements are again met. Any agents\nappointed by the commissioner are empowered to prevent further inspections by a\nstation for failure to maintain adequate space and to permit inspections to be\nmade again upon compliance with the requirements. (c) Waivers of dimension requirements. (1)\n\nThe commissioner, where such action is\nrequired to provide adequate inspection facilities, may waive the space\nrequirements in any area of the State. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may waive the dimension\nstandards for a fleet or dealer inspection station which inspects only vehicles\nowned or controlled by the fleet or dealer and which fit into the\nstation. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may\nwaive the dimension standards for a public inspection station that was licensed\nprior to January 1, 1990, where there is an undue hardship or such waiver is in\nthe public interest because of a lack of heavy vehicle inspection stations in\nan area. However, no waiver will permit a station to inspect a vehicle which\ncannot fit into its building. (d) Equipment. All equipment and tools\nrequired by this section shall be properly maintained in such a manner that an\ninspection may be conducted in conformity with these regulations. (1)\n\nEach station must have, as a minimum, the\nfollowing equipment, before it will be approved as an official inspection\nstation: (i) a one-hole paper punch that\nproduces a round hole, one-quarter inch in diameter; (ii)\na tire tread depth gauge calibrated in\nthirty-seconds of an inch; and\n(iii)\na tire pressure gauge calibrated in\nlbs./sq. in. (psi). (2)\n\nIn addition to the equipment specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, an\nofficial emissions inspection station or any station required to complete\nadvisory emissions scans as defined in section\n79.24\n(j) of this\n\nPart must also have the appropriate computerized vehicle inspection system\n(CVIS), approved by the Department of Environmental Conservation and the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles, capable of performing OBD II and low enhanced\nemissions inspections. This equipment, which shall be known as the NYVIP CVIS, shall include but not be limited to: (i) computer; (ii)\ncontrolling\nsoftware; (iii)\ncommunications link\nprescribed by DEC and DMV; (iv)\nprinter; (v) a DEC and DMV approved\nOBD II scan tool with appropriate connectors and software; (vi)\nbar code scanner; and\n(vii)\na dedicated phone line for transmission\nof all inspection data if a dial-up system is used, or other equipment as\nprescribed by the equipment vendor if another communications system is used. If\na dial-up system is used, an official emissions inspection station that has\nmore than one CVIS unit must maintain at least one phone line dedicated for use\nby the CVIS; this line may be shared by other CVIS units. No line(s) used by\nCVIS units(s) may be shared by any other equipment. This equipment shall be delivered and installed in official\nemissions inspection stations as directed by the commissioner. (3)\n[Reserved]\n(4)\n\nIn addition to the\nequipment specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, an official diesel\nemissions inspection station must also have the appropriate diesel emissions\ninspection system approved by the Department of Environmental Conservation as\nset forth in 6 NYCRR Part\n217. (5)\n\nIn addition to the equipment specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, official heavy vehicle inspection stations must also have: (i) a measuring device for brake adjustment, such as a steel scale or ruler or equivalent; (ii)\na one-sixteenth inch feeler gauge or\nequivalent; (iii)\na brake drum\ngauge or equivalent, capable of measuring up to a 24-inch drum; and\n(iv)\na rotor thickness gauge, such as a disc\nbrake micrometer with a range from one inch to two inches, or\nequivalent. (6)\n\nOfficial\nemissions inspection stations must maintain their printers so that reports and\nother required documents print legibly and clearly. (7)\n[Reserved]\n(8)\n\nIf, after approval, the equipment\nrequirements are not maintained, inspections may not be performed at that\nstation until the equipment requirements are again met. An automotive\nfacilities inspector and any other agent appointed by the commissioner are\nempowered to prevent further inspections by a station for failure to maintain\nadequate equipment and to permit inspections to be made again upon compliance\nwith the equipment requirements. (9)\n\nIn addition to the equipment specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, an\nofficial inspection station licensed to per form a safety inspection of any\nvehicle in group 1a or group 2a must also hav e a tint meter to measure the\nvisible light transmittance through immovable glass. (e) Waivers of equipment requirements. (1)\n[Reserved]\n(2)\n\nAny licensed official heavy vehicle fleet\ninspection station is exempted from the requirement to have a brake drum gauge\ncapable of measuring up to a 24-inch drum, if there are no vehicles in that\nparticular fleet that are equipped with brake drums of that size. The station\nis required to have and maintain a brake drum gauge capable of measuring the\nlargest brake drums found in that particular fleet of vehicles at any time. If\na vehicle is added to the fleet that is equipped with larger brake drums, the\nstation must immediately acquire and maintain a brake drum gauge capable of\nmeasuring the larger brake drums. (3)\n\nAny licensed official heavy vehicle fleet\ninspection station is exempted from the requirement to have a rotor thickness\ngauge, if there are no vehicles in that particular fleet that are equipped with\ndisc brakes. However, if a vehicle is added to the fleet that is equipped with\ndisc brakes, the station must immediately acquire and maintain a rotor\nthickness gauge. (f) Personnel.

(3)\n\nAn automotive facilities inspector or any\nother agent appointed by the commissioner is authorized to test certified motor\nvehicle inspectors for competency where reasonable grounds exist to believe\nthat the inspector is incompetent in conducting inspections of vehicles. If an\ninspector fails to pass such test, such inspector will be deemed incompetent, and will not be permitted to conduct further inspections until a subsequent\nspecial written examination authorized by the commissioner is passed. If the\ncertified motor vehicle inspector fails the special written examination, the\ncommissioner shall revoke the inspector's certificate. The certified motor\nvehicle inspector's certificate may be reinstated when the inspector\ncertification training program is successfully completed and the written\nexamination of such program is passed. (4)\n\nAn automotive facilities inspector or any\nother agents appointed by the commissioner are empowered to prevent further\ninspections by an inspector deemed incompetent and to permit inspections to be\nmade again by such a person upon reinstatement of the certificate or upon\nissuance of a new certificate after revocation.
