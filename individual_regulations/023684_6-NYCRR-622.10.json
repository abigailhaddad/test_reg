Tit. 6 § 622.10 - Conduct of the proceeding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Order of events at the hearing.'\n(1)\n\nBefore any evidence is offered, department staff and then respondent may make an opening statement. (2)\n\nThe ALJ will determine the order in which\nparties present evidence but will generally require the party with the burden\nof proof to present its case first. Department staff may present a rebuttal\ncase with respect to any affirmative defenses presented by respondent. At the\ndiscretion of the ALJ, rebuttal cases may be allowed in other\nsituations. (3)\n\nEach witness will\nfirst be questioned by the party calling the witness (direct examination) and\nthen examined by the opposing party (cross examination). These examinations may\nbe followed by re-direct and re-cross examinations. (4)\n\nThe ALJ will determine the sequence in\nwhich the issues will be tried and otherwise regulate the conduct of the\nhearing in order to achieve a speedy and fair disposition of the matters at\nissue. (5)\n\nAt the conclusion of the\nevidentiary hearing, the ALJ may give the parties an opportunity to make\nclosing statements or to file briefs. (6)\nA hearing will be conducted as nearly as\npracticable in the manner of a civil judicial proceeding. (b) 'The ALJ.'\n(1)\n\nIn proceedings pursuant to this Part, the\nALJ has the power to: (i) rule upon motions\nand requests, including those that decide the ultimate merits of the\nproceeding; (ii)\nset the time and\nthe place of hearing, recesses and adjournments; (iii)\nadminister oaths and\naffirmations; (iv)\nissue subpoenas\nupon request of a party not represented by an attorney admitted to practice in\n\nNew York State; (v) upon the\nrequest of a party, issue a subpoena duces tecum to be served upon a library, other department or bureau of a municipal corporation or of the State, or an\nofficer thereof, requiring the production of any books, papers or other\nthings; (vi)\nupon the request of a\nparty, issue, quash and modify subpoenas except that in the case of a non-party\nwitness the ALJ may quash or modify a subpoena regardless of whether or not a\nparty has so requested; (vii)\nsummon and examine witnesses; (viii)\nadmit or exclude evidence including\nthe exclusion of evidence on grounds of privilege or confidentiality; (ix)\nallow oral argument, so long as it is\nrecorded; (x) hear and determine\nargument on facts and law; (xi)\ndo\nall acts and take all measures necessary for the maintenance of order and\nefficient conduct of the proceeding; (xii)\ndirect the convening of any conference\nrequired for administrative efficiency; (xiii)\npreclude irrelevant, immaterial or\nunduly repetitious, tangential or speculative evidence, argument, examination\nor cross-examination; (xiv)\nissue\norders limiting the length of cross-examination, the form, length and content\nof motions and briefs, and similar matters; and\n(xv)\nexercise any other authority available\nto ALJs under this Part or presiding officers under SAPA Article 3. (2)\n\nImpartiality of the ALJ and\nmotions for recusal: (i) The ALJ will conduct\nthe proceeding in a fair and impartial manner. (ii)\n\nAn ALJ must not be assigned to any\nproceeding in which the ALJ has a personal interest. (iii)\n\nAny party may file with the ALJ a\nmotion in conformance with section\n622.6\nof this Part, together with\nsupporting affidavits, requesting that the ALJ be recused on the basis of\npersonal bias or other good cause. Such motions will be determined as part of\nthe record of the proceeding. (iv)\n\nUpon being notified that an ALJ declines or fails to serve, or in the case of\nthe ALJ's death, illness, resignation, retirement, removal or recusal, the\n\nChief ALJ must designate a successor within thirty (30) days of being\nnotified. (3)\n\nThe\ndesignation of an ALJ as the commissioner's representative must be in writing\nand filed in the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services. (c) 'Appearances.'\n(1)\nA party may appear in person or by an\nattorney or other authorized representative. (2)\n\nAny person appearing on behalf of a party\nin a representative capacity may be required by the ALJ to show and state on\nthe record the person's authority to act in such capacity and to file a notice\nof appearance with the ALJ. (3)\n\nIf\nthere is a change or withdrawal of a party's attorney or authorized\nrepresentative, the party must provide notice of the change or withdrawal to\nthe ALJ and the attorneys or authorized representatives of all other parties, or, if a party appears without an attorney or authorized representative, to the\nparty within ten (10) days of the change or withdrawal. (d) 'Appeals of ALJ rulings.'\n(1)\n\nAny ruling of an ALJ may be appealed to\nthe commissioner after the completion of all testimony as part of a party's\nfinal brief or by notice of appeal and appeal where no final brief has been\nauthorized. The notice of appeal and appeal must be served on all parties and\nfiled with the commissioner c/o the deputy commissioner for hearings and\nmediation services within ten (10) days of receipt of written notice that the\nhearing record is closed pursuant to subdivision\n622.17\n(d) of this\n\nPart. Responses to a notice of appeal and appeal must be served on all parties\nand filed with the commissioner c/o the deputy commissioner for hearings and\nmediation services within five (5) days of receipt of the notice of appeal. One\noriginal and three copies of the notice of appeal, appeal and responsive papers\nmust be filed with the commissioner c/o the deputy commissioner for hearings\nand mediation services. (2)\n\nDuring\nthe course of the proceeding, in conformance with subdivision\n622.6\n(e) of this\n\nPart, the following rulings may be appealed to the commissioner on an\ninterlocutory basis: (i) any ruling in which\nthe ALJ has denied a motion for recusal. (ii)\nany other ruling of the ALJ by seeking\npermission to file an interlocutory appeal, upon a demonstration that the\nfailure to decide such an appeal on an interlocutory basis would be unduly\nprejudicial to one of the parties, or would result in significant inefficiency\nin the hearing process. In all such cases, the commissioner's determination to\nentertain the appeal on an interlocutory basis is discretionary. (3)\nA motion for permission to\nfile an interlocutory appeal must demonstrate that the ruling in question falls\nwithin the criteria set forth in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nThe commissioner\nmay review any ruling of the ALJ on an interlocutory basis upon the\ncommissioner's own initiative or upon a determination by the ALJ that the\nruling should be appealed. (5)\n\nWhenever the commissioner grants permission to file an interlocutory appeal, the parties must be notified. The appellant must be provided the opportunity to\nfile a brief on appeal and the other parties must be provided with the\nopportunity to file a response to the appeal. (6)\n\nFailure to file an interlocutory appeal\nor the denial of permission to file an interlocutory appeal will not preclude\nan appeal from the ruling to the commissioner after the hearing. (7)\n\nThe hearing will not be adjourned while\nan appeal is pending except by permission of the ALJ or the\ncommissioner. (e) 'Consolidation and severance.'\n(1)\n\nIn\nproceedings that involve common questions of fact, the Chief ALJ upon the Chief\nALJ's own initiative or upon motion of any party, may order a consolidation of\nproceedings or a joint hearing of any or all issues. (2)\n\nThe ALJ, upon the ALJ's own initiative or\nupon request of any party, in order to avoid prejudice or to achieve\nadministrative efficiency, may order a severance of the hearing and hear\nseparately any issue or any party to the proceeding. (f) 'Intervention.'\n(1)\n\nAt any time after the commencement of a\nproceeding, the commissioner or the ALJ, upon receipt of a petition verified\nconsistent with CPLR 3020 in writing and for good cause shown, may permit a\nperson to intervene as a party. (2)\n\nThe petition of any person desiring to intervene as a party must state: (i) the petitioner's interest in the matters\ninvolved; (ii)\nthe nature of the\nevidence petitioner intends to present; (iii)\nthe nature of the argument petitioner\nintends to make; and\n(iv)\nany other\nreason that the petitioner should be allowed to intervene. (3)\n\nIntervention will only be granted upon a\nshowing of a reasonable likelihood that the petitioner's private rights would\nbe substantially adversely affected by the relief requested, and that those\nrights cannot be adequately represented by the parties to the\nhearing. (g) 'Adjournment.' After a date has been set for the hearing, adjournments will be\ngranted only for good cause and with the permission of the ALJ. A request for\nan adjournment prior to the commencement of the hearing must be in writing and\nmust be filed with the ALJ and served on all parties prior to the hearing. Adjournments must specify the time, day and place when the hearing will resume\nor specify the time and day on which the parties will advise the ALJ of the\nstatus of the proceeding.
