  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 70.9 - Physicians and surgeons medical malpractice insurance policy provisions for the period commencing July 1, 1988: required endorsement; established rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to section 40 of chapter 266 of the Laws of 1986, the superintendent was directed to establish rates for policies providing coverage for physicians and surgeons medical malpractice liability insurance for the periods commencing July 1, 1985 and ending June 30, 1988. It was not certain at that time whether the authority of the superintendent to establish such rates would be extended for the policy year commencing July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 or if the rates for such period would revert to the prior approval requirements of article 23 of the Insurance Law. Accordingly, all insurers that issue policies of physicians and surgeons medical malpractice liability insurance, as defined in section\n70.1\n(a) of this Part, and all insurers with special licenses under section\n6302\nof the Insurance Law that issue policies including such coverage of physicians and surgeons, were directed to forthwith furnish their insureds with the following endorsement in connection with all such policies in effect on and after July 1, 1988: \"THE PREMIUMS ON THIS POLICY FOR THE PERIOD OF COVERAGE COMMENCING ON OR AFTER JULY 1, 1988 THROUGH JUNE 30, 1989 ARE PROVISIONAL AND SUBJECT TO UPWARD OR DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT. INSUREDS MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY AN AMENDED PREMIUM RETROACTIVE TO JULY 1, 1988, OR THE ANNIVERSARY DATE OF THE POLICY, WHICHEVER IS LATER OR BE ENTITLED TO A CREDIT IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MEET STATUTORY RATING STANDARDS.\"\n(b) Pursuant to section 19 of chapter 184 of the Laws of 1988, the superintendent is directed to establish rates for policies providing coverage for physicians medical malpractice liability insurance for the periods commencing July 1, 1988 and ending June 30, 1991. The rates established herein for policies issued or renewed during the year July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989 supersede any rates that may have been charged or billed by insurers for such policies prior to the promulgation of this Part. (c) Rates for occurrence policies issued or renewed during the period July 1, 1988 through June 30, 1989. (1)\n\nFor primary coverage, up to $1 million/$3 million, the rate shall be five percent greater than that established pursuant to section\n70.8\n(e)(3)(i)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, and purchased directly by a physician, the rate shall be 46 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nFor a first excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, and purchased by a hospital in accordance with section 18 of chapter 184 of the Laws of 1988, the rate shall be 49.3 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in paragraphs (1) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nFor a second excess layer providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above the underlying primary coverage and first layer of excess coverage, described in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, the rate shall be 30 percent of the $1 million/$3 million rate for primary coverage established in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (d) Claims-made primary and excess coverage rates. (1)\n\nClaims-made primary coverage rates. The claims-made rate for a particular primary coverage policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate claims-made factor, as follows: Year in claims-made program\n\nClaims-made factor\n\nFirst: 31%\nSecond: 64%\nThird: 85%\nFourth: 94%\nFifth: 99%\nSixth: 102%\nSeventh: 104%\n(2)\n\nOptional extended reporting period (tail) primary coverage rates. (i) The rate for optional tail coverage that is required to be offered for a particular claims-made primary coverage policy shall be the corresponding occurrence rate multiplied by the appropriate tail factor, as follows: Number of years completed in claims-made program\n\nTail factor\n\nOne: 74.8%\nTwo: 122.1%\nThree: 146.4%\nFour: 162.4%\nFive: 173.3%\nSix: 181.0%\nSeven: 186.7%\n(ii)\n\nFor a policy terminated on a date other than the policy anniversary date, the tail factor shall be obtained by interpolating, on a daily basis, between the tail factors applicable to the last and next policy anniversaries. (iii)\n\nFor any policy that was written at a reduced rate because the insured was eligible for a new doctor discount, the tail premium shall be reduced by the percentage that the current year's rate (exclusive of any surplus contributions) was reduced as a result of such new doctor discount. (3)\n\nRates for claims-made and tail excess coverage policies purchased by hospitals. The aggregate rate for a claims-made excess coverage policy and its simultaneously issued tail (as mandated by this subdivision) purchased by a general hospital on behalf of a physician, shall be equal to the corresponding occurrence excess coverage rate. (4)\n\nRates for claims-made and tail excess coverage policies purchased by physicians directly. The rates for the claims-made and tail first and second excess layers required to be offered when purchased directly by a physician, and the rates for any other claims-made and tail excess layer other than as specified herein, shall be established by the superintendent after a review of proposed rates and supporting documents to be submitted by each insurer writing, or required to write, such coverage, in accordance with paragraph (h)(2) of this section. The superintendent shall consider such submissions, as well as any other relevant factors, and will thereafter establish a rate for each such excess layer. (e) Excess coverage-types of policies; required tail. (1)\n\nPursuant to section 18 of chapter 184 of the Laws of 1988, excess coverage policies providing $1 million/$3 million of excess coverage above $1 million/$3 million primary coverage, purchased by general hospitals on behalf of physicians, shall provide such coverage for occurrences between July 1, 1988 and June 30, 1989. Accordingly, all physicians medical malpractice liability insurers which issue such an excess policy on a claims-made basis shall simultaneously issue full tail coverage.

Support for this number must be attached to this submission........ 11)\n\nThe value discounted to June 30 of the losses and loss adjustment expenses on line 10 must be included. Support for this number must be attached to this submission............................................................................................................... 12)\n\nCalculate this line as follows: (12) = (9) - (11)\n13)\n\nThis line should be the sum of line (2) (total only) for all previous fiscal year reports for this policy year including this report............................................................................................................... 14)\n\nCalculate this line as follows: (14) = [ - 1 × (12)/(13)]\n15)\n\nThe surcharge account balance reported on line 20 of the previous fiscal year's submission for this same policy year should be included here.

Insurers are not permitted to remove surcharge income from the surcharge account until the account balance falls below $1,000,000. The amount of surcharge income removed must be such that the account balance does not exceed $1,500,000 as of June 30 of any fiscal year............................................................................................................... 18)\n\nCalculate this line as follows: (18) = (15) + (16) - (17). 19)\n\nCalculate this line as follows: (19) = [(8)(i)\ni.e., rate of return] × [(15) + (18)]/2\n20)\n\nCalculate this line as follows: (20) = (18) + (19)\n\nSpecial instructions for calculating capital gains or losses: Both realized and unrealized capital gains and losses incurred during the fiscal year must be included. The insurer may opt to calculate the capital gains and losses by using an average of the total gains and losses as a percentage of cash and invested assets over the most recent 10 fiscal years. This percentage is then to be applied to the current fiscal year's cash and invested assets in order to calculate the total capital gains to be applied to the current fiscal year. This option must be exercised on the first report or it is forfeited. Once exercised this averaging procedure must be used on all subsequent reports submitted by the insurer for the stabilized rate years. This option may only be exercised with the permission of the Superintendent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
