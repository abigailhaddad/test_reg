  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 561.6 - Preliminary certification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If, due to the circumstances of delivery, it is not possible to issue a\ncomplete certification of tax payment in accordance with section\n561.5\nof this Part at the time of delivery, the Department of Taxation and Finance, upon application, may authorize the use of a preliminary certification. An\nexample of where such authorization may be granted is the circumstance where\nmotor fuel is sold through a terminal operated by a third person at which the\nseller has no agents or employees and the information necessary for a complete\ncertification is not available. The authorization to issue a preliminary\ncertification must be received from the Department of Taxation and Finance, and\nan application for authorization to issue preliminary certifications must\ncontain a detailed description of the applicant's method of operation, including where motor fuel is stored, the method of withdrawal from storage and\nwhy it is not possible to issue complete certifications of tax payment at the\ntime of delivery. If the applicant is not a registered distributor under\narticle 12-A of the Tax Law, the application must also contain a list of the\napplicant's suppliers and the names of the distributors who will be remitting\nthe tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance. A seller authorized to issue\npreliminary certifications who is not a registered distributor must notify the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance of any changes in its suppliers or in the\nnames of the distributors who will be remitting the tax to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance within five days of any such changes. Failure to do so\nresults in revocation of the authorization to issue preliminary certifications. Preliminary certifications may be issued only under those circumstances and for\nthose locations for which authorization is expressly granted by the Department\nof Taxation and Finance. (b) The\nauthority to issue preliminary certifications is subject to review and the\nauthorization may be revoked at any time by the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. In addition, the authority of a registered distributor to issue\npreliminary certifications is immediately and automatically revoked upon\ncancellation of the distributor's registration. In order to continue to issue\ncertifications in such instance, the person must submit a new application as a\nnondistributor. (c) A preliminary\ncertification must be signed by the seller or its authorized representative. If\nthe seller is a registered motor fuel distributor under article 12-A of the Tax\n\nLaw no signature is required. The preliminary certification may be furnished by\neither of two methods: (1)\n\nThe seller may\nprovide its customer with the following statement prior to delivery of motor\nfuel covering any and all deliveries for which a preliminary certification is\nauthorized during a particular month: (Seller) certifies that both the New York State motor fuel\ntax and prepaid sales tax required to be paid on any fuel sold to (purchaser)\nhave been paid or have been assumed and will be paid by the seller or were\npassed through to the seller by his supplier. In addition, (seller) certifies\nthat his current authorization to issue preliminary certifications, which is\nherewith provided to you or has previously been provided to you, has not been\nrevoked and is currently in effect. (Seller) also certifies that the amounts of\nthese taxes will be stated to you within 10 business days of any delivery and\nin a form acceptable to the New York State Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. This statement must contain the names of the seller and the\npurchaser and the month and year covered by the statement. The statement must\nbe renewed every month. (2)\n\nAlternatively, the seller may incorporate the following statement in its bill\nof lading, loading ticket, delivery receipt, or other shipping document given\nto the purchaser at the time of delivery of the motor fuel: (Seller) certifies that both the New York State motor fuel\ntax and prepaid sales tax required to be paid for the motor fuel shown on this\ndocument have been paid or have been assumed and will be paid by the seller or\nwere passed through to the seller by his supplier. In addition, (seller)\ncertifies that his current authorization to issue preliminary certifications, which is herewith provided to you or has previously been provided to you has\nnot been revoked and is currently in effect. (Seller) also certifies that the\namounts of these taxes will be stated to the purchaser within 10 business days\nof this delivery and in a form acceptable to the New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance. (d) The preliminary certification, if it is\naccepted in good faith, will, until delivery of the complete certification or\nfor 10 business days, whichever is sooner, relieve the purchaser of liability\nfor payment of the prepaid sales tax and the motor fuel taxes. In the event a\npreliminary certification is used, the seller must furnish the purchaser with a\ncomplete certification of tax payment within 10 business days of the delivery\nof the motor fuel. If the purchaser does not receive a properly completed\ncertification of tax payment within such 10 business days, it may no longer\navail itself of the protection of the preliminary certification. Accordingly, such purchaser is subject to personal liability for the payment of the motor\nfuel and prepaid sales taxes. Additionally, if a purchaser does not receive a\nproperly completed certification of tax payment from a seller within 10\nbusiness days, it may not thereafter avail itself of the protection of any\npreliminary certifications issued by such seller. (e) As a condition to constitute acceptance\nof a preliminary certification in good faith from a seller, the purchaser must\nhave received from the seller at or prior to the time of receipt of the\npreliminary certification a copy of the seller's letter of authorization from\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance, then currently in effect, to issue a\npreliminary certification.
