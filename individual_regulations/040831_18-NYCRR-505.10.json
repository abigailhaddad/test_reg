(d) Prior\nauthorization. (1)\n\nGenerally, prior\nauthorization must be obtained before transportation expenses are incurred. Prior authorization is not required for emergency ambulance transportation or\n\nMedicare approved transportation by an ambulance service provided to an MA\nrecipient who is also eligible for Medicare part B payments. If transportation\nservices are provided in accordance with paragraph (e)(7) of this section, the\nindividualized education program or interim or final individualized family\nservices plan of an MA recipient will qualify as the prior authorization\nrequired by this subdivision. (2)\n\nRequests for prior authorization may be made by the MA recipient, his or her\nrepresentative, or an ordering practitioner. (3)\n\nThe recipient, his or her representative, or ordering practitioner must make the request in the manner required by the\nprior authorization official and the department. (4)\n\nIn instances when the MA recipient's\ncondition requires transportation by a method other than the least expensive\nmethod available in the geographic area, the MA recipient's ordering\npractitioner must complete and submit to the prior authorization official a\nwritten form verifying MA transportation abilities as specified by the\ndepartment and published by the prior authorization official. (5)\n\nIn instances when the MA recipient's\ncondition requires MA covered specialized medical care or services that are not\navailable within the MA recipient's common medical marketing area, the MA\nrecipient's ordering practitioner must complete and submit to the prior\nauthorization official a written form for transportation outside the common\nmedical marketing area as specified by the department and published by the\nprior authorization official. If additional information is necessary, the prior\nauthorization official may also require the submission of a letter of medical\nnecessity from the ordering practitioner before making a determination to\napprove or deny transportation. (6)\n\nOrdering practitioners shall complete and submit all required forms and letters\nat no cost to the MA recipient, the department, or the prior authorization\nofficial. (7)\nA request for prior\nauthorization for nonemergency ambulance transportation must be supported by\nthe written order of an ordering practitioner who is the MA recipient's\nattending physician, physician's assistant or nurse practitioner. (8)\nA request for prior authorization for\ntransportation by ambulette or paratransit vehicle must be supported by the\nwritten order of an ordering practitioner who is the MA recipient's attending\nphysician, physician's assistant, nurse practitioner, dentist, optometrist, podiatrist or other type of medical practitioner approved by the\ndepartment. (9)\nA diagnostic and\ntreatment center, hospital, nursing home, intermediate care facility, longterm\nhome health care program, or home and community-based services waiver program, or managed care program may submit an order for ambulette or nonemergency\nambulance transportation services on behalf of the ordering\npractitioner. (10)\n\nEach prior\nauthorization official must inform recipients of MA of the need for prior\nauthorization in order for transportation expenses to be paid under the MA\nprogram and of the procedures for obtaining such prior authorization. (11)\n\nThe prior authorization official may\napprove or deny a request for prior authorization or require the ordering\npractitioner to submit additional information before the request is approved or\ndenied. (12)\n\nThe prior\nauthorization official must use the following criteria in determining whether\nto authorize payment of transportation expenses in accordance with this\nsubdivision: (i) when the MA recipient can be\ntransported to necessary medical care or services by use of private vehicle or\nby means of mass transportation which are used by the MA recipient for the\nusual activities of daily living, prior authorization for payment for\nambulette, TNC, taxi or livery services may be denied; (ii)\nwhen the MA recipient needs multiple\nvisits or treatments within a short period of time and the MA recipient would\nsuffer undue financial hardship if required to make payment for the\ntransportation to such visits or treatments, prior authorization for payment\nfor such transportation expenses may be approved for a means of transportation\nordinarily used by the MA recipient for the usual activities of daily\nliving; (iii)\nwhen the nature and\nseverity of the MA recipient's illness necessitates a mode of transportation\nother than that ordinarily used by the MA recipient, prior authorization for\nsuch a mode of transportation may be approved; (iv)\nwhen the geographic locations of the MA\nrecipient and the provider of medical care and services are such that the usual\nmode of transportation is inappropriate, prior authorization for another mode\nof transportation may be approved; (v) when the distance to be traveled\nnecessitates a large transportation expense and undue financial hardship to the\nMA recipient, prior authorization for payment for the MA recipient's usual mode\nof transportation may be approved; (vi)\nwhen the medical care and services\nneeded are available within the common medical marketing area of the MA\nrecipient's community, prior authorization for payment of transportation\nexpenses to such medical care and services outside the common medical marketing\narea may be denied; (vii)\nwhen the\nneed to continue a regimen of medical care or service with a specific provider\nnecessitates travel which is outside the MA recipient's common medical\nmarketing area, notwithstanding the fact that the medical care or service is\navailable within the common medical marketing area, prior authorization for\npayment of transportation expenses to such medical care and services outside\nthe common medical marketing area may be approved; and\n(viii)\nwhen there are any other circumstances\nwhich are unique to the MA recipient and which the prior authorization official\ndetermines have an effect on the need for payment of transportation expenses, prior authorization for payment for such transportation expenses may be\napproved. (e) Payment. (1)\n\nPayment for transportation\nexpenses will be made only when transportation expenses have been prior\nauthorized except for emergency ambulance transportation or Medicare approved\ntransportation by an ambulance service provided to an MA recipient who is also\neligible for Medicare part B payments or in other instances determined by the\ndepartment, such as during a declared state of emergency. (2)\n\nPayment for transportation expenses will\nbe made only to the vendor of transportation services, to the MA recipient or\nto an individual providing transportation services on behalf of the MA\nrecipient. (3)\n\nPayment will be made\nonly for the least expensive available mode of transportation suitable to the\nMA recipient's needs, as determined by the prior authorization\nofficial.

(7)\n\nPayment is available for\ntransportation services provided in order for the recipient to receive an MA\ncovered service if the recipient receives such service (other than\ntransportation services) at school or off of the school premises and both the\ncovered service and transportation service are included in the recipient's\nindividualized education plan. Payment is available for transportation services\nprovided in order for the recipient, or the recipient's family member or\nsignificant other to receive an MA covered service if both the covered service\nand transportation service are included in the recipient's interim or final\nindividualized family services plan.
