  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-4.2 - General operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Spill and overfill prevention\n(1)\n\nLabelling requirements. Containers must\nbe labeled to identify: (i) the chemical name\n(or common name if the chemical name is not appropriate) of the substance\nstored; (ii)\nthe volume of the\nhazardous substance being stored; and\n(iii)\nhazards associated with the storage of\nthe hazardous substance in the container; (2)\n\nDelivery to containers. (i) Responsibility for transfers. The\noperator, when on the premises or when in control of a hazardous substance\ntransfer, is responsible for transfer activities. If the operator is not on the\npremises and is not in control of a hazardous substance transfer, the carrier\nis responsible for transfer activities. The requirements of subparagraphs (ii)\nthrough (viii) of this paragraph apply to the person responsible for the\ntransfer activities. The operator or carrier must employ practices for\npreventing transfer spills, overfills, and releases. (ii)\n\nImmediately prior to the transfer, the\noperator/carrier must determine that the hazardous substance will be\ntransferred to the proper container, that the receiving container has available\ncapacity to receive the hazardous substance amount to be transferred, and that\nall container valving and flow control devices are in the appropriate position\nto accept delivery. All couplings and other connections must be inspected to\nensure that they are leak free, undamaged, and fully functional. During and\nafter the transfer, all couplings and other connections must be monitored for\nleaks. (iii)\n\nBrakes must be set and\nwheels chocked on all rail cars before and during loading and\nunloading. (iv)\n\nWhen a truck, rail\ncar, or container is connected to a transfer line, caution signs must be in\nplace to give warning to persons approaching from any potential direction. Signs must remain in place until operations are completed, all connections are\nremoved, and outlets properly closed. (v) During the entire transfer, and while the\ncontainer is connected to the loading or unloading device, the operator/carrier\nmust always supervise, monitor, and control the transfer to prevent overfilling\nand spilling. The operator/carrier must be trained in the proper transfer\nprocedures and must take immediate action to stop the transfer of the hazardous\nsubstance when the working capacity is reached, or if an equipment failure or\nemergency occurs. (vi)\n\nDuring the\ntransfer of a hazardous substance with a flash point below 100 degrees\n\nFahrenheit (37.8 degrees Celsius) or wherever flammable vapors may be present, all potential ignition sources must be controlled. Sources of ignition include\nopen flames, lightning, smoking, cutting, welding, hot surfaces, friction, heat, sparks from static, electrical or mechanical sources, spontaneous\nignition, chemical and physical-chemical reactions, and radiant heat. (vii)\n\nConnections to a container at a\ntransfer station must be sufficiently flexible so that any movement will not\ndamage the connection or cause a leak. Examples of flexible connections include\nhoses and swing arms. (viii)\n\nEquipment or practices that prevent the mixing of incompatible substances must\nbe in-place. This must include mating of couplings to prevent mixing, written\nsite procedures that prevent delivery of a substance to the wrong tank and\nwhich prohibit transfer of incompatible substances at the same time within the\nsame transfer station, or equivalent practices. Any written procedures\ndeveloped pursuant to this paragraph, must be specified in the spill prevention\nreport required by section 1.9 of this Part. (b) Inventory records. Inventory records must\nbe kept for all containers stored at the facility. Such records must include\nthe number of containers and the contents of each. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n598-4.2\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register July 19, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 29, eff. 10/17/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
