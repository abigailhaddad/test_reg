  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.4 - Increased services or facilities, substantial rehabilitation, major capital or other improvements\n\nState Regulations\n\nExcept with regard to an adjustment pursuant to paragraph\n(a)(2) of this section, for which the approval of the administrator shall not\nbe required, the administrator may grant an appropriate adjustment of a maximum\nrent where he finds that: (a) Individual Apartment Improvements. (1)\n\nIncrease in space, new equipment, new furniture or furnishings; and other\nadjustments. (2)\n\nAn owner is\nentitled to a temporary rent increase where there has been a reasonable and\nverifiable modification, other than an increase for which an adjustment may be\nclaimed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, of dwelling space, installation of new equipment or improvements, or new furniture or furnishings, provided in or to the tenant's housing accommodation, where the tenant has\nagreed to such modification or increase and the owner has obtained written\ninformed tenant consent to such rent increase. In the case of vacant housing\naccommodations, tenant consent shall not be required. (i) For all work that commenced on or after\n\nJune 14, 2019, notification of all modifications must be submitted to DHCR for\nverification. As a part of such verification, an owner shall: (a) Provide a copy of the written informed\ntenant consent on an approved DHCR form, when tenant consent is\nrequired. (b) Provide the DHCR with\nan itemized list of work performed, including a description and/or explanation\nof the reason or purpose for such work. (c) Provide the DHCR with photographs of the\nsubject apartment where the work will be completed taken prior to such\nmodification or increase as well as photographs taken after, and showing, the\nwork has been completed. Such photographs must be kept as part of the owner's\npermanent records such that the owner must at any future time produce such\nphotographs upon request by an agency with appropriate jurisdiction. (d) Use a licensed contractor to complete\nsuch work. The costs for an individual apartment improvement paid to a person\nor organization contracted to do the improvement or installation work sharing a\ncommon ownership with the owner or managing agent of the subject building or\napartment will be disallowed. (e) Resolve, within the dwelling space, all outstanding hazardous and immediately\nhazardous violations. In no event shall an owner be permitted to begin\ncollection of any rent increase pursuant to this subdivision while there are\nany hazardous or immediately hazardous violations of the Uniform Fire\n\nPrevention and Building Code (Uniform Code), New York City Fire Code, or New\n\nYork City Building and Housing Maintenance Codes pending against the affected\nhousing accommodation. (ii)\n\nFor work commenced on or after June 14, 2019, the recoverable costs incurred by the owner pursuant to this subdivision\nshall be limited to a total aggregate cost of fifteen thousand dollars\n($15,000) that may be expended on no more than three (3) separate individual\napartment improvements in any fifteen (15) year period. (iii)\n\nAn owner who is entitled to a rent\nincrease pursuant to this subdivision shall not be entitled to a further rent\nincrease based upon the installation of similar equipment, or new furniture or\nfurnishings within the useful life of such new equipment, or new furniture or\nfurnishings. (iv)\n\nAny increases to\nthe maximum rent pursuant to this subdivision shall be temporary and shall be\nremoved from maximum rent thirty (30) years from the date the increase became\neffective inclusive of any increases granted by the applicable Rent Guidelines\n\nBoard that had been calculated based upon such rent increase. (v) For individual apartment improvements\npursuant to this subdivision, the DHCR shall maintain an itemized list of work\nperformed and a description or explanation of the reason or purpose of such\nwork, inclusive of photographic evidence documenting the condition prior to and\nafter the completion of the performed work. Such documentation and any other\nsupporting documentation shall be submitted to the DHCR by the owner within\nninety (90) days of the completion of the work, retained in a centralized\nelectronic retention system and made available in cases pertaining to the\nadjustment of maximum rents. (vi)\n\nWhere an owner seeks a temporary individual apartment improvement rent increase\npursuant to this subdivision while the unit is occupied, the DHCR shall provide\na form for use by the owner, to obtain written informed consent from the tenant\nthat shall include the estimated total cost of the improvement and the\nestimated monthly rent increase. Such form shall be completed and submitted to\nthe DHCR by the owner within 90 days of the completion of the work and\npreserved in a centralized electronic retention system. Nothing herein shall\nrelieve an owner, lessor, or agent thereof of his or her duty to retain proper\ndocumentation of all improvements performed or any rent increases resulting\nfrom said improvements. (vii)\n\nFor\nrent increases pursuant to this subdivision that took effect prior to June 14, 2019, the increase in the monthly maximum rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this subdivision shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be 1/40th of the\ntotal cost, including installation but excluding finance charges; and for\nbuildings and complexes containing more than 35 housing accommodations be\n1/60th of the total cost, including installation but excluding finance\ncharges. (viii)\n\nFor temporary rent\nincreases pursuant to this subdivision effective as of or after June 14, 2019, the temporary increase in the monthly maximum rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this subdivision shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be 1/168th of the\ntotal cost, including the cost of installation but excluding finance charges; and for buildings and complexes containing more than 35 housing accommodations\nbe 1/180th of the total cost, including the cost of installation but excluding\nfinance charges. (b) there has been, since March 1, 1959, an\nincrease in the rental value of the housing accommodations as a result of a\nsubstantial rehabilitation of the building or housing accommodations therein\nwhich materially adds to the value of the property or appreciably prolongs its\nlife, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacements; or\n(c) Temporary major capital improvement rent\nadjustments. (1)\n\nAn owner of a building or\nbuilding complex that contains more than thirty-five (35) percent rent\nregulated units may file an application to temporarily increase the maximum\nrents of the building or building complex on forms prescribed by the DHCR which\nincludes an itemized list of work performed and a description or explanation of\nthe reason or purpose of such work, on one or more of the following grounds: (i) There has been a major capital\nimprovement, including an installation, which must meet all of the following\ncriteria: (a) it is deemed depreciable under\nthe Internal Revenue Code, other than for ordinary repairs; (b) it is essential for the preservation, energy efficiency, functionality or infrastructure of the entire building, including heating, windows, plumbing and roofing, but shall not be for\noperational costs or unnecessary cosmetic improvements; (c) it is an improvement to the building or\nto the building complex which inures directly or indirectly to the benefit of\nall tenants, and which includes the same work performed in all similar\ncomponents of the building or building complex, unless the owner can\nsatisfactorily demonstrate to the DHCR that certain of such similar components\ndid not require improvement; and\n(d) the item being replaced meets the\nrequirements set forth on the following useful life schedule, except with DHCR\napproval of a waiver, as set forth in clause (e) of this subparagraph.

(e) (1)\n\nAn\nowner who wishes to request a waiver of the useful life requirement set forth\nin clause (d) of this subparagraph must apply to the DHCR for such waiver prior\nto the commencement of the work for which he or she will be seeking a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rental increase. Notwithstanding this requirement, where the waiver requested is for an item being replaced because of an\nemergency, which causes the building or any part thereof to be dangerous to\nhuman life and safety or detrimental to health, an owner may apply to the DHCR\nfor such waiver at the time he or she submits the temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase application. (2)\n\nIf the waiver is denied, the owner will\nnot be eligible for a temporary major capital improvement increase. However, if\nthe waiver is granted, the useful life requirement will not be a factor in the\ndetermination of eligibility for the temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease. Approval of the waiver does not assure that the application will be\ngranted, as all other requirements set forth in this subdivision must be\nmet. (3)\n\nAn owner may apply for, and the DHCR may grant, a waiver of the useful life requirements set forth in\nthe Useful Life Schedule, if the owner satisfactorily demonstrates the\nexistence of one or more of the following circumstances: (i) The item or equipment cannot be repaired\nand must be replaced during its useful life because of a fire, vandalism or\nother emergency, or \"act of God\" resulting in an emergency; (ii)\n\nThe item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced because such item or equipment is beyond repair, or spare parts are no\nlonger available, or required repairs would cost more than seventy-five (75)\npercent of the cost of the total replacement of the item or equipment. Certification by a duly licensed engineer or architect, where there is no\ncommon ownership or other financial interest with the owner, shall be\nconsidered substantial proof of such condition(s). The owner may also be\nrequired to submit proof that the item or equipment was properly maintained. Such proof may include receipts for repairs and parts or maintenance\nlogs; (iii)\n(A)\n\nAn appropriate New York State or local\ngovernmental agency has determined that the item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced as part of a government housing program; (B)\n\nIf a governmental lender or insurer, for\nthe purposes of qualifying for a New York State or local government long-term\nloan or insured loan, requires the remaining useful life of the building or\nbuilding complex, as well as the component parts of such building or building\ncomplex, to be as great as or greater than the term of the loan\nagreement. (iv)\n\nThe\nreplacement of an item or equipment which has proven inadequate, through no\nfault of the owner, is necessary, provided that there has been no major capital\nimprovement rent increase for that item or equipment being replaced. (4)\n\nIn the event that the DHCR\ndetermines that an installation qualifies for a waiver of the useful life\nrequirements, the DHCR may, subject to all other requirements of this section, and the limitations of the reasonable cost schedule provisions in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision: (i) Where no previous\nincrease was granted within the useful life of the item or equipment being\nreplaced, approve one-hundred (100) percent of the actual, reasonable, and\nverifiable cost of the item or equipment, including installation; (ii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced during its useful life, grant a temporary increase\nbased on the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of the item or equipment, including installation, less both (a) the amount reimbursed from other sources, such as insurance proceeds or any other form of commercial guarantee, and (b)\nthe amount of any increase previously granted for the same item or equipment\neither as a major capital improvement, or pursuant to other governmental\nprograms, if such item or equipment has not exhausted at least seventy-five\n(75) percent of its useful life at the time of the installation; (iii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced even though it has not exhausted seventy-five (75)\npercent of its useful life and that it was installed as part of a substantial\nrehabilitation or the new construction of a building for which the owner set\ninitial building-wide rents, the DHCR may reduce the increase granted for a\nmajor capital improvement by a proportion of the remaining useful life of such\nitem or equipment. (iv)\n\nWhere it is\ndetermined that an item is eligible to be replaced even though it has not\nexhausted one-hundred (100) percent of its useful life, but has exhausted more\nthan seventy-five (75) percent of its useful life, the DHCR may reduce the\nincrease granted for a major capital improvement by a proportion of the\nremaining useful life of such item or equipment. (f) In no event shall a temporary\nmajor capital improvement increase be granted for work done in individual\napartments that is otherwise not an improvement to an entire\nbuilding. (ii)\n\nThere has\nbeen other necessary work performed in connection with, and directly related to\na major capital improvement, which may be included in the computation of an\nincrease in the maximum rent only if such other necessary work was completed\nwithin a reasonable time after the completion of the major capital improvement\nto which it relates. Such other necessary work must: (a) improve, restore or preserve the quality\nof the structure and the grounds; (b) have been completed subsequent to, or\ncontemporaneously with, the completion of the work for the major capital\nimprovement; and\n(c) not be for\nprimarily cosmetic improvements or for operational costs. (iii)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there has\nbeen an increase in services or improvement, other than repairs, on a\nbuilding-wide basis, which the owner can demonstrate are necessary in order to\ncomply with a specific requirement of law. (iv)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there have\nbeen other improvements made or services provided to the building or building\ncomplex, other than those specified in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this\nparagraph, with the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of at least\nseventy-five (75) percent of the rent regulated housing\naccommodations. (2)\n\nMajor Capital Improvement Schedules\n(i) The\nreasonable costs that may be recovered for qualified major capital improvements\nmay not exceed the recoverable costs, as determined by DHCR. In making such\ndetermination, DHCR shall, unless for good cause shown or otherwise specified, refer to such reasonable costs as specified in the Reasonable Cost Schedule\nfound in the Reasonable Cost Schedule that is in effect at the time that the\ncontract for work for the major capital improvement was executed. (ii)\n\nThe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall\nprovide the recoverable cost of major capital improvements that fall within the\nfollowing main three categories: 1. Major\n\nSystems; i. The maximum recoverable costs\nshall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Plumbing; (b) Gas Re-pipe; (c) Wiring; (d) Windows; (e) Boiler/Burner; (f) Hot Water Heater; (g) Elevator Replacement; and\n(h) Elevator Modernization. 2. Fa'ade, Parapet, Roof; i. The maximum recoverable costs shall\nbe presented for the following classes of work: (a) Fa'ade; (b) Parapet; and\n(c) Roof. 3. Other Systems. i. The maximum recoverable costs shall be\npresented for the following classes of work: (a) Chimney; (b) Doors; (c) Security System; and\n(d) Intercom; and may include such other\nsystems as DHCR may determine. (iii)\n\nEach class of major capital improvement\nmay list more detailed types of capital improvement work. Each class of major\ncapital improvement described in the Schedule may be inclusive of additional\ncosts that can be associated with the type of improvements listed within such\nclass. (iv)\n\nThe costs of each type\nof major capital improvement work will be listed as per unit, per unit of\nmeasurement or per piece of equipment, as is appropriate given the nature of\nthe improvement. (v) The maximum\nrecoverable costs for each type of major capital improvement specified in the\ninitial Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be based on a survey of such\nconstruction costs undertaken for such installation. (a) The maximum recoverable costs listed in\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be initially published and made available\nfor public review and comment in conjunction with the promulgation process\nrequired for adoption of this regulation. (vi)\n\nPeriodic Review of Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule: Every year after adoption of this regulation, DHCR shall\nassess and review the categories of major capital improvements, the classes of\nwork within categories eligible for major capital improvements and the maximum\nrecoverable costs listed for the types of major capital improvement costs\nidentified in the Reasonable Cost Schedule. (vii)\n\nProcedure: (a) When applying for a temporary major\ncapital improvement rent increase, owners are required to submit an itemized\nlist of work performed with a description or explanation of the reason or\npurpose of such work. (1)\n\nCosts may be\ngranted for related expenses that are not specified in the actual schedule, if\nthey are found to be: (i) within or below the\nmaximum costs for the class of work, (ii)\nare necessary for the claimed\nimprovement, and\n(iii)\neligible for\nreimbursement as a major capital improvement. (2)\n\nCosts will not be granted for expenses\nwhich are ineligible for major capital improvement rent increases. (3)\n\nOnly the actual and verifiable amounts\nexpended by owners for qualifying major capital improvement costs will be the\nbasis for any temporary major capital improvement rent increase. Qualifying\nowners will, therefore, be awarded a temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease on the lesser of either: (i) the\nactual amount expended, or\n(ii)\nthe\nmaximum reasonable cost from the schedule, and such other additional items that\nare eligible as a major capital improvement but are not listed as part of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (b) The schedule provides a maximum of costs\nthat can be granted for eligible major capital improvements. All costs granted\nfor a temporary major capital improvement rent increase must be actual, reasonable, verifiable, and meet all other regulatory requirements. (viii)\n\nWaiver of Application of\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule\n(a) Owners may apply\nfor a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. The waiver request\nwill be denied, unless the owner satisfies the waiver requirements provided\nherein, and the Division finds the waiver of the application of the schedule to\nbe reasonable and warranted under the circumstances set forth in such\napplication. (b) If an owner's\napplication for a waiver of the reasonable cost schedule is denied, the owner's\nmaximum recoupment shall be limited to that required by the applicable\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (c) Notwithstanding any waiver of the reasonable cost schedule, not all costs\nclaimed for a temporary major capital improvement rent increase may be awarded, as the costs of items claimed may be disallowed, in whole or in part, pursuant\nto all other requirements set forth in this section that must be met and fully\nsupported. (d) Pursuant to the\nrequirements specified below, such application must be fully supported and\ndemonstrate that the claimed costs underlying the temporary MCI rent increase\nare: (1)\nnot identified in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule, or\n(2)\nnecessarily and\nappropriately priced higher than those costs listed in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule due to the unique nature of the installation and the circumstances\nsurrounding such installation, and such costs are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under these\ncircumstances, or\n(3)\nthat use of\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule will cause an undue hardship and the use of\nalternative procedures are appropriate to the interests of the owner, the\ntenants, and the public, and the costs of such improvement are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under the\ncircumstances. (e) Owners must request a waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule in\nwriting and accompany the application with the information and documentation as\nspecified in subparagraph (x) of this paragraph. (ix)\n\nRequirements for Waiver under Specific\n\nCircumstances\n(a) At the time of the initial\napplication for a temporary major capital improvement rent increase, an owner\nmust apply for a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. Such application shall include all necessary requirements\nset forth in subparagraph (viii) of this paragraph and must also meet the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nNon-Landmarked Buildings (Buildings not designated by the Landmark Commission): (i) A licensed engineer or architect must\ncertify that: (A)\nthe major capital\nimprovement costs for which an owner seeks a temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase are accurate and reasonable under the circumstances; and\n(B)\nthere is no common\nownership or other financial interest between the contractor installing the\nreplacement or upgrade and the ownership entity of the owner; and\n(C)\na bid process was conducted and\nsupervised by a licensed architect or engineer. (2)\n\nLandmarked Buildings (Buildings\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission): The costs beyond those permitted by the reasonable cost\nschedule that were the result of any law, regulation, rule, or requirement\nunder which the premises have been designated a landmark building. (3)\n\nCapital Improvement Work\n\nPerformed While Also Under Another Governmental Agency's Supervision: DHCR may also accept the cost of contract where: (i) the building is subject to both (a) the\n\nRent Stabilization Law, and (b) another housing program, and\n(ii)\nthe contract is approved by or awarded\nunder the supervision of a state, city or local housing entity in conjunction\nwith that affordable housing program, and\n(iii)\nsuch supervision includes a process by\nwhich such supervising agency reviews the costs to assure they are\nreasonable. (4)\n\nEmergency Capital Improvements: DHCR may also accept the cost of contract where capital\nimprovements were performed to remedy an emergency condition and for which the\nowner paid more than the reasonable costs due to such emergency. The costs must\nbe actual, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase\nunder the circumstances. (5)\n\nInterim Rules: (i) An owner may apply for a waiver of\napplication of the Reasonable Cost Schedule if, prior to the effective date of\nthis subparagraph (ix), it has either: (A)\nentered a contract for the performance of major capital improvement work within\ntwo years immediately preceding January 27, 2021, the final adoption date of\n\nEmergency Regulation HCR 26-20-00012, or\n(B)\nsubmitted to DHCR an application for a\ntemporary major capital improvement rent increase. (ii)\n\nThe recoverable costs will be determined\naccording to the applicable Reasonable Cost Schedule and these provisions, but\nthe owner need not submit evidence of compliance with the bidding requirements\nset forth in clause (b) of subparagraph (x); owner may instead submit for\nreview alternative means of establishing the reasonableness of the major\ncapital improvement costs sought to be recovered. (iii)\n\nFor pending major capital improvement\napplications, an owner was required to make this waiver application within 60\ndays of June 16, 2020, unless in the context of processing the major capital\nimprovement application the owner was directed by DHCR to submit an application\nfor waiver. (x) Waiver Procedure: As part of the written Waiver application for\nnon-emergency capital improvements, owners must submit the following: (a) A certification by a licensed architect\nor engineer stating that: (1)\n\nThe purchases\nand contracts, whose costs owner seeks to recover have been awarded on the\nbasis of analysis and bidding to the fullest extent possible, but with no less\nthan three bidders having been solicited to perform the work unless the owner\ncan demonstrate that the work is so highly specialized that such bids cannot be\nextended; (2)\n\nList of items for\nwhich owner solicited bids were necessary; (3)\n\nThe costs claimed by owner for the major\ncapital improvement work are accurate and reasonable, provided that the\narchitect or engineer's basis for such conclusion is fully and credibly\nsupported; (4)\n\nAll changes to the\noriginal agreed upon scope of work were necessary to the underlying major\ncapital improvement and reasonably priced; (5)\n\nThe owner selected the lowest responsible\nbidder or the bidder best suited to perform the major capital improvement work, provided that the architect or engineer's basis for such conclusion is credibly\nsupported; and\n(6)\n\nSuch other and\nadditional proof as DHCR may require to ascertain the need for the waiver and\nthe certification of such reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible\ncosts. (b) Certification\nby owner that it has complied with bid process requirements including\nsubmission of: (1)\n\nTabulation of all bids\nreceived; and\n(2)\n\nCopies of all\nbids received; and\n(3)\nA\ncertification by each bidder disclosing whether the owner or any board member, general partner, officer or employee of owner, and/or principal or employee of\nany managing agent retained by owner, has a direct or indirect interest in the\nbidder or in the compensation to be received by the bidder pursuant to the\nproposed contract. Failure to accurately and fully complete this certification\nmay result in the rejection of the bid for purposes of determining owner's\napplication for waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule, as well as\nrejection and a dismissal of the major capital improvement application; and\n(4)\n\nDetailed description of the\nitems for which owner initially solicited bids. (c) A certification by the owner's architect\nor engineer certifying the necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of\nthe costs of all changes to the original agreed upon scope of work that were\nperformed in connection with the major capital improvement, along with a\ndescription of the changes in the scope, price, or time of completion of the\nwork related to each change order. (xi)\n\nFor Emergency Capital Improvement MCI\nApplications: The owner must submit a statement from an independent\nengineer or architect describing the emergency, why the costs were greater than\nthose in the schedule, that the costs were reasonable for the situation, and\nwhy the owner could not obtain three bids in a timely manner due to the exigent\ncircumstances. (xii)\n\nNotice: As part of the MCI application process, any request by an\nowner for a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be made\navailable to the tenants of the subject building(s) with an opportunity to\ncomment on and contest the waiver. (xiii)\n\nOperational Bulletin\n\nThe initial Operational Bulletin 2020-1 including all\namendments, shall be issued pursuant to this paragraph. The Operational\n\nBulletin 2020-1 and all amended versions shall be available in hardcopy form at\n92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and will be available on\nDHCR's website at\nwww.hcr.ny.gov.

For increases\npursuant to subparagraphs (1) (iii) and (iv) of this subdivision, in the\ndiscretion of the DHCR, an appropriate charge may be imposed in lieu of an\namortization charge when an amortization charge is insignificant or\ninappropriate. (5)\n(i) A temporary major capital improvement\nincrease is fixed to the unit and such increase shall be collectible\nprospectively on the first day of the first month beginning sixty (60) days\nfrom the date of mailing notice of approval to the tenant. Such notice shall\ndisclose the total monthly increase in rent and the first month in which the\ntenant would be required to pay the temporary increase. An approval for a\ntemporary major capital improvement increase shall not include retroactive\npayments. (ii)\n\nThe temporary major\ncapital improvement increase is added to the maximum rent as a temporary\nincrease and will be removed from the maximum rent thirty (30) years from the\ndate the increase became effective inclusive of any increases granted by the\nlocal rent guidelines board. The DHCR shall issue a notice to the owner and all\nthe tenants sixty (60) days prior to the end of the temporary major capital\nimprovement increase and shall include the initial approved increase and the\ntotal amount to be removed from the maximum rent inclusive of any increases\ngranted by the applicable rent guidelines board as referenced by section\n2202.1\nof this Title. (iii)\n\nSuch temporary increases shall not be\ncollectible during the term of a lease then in effect, unless a specific\nprovision in the tenant's lease authorizes an increase during its term pursuant\nto an order issued by the DHCR. (iv)\n\nThe collection of such temporary\nincreases shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of\nthe order granting the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of\ngross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum to be\nspread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as established or\nset in future years. In no event shall more than one two-percent increase in\nthe maximum rent pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision be collected in\nthe same year, provided, however, that upon a vacancy, the owner may\ntemporarily increase the rent to the full temporary major capital improvement\nincrease amount. (v) In addition, for any rent increases due to any major capital improvements approved on or\nafter June 16, 2012 and before June 16, 2019, an owner may not collect more\nthan two percent in any year from any tenant in occupancy on the date the major\ncapital improvement was approved, provided the tenant has entered into a\nrenewal lease commencing on or after June 14, 2019, or is or was entitled to\nreceive a renewal lease on or after such date. In such event, the adjusted\nlimit on collectability shall take effect on the first anniversary of the date\non which the increase became collectible to occur after such lease\nrenewal. (vi)\n\nAn increase pursuant\nto paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be collectible from a tenant to\nwhom there has been issued a currently valid senior citizen or disability rent\nincrease exemption pursuant to section 26-509 of the Administrative Code of the\n\nCity of New York, to the extent such increase causes the maximum rent of the\nhousing accommodation to exceed one third of the aggregate disposable income of\nall members of the household residing in the housing accommodation. (6)\n\nThe determination of the\nappropriate adjustment of a maximum rent shall take into consideration all\nfactors bearing on the equities involved, subject to the general limitation\nthat the adjustment can be put into effect without dislocation and hardship\ninconsistent with the purposes of the RSL, and including as a factor a return\nof the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost to the owner, limited to the\nreasonable cost schedule in paragraph (2) of this subdivision and exclusive of\ninterest or other carrying charges, and the increase in the rental value of the\nhousing accommodations. (7)\nDHCR\nmay issue, upon an owner application, an advisory prior opinion pursuant to\nsection\n2209.8\nof this Title, as to whether\nthe proposed work qualifies for an increase in the maximum rent. (8)\n\nNo increase pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall be granted by the DHCR, unless an application is filed\nno later than two years after the completion of the installation or improvement\nunless the applicant can demonstrate that the application could not be made\nwithin two years due to delay, beyond the applicant's control, in obtaining\nrequired governmental approvals for which the applicant has applied within such\ntwo-year period. (9)\n\nAn increase\nfor an improvement made pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not\nbe granted by the DHCR to the extent that, after a plan for the conversion of a\nbuilding to cooperative or condominium ownership is declared effective, such\nimprovement is paid for out of the cash reserve fund of the cooperative\ncorporation or condominium association. However, where prior to the issuance of\nan order granting the increase, the funds taken from the reserve fund are\nreturned to it by the sponsor or holder of unsold shares or units or through a\nspecial assessment of all shareholders or unit owners, the increase may be\nbased upon the actual, reasonable and verifiable cost of the improvement. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent an owner from applying for, and the\nDHCR from granting, an increase for such improvement to the extent that the\ncost thereof is otherwise paid for by an owner. (10)\n\nAny temporary major capital improvement\nincrease granted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be reduced\nby an amount equal to (i) any governmental grant received by the landlord, where such grant compensates the landlord for any improvements required by a\ncity, state or federal government, an agency or any granting governmental\nentity to be expended for improvements and (ii) any insurance payment received\nby the landlord where such insurance payment compensates the landlord for any\npart of the costs of the improvements. Low interest loans or repayable\nsubsidies shall not be considered grants for the purposes of this\nparagraph. (11)\n\nRent adjustments\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be allocated as follows: The DHCR shall determine the dollar amount of the monthly rent adjustment. Such\ndollar amount shall be divided by the total number of rooms in the building. The amount so derived shall then be added to the rent chargeable to each\nhousing accommodation in accordance with the number of rooms contained in such\nhousing accommodation. (12)\n\nWhen\ndetermining the adjustment of maximum rents pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, where the subject building contains commercial rental space in\naddition to residential rental space, and the DHCR determines that such\ncommercial space benefits from the improvement, DHCR shall allocate the\napproved costs between the commercial rental space and the residential rental\nspace based upon the relative square feet of each rental area. (13)\n\nThe DHCR shall not grant an owner's\napplication for a rental adjustment pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, in whole or in part, if after review by DHCR, it is determined\nthat the owner is not maintaining all required building wide services, or that\nthere are outstanding hazardous, immediately hazardous, or other similar\nviolations of any municipal, county, State or Federal law, including the\n\nUniform Fire Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code), New York City Fire\n\nCode, or New York City Building and Housing Maintenance Codes. Certain tenant\ncaused violations may be excepted. A tenant's repeated failure to provide\naccess to remediate a violation may result in the violation being considered to\nbe tenant caused. (i) An owner application, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, may be rejected if it is\ndetermined that there are one or more unresolved applicable violations. A\nrejected application may be refiled within sixty (60) days which shall stay the\ntwo-year filing requirement provided in paragraph (8) of this subdivision and\npreserve the original filing date. In the absence of good cause shown, a\nrejected application that is refiled outside of the sixty (60) day period will\nnot retain the original filing date. (ii)\nA timely refiled application pursuant to\nparagraph 13(i) of this subdivision, that has not addressed the outstanding\nviolations placed against the building or has had new violations placed against\nthe building in the interim period since rejection, will again be denied\nwithout leave to refile within sixty (60) days. (iii)\n\nPrior to the issuance of a\ndetermination, the DHCR shall review and determine if one or more violations\nhave been issued and not corrected to the subject building during the\nprocessing of an owner application pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. The owner will be allowed sixty (60) days to correct such\nviolation(s). In the absence of good cause shown, failure to correct the\nviolation(s) within the allotted time shall result in a denial of the\napplication. (iv)\nDHCR shall retain\nthe ability and right where appropriate to all penalties and violations at any\nother time during the pendency of such application. (14)\n\nIn the case of an improvement\nconstituting a moderate rehabilitation as defined in section 5-02 of title 28\nof the Rules of the City of New York, an owner may elect that the total cost\nfor such improvement be deemed to be the amount certified by the Office of Tax\n\nIncentive Programs of HPD in the certificate of eligibility and reasonable cost\nissued by such office with respect to such improvement. Such election shall be\nbinding on the DHCR and shall waive any claim for a rent increase by reason of\nany difference between the total cash paid by the owner and such lesser\ncertified amount. (15)\n\nWhere an\napplication for a temporary major capital improvement rent increase has been\nfiled, a tenant shall have sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of a notice\nof a proceeding in which to answer or reply. The DHCR shall provide any\nresponding tenant with the reasons for the DHCR's approval or denial of such\napplication. (16)\n\nWhere during the\nprocessing of a rent increase application filed pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, tenants interpose answers complaining of defective operation\nof the major capital improvement, the complaint may be resolved in the\nfollowing manner: (i) Where municipal\nsign-offs (other than building permits) are required for the approval of the\ninstallation, and the tenants' complaints relate to the subject matter of the\nsign-off, the complaints may be resolved on the basis of the sign-off, and the\ntenants referred to the approving governmental agency for whatever action such\nagency may deem appropriate. (ii)\n\nWhere municipal sign-offs are not required, or where the alleged defective\noperation of the major capital improvement does not relate to the subject\nmatter of the sign-off, the complaint may be resolved by the affidavit of an\nindependent licensed architect or engineer that the condition complained of was\ninvestigated and found not to have existed, or if found to have existed, was\ncorrected. Such affidavit, which shall be served by the DHCR on the tenants, will raise a rebuttable presumption that the major capital improvement is\nproperly operative. Tenants may only rebut this presumption based on persuasive\nevidence, for example, a counter affidavit by an independent licensed architect\nor engineer, or an affirmation by 51 percent of the complaining tenants. (a) General requirements. There must be no\ncommon ownership, or other financial interest, between such architect or\nengineer and the owner or tenants. The affidavit shall state that there is no\nsuch relationship or other financial interest. The affidavit must also contain\na statement that the architect or engineer did not engage in the performance of\nany work, other than the investigation, relating to the conditions that are the\nsubject of the affidavit. The affidavit submitted must contain the signature\nand professional stamp of the architect or engineer. DHCR may conduct follow-up\ninspections randomly to ensure that the affidavits accurately indicate the\ncondition of the premises. Any person or party who submits a false statement\nshall be subject to all penalties provided by law. (iii)\n\nAt the discretion of the DHCR, the DHCR\nmay inspect the major capital improvement to determine whether the installation\nwas conducted in a workmanlike manner or the work was sufficiently\ncomprehensive so as to benefit all tenants. (17)\n\nThe DHCR shall annually inspect and\naudit no less than twenty-five percent of applications for a temporary major\ncapital improvement increase that have been submitted and approved. Such\nprocess shall include individual inspections and document review to ensure that\nowners complied with all obligations and responsibilities under the law for\ntemporary major capital improvement increases. Inspections shall include\nin-person confirmation that such improvements have been completed in such way\nas described in the application. (d) there has been, since March 1, 1959, in\nstructures containing more than four housing accommodations, other improvements\nmade with the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of at least 75\npercent of the housing accommodations; provided, however, that whenever the\nadministrator has determined that the improvements proposed are part of a plan\ndesigned for overall improvement of the premises or increases in services, the\nadministrator may order increases in maximum rents for all housing\naccommodations affected upon the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of\nat least 51 percent of the housing accommodations; and provided further, however, that no adjustment granted under this paragraph shall exceed 15\npercent unless the tenants have agreed to a higher percentage of increase, as\nherein provided; and\n(e) the\nlandlord has incurred, since January 1, 1970, in connection with and in\naddition to a concurrent major capital improvement, other expenditures to\nimprove, restore or preserve the quality of the structure. An adjustment\npursuant to this section shall be granted by the administrator only if such\nimprovements represent an expenditure equal to at least 10 percent of the total\noperating and maintenance expenses for the most recent full calendar year or\nthe landlord's most recent fiscal year, or any 12 consecutive months ending not\nmore than 90 days prior to the filing of the application for an increase\npursuant to this subdivision. The adjustment pursuant to this subdivision shall\nbe in addition to any adjustment granted for the concurrent major capital\nimprovement, and shall be in an amount sufficient to amortize the cost of the\nimprovements pursuant to this subdivision over a seven-year period.
