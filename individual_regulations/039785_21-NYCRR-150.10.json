The sale shall be at public auction after\ngiving 10 days'notice of such proposed sale conspicuously posted at two public\nplaces in the city or town where such object, article, float or sunken thing is\nfound unless before the time of such sale the owner thereof appears and claims\nsame and pays to the Canal Corporation the cost and expense which it has\nincurred in connection with the seizure, removal and proposed sale. The owner\nthereof shall be liable for the cost and expense of such seizure, removal and\nsale of the said object, article, float or sunken thing, which cost and expense\nmay be recovered by the Canal Corporation in an appropriate action or\nproceeding brought in the name of the Canal Corporation in any court of\ncompetent jurisdiction. The avails of such sale shall be accounted for by the\n\nCanal Corporation which may, on the application of the owner and upon due proof\nof ownership, pay over such proceeds to the owner after deducting all costs, expenses and reasonable charges of the seizure, removal and sale thereof. Whenever, in the opinion of the Canal Corporation, the navigation or operation\nof any part of the canal system is interrupted or endangered, the Canal\n\nCorporation may cause to be cut up, destroyed or otherwise removed, any object, article, float or sunken thing in or partly in the waters of the canal system\nwhich may, in its judgment, be causing such interruption or damage. The Canal\n\nCorporation may enter into an agreement with the owner or owners of any\nproperty so cut up, destroyed or otherwise removed, covering the amount of\ndamage sustained. Such agreement shall become an obligation of the Canal\n\nCorporation and paid from moneys available therefor. In case no agreement is\nconsummated, the amount of damages sustained may be determined as provided in\nsection\n120\nof the Canal\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
