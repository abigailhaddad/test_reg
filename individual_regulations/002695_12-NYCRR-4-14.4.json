  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-14.4 - Installation requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Expansion and contraction. Provision shall be made for the expansion and contraction\nof steam mains connected to boilers by providing substantial anchorage at\nsuitable points, so that there shall be no undue strain transmitted to the\nboiler. (b) Feedwater. When feedwater or makeup water is introduced from a\npressure line, it shall be connected to the piping system and not directly to\nthe boiler. Feedwater shall not be introduced through the opening or\nconnections used for the relief valve, the water column, or the water gage\nglass. (c) Fluid-relief columns. All hot water heating systems shall be so installed that\nthere will be no opportunity for the fluid-relief column to freeze or to be\naccidentally shut off. (d) Expansion tanks. If a hot water heating system is equipped with an open\nexpansion tank, an indoor overflow from the upper portion of the expansion tank\nmust be provided in addition to an open vent, the indoor overflow to be carried\nwithin the building to a suitable plumbing fixture or to the basement. If the\nsystem is of the closed type, an airtight tank or other suitable air cushion\nmust be installed that will be consistent with the volume and capacity of the\nsystem. Provision must be made for draining the tank without emptying the\nsystem. (e) Return\npipe stop valves. Where a stop valve is used in the supply pipe connection\nof a single boiler, there shall be one used in the return pipe connection\nunless a proper return loop is provided. (f) Stop valve requirements. A stop valve shall be used in each supply and return pipe\nconnection of two or more boilers connected to a common system. Provision shall\nbe made for cleaning the interior of the return piping at or close to the\nboiler. When stop valves over two inches in size are used, they shall be the\noutside-screw-and-yoke rising-spindle type, or of such type as to indicate at a\ndistance by the position of the spindle or other operating mechanism whether it\nis closed or open, and the wheel may be carried either on the yoke or attached\nto the spindle. If the valve is of the plug cock type, it must be fitted with a\nslow-opening mechanism and an indicating device, and the plug must be held in\nplace by a guard or gland. When stop valves are used, they shall be properly\ndesignated substantially as indicated by the following tags of metal or other\ndurable material fastened to them: Supply Valve-Number ()\n\nReturn Valve-Number ()\n\nDo Not Close Without Also\n\nDo Not Close Without Also\n\nClosing Return Valve-\nClosing Supply Valve-\nNumber ()\n\nNumber ()\n(g) Connections for safety\nvalves. The area of the openings shall be at least equal to the\naggregate area based on the nominal diameters of all the safety valves with\nwhich it connects. A screwed connection may be used for attaching a safety\nvalve. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-14.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
