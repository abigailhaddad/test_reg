(b) The records access\nofficer shall accept requests for records submitted in the form of electronic\nmail and shall respond to such requests by electronic mail, provided that the\nwritten requests do not seek a response in some other form. (c) A request shall reasonably describe the\nrecord or records sought. Whenever possible, a person requesting records should\nsupply information regarding dates, file designations or other information that\nmay help to describe the records sought. (d) If agency records are maintained on the\ninternet, the requester shall be informed that the records are accessible via\nthe internet and in printed form either on paper or other information storage\nmedium. (e) A response shall be\ngiven within five business days of receipt of a request by: (1)\ninforming the requester that the request\nor portion of the request does not reasonably describe the records sought, including direction, to the extent possible, that would enable the requester to\nrequest records reasonably described; (2)\ngranting or denying access to records in\nwhole or in part; (3)\nacknowledging\nthe receipt of a request in writing, including an approximate date when the\nrequest will be granted or denied in whole or in part, which shall be\nreasonable under the circumstances of the request and shall not be more than 20\nbusiness days after the date of the acknowledgment, or if it is known that\ncircumstances prevent disclosure within 20 business days from the date of such\nacknowledgment, providing a statement in writing indicating the reason for\ninability to grant the request within that time and a date certain, within a\nreasonable period under the circumstances of the request, when the request will\nbe granted in whole or in part; or\n(4)\nif the receipt of request was\nacknowledged in writing and included an approximate date when the request would\nbe granted in whole or in part within 20 business days of such acknowledgment, but circumstances prevent disclosure within that time, providing a statement in\nwriting within 20 business days of such acknowledgment specifying the reason\nfor the inability to do so and a date certain, within a reasonable period under\nthe circumstances of the request, when the request will be granted in whole or\nin part. (f) In\ndetermining a reasonable time for granting or denying a request under the\ncircumstances of a request, records access officers shall consider the volume\nof a request, the ease or difficulty in locating, retrieving or generating\nrecords, the complexity of the request, the need to review records to determine\nthe extent to which they must be disclosed, the number of requests received by\nthe campus or system administration, and similar factors that bear on the\nability to grant access to records promptly and within a reasonable\ntime. (g) Failure by the records\naccess officer to comply with the time limitations described herein shall\nconstitute a denial of access. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
