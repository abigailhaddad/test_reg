Tit. 21 § 1004.6 - Debarment Determination and Ratification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After consideration of the defenses\nraised by the contractor, and after the hearing is completed, the panel shall\nmake a recommendation as to whether all of the facts and circumstances\nreasonably justify debarment. (b) The panel's determination shall be by majority vote and set forth in writing. If the debarment determination is that the contractor shall be debarred, the\npanel shall recommend that the term of the contractor's debarment shall be five\nyears from the date of the ratification of the debarment determination. The\npanel may, in its discretion, also seek to debar any of the following related\nentities or individuals: (i) if the panel\nfinds that the contractor was created as a single or limited purpose entity to\nexecute and perform the contract which is the subject of the debarment hearing; or\n(ii)\nif the panel finds a\nmaterial and knowing causal connection between such entity or individual and\nthe ground for the contractor's debarment: (1)\nthe contractor's parent(s), subsidiaries\nand affiliates; (2)\nany joint\nventure (including its individual members) and any other form of partnership\n(including its individual members) that includes a contractor or a contractor's\nparent(s), subsidiaries, or affiliates of a contractor, (3)\na contractor's directors, officers, principals, managerial employees, and any person or entity with a ten percent\nor more interest in a contractor; (4)\nany legal entity controlled, or ten\npercent or more of which is owned or controlled, by a contractor, or by any\ndirector, officer, principal, managerial employee of contractor, or by any\nperson or entity with a 10 percent or greater interest in contractor, including\nwithout limitation any new entity created after the date of the notice of\nintent to debar. If the panel seeks to debar any such related entity or\nindividual, it shall issue a written notice of intent to debar to each such\nentity or individual and provide each a reasonable opportunity to be heard on\nthe issue of whether they had a material and knowing causal connection to the\nconduct and circumstances underlying the contractor's debarment. (c) The panel's\ndetermination to debar any contractor and any related entity or individual\nshall be timely submitted to the board of the Authority for ratification. The\nboard of the Authority shall review such determination and either: (i) ratify the determination or, (ii)\nremit the determination to the panel for\nfurther consideration of facts or circumstances identified in the remission. The facts or circumstances identified in the remission shall be reviewed by the\npanel who shall then, after reconsideration, make a determination. Such\ndetermination shall then be resubmitted to the Authority board for ratification\nor nullification. Upon initial Authority board ratification of a panel\ndetermination, or Authority board ratification or nullification of a panel\ndetermination made after reconsideration, such determination shall be deemed\nfinal. (d) Timely and\ncomplete compliance with each and all of the requirements of this Part shall be\na precondition to any legal challenge that the contractor or any related entity\nor individual may be permitted to bring arising out of its debarment pursuant\nto Section\n1279-h\nof the Public Authorities\n\nLaw. (e) Pursuant to Executive Order\n\nNo. 192, the Authority shall notify the New York State Office of General\n\nServices of any final debarment determination within five days of the date it\nis ratified by the board of the Authority.
