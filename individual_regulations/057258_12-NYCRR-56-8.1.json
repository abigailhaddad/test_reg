  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.1 - Air sampling requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personal air sampling. Air sampling shall be performed in the worker's\nbreathing zone, by the asbestos contractor for his personnel, as required by\ncurrent OSHA regulations. (b) Daily\nair sampling. Project air sampling shall be conducted daily for the full\nworkshift for large projects. If more than one daily workshift is required to\naccomplish the work, air sampling shall be performed on each workshift. Air\nsampling is not required on days when there are no Phase II B activities. (1)\n\nNumber and location of samples -- large\nasbestos projects. A minimum of five samples shall be taken on a daily basis. The locations of samples to be taken are the same as specified for Phase II A. (See section\n56-7.1\nand table 2 within section\n56-4.9\nof this Part.)\n(2)\n\nWork stoppage criteria during Phase II B\nabatement procedures. If air samples collected outside the regulated abatement\nwork area, indicate airborne fiber concentrations at or above 0.01 fibers per\ncubic centimeter, or the established background level, whichever is greater, work shall stop immediately for inspection and repair of barriers and negative\nair ventilation systems as necessary. Clean up of surfaces outside of the\nregulated abatement work area using HEPA-vacuums and wet-cleaning methods shall\nbe performed prior to resumption of abatement activities. A summary of clean up\nactivities and the results of barrier inspections including any necessary\nrepairs, shall be documented in the supervisor's daily project log. Work\nmethods shall be altered accordingly to reduce fiber concentrations to\nacceptable levels. (c) Exemption from daily air sampling. Daily air sampling is not required on\nexterior asbestos projects with abatement of non-friable ACM roofing, siding, caulking or glazing compound, tars, sealers, coatings or other NOB ACMs, unless\nthe ACM is rendered friable during removal or debris falls inside the\nbuilding/structure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-8.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
