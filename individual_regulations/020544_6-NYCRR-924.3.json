  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 924.3 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In Table I an item number is assigned consecutively to\neach specifically designated waters or portion thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in Table I shall mean that number or abbreviation assigned to any\ndesignated waters or portion thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage area, such\nas a river, large lake, bay or sound, is usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary river waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of primary lake, bay or sound\nwaters are consecutively numbered in a clockwise order from a defined point, usually the outlet of the primary waters. Subtributaries are numbered as\nencountered along the tributary proceeding from its mouth to the source, and in\nlike manner all of its other stream courses are so numbered. Ponds and lakes\nare numbered in the order they are encountered within the system. Tributaries\nof such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing\nclockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. The numbers\nassigned to such lakes and ponds are prefixed by the letter P. When isolated\nlakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for\nconvenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any waters to\nwhich no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its report, A\nBiological Survey of the Fresh Waters of Long Island\n-1938, and has\nbeen closely followed in connection with the identification of the waters with\nthe following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively\ndue to the omission of streams originally shown on the older maps employed by\nthe Conservation Department at the time of its survey but not shown on newer\nmaps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps\nbut appearing on the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThere are several primary\nindices used to identify the designated waters. Those waters that drain Long\n\nIsland proper are identified by waters index numbers prefixed by the\nabbreviation LIS. Those waters that drain Shelter Island Sound proper are\nidentified by waters index numbers prefixed by the abbreviation SIS. Those\nwaters draining Gardiners Island and Fishers Island are identified by waters\nindex numbers prefixed with either \"Gardiners Island\" or \"Fishers Island\", as\nthe case may be. (4)\n\nThe system as\napplied to the identification of waters in the drainage basin of Eastern\n\nSuffolk County may be illustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nLIS\nLong Island Sound\n\nPrimary waters identified by abbreviation. GB\nGardiners Bay\nSIS\nShelter Island Sound\nLPB\nLittle Peconic Bay\nGPB\nGreat Peconic Bay\nBIS\nBlock Island Sound\nAO\nAtlantic Ocean\nGPB-96\n\nWest Creek\n\nThe 96th stream encountered on Long Island\nproceeding in a clockwise direction around the island from Fort Hamilton (The\n\nNarrows). GPB-96-1\n\nTrib. of West Creek\n\nThe first tributary entering West Creek above the\nmouth. GPB-P 496\n\nLaurel Pond\n\nThe 496th pond or lake encountered in the\n\nConservation Department's report, A Biological Survey of the Fresh\n\nWaters of Long Island. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs., indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, pond or other body of surface water; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated\nwaters shall include only the stream, pond or other body of water referenced by\nsuch waters index number; where a tributary, tributaries, subtributary or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, pond or other body of water\nreferenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and subtributaries\nthereof, which are shown on the reference maps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\n\nTable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\nknown and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of specifically\ndesignated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed\nwaters are tributary are identified as far as possible. (e) Description. The column headed \"Description\" contains designations of\nsegments or sections of waters under consideration to which a particular\nassignment of a class and standards shall apply. Also included in this column\nis any useful information pertinent to the classification or standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in Table I, means map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely or in part in\nsection\n924.9, infra, on\nwhich maps the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown\nwithin the topographical limit line of the described drainage basins or areas. An index for map numbers is shown on Map 2, section\n924.8, infra. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey, Silver Spring, Maryland: Map Ref.
