(2)\n\nDetermination by employer. An individual\nserving the employer as an independent contractor or consultant is not an\nemployee and should not be reported to the retirement system. The employer has\nthe primary responsibility for determining whether an individual is rendering\nservices as an employee or as an independent contractor. When making such a\ndetermination, the employer must consider the following: (i) Factors supporting the conclusion that an\nindividual is an employee rather than an independent contractor: (a) the employer controls, supervises or\ndirects the individual performing the services, not only as to result but as to\nhow assigned tasks are to be performed; (b) the individual reports to a certain\nperson or department at the beginning or during each work day; (c) the individual receives instructions as\nto what work to perform each day; (d) the individual's decisions are subject to\nreview by the employer; (e) the\nemployer sets hours to be worked; (f) the individual works at established and\nfixed hours; (g) the employer\nmaintains time records for the individual; (h) the employer has established a formal job\ndescription; (i) the employer's\ngoverning board formally created the position with the approval of the local\ncivil service commission where necessary; (j) the employer prepares performance\nevaluations; (k) the employer\nrequires that the individual attend training; (l) the employer provides permanent workspace\nand facilities (including, but not limited to, office, furniture and/or\nutilities); (m) the employer\nprovides the individual with equipment and support services (including, but not\nlimited to, computer, telephone, supplies and/or clerical\nassistance); (n) the individual is\ncovered by a contract negotiated between a union and the employer; (o) the individual is paid salary or wages\nthrough the employer's payroll system; (p) tax withholding and employee benefit\ndeductions are made from the individual's paycheck; and\n(q) the individual is entitled to fringe\nbenefits (including, but not limited to, vacation, sick leave, personal leave, health insurance and/or grievance procedures); (ii)\n\nFactors supporting the conclusion that\nan individual is an independent contractor rather than an employee: (a) the individual has a personal employment\ncontract with the employer; (b) the\nemployer pays the individual for the performance of services through the\nsubmission of a voucher; (c) the\nindividual is authorized to hire others, at the expense of the individual or a\nthird party, to assist the individual in performing work for the\nemployer; (d) the individual\nprovides similar services to the public; (e) the individual is concurrently performing\nsubstantially the same services for other public employers; and\n(f) the individual is also employed or\nassociated with another entity that provides services to the employer by\ncontract, retainer or other agreement. (iii)\n\nPresumption. Except as prohibited by\nsection 2051 of part 3 of article 41 of the Education Law, which provides that\na lawyer shall not simultaneously be an independent contractor and an employee\nof a school district or BOCES for the purpose of providing legal services, in\nthe case of an individual whose services has been engaged by an employer in the\ncapacity of attorney, physician, engineer, architect, accountant or auditor and\nwho is also a partner, associate, including an attorney in an \"of counsel\"\nrelationship, or employee of another organization or entity that has a\ncontract, retainer or other agreement to provide professional services to the\nparticipating employer, it shall be presumed that the individual is an\nindependent contractor and not an employee of the participating\nemployer. (iv)\n\nExamples. (a) An attorney who, in providing services to\na participating employer, sets his own hours, is not supervised in the manner\nin which the work is performed, uses his or her own office and staff and has no\ndeductions from salary is considered to be an independent contractor. (b) A physician who is performing\nexaminations and providing medical services for a school district, is provided\nwith office space in the school, has set hours, is provided with supplies and\nreceives a fixed salary with regular payroll deductions is considered to be an\nemployee. (3)\n\nWritten explanation by participating employers; certain professions. In the\ncase of an individual whose service has been engaged by a participating\nemployer in the capacity of attorney, physician, engineer, architect, accountant or auditor and the participating employer has determined that the\nindividual is rendering service as an employee and, therefore, may be eligible\nfor credit with a retirement system, such employer shall submit to the\nretirement system, in a form prescribed by the Comptroller and certified by the\nchief fiscal officer of the employer, an explanation of the factors that led to\nthe conclusion that the individual is an employee and not an independent\ncontractor or consultant. Such certification shall be submitted to the\nretirement system at the time the individual is registered to membership or, in\nthe case of an individual who is already a member of the retirement system, at\nthe time the individual is first reported by the participating employer to the\nsystem. In addition, such employer shall submit copies of documentation\npertaining to the appointment of the individual as an employee and the decision\nto report the individual to the retirement system as well as the acceptance of\nthe appointment by the local civil service commission where necessary. In the\nevent appointments are made by a governing board of the participating employer, such documentation shall include a copy of the minutes of the meeting of such\nemployer's governing board. (4)\n\nExplanation at the request of the retirement system. In the case of any\nindividual who is currently a member or a retiree of a retirement system, the\nretirement system may require that an employer submit to the retirement system\nan explanation of the factors that led to the conclusion that an individual\nengaged by the employer was an employee. An employer receiving such a request\nshall submit a response within 30 days of the date of the request or provide an\nexplanation as to why it is unable to do so. (5)\n\nAdjustment reports. In the event the\nretirement system or an employer determines that an individual has been\nincorrectly reported to a retirement system, the employer, upon notification\nfrom the retirement system, or upon its own initiative, shall promptly file\nsalary and service adjustment reports with the retirement system to correct the\nerror.
