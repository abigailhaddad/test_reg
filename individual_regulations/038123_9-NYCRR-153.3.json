  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 153.3 - Criteria established in statute for mortgage modifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 888 of\nthe Laws of 1980 establishes explicit criteria that must be met before an\nHFA-financed housing project can qualify for a mortgage modification. The\namendment also provides a framework or schedule for mortgage modifications by\nsetting a statutory limit on the length of time that housing project rental\nrates may be held below the level of economic rent and that a housing project\nmay take to pay its debt service and tax arrearages. The major statutory\ncriteria that determine whether or not a project qualifies for a mortgage\nmodification, and that specify the contents of an approved mortgage\nmodification, are summarized below. This summary is not intended to be, nor\nshould it be interpreted as, an exhaustive list of all of the statutory\nrequirements imposed on mortgage modification agreements. The guidelines\napproved by the director are intended to complement those criteria and to\nresolve important issues concerning the content of mortgage modification\nagreements, which the amendment does not address. (b) Eligible housing projects. The owners of\na housing project may enter into an agreement modifying the terms of the\nmortgage on that project only if the imposition of total economic rent (rent\nlevels which are high enough to generate revenues that are sufficient to pay\nall current costs of operating the project, plus accumulated arrearages) would\nrequire an increase in the project's rental rates or carrying charges of 20\npercent or $10 per room per month, whichever is greater. (See section 60, Private Housing Finance Law.)\n(c) Duration of the mortgage modification. As part of a mortgage modification\nagreement, a housing company and HFA may agree to vary rental rates or carrying\ncharges at a housing project below the level of economic rent for as much as 75\nmonths, so long as rents reach the level of current economic rent at the end of\nthat period. Current economic rent is defined in the amendment to be the rent\nor carrying charges sufficient to provide for the payment of all current costs\nof operating a housing project, including payments into reserve funds, real\nproperty taxes, water and sewer charges and mortgage payments (see section 60, Private Housing Finance Law). However, the amendment also requires that certain\narrearages, which are not included in the calculation of current economic rent, must be cured, as described in the next subdivision. (d) Payment of arrearages. The statute\nestablishes different requirements for the payment of three distinct types of\nhousing project arrearages. Debt service arrearages that accumulate before a\nmortgage modification begins are to be repaid by the date that the project's\nmortgage was originally scheduled to terminate. Debt service arrearages that\noccur during the period of the mortgage modification agreement must be paid\nwithin 10 years of the termination date of that agreement. Also, all real\nproperty tax and water and sewer charge arrearages must be paid, with interest, within 15 years of the effective date of the initial variation in rental rates\nor carrying charges.
