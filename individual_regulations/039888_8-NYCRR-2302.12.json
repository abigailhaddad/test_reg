Tit. 8 § 2302.12 - Dissemination-part b\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The New York\n\nState title IV of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act-- part B\ndissemination effort seeks to accomplish two purposes: (1)\nto disseminate information regarding\nparticipation in the title IV-B program to local education agencies\nand\n(2)\nto disseminate the results\nof State advisory council evaluation and State Education Department evaluation. The total dissemination effort will improve local planning and decision making\nin order to assure the most effective use of part B funds. (b) Program participation. (1)\n\nNeeds assessment. The review of fiscal\nyear 1977 applications and requests from local education agencies for\nadditional technical assistance will aid in identification of information\nneeds. Attention will be given to those areas which appear to be creating the\nmost confusion on the part of local agencies and/or those areas where greater\nefforts toward effective use of funds need to be made. (2)\n\nInformation regarding program\nparticipation will be distributed to all chief school officers, diocesan\nsuperintendents, private school principals and other appropriate organizations\nand persons. Information packets contain planning guides (including standards), application forms, and covering memorandum offering consultation services. Allocation notices are sent to chief school officers of all eligible local\neducation agencies. (3)\nA series of\nregional meetings will be held throughout the State to provide an additional\nforum for clarification of the requirements for participation in the part B\nprogram. The meetings will emphasize the importance of planning for effective\nuse of allocated funds, private school participation, how to complete the\napplication, and evaluation. Descriptive materials will be distributed at the\nmeetings. (4)\n\nThe State Education\n\nDepartment will make technical assistance available to eligible local education\nagencies and to private school officials. Consultation and technical assistance\nservices will be publicized through program planning materials, orientation\nsessions and regional representatives. (c) Dissemination of program results. (1)\n\nPart B program effectiveness will be\nascertained in three ways; (1)\nadvisory council evaluation, (2) on-site monitoring by State Education\n\nDepartment staff and (3) self-evaluation by the local education\nagency. (2)\n\nIn each case the\nevaluation will be based on a sample of participating local education\nagencies. (3)\n\nThe most effective\npart B programs will be identified through this three-pronged evaluation. Evidence of comprehensive planning will be sought and programs will be\nrepresentative of all part B program purposes for both public and private\nschool children. (4)\nA brochure\ndescribing effective part B programs will be prepared and disseminated to local\neducation agencies. (5)\n\nGuidelines\nwill be prepared for local and intermediate education agencies encouraging them\nto undertake local and/or regional dissemination efforts. (6)\n\nRepresentatives of local education\nagencies with effective part B programs will be invited to State and regional\nconferences and workshops to share their Part B program planning and\nimplementation strategies with other school personnel. (7)\n\nCoordination with the New York State\n\nEducation Department's Educational Program and Studies Information Services\n(EPSIS) and with the dissemination effort under part C will occur.
