(2)\n\nAll incoming general correspondence will\nbe opened and inspected for cash, checks, money orders, printed or photocopied\nmaterials or contraband. The inmate's presence is not required during the\ninspection of incoming general correspondence. See Part 721 of this Title for\nthe procedure to be followed for the opening of privileged correspondence and\n\nPart 712 of this Title for publications deemed to be unacceptable.

(b) Monies received. When, in the course of inspection, cash, checks, or money\norders from a clearly identifiable source are found, they shall be mailed back\nto the sender, in accordance with departmental directive #4422. Facilities will\ncontinue to process cash received in the mailroom in accordance with\ndepartmental directive #4422. All anonymously received monies will be\nconsidered contraband and handled accordingly. (c) Printed or photocopied materials. (1)\n\nWhen, in the course of inspection, printed or photocopied materials are found, the entire contents of such\ncorrespondence may be delayed through the correspondence unit for up to six\ndays while the materials are subject to media review guidelines (see Part 712\nof this Title). (2)\nA limit of five\npages of printed or photocopied materials (an individual newspaper clipping\nwill be considered one page) may be received within a piece of regular\ncorrespondence (except as provided in paragraphs [3] and [4] of this\nsubdivision). In order to facilitate media review, pages or clippings must not\nbe taped, glued, or pasted together or to other papers. (3)\n\nNot to exceed once every four months, an\ninmate may make a written request to the superintendent to receive in excess of\nfive pages of printed or photocopied legal papers specifically related to the\ninmate's current legal matter (e.g., legal brief or trial transcript relating\nto the inmate's active case) within a piece of regular correspondence. The\ninmate shall make the request in advance, specifically identifying the legal\npapers, including the approximate number of pages, and state why they cannot be\nobtained via the facility law library or privileged correspondence (e.g., from\na court, attorney, or the New York State Law Library). If approved, the piece\nof correspondence must be received within 30 days thereafter. Upon timely\nreceipt, it shall be processed in accordance with this section and shall not be\ndeemed privileged correspondence.

The facility shall return the entire correspondence to the\nsender with a letter explaining that third-party mail is considered contraband, is against department rules and, therefore, will not be delivered to the\ninmate. (2)\n\nUnauthorized items. Such items shall be either returned to the sender at the expense of the inmate, or otherwise disposed of. Such will be the choice of the inmate and\naccomplished at the inmate's expense. An inmate should be allowed 30 days to\nobtain funds to pay the cost of disposing of the contraband. If, after 30 days, the inmate is unable to pay for disposal of the contraband, it will be donated\nor destroyed. (3)\n\nPersonal\nidentifying information. Any material which appears to contain personal\nidentifying information (e.g., social security number, home address, private\ne-mail address or home telephone number) belonging to any person who is not a\nmember of the inmate's immediate family shall be examined. If the information\nidentifies a present or former employee of the department or a person presently\nor formerly employed in a department facility, or a member of such person's\nhousehold, it shall be withheld for investigation unless it is determined that\nthe inmate has authorization from the superintendent to receive such\ncorrespondence, or the personal identifying information pertains to a member of\nthe inmate's immediate family.

(1)\n\nSuch\nauthorization shall be for a 60-day period, subject to renewal by the\nsuperintendent. (2)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent shall request documentation from the person recommending\ninspection to determine that there are sufficient grounds for reading the mail, that the reasons for reading the mail are related to the legitimate interests\nof safety, security, and order, and that the reading is no more extensive than\nis necessary to further these interests. (g) Withholding of correspondence. (1)\n\nWhen incoming general correspondence is\nwithheld by the designated staff member for any of the above listed reasons, notification shall be sent to the sender and the intended correspondent of the\naction taken and the reasons therefore, unless doing so would interfere with an\nongoing investigation. (2)\n\nThe\nsender and inmate may appeal this action by writing the\nsuperintendent.

Such mail shall be\nstamped \" RETURN TO SENDER\" upon entering the facility. (k) When an inmate's incoming correspondence\nis stamped \"RETURN TO SENDER\" or something similar, the correspondence unit\nshould take precautions to ensure that the letter is not an attempt to\ncircumvent the department's inmate-to-inmate correspondence procedures. When\nsuch mail is opened to check for contraband, it shall be inspected to determine\nif it was written by the inmate to whom it is being \"returned.\" If it was not\nwritten by that inmate, it shall be withheld.
