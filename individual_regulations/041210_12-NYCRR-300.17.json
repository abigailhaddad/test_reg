Fees awarded in conciliation, administrative\ndetermination, agreement pursuant to section\n32\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law, or conference calendar processing, may be\napproved by a conciliator or designee of the chair. (e) Whenever an award is made to a claimant\nwho is represented by an attorney or a licensed representative, and a written\nfee application is submitted, the Board in such case shall approve a fee in an\namount commensurate with the services rendered and the amount of compensation\nawarded, having due regard for the financial status of the claimant. In\napproving such fee, the Board shall apply the provisions of the schedule set\nforth in subparagraph (2) of Section\n24\nof\nthe Workers' Compensation Law. (f) Whenever an attorney or licensed representative is notified, by notice of\nsubstitution or otherwise, that the claimant has terminated his or her\nretainer, the attorney or licensed representative, in each instance where a fee\nis requested for services rendered for which no previous fee has been approved, shall file an application for such final fee in the format prescribed by the\n\nChair, within 30 days of the filing of the notice of substitution. Where the\nfee requested is not more than $1000, the attorney or licensed representative\nmay make an oral statement on the record as to the services rendered at the\nfirst hearing held following notice to such attorney or licensed representative\nthat the retainer has been terminated.
