Tit. 20 § 163.2 - Estimation of tax due\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nnonresident taxpayer must estimate the personal income tax due on a form\nprescribed by the commissioner, using an estimated tax rate that equals the\nhighest rate of tax for the taxable year provided in section\n601\nof the Tax Law. The estimated tax due will equal the gain, if any, multiplied\nby that rate. The amount of the gain used in the computation is equal to the\namount reportable for Federal income tax purposes for the taxable\nyear.

(c) If the nonresident taxpayer is an estate or trust, it must estimate the tax due\nbased on the gain, if any, computed without reduction for any distribution of\nincome to the beneficiaries during the tax year of the sale or\ntransfer.
