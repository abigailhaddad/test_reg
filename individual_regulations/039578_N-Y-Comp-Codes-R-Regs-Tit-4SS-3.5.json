  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4§ 3.5 - Rating of examinations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nsubjects of an examination shall be given such relative weights as the\npresident of the commission may prescribe; provided, however, that in a\npromotion examination, credit granted for seniority and for performance rating\nmay be applied by the addition of points to the average scores earned by passed\ncandidates in the other parts of the examination. (b) After a candidate's rating has been\ndetermined, he shall be notified of such rating unless he has otherwise been\ndisqualified. (c) In an examination\nin which the number of candidates is expected to greatly exceed the number of\nexisting and anticipated vacancies, the president of the commission may\nprescribe that the passing mark shall be the lowest grade received among a\ncertain fixed number of the candidates graded highest in such examination or in\nany subject of such examination. Whenever the president shall determine upon\nsuch a passing mark in any examination or in any subject of an examination, notice thereof shall be set forth in the announcement of the\nexamination. (d) In examinations\nwhere the competition is small in relation to the number of positions to be\nfilled or in examinations which prove to be unusually difficult so that an\nadequate number of eligibles cannot otherwise be obtained, the president may\nauthorize the use of any type or combination of types of conversion methods, set forth in the regulations, in the rating of such examinations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4§\n3.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
