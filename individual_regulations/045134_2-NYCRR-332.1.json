  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 332.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n363-b\nof the Retirement and Social\n\nSecurity Law provides disability retirement coverage to members of the Division\nof State Police in lieu of the coverage provided by sections\n362\nand\n363\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. Section 363-b(b)(2)(b) requires five years of service in the Division of\n\nState Police as a condition precedent of eligibility for nonservice-connected\ndisability coverage. Certain members transfer to the Division of State Police from\nother member police service. Those members may have 10 years of service credit\nwhich makes them eligible for ordinary disability retirement coverage under\nsection\n362\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, or they may, within five years of joining the State Police, attain such\neligibility. Section 5 of Article 7 of the State Constitution establishes\na contractual relationship for retirement benefits and provides that no such\nbenefit may be diminished. The application of section 363-b to persons with\nless than five years of service in the Division of State Police often deprives\nmembers of benefits for which they were otherwise qualified. This Part is promulgated to insure that those members of the\n\nDivision of State Police who were otherwise eligible for ordinary disability\nretirement coverage prior to their transfer to the Division of State Police or\nduring their first five years of service in the Division of State Police, retain eligibility for ordinary disability retirement coverage pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n362\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw until they have accumulated five years of total service credit in the\ndivision, provided they remain in service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n332.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
