  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 261.1 - Accounting periods\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 5(a) of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of the\n\nCity of Yonkers, § 92-102(a)\n(a) General. The taxable year of a nonresident taxpayer required to\nmake a City of Yonkers earnings tax return, under article 30-B of the Tax Law\nand article X of the Codes and Ordinances of the City of Yonkers, must be the\nsame as such nonresident taxpayer's taxable year for Federal income tax\npurposes. Similarly, the taxable year of a partnership required to make a City\nof Yonkers partnership return (see section\n267.9\nof this Title) must be the same as the partnership's taxable year for Federal\nincome tax purposes. The taxable year may be a calendar year or a fiscal year\nconsisting of 12 months. However, under certain circumstances, the period may\nbe less than 12 months (\ne.g., in case of death, change of\naccounting period or change of resident status), or it may be a 52-53 week\nyear. (b) Absence of\n\nFederal accounting period. A nonresident taxpayer who is not required to file a\n\nFederal income tax return, but who is required to file a City of Yonkers\nearnings tax return, must report on the calendar year basis unless the State\n\nTax Commission authorizes the use of a different taxable period. This rule does\nnot apply, however, in a case where a taxpayer had for a previous year filed a\n\nFederal income tax return and such taxpayer's taxable year for Federal income\ntax purposes for the last such year, in respect of which a Federal income tax\nreturn was filed, was other than the calendar year. Thus, if the last Federal\nincome tax return filed by a taxpayer was on the basis of a fiscal year ending\n\nJune 30th, and such taxpayer is not required to file a Federal income tax\nreturn for the subsequent taxable year but is required to file a City of\n\nYonkers earnings tax return, such taxpayer's taxable period for the City of\n\nYonkers earnings tax purposes for such year and thereafter is a fiscal year\nending June 30th. If a taxpayer not required to file a Federal income tax\nreturn is subsequently required to file a Federal income tax return and the\ntaxable period for Federal purposes is different from the taxable period\nestablished for City of Yonkers earnings tax purposes, his City of Yonkers\ntaxable period will be changed to conform to the Federal taxable\nperiod. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n261.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
