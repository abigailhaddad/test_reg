  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6160.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Experience in\ncommunity crime prevention programs has shown that the most lasting positive\nresults are achieved when the crime prevention effort is made by the people who\ninhabit the area affected by the crime problem. Therefore, the funding emphasis\nfor this program will be on neighborhood crime prevention projects done by\nneighborhood residents on a volunteer basis. Special consideration will also be\ngiven to those projects proposing to address crimes against the elderly\npersons, and youth crime prevention. The \"neighborhood\" can be a residential\none, a business one, or a school one. Proposed projects will also be analyzed\nin light of their potential for reproduction in other areas of the\n\nState. (b) The overall goals are to\nencourage neighborhood participation in problem solving and crime prevention\nand to foster the growth of alliances among existing community organizations, elected officials, the private sector, and law enforcement in their shared\nresponsibility for the control of crime. These in turn result in improved crime\nreporting, increased understanding of the criminal justice system, increased\nreturn of stolen property to owners, and increased willingness to bear witness\nin court. (c) Successful projects\nto date have had several common elements, of which only a few can be written\ninto grant-award contracts. Among these are the extensive involvement of\nvolunteers (trained and organized) in the project, the willingness to help out\nother programs trying to get started or solve a problem, and an attitude of\nwe-can-help-solve -our-own-problems-together. (d) Neighborhood volunteers take pride in\ntheir work, and feel they have a stake in the project's success and in the\nimprovement of quality of life in the area being served. They are the project's\nown best advertisement and source of recruitment efforts. Most important, crime\ngoes down and the momentum of their success expands their efforts to other ways\nof improving their neighborhood (cleaning up the park, helping senior citizens\ndo shopping, getting streetlights repaired, using the school for programs after\nhours, all week), which reinforce neighborhood cohesiveness and in turn help\nreduce crime. (e) Funds made\navailable under this act will be awarded on a competitive, merit basis. The\napplication deadline(s) will be announced well in advance of its (their)\noccurrence(s), as established each year by the Commissioner of the Division of\n\nCriminal Justice Services. (f) Regardless of the particular crime prevention activity, projects must be based\non the substantial participation of people who live/work/attend school in the\narea being served. They must include volunteers in key roles and the bulk of\nthe project activity must be done on a volunteer basis. (g) Applicants should also demonstrate, where\napplicable, what other support and assistance is available in addition to that\nto be awarded under this act. This would include volunteer support other than\nthe crime prevention activities (hours donated or tasks done); cash donations\nby individuals, businesses, or groups, for general purposes of the project or\nspecific needs of a project activity; services provided (photocopying, office\nspace, typing, artwork); materials or equipment provided; and the\nlike.
