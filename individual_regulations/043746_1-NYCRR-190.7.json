A shell that is free from foreign\nmaterial and from stains or discolorations that are readily visible. An egg may\nbe considered clean if it has only very small specks or stains, if such specks\nor stains are not of sufficient number or intensity to detract from the\ngenerally clean appearance of the egg. Eggs that show traces of processing oil\non the shell are considered clean unless otherwise soiled. (b) Dirty. An individual egg that has an\nunbroken shell with adhering dirt or foreign material, prominent stains, or\nmoderate stains covering more than 1/32 of the shell surface if localized, or\n1/16 of the shell surface if scattered. (c) Practically normal (AA or A quality). A\nshell that approximates the usual shape and that is of good even texture and\nstrength and is free from rough areas or thin spots. Slight ridges and rough\nareas that do not materially affect the shape, texture and strength of the\nshell are permitted. (d) Abnormal\n(B quality). A shell that may be somewhat unusual or decidedly misshapen or\nfaulty in soundness or strength or that may show pronounced ridges or thin\nspots. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n190.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
