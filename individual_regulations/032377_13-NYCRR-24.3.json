This section must be on a separate right-hand page immediately following\nthe table of contents and must provide, at a minimum, that: (1)\nthe purchaser may cancel his or her contract\nby mailing written notice of cancellation, postmarked within seven business days of the date on which the contract was executed, to the sponsor or\nselling agent at the address indicated on the cover of the offering plan; (2)\nthe right to cancel may not\nbe waived under any circumstances, and any instrument executed by a purchaser which purports to waive such right shall be deemed void and of no\neffect; (3)\na purchaser may exercise the right to cancel at will and without explanation; (4)\na purchaser may cancel his or her contract without penalty or obligation and all payments made by the purchaser\nprior to cancellation shall be refunded with 30 days after the sponsor or selling agent receives notice of cancellation; (5)\nany note or other negotiable debt instrument executed by the purchaser in connection with financing provided or\narranged by the sponsor shall be returned to the purchaser within 30 days after the sponsor or selling agent receives notice of cancellation. If the law of the jurisdiction in which the property subject to the\ntimesharing plan is located requires a rescission period of more than seven business days from the date of execution of the contract, substitute the\nappropriate time period in this section of the offering plan. (d) Special\nrisks. This section must begin on a separate right-hand page immediately\nfollowing the section on purchaser's right of cancellation. All features of a plan which involve significant risk or will disproportionately or\nunusually affect maintenance charges or obligations of timeshare owners in future years of timeshare operation must be conspicuously disclosed and\nhighlighted in consecutively numbered paragraphs in order of decreasing significance. A brief description given in this section and a more thorough\ndescription should be given in a referenced later section. Questions highlighted in this section should be resolved in favor of inclusion. To the\nextent applicable, this section should include the following special risk factors in the following order: (1)\n\nIn a right-to-use timesharing plan, state that if the sponsor or other fee owner of the timeshare property\ndeclares bankruptcy, the rights of all purchasers (even purchasers who have paid for their timeshares in full) may be terminated. State that in such\nevent, purchasers will not be entitled to use their units or other timeshare facilities and that the sponsor may sell the timeshare property to a\nthird party who will be under no obligation to honor the contracts of timeshare purchasers. State that timeshare purchasers may be treated as general\nunsecured creditors in bankruptcy and, in such event, will receive little or no refund. (2)\n\nIn a\nright-to-use timesharing plan, state that all mortgages or other liens presently encumbering the timeshare property contain, and any consensual liens\nplaced on the timeshare property in the future will contain, nondisturbance clauses to protect the possession and use rights of timeshare owners from\nforeclosure of such liens. State that involuntary liens filed against the property in the future (such as judgment liens or mechanic's liens filed\nagainst the property by the sponsor's creditors) will cut off the rights of timeshare owners in foreclosure. (3)\n\nIn a campground timesharing plan, disclose the number of timeshares sold and offered for sale for each campsite\nin the campground or multi-site campground network, and include a reference to the discussion of the reservation policy. State whether or not and\nunder what conditions the sponsor may permanently or temporarily close campgrounds which are part of the timesharing plan. If the sponsor offers\ntrailer or other equipment rentals, state that availability is limited and include a reference to a more detailed discussion of equipment\nrentals. (4)\n\nIf, as part of the timesharing plan, timeshare owners have the right to use and occupy\nproperty outside the immediate timeshare regime (at no additional charge or at a discount from rates charged to the general public), describe the\neasement of the timeshare regime over the other property and specify those mortgages and other liens, if any, to which the easement is subordinate. Discuss the possibility that such easement (and the right of timeshare owners to use and occupy the other property) may be cut off by the foreclosure\nof such mortgages or other liens on the other property or by the bankruptcy of the owner of the other property. (5)\n\nIf, as part of the timesharing plan, timeshare owners have the right to use and occupy property outside the\nimmediate timeshare regime (at no additional charge or at a discount from rates charged to the general public), describe the covenant (running with\nthe land) that such other property will be used only for the purposes set forth in the offering plan. Specify any mortgages or other liens to which\nthe covenant is subordinate and discuss the possibility that such covenant may be cut off by the foreclosure of such mortgages or other liens on the\nother property and that, in such event, the use of the other property may be changed from its use at the time that the purchaser acquired his or her\ntimeshare. (6)\n\nState that timeshares should be purchased for personal recreational use and not for profit\nor investment. State that no resale market exists for timeshares and that the resale value of timeshares, if any, is uncertain. State that most real\nestate brokers will not list timeshares and that an owner's efforts to sell his or her timeshare will bring him or her into direct competition with\nthe sponsor who may have a large inventory of unsold intervals. Discuss any restrictions or fees imposed on the resale of timeshares. (7)\n\nState which resort exchange network, if any, the sponsor has joined. State, if applicable, that the exchange\nnetwork is independent of the sponsor and that timeshare owners will be entitled to use this network only as long as the sponsor and the timeshare\nproperty continue as a member of the exchange company. State that the availability of exchange privileges for any timeshare owner will be contingent\nupon meeting the terms and conditions of the exchange company, including payment of membership and exchange fees. If applicable, state that a\ntimeshare owner must release his or her timeshare to the exchange network in order to participate in the exchange program before being informed of\nthe specific resorts or locations available for trade. State in capital letters that there can be no assurance that a particular interval can be\nexchanged, that an exchange for a particular interval or a particular resort can be arranged, that this timeshare resort will continue to qualify\nwith the exchange company, or that this interval program or any other will continue to exist. If the timesharing plan is not affiliated with an\nexchange network, so state. (8)\n\nIn a right-to-use timesharing plan, state that a timeshare purchaser\nacquires no recordable interest in real property. In a right-to-use or leasehold timesharing plan, state that a timeshare purchaser receives no\nvoting rights or right to control the policies or decisions of the sponsor with regard to the use or maintenance of the timeshare property. State\nalso that full control for the adequate operation and maintenance of the timeshare property lies with the sponsor, and that the facilities and\nservices of the timesharing plan will be available only as long as the sponsor is able to provide them. State that no bond or other security has been\nprovided for the sponsor's undertakings in this regard. (9)\n\nIn a fee or cooperative timesharing plan, state that the successful operation and maintenance of the timeshare property depends upon the ability of the sponsor to meet its financial\nobligations with respect to unsold timeshares. State that during the early years of the project, the failure of the sponsor to meet its obligations\nin this regard will require a small number of timeshare owners to cover the costs of operating and maintaining the entire project. State that the\nsponsor has provided no bond or other security for its undertaking in this regard. (10)\n\nIn a fee or\ncooperative timesharing plan, state that while timeshare owners do have certain voting rights, it is expected that most timeshare owners will not\nparticipate in the management of the timeshare regime since each timeshare owner has a relatively small interest in the timesharing plan and is away\nfrom the timeshare property for most of the year and it is unlikely that the many timeshare owners could be effectively organized into a voting\nblock. State that the governing body of the timeshare regime will be controlled by the sponsor and that the daily affairs of the timeshare regime\nwill be handled by the sponsor and managing agent. (11)\n\nState the number of additional units that the\nsponsor plans to construct in subsequent phases of the project, and the number of timeshares which will be offered for sale in those units. State the\nsponsor's obligation to add to recreational areas and resort facilities in the event of such expansion and, if the sponsor has no such obligation, state that the recreational areas and resort facilities may be inadequate to meet the needs of all future timeshare owners. (12)\n\nIn a mixed-use project, state that the larger project of which the timesharing plan is a part includes whole\nownership units and that the interests of timeshare owners and whole unit owners may conflict. (13)\n\nState\nthat the units and the furnishings therein will be subject to extraordinary wear and tear. State that the projected budget for the timeshare regime\n(set forth in schedule B) includes estimates for unit repairs and the replacement of furnishings, but that no assurances can be given that these\nreserves will be adequate or that they will not need to be increased in the future. (14)\n\nIn a fee\ntimesharing plan, describe the risk of partition of a timeshare unit and its appurtenant interest in common elements under the law of the\njurisdiction in which the timeshare property is located. Describe the effect that a successful partition action would have on the timeshare owners\ninvolved. (15)\n\nIn a fee timesharing plan, describe the risk that Federal and State authorities will\nforeclose on an entire timeshare unit and its appurtenant interest in the common elements in order to satisfy tax liens against less than all\nco-owners of that unit. Describe the effect that such a foreclosure would have on the timeshare owners involved. (16)\n\nState which facilities may be used by other than timeshare owners (\ne.g., members of the\npublic, hotel guests), including any limitations on such use. (e) Introduction. The introduction must: (1)\nexplain that the purpose of the offering is to set forth all the terms of the offer.
