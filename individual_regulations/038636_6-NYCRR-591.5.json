  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 591.5 - Departmental review process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whichever of the methods of State land\nproject initiation set forth in section\n591.3\nof this Part is involved, the\nfirst step in the review process is the investigation of all potential projects\nby the regional office of the department within which the project is located or\nby the Division of Marine and Coastal Resources for tidal wetlands and tidal\nwaterway access projects located within the marine and coastal district. That\ninvestigation must include a determination of whether or not the project meets\nthe minimum eligibility requirements set forth under section\n591.3\nof this Part and is\nconsistent with identified regional acquisition objectives. Such investigation, when appropriate, will be coordinated with any program personnel who may have\nan interest in the project. Upon completion of this investigation, if the\nproposed project meets the minimum eligibility requirements, a project file\nshall be prepared and forwarded with the regional recommendation to central\noffice program. (b) The central\noffice program will review each project file and recommend statewide projects\nfor the program area to the commissioner based on all relevant factors, including the extent to which the project furthers identified statewide\nacquisition objectives. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n591.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
