  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2B.101 - End Speed Zone Sign (NYR2-11)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The End Speed Zone (NYR2-11) sign (see Sign Drawing\nSD-R1) may be used for posting the end of a linear or area speed limit which is\nfollowed by the statewide limit. It is a substitute for the NYR2-2 sign (see\n\nSection\n2B.13\n) at that location. Standard: 02 The NYR2-11 sign shall be used only where the NYR2-2\nsign would be unsuitable because of conditions immediately beyond the sign\nlocation. Examples of such conditions are: A. A curve with advisory speed less than the\nstatewide limit. B. A school\nbuilding adjacent to the highway. C. Highway and/or roadside characteristics\nwhich are not conducive to an immediate increase in travel speed. 03 Where the NYR2-11 sign is used, a NYR2-2 sign shall be\nplaced beyond it at the first suitable location, unless another speed\nrestriction begins within one-quarter mile of that location. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2B.101\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
