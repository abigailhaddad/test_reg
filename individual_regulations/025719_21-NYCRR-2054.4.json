  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2054.4 - Selection of outside contractors\n\nState Regulations\n\nSelection of all outside contractors shall be made on a\ncompetitive basis, except in the following circumstances: the president, or the\nresponsible official after consultation with the president, shall have\ndetermined that: (a) the need to obtain\nhigh quality goods or services, or continuity of supply of goods or services, or goods or services having unique or extraordinary features or time\nrequirements substantially outweighs possible cost savings from selection on a\ncompetitive basis; or\n(b) the\ncorporation has other cost control procedures to protect the corporation from\npaying more for goods or services than necessary. The foregoing shall not be\nconstrued to affect any requirements for competitive bidding, or for giving\nnotice of proposal solicitation, which may be binding on the corporation under\napplicable law. Where selection is made on a competitive basis, the responsible\nofficer shall request proposals from at least three outside contractors known\nto have experience in providing the type of goods or services in question. Where the total value of the contract is likely to exceed $10,000, the\nproposals shall be in writing. Proposals shall be evaluated on the basis of all\nrelevant factors, which in any instance may include the outside contractor's\nexperience, reputation, technical qualifications, financial condition, past\nperformance, size, quality and availability of staff, identity of supervisory\npersonnel, possible conflicts of interest, proposed scope of work and proposed\nfee, cost or commission. No single factor shall necessarily be controlling and\nthe outside contractor submitting the proposal which is most favorable on an\noverall basis shall be selected, except that the president, or the responsible\nofficial after consultation with the president, may reject all proposals if he\nconsiders such action in the best interest of the\ncorporation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n2054.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
