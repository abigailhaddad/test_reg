  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.17 - Shutoff valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nEach water-gage glass shall be equipped\nwith a top and a bottom shutoff valve of such through-flow construction as to\nprevent stoppage by deposits of sediments. If the lowest valve is more than\nseven feet above the floor or platform from which it is operated, the operating\nmechanism shall indicate by its position whether the valve is open or closed. The pressure-temperature rating shall be at least equal to that of the lowest\nset pressure of any safety valve on the boiler drum and the corresponding\nsaturated steam temperature. (2)\n\nStraight-run globe valves of the ordinary type as shown in Figure P-43(a) shall\nnot be used on such connections. (3)\n\nAutomatic shutoff valves on water gages, shall conform to the following requirements: (i) check valves in upper and lower fittings\nshall be of solid noncorrosive metal ball type to avoid need for\nguides; (ii)\nball check valves in\nupper and lower fittings must open by gravity and the lower ball check valve\nmust rise vertically to its seat; (iii)\nthe check balls must be not smaller\nthan 1/2 inch in diameter, and the diameter of the circle of contact with the\nseat must be not greater than two-thirds of the diameter of the check ball. The\nspace around each ball must be not less than 1/8 inch, and the travel movement\nfrom the normal resting place to the seat must be not less than 1/4\ninch; (iv)\nthe ball seat in the\nupper fitting must be a flat seat with either a square or a hexagonal opening, or otherwise arranged so that the steam passage can never be completely closed\nby this valve; (v) the shutoff\nvalve in the upper fitting must have a projection which holds the ball at least\n1/4 inch away from its seat when the shutoff valve is closed; and\n(vi)\nthe balls must be accessible for\ninspection. Means must be provided for removal and inspection of the lower ball\ncheck valve while the boiler is under steam pressure. These restrictions do not\napply to closing the valves by external methods. (b) When shutoffs are used on the\nconnections to a water column, they shall be either outside-screw-and-yoke or\nlever-lifting type gate valves or stopcocks with levers permanently fastened\nthereto and marked in line with their passage, or of such other through-blow\nconstruction as to prevent stoppage by deposits of sediment, and to indicate by\nthe position of the operating mechanism whether they are in open or closed\nposition; and such valves or cocks shall be locked or sealed open. Where\nstopcocks are used they shall be of a type with the plug held in place by a\nguard or gland. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
