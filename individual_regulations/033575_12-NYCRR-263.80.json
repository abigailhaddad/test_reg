Tit. 12 § 263.80 - Impasses in Collective Bargaining and Assignment of Mediators\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the event that an employer and a labor organization\nhave failed to achieve an agreement, either the employer or the labor\norganization, or both acting jointly, may notify the board in writing of the\nexistence of an impasse. The notification, or declaration of impasse, must be\nsigned by the representative of the declaring party, or where the parties are\njointly declaring impasse, the representative of each party. The notification\nshall be filed electronically with the director of conciliation (see section\n263.15\nof this Part). Upon receipt\nof the notification of an impasse in collective bargaining, the board may\nappoint a mediator from a list of qualified persons maintained by the board to\nassist the parties to effectuate a voluntary resolution of the impasse.
