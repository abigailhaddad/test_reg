  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-2.3 - Local cash subsidy\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhere a loan and subsidy contract specifically so\nprovides, a municipality will be required to pay a local cash subsidy, in the\nminimum amount specified in the contract, regardless of the value of the tax\nexemption subsidy. Local cash subsidies may also be required under other\ncircumstances, as where the value of the tax exemption is not sufficient to\nmatch the State subsidy, or where the operating deficit is in excess of the\nmaximum State subsidy. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
