A base price shall be established for each of the payment groups defined in the PAS classification. All procedures within the same payment group shall be reimbursed at a single discrete price. (c) Each base price shall be adjusted by a wage equalization factor and a space occupancy factor to reflect regional differences in the price of labor and space. The wage equalization factor shall be applied to the operating room and preoperative and postoperative nursing personnel salary components of each base price. (d) Prices established pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section shall provide full reimbursement for applicable: (1)\nnursing services, technician services, and other related professional expenses directly incurred by the licensed facility; (2)\ndrugs, biologicals, surgical dressings, supplies, splints, appliances and equipment directly related to the provision of the surgical procedures; (3)\ndiagnostic or therapeutic items and services directly related to the provision of surgical procedures; (4)\nmaterials for anesthesia; (5)\nprosthetic and orthotic appliances provided during or integral to an ambulatory surgery procedure; (6)\nadministrative, personnel, business office, data processing, recordkeeping, housekeeping and other related facility overhead expenses; and\n(7)\nspace occupancy and plant overhead costs.

Each weight shall be adjusted by one or more price indices. Included among these indices are elements of the United States Department of Labor consumer and producer price indices and special indices developed by the commissioner for this purpose. (f) The projected trend factors shall be updated on an annual basis, based upon then current and available data. The commissioner shall adjust annually subsequent trend factors based upon such update.
