  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2604.5 - Hardship assistance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncorporation may provide hardship assistance in those cases where the\ncorporation, in its discretion, determines financial hardship exists. In making\nsuch determination, the corporation may consider whether the total estimated\nannual service charge for a household or equivalent dwelling unit in the area\nserved by the project, calculated using the maximum interest rate applicable to\nthe project, exceeds the target service charge. The provisions relating to\nhardship assistance shall be published annually in the IUP. (b) To the extent such hardship assistance\nincludes a principal subsidy, the corporation shall give preference in the\ngranting of such subsidies to small and rural communities. (c) To the extent such hardship assistance\nincludes State assistance payments, the corporation shall give preference to\nrecipients which would be unable to carry out such eligible projects in the\nabsence of such grant or State assistance payments without creating a financial\nhardship on system users. (d) The\napplicable terms of the hardship assistance are those which bring the estimated\nservice charge closest to the target service charge. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, the corporation may also consider other conditions deemed relevant\nto adjust the terms of the hardship assistance if such adjustment is necessary\nto reflect actual financial needs (or lack thereof). (e) Hardship assistance in the form of a\ngrant or reduced interest rate financing may be provided only for an eligible\nrecipient's project or allocable portion thereof and shall be limited to the\namounts published in the IUP. Hardship assistance will not be provided for a\nsegment of a recipient's project if the total cost of all segments of such\nproject exceeds the hardship limit. The corporation may provide a written\nconfirmation that a potential recipient qualifies for hardship assistance\nbecause of financial hardship. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
