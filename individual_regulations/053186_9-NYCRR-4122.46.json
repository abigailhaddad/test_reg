  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4122.46 - Pick four pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The pick\nfour (or other approved name) is a form of pari-mutuel wagering conducted on\nfour races specifically designated as pick four races by the commission. Each\nbettor selects, in order, the first placed horse in each of the four races\ndesignated and advertised by the track as pick four races, in the race order so\ndesignated by the commission. (b) The pick four is not a parlay and has no connection with nor relation to the\nother betting pools for the respective races. The pick four pool shall be held\nentirely separate from all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, quinella, triple, superfecta or other wagering pool. (c) Resale of pick four tickets from one\nindividual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection, and may be\ndeemed illegal gambling. (d) Races\nin which pick four pools shall be conducted shall be clearly designated in the\nprogram and racing cards issued by the corporation. (e) The design of the pick four tickets shall\nbe clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (f) Scratched horses and\nnonstarters. At any time after wagering begins on the pick four pool, should an\nentire betting entry or field be scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick\nfour race, no further tickets selecting such betting entry or field shall be\nissued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for purposes of the pick\nfour pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the betting entry or field (designated\nhorse) upon which the most wagering money has been registered at the track in\nthe win pool at the close of win pool betting for such race. (In the event of a\nmoney tie, the tied betting entry or field upon which the most wagering money\nhas been registered at the track in the place pool at the close of place pool\nbetting for that race shall be designated.) Wagers in the pick four pool upon\nan entry or field of horses from which a starter or starters may have been\nscratched will, in the case of such entry or field, be deemed wagers upon the\nhorse or horses remaining in such entry or field; except at tracks with\ntotalisator capability to record wagers selecting a coupled entry (or field)\nand wagers selecting any individual constituent horses therein (merging such\nwagers for odds display and payoff purposes), in which case, the wagers upon\nscratched constituent horses will be deemed wagers upon the \"designated horse\"\nin such race. In case no starter remains representing any betting entry or\nfield, wagers upon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the\n\"designated horse\" in the race affected by the scratch. Should the balance of a\nbetting entry or field race as a nonbetting starter for purposes of other\npari-mutuel pools, as provided in section\n4122.27\nof this Part, wagers upon\nsuch entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the \"designated horse\" for such\nrace. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared a nonstarter in any\npick-four race prior to the start of the first leg, the betting operator shall\nbe authorized to refund any tickets designating betting entries affected\nthereby prior to such first leg. (g) Failure to select a winning combination. (1)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of the four pick four races, all pick four tickets designating\nthree winners shall be considered winning tickets and the net pool distributed\nequally to holders of said tickets. (2)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of three such races, all pick four tickets designating two winners\nshall be considered winning tickets and the net pool distributed equally to\nholders of said tickets. (3)\n\nIf no\npick four ticket is sold combining the winners of two such races, all pick four\ntickets designating one winner shall be considered winning tickets and the net\npool distributed equally to holders of said tickets. (4)\n\nIf no pick four ticket is sold\ndesignating any winner to win in the designated pick four races, the pick four\nshall be declared off and the gross pool refunded. (5)\n\nIf any of the designated races are\ncancelled or declared \"no race,\" the pick four will be determined by the\nwinners of the remaining race or races. (h) Dead heats. In the event of a dead heat\nfor win in any or all pick four races, all pick four tickets designating either\nhorse to win in said race or races shall be eligible for participation in the\nremaining pick four races, and the net pool shall be equally distributed to the\nwinners, that is, the net pool will be divided by the total amount represented\nby all winning tickets and the resulting price, per dollar, and after breakage, shall be the payoff price, which shall be uniform for any winning\ncombination. (i) In the event of\noccurrences not encompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall be formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel\npractice and in accordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this\nsection; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made\non the basis of outstanding tickets, the method of formulation announced by the\ntrack, and upon which basis payments have been made, shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (j) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable free of charge by the track to the public in the public betting area\nof the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
