  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 594.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is the\npurpose of these regulations to establish standards which secure the right of\nchildren and youth identified as having serious emotional disturbance to be\ntreated within a family-like setting. Although treatment within an individual's\nfamily is preferable, when this is not possible, alternative types of\nresidential settings must be made available to meet the treatment needs of\nchildren and youth identified as having a serious emotional disturbance. These\nsettings should strive to provide services in an individualized, family-centered, community-based manner. (b) It is the purpose of these regulations to\nestablish standards for licensed housing programs which provide residential\ntreatment alternatives for children and youth who require such treatment in\nthis setting due to a serious emotional disturbance. This Part sets forth\nstandards for licensed housing for three types of residential options: teaching\nfamily homes, community residences, (including the Community Residence for\n\nEating Disorder Integrated Treatment \"CREDIT\" Program), and crisis\nresidences. (c) It is the intent of\nthe Office of Mental Health to establish residential treatment options which\nhave as their primary goal the return of children and youth to a permanent\nfamily-like setting and to prepare the children and youth for successful\nindependent living as appropriate. Such programs shall also provide support to\nthe family which includes education and counseling relating to the child's\nmental health disability, collaborative techniques in supporting the child's\nemotional and maturational development, and community resources to support the\nsuccessful return of the child to his/her home community and family. In\naddition, it shall be the mission of each residential option to provide a safe\nenvironment which ensures protection from harm, abuse, and neglect; to\nencourage emotional, intellectual and physical growth; and to ensure that\nindividualized treatment is provided with sensitivity to cultural and ethnic\nconsiderations. (d) It is the\nintent of the Office of Mental Health to establish residential treatment\noptions which provide rehabilitation services and treatment for children and\nyouth that result in outcomes of successful functioning and integration into\nthe family, community, school or independent living situations and vocational\nopportunities as appropriate. Such services shall be provided in consideration\nof a child's developmental stage with careful attention to individual\nstrengths, needs and desires throughout the process of rehabilitation and\nskills development.
