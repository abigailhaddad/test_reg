Tit. 18 § 343.7 - Pleadings, depositions and discovery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The pleadings in an enforcement action\nshall consist of the notice of hearing and answer. (b) Neither formal discovery procedures nor\nformal procedures for bills of particulars shall apply. However, upon\napplication of a facility, a more definite and detailed statement shall be\nfurnished whenever the hearing officer finds that the statement of charges does\nnot adequately apprise the facility of such charges. Any statement furnished\nshall be deemed, in all respects, to be part of the original notice of hearing. The hearing officer may grant additional time to respond to the notice of\nhearing when a motion for a more definite and detailed statement has been\ngranted. (c) Disclosure of evidence\nby deposition of a party to the hearing or the officer, director, member, agent\nor employee of a party, prior to the hearing shall not be permitted, except\nwhere the hearing officer determines that special circumstances, as set forth\nin section 3101(a)(3) of the New York Civil Practice Law and Rules, require the\ntaking of testimony by deposition.
