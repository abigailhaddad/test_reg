  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 13.8 - Meter reading and estimated bills\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Meter reading. (1)\nA utility shall make a\nreading attempt, to obtain an actual reading for every customer's account, on\nthe regularly scheduled basis provided for in its tariff. (2)\nA reading attempt requires that a meter\nreader visit the premises between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. on a business day, and\nfollow any routine access instructions. (3)\n\nWhere circumstances beyond a utility's\ncontrol prevent the utility from making a regularly scheduled reading attempt\nand where the two previous consecutive cycle bills were not based on an actual\nreading, the utility shall make a second similar follow-up reading attempt as\nsoon as possible and within seven calendar days after the scheduled reading\ndate. (4)\n\nWhere a utility did not\nobtain an actual reading from the meter(s) of a demand account at the time of a\nregularly scheduled or follow-up reading attempt, the utility shall make\nanother reading attempt as soon as possible and within seven calendar days\nafter its last attempt. (5)\n\nWhere a\nutility has billed a customer's account based on the readings of a remote\nregistration device for six consecutive months, the utility shall, at the time\nof every subsequent reading attempt and, until successful, try to gain access\nto and read the meter. (6)\n\nWhere a\nutility has billed a customer's account based on customer readings for six\nconsecutive months, and did not obtain an actual reading at the time of the\nnext regularly scheduled or follow-up reading attempt thereafter, the utility\nshall, within seven calendar days after the last attempt, either make another\nreading attempt or an appointment with the customer to read the\nmeter. (7)\n\nUnless a customer does\nnot have access to the meter or the customer will be unable to obtain a\nreliable meter reading, the utility shall, at the time of any unsuccessful\nreading attempt, leave at the premises or mail to the customer a meter-reading\ncard for the nondemand meter. (b) Estimated bills. (1)\nA utility may render an estimated bill\nfor a regular cycle billing period only when: (i) the utility has failed to obtain access\nto the meter(s); (ii)\ncircumstances\nbeyond the control of the utility made obtaining an actual reading of the\nmeter(s) extremely difficult, despite having access to the meter area; provided, however, that estimated bills for this reason may be rendered no more\nthan twice consecutively without the utility advising the customer in writing\nof the specific circumstances and the customer's obligation to have the\ncircumstances corrected; (iii)\nthe\nutility has good cause for believing that an actual or customer reading\nobtained is likely to be erroneous; provided, however, that estimated bills for\nthis reason may be rendered no more than twice consecutively without the\nutility initiating corrective action before the rendering of the next cycle\nbill; (iv)\ncircumstances beyond the\ncontrol of the utility prevented the meter reader from making a premises\nvisit; (v) an actual reading was\nlost or destroyed; provided, however, that an estimated bill for this reason\nshall be rendered no more than once without the utility initiating corrective\naction before the rendering of the next cycle bill; (vi)\nan estimated reading has been prescribed\nor authorized by the commission for a particular billing cycle; (vii)\nan estimated reading is the approved\nbilling method in accordance with the utility's tariff for the billing; or\n(viii)\nan unmetered condition\nwas in existence during the period. (2)\n\nEvery estimated bill shall be calculated\nin accordance with an established formula or methodology which shall take into\naccount the best available relevant factors for determining the customer's\nenergy usage and, if applicable, demand usage. (c) No-access procedure. (1)\nA utility shall begin providing no-access\nnotices as described in this subdivision, commencing with: (i) the second consecutive bill estimated\npursuant to either subparagraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section in the case\nof accounts billed for demand; (ii)\nthe fourth consecutive bill estimated pursuant to either subparagraph (b)(1)(i)\nor (ii) of this section in the case of accounts not billed for demand; or\n(iii)\nthe 10th consecutive bill\nestimated pursuant to subparagraph (b)(1)(i) or (ii) of this section or based\non a remote registration device or a customer reading. (2)\n\nThe no-access notices and charges\ndescribed in this subdivision shall be directed only to the access controller. In any case where the access controller is not the customer of the subject\naccount, a copy of these no-access notices shall also be sent to the customer\nat the same time. (3)\n\nThe series of\nno-access notices shall be as follows: (i) The\nfirst notice shall advise the access controller that unless access to the\ncustomer's meter is provided on the next meter reading date, or a special\nappointment to read the meter is made and kept by the access controller prior\nto that date, a no-access charge will be added to the access controller's next\nbill and to every bill thereafter until access to the customer's meter is\nprovided, but that no charge will be imposed if an appointment is arranged and\nkept. The notice shall advise the access controller that the utility will\narrange a special appointment for a reading of the customer's meter if the\naccess controller calls a specified telephone number. Where the access\ncontroller is not the customer of the subject account, the notice shall begin\nby stating that the utility records indicate that the recipient is the party\nwho controls access to the meter of the customer, specifically identified as to\naddress, part supplied, and account number, and that the utility has not been\nprovided access to the customer's meter as required. (ii)\n\nThe second notice shall advise the\naccess controller of the no-access charge that has been added to the access\ncontroller's bill and that, unless access to the customer's meter is provided\non the next meter-reading date or a special appointment to read the meter is\nmade and kept by the access controller prior to that date, another charge will\nbe added to the access controller's next bill. The notice shall further explain\nthat if the access controller's service can be physically terminated without\nobtaining access, steps to terminate service will follow, and that in the event\nthat the access controller's service cannot be physically terminated, steps to\nobtain a court order to gain access to the customer's meter will follow. The\nnotice shall advise the access controller that the utility will arrange a\nspecial appointment for a reading of the customer's meter if the access\ncontroller calls a specified number. (iii)\n\nThe third and each successive notice\nshall advise the access controller of the no- access charge that has been added\nto the access controller's bill and, if the access controller's service can be\nterminated without obtaining access, shall be accompanied by a final notice of\ntermination for nonaccess. In any case where the access controller's service\ncannot be physically terminated without obtaining access, the notice shall\nadvise the access controller that the utility is seeking to obtain a court\norder to gain access to the customer's meter. (4)\nA no-access charge as provided for in the\nutility's tariff shall not exceed $100. (5)\n\nNo more than $100 per building or\npremises shall be added to any single bill of the access controller even though\nmore than one meter is located there. (6)\nA utility may, at its discretion, suspend\ntemporarily the issuance of no-access notices and/or penalties under this\nsubdivision if the access controller contacts the utility and provides a\nlegitimate reason for postponing the provision of access; provided, however, that such suspension may not be utilized in the case of any account that is\nbilled for demand charges and in no event for more than 90 calendar\ndays. (d) Utilities\nshall comply with this section no later than March 18, 1988. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
