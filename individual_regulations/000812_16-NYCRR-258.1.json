  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 258.1 - Scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part\nprescribes minimum safety standards for liquid petroleum pipeline facilities. Every liquid petroleum pipeline corporation engaged in the transportation of\nliquid petroleum via pipeline within the State of New York is to comply with\nthe rules set forth in this Part. (b) The rules and regulations of this Part\nare considered adequate for safety under conditions normally encountered in the\nliquid petroleum industry. However, these rules and regulations cannot\nspecifically provide for all abnormal or unusual conditions; nor can they\nspecifically detail all methods for achieving compliance. Approved alternate\nmethods may be used provided that all work performed within the scope of this\n\nPart shall meet or exceed the safety standards expressed or implied\nherein. (c) If a waiver of or\ndeviation from the application of any rules prescribed in this Part is\nindicated because of special facts, application may be made to the department\nfor a waiver of or deviation from any rule in this Part. Each application shall\ninclude a full and comprehensive justification for the requested waiver or\ndeviation. (d) Except where\notherwise indicated, this Part is not applied retroactively to existing\ninstallations insofar as design, fabrication, installation, and testing are\nconcerned. The provisions of this Part are, however, applicable to existing\nfacilities that are reconstructed, relocated, or reactivated, or that are\nconsidered for an increase in maximum operating pressure. (e) This Part does not apply to: (1)\ntransportation of liquid petroleum\nthrough interstate pipelines regulated under 49 CFR\n195; (2)\nliquid petroleum refining, handling, processing, transfer, or storage facilities licensed under article 12 of the\n\nNavigation Law or registered under 6 NYCRR Part\n612\nincluding pipelines, or\nportions thereof, within the property boundaries of such facilities; and\n(3)\nliquid petroleum production\nfacilities.
