If an application is accepted by telephone, the lender shall\nmail, deliver or transmit by electronic media the required disclosure statement\nwithin three business days. (b) In the case of a balloon-payment mortgage\nloan, the disclosure required to be given pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection shall include the following notice, or a notice to like effect, as\napplicable, which notice may be given in writing or via electronic media and\nwhich shall also be included in the loan contract: THE TERM OF THE LOAN IS ________ YEARS.

THE LENDER HAS NO OBLIGATION TO REFINANCE THIS LOAN AT THE\nEND OF ITS TERM. THEREFORE, YOU MAY BE REQUIRED TO REPAY THE LOAN OUT OF ASSETS\nYOU OWN OR YOU MAY HAVE TO FIND ANOTHER LENDER WILLING TO REFINANCE THE\nLOAN. ASSUMING THIS LENDER OR ANOTHER LENDER REFINANCES THIS LOAN\nAT MATURITY, YOU WILL PROBABLY BE CHARGED INTEREST AT MARKET RATES PREVAILING\nAT THAT TIME AND SUCH RATES MAY BE HIGHER THAN THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON THIS\nLOAN. YOU MAY ALSO HAVE TO PAY SOME FOR ALL OF THE CLOSING COSTS NORMALLY\nASSOCIATED WITH A NEW MORTGAGE LOAN. If the lender guarantees refinancing of the loan for\nadditional terms until the principal balance has been repaid but does not\nprovide for the recalculation of the interest rate at the time of each\nrefinancing according to a pre-specified index, the disclosures and the loan\ncontract shall include the following notice or a notice to like effect, as\napplicable, which notice may be given in writing or via electronic\nmedia: THE TERM OF THE LOAN IS ________ YEARS. AT MATURITY, ________YEARS FROM THE DATE ON WHICH THE LOAN IS MADE, AND AT TIME OF EACH\nFURTHER REFINANCING, THE LOAN WILL BE REFINANCED AT AN INTEREST RATE\nESTABLISHED BY THE LENDER WITH REFERENCE TO MARKET RATES. SUCH INTEREST RATE(S)\nMAY BE HIGHER THAN THE INTEREST RATE PAID ON THIS LOAN. In addition, at the time it commits itself to make the loan, the lender must inform the applicant in writing or via electronic media of the\nprincipal balance which will be due at maturity of the loan or the initial term\nof the loan (assuming all scheduled principal payments, if any, are made in\naccordance with the loan contract and the fact that the borrower will receive\nnotice of maturity in writing or, where the borrower has consented in advance, via electronic media from the lender and the time periods within which such\nnotice will be sent). (c) In the case of a graduated payment mortgage loan, the disclosures required\npursuant to subdivision (a) of this section shall include a disclosure that the\ninterest costs for the loan will be higher than the interest costs for a\nfixed-rate amortizing loan of the same term and for the same amount, together\nwith an explanation for this result. (d) In the case of a pledged-account mortgage\nloan, the disclosures required pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section\nshall include an example of the difference in interest cost between a loan\nsecured by property and a savings account and a loan secured by property\nalone.

In those instances in\nwhich a hard-copy of the disclosure is not mailed to the applicant, the lender\nmust be able to demonstrate that information was obtained as to the applicant's\ncomputer capacity to down-load and print such disclosure.
