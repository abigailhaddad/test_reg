  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 182.9 - Request for determination whether activity is subject to regulation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person\nproposing an activity or any entity with regulatory oversight over a proposed\nactivity may request a determination from the department as to whether the\nproposed activity is likely to result in the take or taking of any species\nlisted as endangered or threatened in this Part and is therefore subject to\nregulation under this Part. Failure to ask the department for such a\ndetermination does not remove the subject activity from the potential for\nregulation under this Part. (b) A\nrequest for a determination under subdivision (a) of this section shall be\ndirected to the appropriate regional permit administrator, shall be in writing\nand shall, at a minimum, contain a full description of the activity being\nproposed that includes a proposed site plan showing the limits of disturbance\nand a map of the location of the proposed activity that includes the address\nand tax parcel identification. (c) Department response to request for determination. (1)\n\nWithin 30 calendar days of receipt of a\nrequest for determination, the department shall provide a written answer to the\nperson making the request stating whether the proposed activity is subject to\nregulation under this Part, requesting additional information necessary to make\nsuch a determination, or advising that one or more of the factors cited in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision require an extension of the 30-day time\nperiod. (2)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines that the proposed activity is subject to regulation under this Part, the department's response must describe the take or taking that may result from\nthe proposed activity, including any adverse modification of habitat and/or\ninterference with or impairment of an essential behavior of a species listed as\nendangered or threatened in section 182.5 of this Part. (3)\n\nIn the event that weather, the subject\nspecies' essential behavior, habitat conditions or other environmental factors\nprevent the department from making a determination within 30 calendar days, it\nmay extend such time period until a determination can be made. (4)\n\nIf the department determines the proposed\nactivity is not subject to regulation under this Part, the department's\ndetermination is valid for one year from date of issuance as long as there are\nno changes to the activities or locations proposed in the jurisdictional\nrequest and no federally listed species are confirmed within the project\nfootprint prior to the expiration of one year. (d) All determinations made under this\nsection will be kept on file at the appropriate regional office for three\nyears. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
