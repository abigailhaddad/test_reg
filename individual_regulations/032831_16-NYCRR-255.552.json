  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.552 - Notification requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nmaximum allowable operating pressure of any transmission line, or main\noperating at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or above, shall not be raised or\nlowered without submitting a letter of intent at least 60 days prior to any\nproposed change of said certified operating pressure. Where the letter of\nintent indicates a decrease in the maximum allowable operating pressure, a\nstatement of explanation is to be included. All procedures involved in the\nrecertification project shall be in accordance with these requirements. In the\nevent of an emergency, verbal permission may be obtained, but the written\napplication must be filed promptly. (b) In addition, any operator proposing to\nincrease the maximum allowable operating pressure of a pipeline which was\noriginally constructed to operate at a pressure of less than 125 psig (862 kPa)\nto a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or more shall comply with the reporting\nrequirement of subdivision (a) of this section. If the increase in pressure is\nproposed within three years of the initial operation of a pipeline which, at\nthe higher pressure proposed, would fall within the definition of major utility\ntransmission facility as set forth in section\n120\n(2)\nof the Public Service Law, a hearing will\nbe held on the proposed increase, unless such hearing is waived by the\ncommission on the application of staff of the department. In addition with\nrespect to any such increase, the operator shall, in addition to the reporting\nrequirements set forth above, provide in writing to staff the basis of the need\nfor the increase, a discussion of how the increase will serve the public\ninterest, convenience and necessity, and such assurance as staff may require, including documentation, that no undue hazard will result from operation of the\nline at the higher pressure. (c) At\nleast 60 days prior to increasing the maximum allowable operating pressure of a\ndistribution system above the limits set below, the operator shall submit a\nletter of intent. In the event of an emergency, verbal permission may be\nobtained, but the written notification must be filed promptly. (1)\n\nIf the maximum allowable operating\npressure is between 1/2 psig (3.4 kPa) and 60 psig (414 kPa), notice is\nrequired for an increase in pressure greater than six psig (41.4\nkPa). (2)\n\nIf the maximum allowable\noperating pressure is between 60 psig (414 kPa) and 124 psig (855 kPa), notice\nis required for an increase in pressure greater than 10 percent of the maximum\nallowable operating pressure. (3)\n\nConverting a low pressure distribution system to a high-pressure system not to\nexceed 124 psig (855 kPa). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.552\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
