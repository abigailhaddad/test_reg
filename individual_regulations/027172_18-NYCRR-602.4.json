  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 602.4 - Cost allocation bases\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen costs in groups of classifications or pools must be\ndistributed into subdivided classifications or component pools, the process of\nallocation must involve the application of workload measures or other bases to\nwhich the allocated costs can be reasonably compared. The bases for allocating\ncost-related factors affecting reimbursement or claiming must satisfy\nrequirements of the department or be in accord with generally accepted\naccounting principles approved by the department. A basis must be a measure by\nwhich comparisons can be made for the purpose of devising a ratio or other\nmeans of subdividing or distributing an allocated cost among classifications\napplicable to the basis and the allocated cost. (a) Subdivision bases. Subdivisions of costs\ninto component parts must employ a procedure which: (1)\nidentifies the appropriate organization\nunit of the district, based upon unit size and any unusual workload of the unit\nfor which a staff count or other normal distribution is not appropriate or\naccurate; (2)\nanalyzes the work\ncontent of the unit, including type of work performed, variability of the work\nand applicable workload units; (3)\ninstalls methods for identification of unit salary costs by separate coding of\nunit components of personnel expenditures; (4)\nimplements a statistical data collection\nmechanism for measuring workload by function or other classification; (5)\nuses classification and statistical\ncomparison for allocating costs; and\n(6)\nconforms to requirements prescribed by or\nfor the department. (b) Reference bases. Derivations of cost by reference to statistical data\ncollection mechanisms for measuring workload distribution may involve\ncomparisons to weighted time factors, random-moment observation study\nstatistics or specialized counts of work measures in quantities related to the\nallocable costs. Reference work measure bases must be comparable to the costs\nbeing allocated and may include quantities such as time, money, transactions, space, counts, distance or other reasonably related measurable units. (c) Actuarial bases. Cost allocation bases\nderived from random-moment observation studies (RMS), social services reporting\nrequirements (SSRR) or other means of actuarial computation will be used as\nrequired by the department. When cost allocation methods prescribed by the\ndepartment require the use of data developed in conjunction with a district for\nthe purpose of establishing allocation bases, the district will cooperate in\nassuring the collection of accurate data as instructed by the department. (1)\n\nFormats required by the department for\nreporting necessary data must be used. (2)\n\nDistrict personnel must participate as\nnecessary in the collection of allocation bases data. (3)\n\nNecessary data must be collected in\naccordance with instructions of the department. (4)\n\nStandards prescribed by the department\nmust be observed when data must be classified or subdivided. (5)\n\nClassification criteria will conform to\ndepartment direction when data units cannot be subdivided into discrete\ncomponents. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n602.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
