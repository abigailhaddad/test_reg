  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 103.7 - Signs and markers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Highway signs. The following signs are\napproved for use on highways with respect to ATV operation: (1)\nATV route marker. Image\n(i) The sign shall have a white legend and\nborder upon a green background which will be reflectorized. It shall be 24 x 18\ninches with a 1/2-inch border. It shall be used along highways or parts of\nhighways where the use of ATV's is permitted by official designation in\nconformance with section\n2405\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. (ii)\n\nThe ATV route marker shall be used in\ncombinations and assemblies similar to other route markers as provided in the\n\nManual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (17 NYCRR\n251.17\n-\n251.23\n) to indicate\nthe direction of permitted use. The directional arrow marker shall be mounted\nimmediately below the ATV route marker and shall have a white legend on a green\nbackground. (iii)\n\nIt shall be\nlocated at intervals as necessary to clearly mark the permitted path of travel\nand at turns in the path. The height, lateral placement and orientation shall\nconform to the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices (17 NYCRR\n201.5\n). (2)\nATV crossing\nsign. Image\n(i) The sign shall have a black legend on a\nyellow background which shall be reflectorized. The height, lateral placement\nand orientation shall conform to the Uniform Manual of Traffic Control Devices\n(17 NYCRR\n201.5\n). (ii)\n\nThis sign is\nintended to warn traffic of a reasonably well defined ATV trail crossing where\nconditions such as sight distance and number of ATV's crossing warrant such\nuse. This sign shall not be used in advance of a public intersection where an\nintersection sign may be warranted, nor where other warning signs indicate the\nexistence of the crossing. (iii)\n\nThe standard sign shall be 30 x 30 inches with a 1/2-inch margin and a 3/8-inch\nborder. A larger sign, 36 x 36 inches with a 5/8-inch margin and a 7/8-inch\nborder, may be used where greater emphasis of visibility is required. A smaller\nsign, 24 x 24 inches with a 3/8-inch margin and a 5/8-inch border, may be used\non highways having no more than one moving lane of traffic in each direction, where approach speeds are low and where physical conditions make the use of a\nstandard size impractical as a ground-mounted sign. (iv)\n\nThis sign is in posting category I set\nforth in 17 NYCRR\n230.2. Advance posting distances should be measured from the\nnear side of the crossing. (b) Off-highway. Any sign used off-highway\nwith respect to ATV operation shall be the appropriate sign as specified in\nthis section and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (17 NYCRR Parts\n200\n-\n302\n) which would be used with respect to such operation on a public\nhighway. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n103.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
