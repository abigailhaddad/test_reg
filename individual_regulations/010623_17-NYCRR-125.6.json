  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 125.6 - Layout of major commercial driveways\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is impossible to standardize driveway design in the major commercial\ncategory. Each shall be individually considered in detail. The resulting design\ncould range from one typical of a minor commercial driveway to one based on\nhigh-type intersection design principles. (b) Entrances to large traffic generators\nsuch as shopping centers, industrial plants, etc. may require additional\nacceleration, deceleration, storage, or turning lanes on the State highway to\naccommodate the increased traffic flow caused by their presence. Prior to\nissuance of the permit, the amount of increased traffic flow should be\npredicted by a documented traffic study which is the responsibility of the\npermit applicant. In conducting the traffic study, appropriate design hour and\ndesign year trip generation units shall be used. While traffic volumes for a\nfactory or an office building may, in some cases, be estimated on the basis of\nthe number of employees, a different land use, such as a shopping center, requires a different trip generation unit. (c) Improvements to the State highway to\nfacilitate safe and unimpeded traffic flow are part of the work required under\nthe work permit and their completion shall be the responsibility of the\nproperty owner or developer. Where the width of the highway right-of-way is\ninsufficient to permit the construction of such improvements, the property\nowner should grant additional right-of-way to the department. (d) The type of vehicle using the driveway\nshall be considered in driveway design. Industrial and commercial driveways\nused by large trucks should have adequate width, radii and pavement thickness\nto accommodate the appropriate design vehicle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n125.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
