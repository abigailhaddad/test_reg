  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 1.1 - Acceptance of warrants to purchase stock of corporate borrowers\n\nState Regulations\nA State bank requested confirmation that a proposed loan\ntransaction in which X, a New York business corporation, would issue warrants\nto purchase its common stock to several banks for exercise over a five year\nperiod would not violate any regulation or policy of the New York State Banking\n\nDepartment. The bank stated that it would not exercise the warrants issued to\nit in the transaction but that it intended to retain the warrants for its own\naccount. Its letter included the following discussion of New York law: Regarding the applicable provisions of the Banking Law, it is\nsubmitted that the power to acquire warrants by a New York banking corporation\nin the manner contemplated derives from Section 96-1, the general banking\npowers clause, as an 'incidental power * * * necessary to carry on the business\nof banking.' Acquisition of the warrants is not prohibited by Section 97\nrelating to acquisitions by banks of stock of any corporation, because warrants\nare not 'stock'. The bank will not exercise such warrants, and will thus never\nown stock in [X]\nFinally, the provisions of Section\n108\nof the Banking\n\nLaw and Section 190.4 of the Penal Law regarding interest rates do not prohibit\nthe proposed transaction. The warrants are in the nature of prepaid 'interest'\nas a 'charge * * * incidental to * * * making any such loan,' but their present\nvalue, together with the annual interest on the notes of 1/2% over the prime\nrate, will be substantially below the 25% usury ceiling applicable to corporate\nborrowers.\"\nThe bank was advised that the transaction as outlined did not\nviolate any present regulation or policy of the department. The bank was\nfurther advised that the department agreed with its view of the applicable\nprovisions of the New York Banking Law. The department stated its intention, however, to examine\ncarefully all significant credits involving the issuance of warrants to\npurchase the common stock of a borrower, because equity arrangements of this\nkind are frequently made with prospective borrowers of less than adequate\ncredit standing. In this regard, the department noted with satisfaction the\nbank's express statement that the credit-worthiness of the borrower in the\nproposed transaction and its ability to repay the principal amount of the loan\nhad been determined \"without reference to any value of the warrants\" to be\nissued. DATED: November 13, 1969\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
