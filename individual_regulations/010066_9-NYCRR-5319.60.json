  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.60 - Electronic table games\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll electronic table games (ETGs) shall meet the\nrequirements set forth in sections\n5319.12, 5319.13, 5319.14 and\n5319.35\nof this Part. (a) Communication protocol. Each component of\nan ETG system shall function as indicated by the communication protocol\nimplemented. All protocols shall use communication techniques that have proper\nerror detection and/or recovery mechanisms that are designed to prevent\nunauthorized access or tampering, employing data encryption standards or\nequivalent encryption with secure seeds or algorithms. Any alternative measures\nshall require approval of the commission in writing. (b) System integrity. The server or system\ncomponent or components shall reside in a secure area where access is limited\nto authorized staff as set forth in the gaming facility licensee's approved\nsystem of internal controls. Access to the logic components of the game shall\nbe logged on the system or on a computer or other logging device that resides\noutside the secure area and is not accessible to the employee or employees\ngaining access to the secure area. (1)\n\nThe\nlogged data shall include time and date and user login. (2)\n\nThe resulting logs shall be retained for\na minimum of 90 days. (c) RNG. Each RNG shall meet the requirements\nset forth in section\n5319.35\nof this Part and the\nfollowing requirements: (1)\n\nIn the game\nselection process: (i) each possible\npermutation or combination of game elements that produces winning or losing\ngame outcomes shall be available for random selection at the initiation of each\nplay, unless otherwise denoted by the game; (ii)\nafter selection of the game outcome, the\nETG shall not make a variable secondary decision that affects the result shown\nto the player; and\n(iii)\nan ETG\nshall use protocols that effectively protect the RNG and random selection\nprocess from influence by associated equipment that may be communicating with\nthe ETG. (2)\n\nThe RNG\nshall be cycled continuously in the background between games and during game\nplay at a speed that cannot be timed by the player. Periods when the RNG may\nnot be cycled (e.g., interrupts) shall be kept to a minimum. (3)\n\nThe first seed shall be determined\nrandomly by an uncontrolled event such that the seed randomly changes after\nevery game. A licensed manufacturer is not required to use a random seed so\nlong as such manufacturer shall ensure that games do not synchronize. (4)\n\nGames depicting cards being\ndrawn from a deck shall meet the following requirements: (i) at the start of each hand, the cards\nshall be drawn from a randomly shuffled deck; (ii)\nreplacement cards shall not be drawn\nuntil needed and allow for multi-deck and depleting decks in accordance with\ngame rules; (iii)\ncards once\nremoved from the deck shall not be returned to the deck except as provided by\nthe rules of the game depicted; and\n(iv)\nas cards are removed from the deck, such\ncards shall be used immediately as directed by the rules of the game. (d) Maintenance of\ncritical memory. Critical memory storage may be maintained by the player\nterminal or the system, where applicable. (e) Player interface terminal requirements. Player interface terminals may either be a display mechanism where the system\nperforms all operations of the game (also known as thin client) or a mechanism\nthat contains its own logic function in conjunction with the ETG (also known as\nthick client). Such player interface terminals shall meet the hardware and\nsoftware requirements set forth in this Part. (f) Notification of non-compliance. A gaming\nfacility shall report any requirements that cannot be met as a result of manual\nintervention from a live dealer to the commission prior to submission for\nrequired testing as set forth in Part 5318 of this Subchapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.60\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 28, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 52, eff. 12/28/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
