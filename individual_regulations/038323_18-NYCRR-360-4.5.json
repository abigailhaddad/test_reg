In determining the initial or continuing eligibility of any person\napplying for or receiving MA, there must be included in the amount of income\nand resources considered available to such person the maximum amount of\npayments that may be permitted to be distributed under the terms of an\nMA-qualifying trust, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee or\ntrustees. For purposes of this subdivision, an MA-qualifying trust is a trust\nor similar legal device established by a person or by his/her spouse (the\ngrantor or grantors) other than by will, under which the grantor may be the\nbeneficiary of all or part of the payments from the trust and under which one\nor more trustees are permitted to exercise any discretion with respect to the\ndistribution to the grantor. (1)\n\nThis section\napplies without regard to: (i) whether the\nMA-qualifying trust is irrevocable or is established for purposes other than to\nenable a grantor to qualify for MA; or\n(ii)\nwhether the trustee actually exercise\ndiscretion with respect to the distribution of payments to the\ngrantor.

In the case of a trust which contains the assets of an individual and of\nanother person or persons, the provisions of this subdivision apply to the\nportion of a trust's assets which are attributable to the individual. (1)\n\nIrrevocable trusts created by an\napplicant/recipient.

The date of the transfer in such cases is the date the trust is\nestablished or, if later, the date on which payment to the applicant/recipient\nis foreclosed under the terms of the trust agreement. (ii)\n\nAny portion of the trust principal, and\nof the income generated from the trust, which can be paid to or for the benefit\nof the applicant/recipient, under any circumstances, must be considered to be\nan available resource. (iii)\n\nPayments made from the trust to or for the benefit of the applicant/recipient\nmust be considered to be available income in the month paid.

(b) A trust containing the assets of a\ndisabled individual if: the trust is established and managed by a non-profit\nassociation which maintains separate accounts for the benefit of disabled\nindividuals, but for purposes of investment and management of trust funds, pools the accounts; each account in the trust is established solely for the\nbenefit of a disabled individual by the individual, by the parent, grandparent, or legal guardian of the individual, or by a court of competent jurisdiction; and upon the individual's death amounts remaining in the individual's account\nwhich are not retained by the trust must be paid to the State up to the total\nvalue of all MA paid on behalf of the individual.

(iii)\nA trustee of a trust described in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, in order to fulfill his or her fiduciary\nobligations with respect to the State's remainder interest in the trust, must: (a) notify the appropriate social services\ndistrict of the creation or funding of the trust for the benefit of an MA\napplicant/recipient; (b) notify the\nsocial services district of the death of the beneficiary of the\ntrust; (c) notify the social\nservices district in advance of any transactions tending to substantially\ndeplete the principal of the trust, in the case of a trust valued at more than\n$100,000; for purposes of this clause, the trustee must notify the district of\ndisbursements from the trust in excess of the following percentage of the trust\nprincipal and accumulated income: five percent for trusts over $100,000 up to\n$500,000; 10 percent for trusts valued over $500,000 up to $1,000,000; and 15\npercent for trusts over $1,000,000; (d) notify the social services district in\nadvance of any transactions involving transfers from the trust principal for\nless than fair market value; and\n(e) provide the social services district with\nproof of bonding if the assets of the trust at any time equal or exceed\n$1,000,000, unless that requirement has been waived by a court of competent\njurisdiction, and provide proof of bonding if the assets of the trust are less\nthan $1,000,000, if required by a court of competent jurisdiction. (iv)\nA social services district or\nthe department may commence a proceeding under section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law against the trustee of a trust described in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph, if the district or the department considers any acts, omissions, or failures of the trustee to be inconsistent with the terms of the\ntrust, contrary to applicable laws or regulations (including but not limited to\nthis paragraph), or contrary to the fiduciary obligations of the\ntrustee. (c) Trusts created by will. Payments made from the trust to the applicant or\nrecipient are available income in the month received. Neither the principal of\nsuch a trust nor any in-kind benefits received by the applicant or recipient as\na result of disbursements from the trust will be counted as or deemed to be\navailable income or resources for purposes of determining MA\neligibility. (d) Any provision of a\ntrust created on or after April 2, 1992 is void if it directly or indirectly\nlimits, suspends, terminates, or diverts the principal, income, or beneficial\ninterest of the grantor or grantor's spouse in the event that the grantor or\ngrantor's spouse applies for MA or requires medical care, without regard to the\nirrevocability of the trust or the purpose for which the trust was created. The\nbeneficial interest of the grantor or grantor's spouse includes any income or\nprincipal amounts to which the grantor or grantor's spouse would be entitled\nunder the terms of the trust, by right or in the discretion of the trustee, assuming the full exercise of discretion by the trustee. (e) The provisions of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, with respect to trusts created on or after August 11, 1993, also apply\nto legal instruments and other devices similar to trusts created on or after\n\nAugust 11, 1993. A legal instrument or other device is similar to a trust if, attendant upon its creation, assets are put under the control of an individual\nor entity with fiduciary obligations to manage such assets for the benefit of a\ndesignated beneficiary or beneficiaries. Legal instruments and devices subject\nto the provisions of subdivision (b) of this section include, but are not\nlimited to, escrow accounts, investment accounts, and pension funds. Notes\nN.Y.
