  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 862.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of this Part an item number is assigned to\neach specifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I of this Part shall mean that number or abbreviation which\nhas been assigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for\nthe purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, a stream or large lake, is referred to by name or\nabbreviation. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively as they are\nencountered, such number being preceded by the letter P. This system also\ninvolves the consecutive numbering of tributaries as they enter a stream, progressing upstream from the mouth. Tributaries of lakes or ponds are numbered\nconsecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from\nits outlet or mouth. Isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index\nnumber merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the Hudson watershed in 1936 and has been closely followed\nin connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on the older maps employed by the\n\nConservation Department at the time of its 1936 survey but not shown on newer\nmaps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps\nbut appearing on the newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to\nthe identification of waters in the Hudson River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName of waters\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from The Battery, New York City. H-95\n\nFishkill Creek\n\nThe ninety-fifth tributary of the Hudson River in\n\nNew York State above The Battery (Map O-24sw). H-95-5\n\nClove Creek\n\nThe fifth tributary entering Fishkill Creek\nupstream from its mouth (Map O-24sw). H-95-5-2-P 345k\n\nLake Valhalla\n\nOne of several ponds or lakes encountered between\nthe 345th and 346th pond of the waters index system, and specifically located\nin the drainage basin of the 2nd tributary of Clove Creek upstream from its\nmouth (Map O-24sw). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib. and\ntribs. indicating\ntributary\nand\ntributaries, and the terms\nsubtributary\nand\nsubtributaries\nshall mean any stream, pond or other body of\nsurface water which flows into any other stream, pond, or other body of surface\nwater; where no tributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are\nmentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, pond, or other body of water referenced by such waters index number; where a\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary or subtributaries are mentioned after the\nwaters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, pond, or other body of water referenced by such waters index number and\nall tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference\nmaps, excluding numbered ponds, unless exceptions are expressly\nstated. (d) Name\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean the name by which the\nspecifically designated waters are known and which name may appear on the\nreference maps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named waters to which the unnamed waters are tributary are identified as\nfar as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no., as appearing in table I of this Part, means map reference number\nand indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. The following maps were produced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey, Silver Spring, Maryland. (1)\n\nMap Ref.

(h) Standards, as appearing\nin table I of this Part and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C, or D opposite\neach specifically designated waters, shall mean the quality standards\nestablished for class AA, A, B, C, or D, as the case may be, as set forth in\n\nPart 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any class\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus\nand\n\nThymallus. (j) All streams or other bodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural\nwaters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated\nin table I of this Part, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of\nquality and purity as the specifically designated waters to which they are\ndirectly tributary. (k) All streams\nor other bodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall\nbe assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the\nreference maps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the\nwaters to which it is directly tributary. (l) The Hudson River drainage basin shall be\ndeemed to include the following areas: all land and water areas, the natural\nsurface water drainage from which is directly or indirectly tributary to the\n\nHudson River. (m) Notwithstanding\nthe items indicated in table I of this Part and the aforementioned special\nconditions statements which, in some instances, may indicate assignment of\nclassifications for waters contained within the boundaries of the State-owned\nforest preserve lands and, therefore, controlled under the provisions of the\n\nState Constitution and the Environmental Conservation Law, such waters are\nhereby excluded from classification to the extent that any part of such waters\nmay be located within the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve lands. All waters within 100 feet of the boundaries of the State-owned forest preserve\nlands are hereby assigned to class A with standard of quality and purity for\nclass A. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
