Tit. 9 § 5008.12 - Ticket sales for variations of the Lotto game\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The price for each wager in any variation\nof the Lotto game shall be determined by the commission. (b) A play card is not a valid receipt for\nany game played. The bet ticket is the only valid receipt. (c) No claimant will be considered eligible\nto receive a prize without presentation of a valid winning bet\nticket. (d) If for any reason, a\nbet ticket is not entirely legible or is misprinted or altered in any way, then\nthe computer record created at the time of sale will be the sole method of\ndetermining whether such ticket is a valid winning ticket. (e) A bet ticket for any variation of the\n\nLotto game may not be canceled once issued by the computer terminal. However, the agent may receive credit for any unreadable bet ticket issued, as these\ntickets (although unreadable) are recorded on the computer file as valid\nbets. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5008.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
