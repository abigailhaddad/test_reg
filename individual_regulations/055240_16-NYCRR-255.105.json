  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.105 - Design formula for steel pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndesign pressure for steel pipe is determined in accordance with the following\nformula: P = (2 St/D) x F x E x T\nP =Design pressure in pounds per square inch (kPa)\ngauge. S =Yield strength in pounds per square inch (kPa)\ndetermined in accordance with section\n255.107\nof this Part. D =Nominal outside diameter of the pipe in inches\n(millimeters). t =Nominal wall thickness of the pipe in inches\n(millimeters). If this is unknown, it is determined in accordance with section\n255.109\nof this Part. Additional\nwall thickness required for concurrent external loads in accordance with\nsection\n255.103\nof this Part may not be\nincluded in computing design pressure. F =Design factor determined in accordance with section\n255.111\nof this Part. E =Longitudinal joint factor determined in accordance\nwith section\n255.113\nof this Part. T =Temperature derating factor determined in accordance\nwith section\n255.115\nof this Part. (b) If steel pipe that has been\nsubjected to cold expansion to meet the SMYS is subsequently heated, other than\nby welding or stress relieving as a part of welding, the design pressure is\nlimited to 75 percent of the pressure determined under subdivision (a) of this\nsection if the temperature of the pipe exceeds 900° F (482° C) at any\ntime or is held above 600° F (316° C) for more than one hour. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.105\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
