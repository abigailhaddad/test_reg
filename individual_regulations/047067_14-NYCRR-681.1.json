Tit. 14 § 681.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon the\neffective date of this section [March 15, 1989], OPWDD (see glossary, section\n681.13\nof this Part) will utilize\nthe requirements contained in\n42 CFR\n483, 42 CFR\n456 and Parts 624 and 633 of\nthis Title as the primary basis for issuing an operating certificate pursuant\nto article 16 of the Mental Hygiene Law in the class of facility known as\nintermediate care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Where CFR 483 is more restrictive than Part 624 or 633, it shall be\ncontrolling. (b) The Federal\nrequirements referenced in subdivision (a) of this section are section 42 CFR\n483\nas published in the June 3 edition of the\n\nFederal Register\n(vol. 53, pages 20494-20505) and section 42 CFR\n456, Utilization\n\nControl for Intermediate Care Facilities; 46 CFR\n(page 48561)\npublished October 1, 1981 and as amended at\n50 CFR\n(page 33034) published\n\nAugust 16, 1985. They are available from the United States Government Printing\n\nOffice, Superintendent of Documents, Washington, DC 20402. (c) The Federal requirements referenced in\nsubdivision (a) of this section are also available and may be reviewed in\nperson during regular business hours at the: (1)\n\nNew York State Department of State, 99\n\nWashington Avenue, Albany, NY 12231; or by appointment at the: (2)\n\nNew York State Office for People with\n\nDevelopmental Disabilities, Public Information Office, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. (d) Additional requirements deemed to be necessary by OPWDD for this class of\nfacility are contained in this Part and/or in other general regulations of the\ncommissioner which are applicable to all classes of facility. (e) Conformance with the Federal and State\nstandards referenced herein shall be verified through periodic surveys by OPWDD\nin accordance with\n42 CFR\n442.30\nand the Mental Hygiene Law. The\n\nFederal requirement referenced previously as section\n42 CFR\n442.30\nas amended, is published in the June\n3, 1988 edition of the\n\nFederal Register\n(vol. 53, page 20495). It is available from the United States Government Printing Office, Superintendent of Documents, Washington, DC 20402. (f) Intermediate care facilities for\nindividuals with intellectual disabilities may include Small Residential Units\n(SRU) constructed on State-owned land. Such SRU's while remaining institutional\nplacements for census-counting purposes, shall be required to meet all\nstandards mandated by this Part and shall hold a site-specific operating\ncertificate in accordance therewith. Additional standards applicable to SRU's\nare found in section\n681.10\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (g) SRU's are limited\ncapacity, (see glossary, section\n681.13\nof this Part) discrete\nliving units designed for the purpose of providing small residential group\nsettings. They are being considered for location on the grounds of: (1)\nJ.N. Adam Developmental Center; (2)\n\nLong Island Developmental\n\nCenter; (3)\n\nRome Developmental\n\nCenter; and\n(4)\n\nSunmount\n\nDevelopmental Center. Nothing here shall preclude SRU development at other\n\nState-owned property pending the appropriate approvals, nor shall anything here\npreclude the operation of an SRU by a voluntary agency provider. (h) Small residential\nunit facilities shall be designed to provide a more normalized and less\nrestrictive living alternative for people with developmental disabilities. Such\nSRU placements shall be for persons for whom a community residential placement\ncannot be made available in a timely manner and for whom the SRU placement\nprovides an experience in small group living which could facilitate placement\ninto the community at large. (i) For SRU's not beyond the preliminary design stage as of the effective date of\nthese amendments, OPWDD will ensure that local officials and other interested\nparties are formally consulted. (j) The intent shall be to incorporate those features into the design and operation\nof small residential units to facilitate integration into the community at\nlarge. Thus, there shall be an effectively functioning neighborhood advisory\ncommittee. (k) Intermediate care\nfacilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities may include Extended\n\nTreatment Units (ETUs), operated by OPWDD. ETUs, while remaining institutional\nplacements for census-counting purposes, shall be required to meet all\nstandards mandated by this Part and shall hold a site-specific operating\ncertificate in accordance therewith. (1)\nETUs\nare limited capacity (see glossary, section\n681.99\nof this Part) residential\nprograms that may include discrete living units. (2)\nETUs shall have the following\ncharacteristics: (a) Provide specialized\nresidential services to individuals who: (i) Meet criteria for admission to intermediate care facilities for individuals\nwith intellectual disabilities; (ii)\n\nHave co-occurring psychiatric or behavioral health disorders; (iii)\n\nAre age twenty-one (21) or\nolder; (b) Promote\nbehavioral and psychiatric stabilization; (c) Serve as a transitional living\narrangement; and\n(d) Facilitate\ncommunity reintegration. (3)\n\nAll admissions to an ETU shall require\nthe prior approval of the commissioner, or designee, and necessitate that all\ncriteria for admission to an ETU, as specified by OPWDD, have been\nmet. (4)\n\nThe length of stay at an\nETU shall be in increments of thirty (30) days up to a maximum of six (6)\nmonths, absent approval by the commissioner for an extension of stay. Such\nextensions shall only be granted upon a finding by the commissioner, or\ndesignee, that there exist compelling circumstances which warrant an extension. Extensions shall only be approved in increments of thirty (30)\ndays. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
