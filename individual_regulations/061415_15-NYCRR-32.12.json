  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 32.12 - Insurance information accompanying id cards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) At the time that ID cards are issued to a\npolicyholder by or on behalf of an insurance company in conjunction with the\noriginal issuance of a policy an insurer shall provide the policyholder with\nthe insurance information set forth in section\n32.12\n(b) of this\n\nPart. An insurance company or producer may provide this information to a\npolicyholder at any other time including in conjunction with policy renewals or\nvehicle endorsements as may be deemed appropriate. (b) Important insurance information for\npolicyholders. (1)\n\nFinancial security\n(insurance) shall be maintained without interruption during the entire\nregistration period regardless of whether the vehicle is driven. (2)\n\nLicense plates must be surrendered before\ninsurance is cancelled or suspended without exception. This is compliance with\n\nNew York State law. Surrendering license plates before cancellation of\ninsurance will prevent communications from DMV based on cancellation that\ninsurers are required by law report to DMV. (3)\n\nPolicyholders moving from New York State\nmust coordinate the surrender of New York State license plates and cancellation\nof a New York State insurance policy with obtaining a new registration and\ninsurance policy in another state. Again, this will prevent DMV communications\nbased on cancellation reported by insurers. (4)\n\nInsurers must provide policyholders with\nat least two identical ID cards for each vehicle insured. ID cards represent\nthat insurance is provided for the named insured and the described vehicle, as\napplicable, as of the effective date shown thereon. (5)\n\nEncrypted 2D bar codes on ID cards\ncontain tamper proof security features that prevent ID card fraud. The bar code\ncontains information about the policy, effective dates of coverage and issuance\ndate, registrant name and address, vehicle description (as applicable) and the\nissuer of the ID card. (6)\n\nSome\ninsurers and agents are using software that allows ID cards to be either\ne-mailed or faxed. Successful faxing requires equipment in good working order\nboth sending and receiving. Faxed ID cards are only acceptable if the ID card\ncontains a large faxable bar code that scans (is readable). (7)\n\nPolicyholders should check to be sure\nthat the name and the vehicle identification number (VIN) on all ID cards are\nidentical to the name and VIN on all the registrations. Policyholders should\nimmediately notify their agent and/or insurer of any discrepancies. Agents\nand/or insurer must issue corrected ID card and change policy records\naccordingly. (8)\n\nPolicyholders must\nkeep one ID card in the vehicle at all times. (9)\n\nAn ID card must, upon demand, be shown to\na law enforcement officer, judge, hearing officer or any person with whom the\ninsured or other driver may have had an accident. In the event of an accident, the insured or driver can also demand to see the other driver's ID\ncard. (10)\n\nThe failure to produce\nan ID card at the request of a law enforcement officer is presumptive evidence\nof uninsured operation for which the driver may be given a ticket. An ID card\nmust be produced upon demand by any driver of a vehicle; not just the\nregistrant. (11)\n\nIf the second ID\ncard is not currently required for registration purposes it should be kept in a\nsafe place since it may be required to be submitted to DMV as proof of\ninsurance in the future. (12)\n\nUpon\nloss of an ID card the insured shall contact the insurance company, agent or\nbroker, not DMV. (13)\n\nAn ID card is\nonly as good as the policy that it represents. If for any reason the insurance\npolicy is terminated, then the ID cards issued in conjunction with such policy\nare void. Any use of such invalid ID cards may be a violation of law. (14)\n\nFailure to maintain liability insurance\ncoverage continuously throughout the registration period even if the vehicle is\nnot in use may result in the suspension of the registration and driving\nprivileges. Registrants if eligible may opt to pay a civil penalty for each day\nthat a vehicle was registered and uninsured one time in a three-year period if\nthe lapse in coverage does not exceed 90 days. A 20-day revocation may be\nimposed on for hire vehicles such as taxis, liveries, buses, rentals and so\nforth. (15)\n\nDriving without\ninsurance, a valid registration or driver's license is subject to severe\nsanctions under the law. A driver may be arrested and incarcerated and the\nvehicle impounded. Such driver is subject to fines and surcharges in a court of\nlaw. In cases of uninsured operation DMV will imposed mandatory revocation of\nregistration and driver's license as well as a substantial civil\npenalty. (16)\n\nFraudulent issuance\nor use of an ID card as proof of a non-existent policy is punishable as a\nmisdemeanor under New York State law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
