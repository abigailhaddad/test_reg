  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 636-1.2 - Person-centered planning process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nperson-centered planning process is a process in which, to the maximum extent\npossible, an individual directs the planning of his or her services and makes\ninformed choices about the services and supports that he or she receives. The\nplanning process guides the delivery of services and supports to an individual\nin a way that leads to outcomes or results in areas of the individual's life\nthat are most important to him or her (\ne.g., health, relationships, work, and home). (1)\n\nThe\nperson-centered planning process involves parties chosen by the individual, often known as the individual's circle of support. The parties chosen by the\nindividual participate in the process as needed, and as defined by the\nindividual, except to the extent that decision-making authority is conferred on\nanother by State law. (2)\n\nThe\nparties chosen by the individual assist the individual in decision-making by, among other things, explaining issues to be decided, answering the individual's\nquestions, encouraging the individual to actively participate in\ndecision-making and, where necessary, assisting the individual to communicate\nhis or her preferences. (3)\n\nThe\nperson-centered planning process requires that: (i) supports and services are based on the\nindividual's interests, preferences, strengths, capacities, and\nneeds; (ii)\nsupports and services\nare designed to empower the individual by fostering skills to achieve desired\npersonal relationships, community participation, dignity, and respect; and\n(iii)\nthe individual is\nsatisfied with activities, supports, and services. (4)\n\nPerson-centered planning is a\ncollaborative and recurring process between the individual and the service\nprovider. The planning process is used at the time of initial plan development\nand during reviews of the plan. (b) A person-centered planning process is\nrequired for developing the person-centered service plan (see section\n636-1.3\nof this subpart), including the HCBS Waiver service plan, with the individual and parties chosen\nby the individual. The person-centered planning process involves: (1)\nproviding necessary information and\nsupport to ensure that the individual, to the maximum extent possible, directs\nthe process and is enabled to make informed choices and decisions; (2)\nscheduling with the individual at times\nand locations of convenience to the individual; (3)\ntaking into account the cultural\nconsiderations of the individual and providing information in plain language\nand in a manner that is accessible to and understood by the individual and\nparties chosen by the individual; (4)\nproviding a method for the individual to\nrequest updates to the person-centered service plan as needed; and\n(5)\ndeveloping strategies that address\nconflicts or disagreements in the process, including clear conflict of interest\nguidelines for individuals, and communicating such strategies to the individual\nwho is receiving services as appropriate.
