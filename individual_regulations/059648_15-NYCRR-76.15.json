(c) Application. (1)\n\nApplications\nfor an instructor's certificate must be made by the person desiring such\ncertificate on forms prescribed by the commissioner and must have endorsed\nthereon the consent of a licensed drivers' school desiring to employ the\napplicant. Any applicant for an original driving instructor's certificate must\nsuccessfully complete a course in driver training and traffic safety, approved\nby the commissioner, consisting of at least 30 hours, prior to the expiration\ndate of the original certificate issued, except that if the original\ncertificate when issued will expire in less than six months, such course must\nbe completed prior to the expiration date of the first renewal certificate\nissued. The completion of such course in driver training and traffic safety\nshall not be required if the holder of a current and valid certification by the\n\nEducation Department is qualified to give driver education and training\ninstruction in the secondary or higher schools of New York, nor shall such\ncourse in driver training and safety be required of the holder of a valid\ncertificate of training issued by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation, or other\nevidence of motorcycle teacher training approved by the commissioner in order\nto be engaged in teaching motorcycle operation; and except that where the\ncourse is not available within a reasonable distance from the drivers' school, the commissioner may renew the certificate upon the condition that the\napplicant complete the first available course, but in no event shall such\ncertificate be renewed without such course more than two times. (i) If an applicant has failed to meet the\ncondition concerning completion of the required course, no subsequent original\ncertificate may be issued until such course has been successfully\ncompleted. (2)\n\nEvery\noriginal application for an instructor's certificate shall be accompanied by\nthe appropriate fee, which shall not be refunded and shall be subject to\npayment of an appropriate renewal fee by check, money order, or other payment\nmethod as prescribed by the commissioner. (3)\n\nApplicants for an instructor's\ncertificate will be required to submit one photograph at least 11/2 inches by\n11/2 inches in size taken not more than 30 days prior to the date of such\napplication or renewal thereof, and also will be subject to an investigation or\nrequired to submit additional information as the commissioner may\nprescribe. (d) An\napplicant for an original instructor's certificate will be required to submit\nto and pass special eye, written, road sign and road tests which will include a\ndemonstration of ability to instruct, and may be required to submit additional\nor other proof of his qualifications as an instructor. The written, road sign\nand road tests, as established by the commissioner, may be given by a motor\nvehicle employee or a driving instructor approved by the department to give\nthese tests pursuant to paragraph (b)(7) of this section. The vision test must\nbe conducted by a health care professional listed in section\n5.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. The applicant will be permitted two chances to qualify on each of the\ntests required on an application except for the road test. A failure on the\nroad test will void the application. (1)\nA\nperson holding a driver education instructor's certificate (MV-283) is exempt\nfrom the written and road sign tests. Such person, however, is required to take\nthe instructor's road test and vision test. (2)\n\nAn applicant for an instructor's\ncertificate must be licensed, for a minimum of two years immediately prior to\nthe date of application, to operate the type of vehicle in which they will give\ndriving instruction. Such license must include all endorsements for the\noperation of such vehicle. The applicant must not have any restrictions on such\nlicense that would prohibit operating such vehicle. Qualification on the\ninstructor's road test for an appropriate type of vehicle is also required, in\nall cases, before an instructor's certificate (MV-524) endorsed for instructing\non vehicles requiring this license class may be issued. (e) Original instructors' certificates shall\nbe valid from the date of issuance and will expire on the last day of the 12th\nmonth following the date of issuance. Upon approval of an application to renew\nan instructor's certificate, the commissioner will issue a renewal which shall\nbe valid for a two-year period from the date of issuance, except in the case\nwhere the instructor's driver license is issued by a state other than New York. In such case, the instructor's certificate shall be valid from the date of the\n\nNew York issuance and will expire on the last day of the 12th month following\nthe date of issuance. (f) An\ninstructor's certificate must be surrendered by the instructor to the drivers'\nschool employer who shall surrender it to the proper drivers' school unit in\nthe central office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New York, immediately upon termination of an instructor's services with or by any\ndrivers' school designated on such certificate. (1)\n\nAt the time of terminating any\ninstructor's services, the designated school must submit a notice on form\nMV-526 provided by the department as to the termination of such instructor's\nservices, which notice shall also set forth on the face thereof the name, address and certificate number of such instructor and the total amount of\nlogged time rendered by such instructor in behind-the-wheel instruction for the\naccount of the school. The reason or reasons for the termination of such\ninstructor's services shall be endorsed on the back of such form along with the\nparticulars thereof. A duplicate copy of such form shall be provided by the\nschool to the instructor so terminated. (2)\n\nThe surrendered instructor's certificate\nwill be returned to the instructor by the Department of Motor Vehicles upon\nrequest, without testing, if the instructor resumes employment prior to the\nexpiration of the certificate. An instructor's certificate may be renewed, without testing, within the period of one year from its date of expiration only\nif the instructor resumes employment and submits the proper forms and fee. An\napplication received more than one year from the date of expiration of the\ninstructor's certificate would be considered an original application in respect\nto the testing provisions of subdivision (d) of this section. (g) Any instructor who loses his\ncertificate must report the loss thereof immediately, in writing, to the proper\ndrivers' school unit in the central office of the Department of Motor Vehicles, Albany, New York, and a duplicate will be issued to replace a lost current\ncertificate. (h) The instructor's\ncertificate must be carried by the instructor at all times while driving\ninstructions are being given or when an instructor is accompanying an applicant\nfor a license to the road test line in a motor vehicle or motorcycle. (i) The commissioner shall not issue an\ninstructor's certificate to any person who is not employed by or associated\nwith a drivers' school licensed by the commissioner. (j) No instructor's certificate shall be\nvalid except for the purpose of the giving of instruction by the holder thereof\nin the course of his employment or association with the drivers' school\ndesignated thereon and for the account of such school. The giving of any\ninstruction for hire in violation of the foregoing provisions shall render such\ninstructor's certificate invalid and subject to forfeiture and immediate\nsurrender to the drivers' school employer for subsequent surrender to the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles. (k) Any instructor whose certificate shall be subject to surrender by reason of\ntermination of his services by the drivers' school designated thereon or whose\ncertificate shall be invalidated by reason of violation of the provisions of\nsubdivision (k) of this section, and who shall not promptly surrender such\ncertificate, shall be subject to proceedings upon reasonable notice and\ndepartmental hearing for the suspension or revocation of his instructor's\ncertificate. (l) Qualified and\nrecognized experts in the field of driver training, traffic regulation or motor\nvehicles may give occasional classroom lectures (not including the\npre-licensing course lectures) without holding a valid instructor's\ncertificate. The school shall maintain a record, indicating the name, address, qualifications of the extent and lecture date, and shall make all such records\navailable for inspection by the commissioner if he desires to inspect\nthem. (m) Denials of\ninstructor's certificate. (1)\n\nNo\napplicant, except in the discretion of the commissioner, will be issued an\ninstructor's certificate, or a renewal thereof, who has had his driver's\nlicense or his out-of-state driver's privilege suspended or revoked within the\n24 months immediately prior to the date of application either in New York State\nor any other state, except that this provision shall not apply to a temporary\nsuspension. No renewal of an instructor's certificate will be issued to an\napplicant whose last preceding instructor's certificate or any last preceding\ninstructor's certificate, if he held more than one, was not surrendered in\npursuance of the provisions of subdivision (f) or (k) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nAn application for\ninstructor's certificate or a renewal thereof may be denied, if in the\ndiscretion of the commissioner, such applicant's driving record indicates a\nlack of the qualities or competence desirable for a driving instructor. No such\ndenial shall be made for a period of less than 30 days nor more than one year, based upon the same occurrences. Any such denial shall not become final until\nafter a hearing if the applicant requests in writing within five days after\nreceipt of notice of such denial a hearing. (n) Holders of instructors' certificates may\nbe required to attend a group session at which time the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles will brief applicants on any new changes in the regulations and laws\nor new training techniques, or it may inform them with printed materials\nthrough the mail. The applicants for a renewal of an instructor's certificate\nmay also be required to submit to psycho-physical tests or to a test of their\nteaching ability. This will be done at the discretion of the commissioner based\non the applicant's past record as an instructor. (o) If an instructor possessing a current\ninstructor's certificate desires to be employed by an additional school or\nschools, an additional certificate or certificates will be issued for such\npurpose without fee. (p) An\napplicant who does not possess a high school or high school equivalency\ndiploma, but who possesses a military general equivalency diploma, may file an\napplication for an instructor's certificate, provided such application is\naccompanied by proof that the applicant has filed for a New York State high\nschool equivalency diploma. An instructor's certificate may be issued to such\nan applicant which shall be conditional upon the applicant submitting proof of\nhaving obtained a New York State high school equivalency diploma within six\nmonths from the issuance of such certificate.
