  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 54.4 - Conduct of hearings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Hearings shall be conducted by a member of the authority or any employee of the\nauthority duly designated by the authority to hold hearings, who shall be known\nas the administrative law judge. The administrative law judge shall rule upon\nmatters of procedure and introduction of evidence, and shall conduct the\nhearing in such manner as, in his discretion, will best serve the attainment of\njustice. Wherever the term hearing officer appears in the rules of the\nauthority in connection with disciplinary proceedings, it shall be deemed to\nmean and to refer to the administrative law judge. (b) (1)\n\nThe\norder of proof in hearings before the authority shall be as follows: (i) testimony by the witness or witnesses in\nsupport of the charges preferred against the licensee; (ii)\ncross-examination of such\nwitnesses; (iii)\ntestimony by the\nlicensee or his witnesses in defense and explanation; and\n(iv)\ncross-examination of the licensee and\nwitnesses. The hearing officer may, in his discretion, change the\norder of proof where the circumstances so warrant. (2)\n\nObjections may be taken to the rulings of\nthe hearing officer with the reasons for such objections, but will not be\ndeemed to have been made unless duly noted in the record. (3)\n\nMotions to dismiss may be made at the\noption of the licensee or his attorney, but are not required and will not be\ndeemed to be necessary to protect any right of the licensee. (4)\n\nThe hearing officer shall have no power\nto grant any motion to dismiss any of the charges or to the effect that the\nauthority has failed to establish a prima facie case. (c) (1)\n\nThe\nrules of evidence governing proceedings in the courts of this State shall not\nbe rigidly enforced in hearings before the authority. Unless objection is made\nand duly noted in the record, all evidence appearing in the record shall be\ndeemed to have been validly introduced for the consideration of the\nauthority. (2)\n\nThe introduction of\ncumulative evidence shall be avoided and the hearing officer may curtail the\ntestimony of any witness which he judges to be merely cumulative; however, the\nparty offering such testimony may make a short avowal of the testimony which\nwould be given and if the witness asserts that such avowal is true, this avowal\nshall be made part of the record. (3)\n\nUpon the due application to the authority\nprior to its determination, the authority may, in its discretion, reopen the\nhearing for the presentation of new or additional evidence. Such application\nmust set forth concisely the nature of this additional evidence. The authority\nmay, on its own motion, reopen a hearing for the presentation of additional\nevidence. (d) The\nhearing officer or the attorney for the authority may amend the notice of\npleading at any time before the close of the hearing or prior to a\ndetermination by the authority. If the licensee requests an adjournment based\nupon such amendment, the hearing officer may, in his discretion, grant such\nadjournment in the interest of justice when a party to such proceeding was\nsurprised by such amendment without fault on his part. (e) Parties may, by agreement, stipulate as\nto any facts involved in the proceedings, provided that such stipulation is\nduly noted in the record. (f) Oral\nargument may be made only before the hearing officer. Such oral argument may be\ncurtailed or limited by the hearing officer in his discretion and is to be\nincluded in the record. (g) After\nthe conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall make, in writing, his\nfindings as to whether the evidence sustained the charges, or any of them, preferred against the licensee, shall designate which charges he has found\nsustained by the evidence, and shall, at his option, recommend to the authority\nthe action to be taken against the licensee. A copy of such report shall be\nserved on the licensee or his attorney by first class mail prior to submission\nof such report to the authority, provided a request therefor is made on the\nrecord at the hearing. The report, when served, shall be accompanied by a\nstatement in writing advising that the recipient may controvert any of the\nfindings contained therein within the time limited in such statement. The\nrecord shall be referred, together with the hearing officer's report and any\nstatement controverting the findings contained therein, for due consideration\nand appraisal by the authority at a meeting duly held by it. (h) Subject to the supervision and control of\nthe authority, in all cases where the licensee has pleaded \"no contest\" to the\ncharge or charges, the hearing officer shall summarize the facts of the case\nand shall recommend the penalty to be imposed by the authority. (i) In the event of a hearing officer's\ndeath, resignation, removal, termination of employment, disability, or his\ninability or failure to make his written report and findings within 30 days\nafter the completion of the hearing, the chairman of the authority may direct\nthat all of the evidence taken at the hearing shall be submitted to the members\nof the authority at a regular meeting. After consideration thereof, the members\nof the authority shall make proposed written findings and mail a copy thereof\nto the licensee or his attorney and afford him an opportunity to controvert, in\nwriting, any of the proposed findings contained therein. Thereafter, after due\nconsideration of all of the foregoing, including any statement in controversion\nsubmitted by the licensee, the authority shall make final written findings and\nassess such penalty as may be deemed appropriate.
