  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1704.6 - Showers and exercise\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An\ninmate shall be permitted to shower at least three times a week. (b) An inmate shall be permitted to exercise\noutside of his or her cell for at least one hour daily, except as provided in\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section. Such exercise shall be provided\nout-of-doors, weather permitting, unless the size of the population or the\nphysical plant of the facility renders such daily exercise out-of-doors\nunfeasible. If daily exercise out-of-doors is not feasible, outdoor exercise\nshall be provided at least once every other day, indoor exercise shall be\nprovided as a substitute on those days that outdoor exercise is not available\nand the Deputy Commissioner of Correctional Facilities shall be\nnotified. (c) An inmate newly\narrived at a correctional facility will not be permitted out-of-cell activities\nuntil it is reasonably concluded that he/she has no known enemies at the\nfacility. This restriction shall not exceed five days unless extenuating\ncircumstances exist and approval is granted by the Deputy Commissioner of\n\nCorrectional Facilities or his designee. (d) An inmate who has lost recreation\nprivileges but who is not otherwise keeplocked or confined to his or her cell\nneed not be permitted the daily exercise referred to in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. However, an inmate who is on loss of recreation status and who has no\nprogram shall be permitted the daily exercise referred to in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (e) This section\nshall not be construed so as to prohibit emergency action by the superintendent\nof the facility. If necessary for the safety and security of the facility, the\nsuperintendent may suspend shower and exercise privileges for all inmates or\nfor any segment of the inmate population until the emergency has passed. In any\nsuch case the superintendent shall immediately notify the deputy commissioner\nfor correctional facilities. (f) Whenever in the judgment of the officer in charge, there is imminent danger\nthat a \"keeplock\" inmate will do injury to himself/herself or to another, if\npermitted out of the cell for a shower or exercise, the officer with the\napproval of the area supervisor, may deprive the inmate of the shower or\nexercise. A written report shall be prepared immediately and delivered to the\nsuperintendent or deputy superintendent for security indicating the reason for\nthe deprivation. In all cases the activity will be restored as soon as it can\nbe deemed consistent with safety. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
