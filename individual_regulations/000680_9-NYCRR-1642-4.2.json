  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-4.2 - Pro rata rent schedule\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Generally speaking, with respect to State-aided projects, all dwelling rents\nare payable monthly and are due on the first of each calendar month. Incoming\ntenants are ordinarily required to sign a lease agreement covering the dwelling\nunit to be occupied having a term of one month beginning on the first day of\nthe month and ending on the last day of the month and containing a provision\nrequiring the tenant to give the local agency one full month's notice of intent\nto vacate. Changes in tenancy may, however, occur on other than the first or\nlast days of the month. For accounting purposes, therefore, the initial and\nfinal charges to the tenant will be determined by the effective date of tenancy\n(for incoming tenants) and by the charge-through date (for outgoing tenants), as determined by local agency policy. These dates will not necessarily be the\nsame as the lease dates or the dates the tenant actually occupies or vacates\nthe dwelling unit. The latter dates are referred to, respectively, as the\nmove-in and move-out dates. The effective date of tenancy and the\ncharge-through, move-in, and move-out dates shall be recorded on the individual\ntenants ledger sheet. (b) For the\npurpose of readily determining the amount of rentals chargeable against tenants\nmoving into a dwelling unit, where the effective date of tenancy is other than\nthe first day of the month, or against tenants vacating a dwelling unit where\nthe charge-through date is other than the last day of the month, the local\nagency shall establish pro rata rent schedules for 28-, 29-, 30-, and 31-day\nmonths covering each anticipated basic rent charge in the dwelling rent\nschedule. Similar pro rata rent schedules should be established, where\npossible, for each anticipated rent surcharge. Where such is not possible, the\nrent surcharge for a fractional part of a month shall be computed on the same\nprinciples as are employed in constructing a pro rata schedule. In preparing a\npro rata rent schedule, a daily rental rate is first determined by dividing the\nmonthly rental charge by the number of days in the month, carrying the figure\nout to five decimal places. The proportionate rental for a fractional part of a\nmonth is then determined by multiplying the daily rental rate by the number of\ndays in the fraction. A specimen pro rata rent schedule for a 30-day month\nfollows: Pro Rata Rent Schedule for Fractional Parts of a\n30-day Month\n\nBasic monthly\nrent\n\nDay of\nmonth\n\nNo. of days\n13.25\n15.25\n17.95\n19.95\n1\n30\n13.25\n15.25\n17.95\n19.95\n2\n29\n12.81\n14.74\n17.35\n19.29\n3\n28\n12.37\n14.23\n16.75\n18.62\nx x x x x x x\n29\n2.88\n1.02\n1.20\n1.33\n30\n1.44.51.60.67\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
