  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-5.2 - Rent collection\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Tenants\nin occupancy. (1)\n\nPayment of rent promptly by\ntenants can be made a matter of habit. This fact should be emphasized at all\ntimes, and most strongly in the case of new tenants. Thus, at time of\nprospective tenant's interview, managers should stress emphatically that rent\nis payable on first day of month and that late payment will not be tolerated. Tenants who allege inability to pay rent because of financial difficulties\nshould be referred to the bureau of welfare or other social agency during first\nmonth of delinquency rather than granting a delay in payment, so that no\nproblem in paying back rent develops. (2)\n\nIn the event that rent payment is not\nmade properly, a three-day notice should be served as soon as the authority\ndeems advisable, but not later than the 10th of the month. At expiration of\nthree-day period, summary proceedings should be initiated without delay. Under\nsupervision of counsel, precept and petition can be prepared by the manager or\na member of his staff. Counsel for the authority should continue to prosecute\nproceeding unless full payment from tenant has been received within prescribed\ntime. (3)\n\nTenant may be charged for\nservice and filing fees in connection with such proceedings, as well as any\ncourt costs authorized under the law. Where rules and regulations do not\nclearly set forth this fact, they should be revised to include such\nprovision. (4)\n\nIt is the\nresponsibility of the manager to see that proceedings are diligently followed, up to point of eviction if necessary, and that counsel pursues collection of\nany judgment rendered by the court. The responsibility of the manager by no\nmeans ends when the account is turned over to counsel. He should keep in\nfrequent contact with him. (5)\n\nAll\ntenants owing retroactive surcharges should be personally interviewed by the\nmanager and a schedule for monthly amortization of indebtedness agreed upon. A\nmemorandum of such agreement should be signed by the tenant, in which it is\nstipulated that the amount to be paid monthly is to be considered additional\nrent. (6)\n\nIt is the policy of the\ndivision that tenants should be billed currently for surcharges. (b) Vacated tenants. Where a\ntenant has vacated, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, it is still the\nresponsibility of the manager and counsel to locate such tenant and to collect\nall sums due the authority. In achieving this end, consideration should be\ngiven to utilizing the services of a credit bureau to locate a vacated tenant, ascertain his current employment and discover available assets, if any. Judgments should be secured, and garnishee placed if indicated. (c) Write-offs of uncollectible accounts. (1)\n\nEvery effort should be made by manager\nand counsel to locate the tenant, discover his available assets and collect the\nindebtedness, before recommending a vacated tenant's accounts receivable as a\ncollection loss write-off. (2)\n\nWhere collection efforts on the part of the authority and counsel have not been\nsuccessful, division approval to turn over uncollected accounts to a collection\nagency may be obtained on request. The agreement between the authority and the\ncollection agency must be approved by the division. (3)\n\nWhere all efforts as outlined above prove\nto be unsuccessful and account appears to be uncollectible, write-off should be\nhandled as follows: (i) Accounts receivable\nup to $100 may be written off at discretion of project manager. (ii)\n\nAccounts receivable from $100 up to $300\nmay be written off by resolution of authority acting upon recommendation of\ncounsel. (iii)\n\nAccounts receivable\nfrom $300 to $500 may be written off with the approval of the management bureau\nof the division upon resolution of authority acting upon recommendation of\nhousing authority counsel. (iv)\n\nAccounts receivable in excess of $500 may be written off only after approval by\nthe legal bureau of the division. Requests for such approval must be supported\nby the following: (a) Form HM 56 \"Uncollected\n\nAccount Write-off Approval\" must be completely filled out with all requested\ninformation shown. (b) Specific\ncollection efforts must be detailed. The efforts of the manager and the counsel\nshould be shown. Dates of letters sent and nature of mailing (e.g., return\nreceipt requested) should be included. Efforts at personal contact, information\nfrom employer or other sources should be listed, with a negative indication\nshown, if such efforts were not made or were unavailing. (c) If judgment was not obtained, give\nreason. (d) If judgment was\nobtained but no garnishee made, give reason. (e) A clear, concise statement indicating the\nbasis on which it was concluded that the account was uncollectible. (f) A signed copy of the recommendations of\nhousing authority counsel based on his efforts to collect, specifying such\nefforts to collect, specifying such efforts. (g) A statement as to whether the account was\nturned over to a collection attorney or agency approved by the division. If so, include their report. (h) Attach\ncopy of authority's resolution requesting write-off approval. Said resolution\nshould be duly executed by an authorized member of the authority. (v) Except for cases of fraud and\nmisrepresentation, counsel to an authority may be permitted to compromise and\nsettle all accounts of vacated tenants turned over to him regardless of the\namount involved when such compromise and settlement are of an urgent nature and\nare approved by the chairman of the authority or in his absence, the vice\nchairman. The division must be advised of such settlements in cases where\nindebtedness exceeded $500. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
