  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 801.29 - Forms\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The employer\nmust use SH 900, SH 900.1, and SH 900.2 forms, or equivalent forms, and\nassociated instructions, for recordable injuries and illnesses. The SH 900 form\nis called the log of work-related injuries and illnesses, the SH 900.1 is the\nannual summary of work-related injuries and illnesses, and the SH 900.2 form is\ncalled the injury and illness incident report. (b) If the case is to be considered a privacy\nconcern case, the employer may not enter the employee's name on the SH 900 log. Instead, the employer must enter \" privacy case\" in the space normally used for\nthe employee's name. This will protect the privacy of the injured or ill\nemployee when another employee, a former employee, or an authorized employee\nrepresentative is provided access to the SH 900 log under section\n801.35\nof this Part. The employer\nmust keep a separate, confidential list (the privacy case list) of the case\nnumbers and employee names for the employer's privacy concern cases so the\nemployer can update the cases and provide the information to the government if\nasked to do so. (c) The employer\nmust consider the following injuries or illnesses to be privacy concern cases: (1)\nan injury or illness to an intimate body\npart or the reproductive system; (2)\nan injury or illness resulting from a\nsexual assault; (3)\nmental\nillnesses; (4)\nHIV infection, hepatitis, or tuberculosis; (5)\nneedlestick injuries and cuts from sharp objects that are contaminated with\nanother person's blood or other potentially infectious material (see section\n801.7\nof this Part for\ndefinitions); and\n(6)\nother\nillnesses, if the employee independently and voluntarily requests that his or\nher name not be entered on the log. Effective January 1, 2004, musculoskeletal\ndisorders (MSDs) are not considered privacy concern cases. This is a complete list of all injuries and illnesses\nconsidered privacy concern cases. No other types of injuries or illnesses may\nbe classified as privacy concern cases. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n801.29\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
