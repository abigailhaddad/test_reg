  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 691.3 - Discipline of attorneys for professional misconduct in foreign jurisdictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any attorney to whom this Part shall apply, pursuant to section\n691.1\nof this Part, who has been\ndisciplined in another state, territory or district, may be disciplined by this\ncourt because of the conduct which gave rise to the discipline imposed in such\nother state, territory or district. (b) Upon receipt from the foreign\njurisdiction of a certified or exemplified copy of the order imposing such\ndiscipline and of the record of the proceedings upon which such order was\nbased, this court, directly or by a committee appointed pursuant to section\n691.4\n(a) of this\n\nPart, shall give written notice to such attorney pursuant to subdivision 6 of\nsection\n90\nof the\n\nJudiciary Law, according him the opportunity, within 20 days of the giving of\nsuch notice, to file a verified statement setting forth any defense to a\ndiscipline enumerated under subdivision (c) of this section, and a written\ndemand for a hearing at which consideration shall be given to any and all\ndefenses enumerated in said subdivision (c) of this section. Such notice shall\nfurther advise the attorney that, in default of such filing by him, this court\nwill impose such discipline or take such disciplinary action as it deems\nappropriate. (c) This court, in default of the attorney's filing a verified statement and demand\nas provided for in subdivision (b) of this section, may discipline such\nattorney unless an examination of the entire record before this court, including the record of the foreign jurisdiction and such other evidence as\nthis court in its discretion may receive, discloses (1) that the procedure in\nthe foreign jurisdiction was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be heard as\nto constitute a deprivation of due process; or (2) that there was such an\ninfirmity of proof establishing the misconduct as to give rise to the clear\nconviction that this court could not, consistent with its duties, accept as\nfinal the finding of the court in the foreign jurisdiction as to the attorney'\ns misconduct; or (3) that the imposition of discipline by this court would be\nunjust. (d) Opportunity for hearing. Where an attorney shall have duly filed both his\nverified statement setting forth any defense (as enumerated in subdivision [c]\nof this section) to the imposition of discipline by this court and his written\ndemand for a hearing with respect to such defense, no discipline, by way of\nsuspension or otherwise, shall be imposed without affording the attorney an\nopportunity to have a hearing. (e) Any attorney to whom this Part\nshall apply who has been disciplined in a foreign jurisdiction shall promptly\nadvise this court of such discipline. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
