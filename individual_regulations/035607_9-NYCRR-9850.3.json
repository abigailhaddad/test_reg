Tit. 9 § 9850.3 - Audit and record retention\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All fiscal and statistical records and reports of providers and prescriptions\nfilled or refilled which are used for the purpose of establishing the\nprovider's right to payment under the program, and any underlying books, logs, records and documentation which formed the basis for such fiscal and\nstatistical records and reports, shall be subject to audit. Providers must\nmaintain a contemporaneous signature log which shall contain at a minimum the\nfollowing elements of information for all prescriptions, except those\nprescriptions which are delivered to the participant by courier or mail: the\nprescription number, the date the prescription was dispensed and the signature\nof the participant or the participant's authorized representative. All\nunderlying books, logs, records and documentation, including all prescriptions\nfilled or refilled, shall be kept and maintained by the provider for a period\nof not less than three years from the date of completion of such reports or the\ndate upon which the fiscal and statistical records were required to be filed, whichever is later, or the date the prescription was filled or refilled. Failure to maintain accurate records in accordance with this section may result\nin the disallowance of any claims for which such documentation is\nlacking. (b) All claims made under\nthe program shall be subject to audit by the executive director or contractor\nfor a period of three years from the date of their filing. This limitation\nshall not apply to situations in which fraud may be involved or where the\nprovider or an agent thereof prevents or obstructs the contractor from\nperforming an audit pursuant to this Part. (c) Notification to the provider of the\nintent to audit shall toll the period for record retention and audit. The audit\nshall commence within 60 days of the notification. However, this period may be\nextended for 60 days upon written notice to the provider. There shall be no\nmore than one extension of a notification of intent to audit. (d) If an audit has not been commenced within\n60 days of a notification of intent to audit or within 120 days of an extended\nnotification, the effectiveness of the notification shall lapse. However, subsequent notifications of intent to audit may be issued within the period\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section. The passage of this period shall\npreclude the conduct of an audit unless there is in existence an unexpired\nnotification of intent to audit or an extended notification. The passage of\nthis period shall not prohibit the conclusion of an audit already\nbegun. (e) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, the period within which\nto commence an audit may be indefinitely extended on account of delays in the\ncommencement of the audit caused or requested by the provider or a\nrepresentative of the provider. (f) The audit shall begin with an entrance conference at which the nature and\nextent of the audit shall be discussed. The time, manner and place of an audit\nshall be determined by the executive director or the contractor. (g) In their discretion, the executive\ndirector or the contractor may terminate an audit at any time in the audit\nprocess. The provider shall be notified in writing of such termination. This\nwritten notification shall serve in the place of a closing conference, draft\naudit report or final audit report, as appropriate. If an audit is terminated, the executive director or the contractor is precluded from recommencing an\naudit of those items which were the subject of the terminated audit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
