  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 74.5 - Imposition of tax on the use of cigarettes\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 471-a, 475 and 1814\n(a) As a supplement to the tax imposed on\ncigarettes possessed in New York State for sale, article 20 of the Tax Law also\nimposes a tax on cigarettes possessed in the State for purposes other than\nsale. Except as provided for in this section, the cigarette use tax is imposed\nand must be paid on all cigarettes used in the State by any person. As defined\nin section\n70.2\n(d) of this Title, a\nuse of cigarettes\nconstitutes the exercise of\nany right or power, actual or constructive, with respect to cigarettes, but\ndoes not include possession for sale. Accordingly, the cigarette tax imposed\nupon cigarettes used in the State is a complement to the tax imposed on\ncigarettes possessed for sale in the State and all of the provisions of article\n20 of the Tax Law and this Title regarding the latter tax, if not inconsistent\nwith this section, shall apply to the administration and enforcement of the use\ntax in the same manner as if the language of said provisions had been\nincorporated in full into this section. (b) (1)\n\nThe\ntax on cigarettes used in the State is imposed at the rate of $4.35 for each 20\ncigarettes or fraction thereof. If a package of cigarettes contains more than\n20 cigarettes, the rate of tax on those cigarettes in excess of 20 is $1.0875\nfor each five cigarettes or fraction thereof. (2)\n\nWithin 24 hours after a taxable use of\ncigarettes has occurred, if the cigarette tax has not been paid, the person so\nusing such cigarettes must file a return with the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance and must remit with such return the tax shown to be due thereon (see\nsection\n75.3\nof this Title). (c) No\ncigarette use tax shall be imposed on cigarettes used in the State, if: (1)\nthe tax imposed on cigarettes possessed\nfor sale, as provided in section\n471\nof the Tax Law, has been paid as\nevidenced by the presence of New York State cigarette tax stamps affixed to\nindividual packages of such cigarettes; (2)\nsuch cigarettes are exempt from the tax\nimposed on cigarettes possessed for sale pursuant to such section (see section\n74.1\n[c]\nof this Part); or\n(3)\nthe number of\ncigarettes brought into the State on, or in the possession of, any person does\nnot exceed 400. Where a use of cigarettes involves more than 400\ncigarettes brought into the State on, or in the possession of, any person, all\nsuch cigarettes are subject to tax. Furthermore, where cigarettes are brought\ninto the State other than on, or in the possession of, the user of such\ncigarettes (\ne.g., cigarettes delivered into the State by mail)\nall such cigarettes are taxable. (d) For purposes of article 37 of the Tax Law\nwith respect to criminal penalties, the possession or transportation within\nthis State by any person, other than an agent, at any one time of 5,000 or more\ncigarettes in unstamped or unlawfully stamped packages, is presumptive evidence\nthat such cigarettes are possessed or transported for the purpose of sale and\nare subject to the tax imposed on cigarettes possessed for sale pursuant to\nsection 471 of such law. Any provision of this Title providing for the time\nperiod during which the use tax may be paid shall not apply to such possession\nor transportation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
