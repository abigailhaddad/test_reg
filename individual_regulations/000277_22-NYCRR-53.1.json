Coordination pursuant to this section\nshall apply to pretrial proceedings, including dispositive motions. (b) Litigation coordinating panel. (1)\n\nComposition.

(3)\n\nStandards for coordination. In\ndetermining whether to issue an administrative order of coordination, the panel\nshall consider, among other things, the complexity of the actions; whether\ncommon questions of fact or law exist, and the importance of such questions to\nthe determination of the issues; the risk that coordination may unreasonably\ndelay the progress, increase the expense, or complicate the processing of any\naction or otherwise prejudice a party; the risk of duplicative or inconsistent\nrulings, orders or judgments; the convenience of the parties, witnesses and\ncounsel; whether coordinated discovery would be advantageous; efficient\nutilization of judicial resources and the facilities and personnel of the\ncourt; the manageability of a coordinated litigation; whether issues of\ninsurance, limits on assets and potential bankruptcy can be best addressed in\ncoordinated proceedings; and the pendency of related matters in the Federal\ncourts and in the courts of other states. The panel may exclude particular\nactions from an otherwise applicable order of coordination when necessary to\nprotect the rights of parties. (4)\n\nDetermination. (i) The panel shall issue a\nwritten decision on each application. If the panel determines to direct\ncoordination, it shall issue an administrative order identifying the actions\nthat shall be coordinated.

(ii)\n\nThe order of the panel, following\nconsultation with the Chief Administrative Judge, shall specify the number of\n\nCoordinating Justices and the county or counties in which the coordinated\nproceedings shall take place. In making this decision, the panel shall\nconsider, among other things, the venues of origin of the cases to be\ncoordinated; whether the actions arise out of an accident or events in a\nparticular county; judicial caseloads in prospective venues; fairness to\nparties; the convenience of the parties and witnesses; the convenience of\ncounsel; and whether the purposes of this section can best be advanced by\ncoordination before more than one Coordinating Justice.

In deciding\nwhom to designate, the Administrative Judge shall consider, among other things, the existing caseload of each prospective appointee and the overall needs of\nthe court in which that justice serves; the familiarity of that justice with\nthe litigation at issue; the justice's managerial ability; and the previous\nexperience of the justice with the field of law involved and with coordinated\nlitigation. The Administrative Judge may designate a justice from another local\njurisdiction as a Coordinating Justice with the approval of the Administrative\n\nJudge thereof and the appropriate Presiding Justice. (2)\n\nAuthority.

(3)\n\nCoordination with Federal or other\nstates' actions. If actions related to those pending before a Coordinating\n\nJustice are proceeding in Federal courts or in the courts of other states, the\n\nCoordinating Justice shall consult with the presiding judge(s) in an effort to\nadvance the purposes of this section.
