Tit. 9 § 367.8 - Significant risk\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The three\nfactors necessary to create a significant risk of contracting or transmitting\nHIV infection are: (1)\nthe presence of a\nsignificant risk body substance; (2)\na circumstance which constitutes\nsignificant risk for transmitting or contracting HIV infection; and\n(3)\nthe presence of an infectious source and\na noninfected person. Transmission occurs only from infected to uninfected\npersons. (b) Any body\nsubstances that have been epidemiologically implicated in the transmission of\nHIV are considered to be a significant risk body substance. These include\nblood, semen, vaginal secretions, and breast milk. Other body substances that\nhave been considered infectious for HIV include tissue and the following body\nfluids: cerebrospinal, amniotic, peritoneal, synovial, pericardial, and\npleural. These body substances shall also be considered significant risk body\nsubstances. (c) Circumstances that\nconstitute significant risk for transmitting or contracting HIV infection are\nas follows: (1)\nsexual intercourse (vaginal, anal, oral) that exposes a noninfected individual to blood, semen, or vaginal\nsecretions of an infected individual; (2)\nsharing of needles and other\nparaphernalia used for preparing and injecting drugs between infected and\nnoninfected individuals; (3)\nthe\ngestation, birthing or breast feeding of an infant when the mother is infected\nwith HIV; (4)\ntransfusion or\ntransplantation of blood, organs, or other tissues obtained from an infected\nindividual to an uninfected individual, providing such products have not tested\nnegatively for antibody or antigen and have not been rendered noninfective by\nheat or chemical treatment; (5)\nother circumstances not identified in paragraphs (1) through (4) of this\nsubdivision during which a significant risk body substance (other than breast\nmilk) of an infected individual contacts mucous membranes (e.g.eyes, nose, mouth), nonintact skin (e.g. open wound, dermatitis, abraded areas), or the\nvascular system of a noninfected person. Such circumstances include, but are\nnot limited to, needlestick or puncture wound injuries and direct saturation or\npermeation of these body surfaces by the infectious body substance. (d) Circumstances that do not\nconstitute significant risk include: (1)\nexposure to urine, feces, sputum, nasal secretions, saliva, sweat, tears or\nvomitus that does not contain blood that is visible to the naked eye; (2)\nhuman bites where there is no direct\nblood to blood, or blood to mucous membrane contact; (3)\nexposure of intact skin to blood or any\nother body substance; (4)\noccupational settings where individuals use scientifically accepted barrier\ntechniques and preventive practices in circumstances that would otherwise pose\na significant risk.
