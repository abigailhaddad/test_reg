(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, two or more employers already\nmaintaining offices or transacting business within New York State and making\npayment of wages taxable under article 22 of the Tax Law to resident or\nnonresident individuals, who merge or otherwise consolidate to form a new\nemployer shall, if the provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph apply, file employer's returns of tax withheld on form WT-1 and pay over withheld\ntaxes as follows: (1)\nif at least one such\nemployer utilized the three business day rule described in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph during the calendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar\nquarter of the merger or consolidation, then the new employer shall likewise\nutilize the three business day rule until notified to the contrary by the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance; (2)\nif all such employers utilized the five\nbusiness day rule described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph during the\ncalendar quarter immediately preceding the calendar quarter of the merger or\nconsolidation, then the new employer shall utilize the five business day rule\nuntil notified to the contrary by the Department of Taxation and Finance. (iii)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance shall annually notify, in writing, all\nemployers described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph of any\nchanges to their three or five business day filing and remittance due date\n(\ni.e., whether the three business day rule or five business\nday rule will be applicable to the upcoming calendar year). (2)\n\nWhere, at the close of any calendar\nquarter, an employer has been required to deduct and withhold, but has not paid\nover to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, a cumulative\naggregate amount of less than $700 of tax (see subparagraph [4][i] of this\nsubdivision) during such calendar quarter, such employer shall pay over such\ncumulative aggregate amount of tax to the Department of Taxation and Finance\nwith the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return required to\nbe filed for such quarter, on or before the last date prescribed for the filing\nof such quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return (see section\n174.2\nof this Part). (3)\n\nWhere an\nemployer makes more than one payroll per week, then such employer shall\ndetermine the applicability of the rules described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of\nthis subdivision measured as of the last payroll made within the week by such\nemployer; provided, however, that in any week in which the end of a quarter\noccurs between the making of payrolls by an employer, then such employer shall\ndetermine the applicability of the rules described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of\nthis subdivision measured as of the last payroll made within the quarter by\nsuch employer. For purposes of this paragraph, the term\nweek\nshall mean the period Sunday through Saturday. (4)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, the\nfollowing terms have these meanings: (i) The\nterm\naggregate amount of tax deducted and withheld\nmeans the\ntotal of the New York State personal income tax under article 22 of the Tax\n\nLaw, the City of New York personal income tax on residents under chapter 17 of\ntitle 11 of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, the City of New\n\nYork nonresident earnings tax under chapter 19 of title 11 of the\n\nAdministrative Code of the City of New York, the City of Yonkers income tax\nsurcharge on residents under article IX of the Codes and Ordinances of the City\nof Yonkers, and the City of Yonkers nonresident earnings tax under article X of\nthe Codes and Ordinances of the City of Yonkers.

(5)\n\nIn\ndetermining the $700 withholding threshold amount referred to in paragraphs (1)\nand (2) of this subdivision, the cumulative aggregate amount of tax required to\nbe deducted and withheld from annuities, pensions, retired pay or individual\nretirement account payments must be combined with the cumulative aggregate\namount of tax required to be deducted and withheld from wages. Accordingly, such $700 withholding threshold is determined separately with regard to the\ncumulative aggregate amount of tax required to be deducted and withheld from\ncertain gambling winnings. (6)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this subdivision can be illustrated by the following examples\n(assume in each example that the employer referred to is not an educational\norganization, a health care provider or a new employer): Example 1: For the first calendar quarter of a calendar year, employer C has been required to deduct and withhold a cumulative aggregate\namount of $450 of tax. C is required to pay over such amount with Part A of C's\nquarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return due on or before April\n30 of the same calendar year. Example 2: Assume the same facts as in Example 1. Also assume the\nfollowing: due to a hiring increase at the beginning of the second calendar\nquarter of such calendar year, employer C has been required to deduct and\nwithhold a cumulative aggregate amount of $1,000 of tax after making C's first\npayroll of the calendar quarter on April 10, and, in the calendar year\npreceding the previous calendar year, C was required to remit a cumulative\naggregate amount of $5,000 of tax. C must file form WT-1 and pay over the\n$1,000 of withheld tax on or before the fifth business day after making the\n\nApril 10th payroll, even though C has not yet paid over the withheld tax and\nfiled C's quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return for the\nprior quarter. Example 3: Assume that during the third calendar quarter of a\ncalendar year, employer D makes its payrolls weekly, on Fridays. There are 13\n\nFridays in the calendar quarter. D's payrolls are constant throughout the\ncalendar quarter, and after making each such payroll, D is required to deduct\nand withhold a cumulative aggregate amount of $400 of tax. In the calendar year\npreceding the previous calendar year, D was required to remit a cumulative\naggregate amount of $16,000 of tax. D will be required to file form WT-1 and\npay over the withheld tax on or before the third business day after making\nevery second payroll in the quarter. The cumulative aggregate amount of $400 of\ntax required to be deducted and withheld after D's last payroll of the calendar\nquarter, on the last Friday of September, must be paid over with the quarterly\ncombined withholding and wage reporting return required to be filed for such\nquarter, on or before October 31st of the same calendar year. Example 4: During the fourth calendar quarter of a calendar year, employer E makes payrolls twice weekly, on Tuesdays and Fridays. In the\ncalendar year preceding the previous calendar year, E was required to remit a\ncumulative aggregate amount of $100,000 of tax. After making the first payroll\nof the quarter, which falls on a Friday, E is required to deduct and withhold a\ncumulative aggregate amount of $400 of tax. Since E has not yet exceeded the\n$700 threshold, E need not file form WT-1 and pay over the withheld tax. E\nmakes the next payroll on the following Tuesday and is required to deduct and\nwithhold a cumulative aggregate amount of $500 of tax. E still need not file\nform WT-1 and pay over the withheld tax since E must determine the\napplicability of the rules described in this section based on the last payroll\nmade within the week. E makes the next payroll on the following Friday and is\nrequired to deduct and withhold another cumulative aggregate amount of $500 of\ntax. Since this is E's last payroll within the week, E determines the\napplicability of the rules described in this section based on this payroll. Since E has exceeded the $700 threshold, E must file form WT-1 and pay over the\n$1,400 of withheld tax on or before the third business day after making the\nlast payroll in the week. Example 5: Assume the same facts as in Example 4. Also assume the\nfollowing: for each payroll made during the rest of the fourth calendar quarter\nof the calendar year, except for the last payroll of the quarter which falls on\na Tuesday, E is required to deduct and withhold a cumulative aggregate amount\nof $500 of tax; for the payroll made on the last Tuesday of the calendar\nquarter, E is required to deduct and withhold a cumulative aggregate amount of\n$650 of tax; Christmas and New Year's Day do not fall on a Tuesday or a Friday; and the end of the quarter occurs on a Thursday. E will be required to file\nform WT-1 and pay over the withheld tax on or before the third business day\nfollowing the payroll made on each Friday of the quarter. Since for the last\nweek of the calendar quarter, the end of the quarter occurs between E's two\npayrolls for that week, E must determine the applicability of the rules\nprescribed by this section based on E's last payroll made within the quarter, on Tuesday of that week. Thus, E will be required to pay over the $650 of\nwithheld tax with the quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting return\nrequired to be filed for such quarter on or before February 28th of the\nsucceeding year. Example 6: Employer F, a new employer within the meaning of clause\n(1)(ii)(\na\n) of this subdivision, commences operations in the\nthird calendar quarter of a year. During such quarter, F was required to remit\na cumulative aggregate amount of $3,000 of tax. During the fourth calendar\nquarter of such year, F was required to remit a cumulative aggregate amount of\n$5,000 of tax. During each of such calendar quarters, as well as during all\ncalendar quarters in the succeeding two calendar years, F exceeds the $700\nwithholding threshold at least once. During the two calendar quarters in the\nyear in which F commenced operations, and during all four calendar quarters in\nthe succeeding calendar year, F will be required to file the employer's return\nof tax withheld on form WT-1 and pay over withheld taxes on or before the fifth\nbusiness day after making the payroll in which the $700 threshold was exceeded. However, in the second calendar year following the year which F commenced\noperations, F will be notified by the Department of Taxation and Finance that F\nmust utilize the three business day rule since F was required to remit an\nannualized cumulative aggregate amount of $16,000 of taxes in the year of\ncommencement of operations ($3,000 + $5,000 = $8,000; $8,000 ÷2 = $4,000; $4,000 × 4 = $16,000). (c) New York State employer's return of\ntax withheld of a governmental employer. The New York State employer's return of tax withheld\n(form WT-1) of a governmental employer is to be made by the officer or employee\ncontrolling the payment of wages or other officer or employee appropriately\ndesignated for that purpose. (d) Transmittal of New York State\nemployer's returns of tax withheld. The New York State employer's returns of tax withheld on\nform WT-1 referred to in this section must be filed with the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. No listing of employees or itemization of\nrespective New York State personal income taxes withheld is to be attached to\nor accompany the New York State employer's return of tax withheld on form WT-1, however, see section\n174.2\nof this Part concerning the filing of the quarterly combined withholding and\nwage reporting return. (e) Final New York State employer's return of tax withheld. The last New York State employer's return of tax withheld\n(form WT-1) for any employer who discontinues business or permanently ceases to\npay wages must be marked \"Final Return\", the date of the last payroll must be\nfurnished by the employer on such return and such return must be filed within\nthe period referred to in paragraph (b)(1) of this section, accompanied by the\nremittance of the cumulative aggregate amount of tax required to be deducted\nand withheld. See section\n174.2\nof this Part concerning the filing of the final quarterly combined withholding\nand wage reporting return. (f) Magnetic media. (1)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nmay grant authorization to file New York State employer's returns of tax\nwithheld (form WT-1) on magnetic media. Employers must comply with the\ninstructions and requirements of such department with respect to filing New\n\nYork State employer's returns of tax withheld on magnetic media. Failure to\ncomply with such instructions and requirements may subject an employer to\npenalties and/or additions to tax (see section\n685\nof the Tax Law). (2)\n\nAdherence to the instructions and\nrequirements of the Department of Taxation and Finance with respect to filing\n\nNew York State employer's returns of tax withheld on magnetic media satisfies\nthe requirements of this section and Part 153 of this Title with regard to the\nfiling of New York State employer's returns of tax withheld. (3)\n\nEmployers or groups of employers may\nauthorize a reporting or service agency to file employer's returns of tax\nwithheld (form WT-1) on magnetic media on their behalf in compliance with the\n\nNew York State filing requirements.
