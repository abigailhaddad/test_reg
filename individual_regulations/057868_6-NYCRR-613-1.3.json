(f) Category 2\nmeans any\ntank system component (\ne.g., tank, piping, ancillary\nequipment, fill port catch basins, containment sumps, secondary containment, etc.) installed from December 27, 1986 through October 11, 2015. (g) Category 3\nmeans any\ntank system component (\ne.g., tank, piping, ancillary\nequipment, fill port catch basins, containment sumps, secondary containment, etc.) installed after October 11, 2015. (h) Cathodic protection\nmeans the prevention of electrolytic corrosion of a metallic structure by\ncausing it to act as the cathode rather than as the anode of an electrochemical\ncell. (i) Cathodic\nprotection tester\nmeans a person who can demonstrate an understanding\nof the principles and measurements of all common types of cathodic protection\nsystems as applied to metal portions of tank systems in contact with the\nground. At a minimum, such persons must have education, training and experience\nin soil resistivity, stray current, structure-to-soil potential, and component\nelectrical isolation measurements of metal portions of tank systems in contact\nwith the ground. (j) Change-in-service\nmeans switching the material stored within a\ntank system from a petroleum substance to a non-petroleum substance. This term\nis a form of permanent closure. (k) Class A Operator\nmeans the individual who has primary\nresponsibility to operate and maintain the UST system(s) at a facility in\naccordance with applicable requirements of this Part. The Class A Operator\ntypically manages resources and personnel to achieve and maintain compliance\nwith the requirements of this Part.
