Tit. 16 § 730.1 - Filing of reports\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every gas\nor electric corporation having equipment containing 500 parts per million (ppm)\nor greater of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), including but not limited to\ncapacitors and transformers, shall file, in accordance with the requirements of\nsection\n3.5\nof this Title, a PCB inventory\nreport to the commission semiannually. (b) The inventory reports shall be filed on\n\nSeptember 1st each year, for the reporting period January 1st through June 30th\npreceding, and on March 1st each year, for the period July 1st through December\n31st preceding. (c) Each gas\ncorporation, as set forth herein, shall file with the secretary, in accordance\nwith the requirements of section\n3.5\nof this Title, a report of\neach discovery in the gas distribution system of materials containing PCBs in\nconcentrations of 50 ppm or greater, such as materials collected at custody\ntransfer points, and the PCB concentrations found in such materials. The report\nshall be submitted annually by February 1st of the year following the calendar\nyear for which the report is rendered. (d) The inventory reports referred to in\nsubdivision (a) of this section shall include two parts: one covering PCB\nequipment in service as of the last day of the reporting period and one\ncovering PCB equipment retired, stored, processed, or shipped during the\nreporting period. (e) Each gas or\nelectric corporation filing the inventory reports referred to in subdivision\n(a) of this section shall also submit to the chief executive of each county and\ncity located in its service territory a report containing the information\npresented for equipment and PCBs located in or transported through the county\nor city receiving the report. (f) The following provisions apply in connection with the inventory reports: (1)\n\nThe term equipment means devices such as\ntransformers, capacitors, compressors, or other equipment designed to contain\noil or other fluids necessary for their operation. The term does not include\nitems on the gas distribution system that were not designed to contain oil\nnecessary for operation such as drips, valves, or pipelines. (2)\n\nMaterials means liquids, particulate\nmatter, rags or other items containing PCBs. (3)\n\nPolitical jurisdiction may be reported by\nany of the following: town, village, city, each borough of New York City, or\ntax district. If the report is by tax district, it shall be made clear which\npolitical jurisdiction or jurisdictions comprise each tax district. (4)\n\nThe location of PCB equipment in service\nmay be reported by any of the following: street address, building name, line\nand pole number, line and vault number, pole number with street and\ncross-street, vault number with street and cross-street or, for gas utility\nequipment, by pipeline mile post, engineering station, or geographic feature. If the location is reported by pole and line number or vault number, additional\ninformation shall be available to indicate the exact location of the line or\nequipment. For substations and power plants, additional information shall be\navailable to indicate the location of the equipment within each substation or\npower plant. The location of storage and processing facilities shall be\nreported by postal address and shall include, as a minimum, the political\njurisdiction in which the facility is located. (5)\n\nSize shall be expressed as volume of PCB\nfluid, and the PCB concentration (ppm) shall be reported. The fluid, if a\ndielectric, shall be identified (i.e., mineral oil, Askarel, pure\nPCB). (6)\n\nService date may be\nreported by any of the following: date of purchase, date of first installation, date of last installation, date of capitalization, or date of manufacture. Date\nof manufacture may be reported by serial number if a key is provided which\ncross-references serial number to date of manufacture. For capacitors, the\nreported service date may be the service date for the oldest capacitor in a\nbank or the date that the bank was first installed. For transformers located in\nsubstations, the reported service date may be the service date for the oldest\ntransformer installed at each substation. Each inventory report shall specify\nwhether the reported service date is the purchase date, date of capitalization, or date of manufacture. (7)\n\nQuantity means the number of individual units. Capacitors may be reported by\nbank if the number of units per bank is stated. (8)\n\nThe term in-service applies to equipment\nused electrically under loaded conditions, and to other equipment, such as gas\ncompressors, on gas distribution systems. In-service equipment may also be\nidentified as equipment recorded in the Electric Plant In Service or Gas Plant\n\nIn Service accounts. (9)\n\nThe last\nin-service location is the last location at which the PCB equipment was in\nservice, or the location (i.e., service center or treatment storage and\ndisposal facility) at which the electrical equipment or material was first\ndetermined to contain 500 ppm or greater of PCBs. (10)\n\nThe retirement date reported shall be\neither the date on which the equipment is no longer in service or the date on\nwhich the equipment was removed from the Electric Plant In Service or Gas Plant\n\nIn Service accounts. (11)\n\nThe New\n\nYork State portion of the shipping route shall be described for all shipments\nof PCBs between storage and processing facilities and for all shipments out of\n\nState. The route description shall identify the highways used and shall\nidentify all cities and counties traversed by the route. Shipping routes within\n\nNew York City shall identify the borough or boroughs traversed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
