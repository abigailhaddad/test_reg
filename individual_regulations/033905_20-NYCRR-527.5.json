(1)\n\nThe tax is imposed on receipts from every\nsale of the services of installing, maintaining, servicing or repairing\ntangible personal property, by any means including coin-operated machines, whether or not any tangible personal property is transferred in conjunction\nwith the services. (2)\n\nInstalling\nmeans setting up tangible personal property or putting it in place for use. Example 1: An individual pays for the installation of a washer and\ndryer to existing wiring and plumbing in his home. The charge for installation\nis taxable. Example 2: An individual contracts with a company for a central\nstation burglar alarm and guard service. The company charges him a fee at the\ncommencement of the contract for installing wiring and alarm devices. The\ncharge to the customer is taxable as an installation charge. (3)\n\nMaintaining, servicing and repairing are\nterms used to cover all activities that relate to keeping tangible personal\nproperty in a condition of fitness, efficiency, readiness or safety or\nrestoring it to such condition. Example 3: The charge for the repair and tuning of a piano is\ntaxable. Example 4: The charge for the service of lubricating a motor vehicle\nis taxable. Example 5: The charge for washing an automobile is taxable, whether\nthe washing is performed manually or by a coin-operated machine. Example 6: A company operates a diagnostic service in which it tests\nan appliance for a set fee, but does not repair the appliance. The charge for\nthe diagnostic service is taxable. Example 7: A company operating a central station burglar alarm system\ncharges its customers a fee for repairs to the system necessitated by damage\nbeyond the control of the company. It does not charge its customers for repairs\nrequired by malfunctioning of the system. The charge by the company is taxable\nas a charge for repair. (4)\n\nThe installation of tangible personal property by a person furnishing services\nsubject to tax under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law\n(utility services) is a service subject to the tax imposed under section\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax Law\nwhen: (i) the tangible personal property is\ninstalled at the premises of the purchaser of the utility service; (ii)\nthe tangible personal property installed\nis for use in connection with a utility service; and\n(iii)\nthe tangible personal property is\npurchased and owned by the person purchasing the utility service. For\napplication of the tax on the installation of tangible personal property owned\nby a person furnishing a utility service, see section\n527.2\n(d) of this Part. Example 8: A person purchases a unique type telephone and requests the\ntelephone company to install it in his home for use in connection with the\ntelephone service subscribed to. The installation service is taxable under\nsection\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (5)\n(i) The installation of floor covering is\nsubject to tax unless it is the installation of the initial finished floor\ncovering in new construction, in a new addition to existing construction or in\na total reconstruction of existing construction. (ii)\n\nThe term floor covering includes carpet, carpet tile, carpet padding, linoleum and vinyl roll floor covering, linoleum\ntile, vinyl tile and other similar floor coverings. Example 9: A floor covering contractor removes wall-to-wall carpet and\ninstalls new wall-to-wall carpet padding and carpeting as its replacement. The\ntotal charge for the installation and sale of the padding and carpet is subject\nto sales tax because this is merely the replacement of the existing floor\ncovering. Cross-reference: For a detailed discussion of the taxability of the\ninstallation of floor covering, see section\n541.14\nof this Title. (b) Exemptions. (1)\n\nThe services of installing, maintaining, servicing or repairing tangible personal property are not taxable if the\nservices were performed for resale. See section\n526.6\n(c)(8)\nof this Title. (2)\n\nMaintaining, servicing or repairing tangible personal property is not taxable if the\nproperty maintained, serviced or repaired is held for sale in the regular\ncourse of business. Example 1: A repair shop charges a boat dealer for reconditioning boat\nmotors which the dealer will resell. The reconditioning of the motors is not\ntaxable because the motors are for resale. (3)\n\nTax is not imposed on the services of\nlaundering, dry-cleaning, tailoring, weaving, pressing, shoe repairing, and\nshoe shining. For example, alterations to clothing, although considered to be\nmaintaining, servicing, or repairing property, are excluded from tax because\nthey are tailoring. This would include tailoring performed either by an\nindependent tailor or seamstress, or by a tailer or seamstress employed by the\nvendor of the clothing so long as the vendor's charge for the tailoring is\nreasonable and separately stated from the charge for the clothing itself, and\nregardless of whether the clothing qualifies for the exemption from tax under\nsection\n1115 (a)(30)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. However, when a person provides raw materials to a tailor or seamstress\nand the tailor or seamstress produces an article of clothing for the person, the tailor's or seamstress' work constitutes the production of clothing (which\nis not tailoring); and the charge for such service would be subject to State\nand local sales and use tax (see 527.4[b] of this Part). (4)\n\nTax is not imposed on the charge for\ninstallation of tangible personal property which, when installed, will be an\naddition or capital improvement to real property. For a detailed discussion of\nrepairs or capital improvements to real property, see section\n527.7\nof this Part. For a detailed discussion of the taxability of floor covering, see section\n541.14\nof this Title.

(6)\n\nInstallation, repair and maintenance services rendered in or about the residence of a private\nhomeowner or lessee are not subject to tax when: (i) the person performing the services is\nengaged directly by the homeowner or lessee; and\n(ii)\nthe person performing the services is\nnot in a regular trade or business, offering his services to the public. Example 3: A homeowner engages a college student to clean and wax his\nautomobile. The student is not in the business of servicing automobiles and\ndoes the work in the homeowner's garage. The cleaning and waxing of the\nautomobile is not subject to tax. Example 4: A college student advertises in the classified that he will\nwash and wax automobiles for a fee.

(10)\n\nTax is not\nimposed on receipts from services rendered to certain machinery, equipment or\napparatus, or parts, tools or supplies used in connection therewith, as\ndescribed in section\n1105-B\nof the Tax Law. For a detailed\ndiscussion and description of this exemption, see section\n528.13\nof this Title. (c) Maintenance and service contracts. (1)\n\nThe purchase of a maintenance or service\ncontract is a taxable transaction.

Example 2: The same vendor also offers a service contract for the\nprice of $50 under which the purchaser will receive one service call at no\nadditional charge, including parts and labor, and each additional service call\nwill cost the purchaser $5 for parts and labor. All the charges are receipts\nsubject to tax. (d) Warranty work. (1)\n\nRepair or maintenance services rendered, without charge to a customer under a warranty agreement are not\ntaxable. (2)\n\nThe vendor performing\nthe warranty services may purchase for resale any tangible personal property\nwhich is transferred to his customer in connection with the services\nrendered.
