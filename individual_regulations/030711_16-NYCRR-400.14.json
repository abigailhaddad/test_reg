  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 400.14 - Testing of pressure compensated counters\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The counter shall be tested by applying\npressure to the compensating mechanism and rotating the \"following\" magnet a\nfixed number of turns as shown in the following table with two readings being\ntaken at each of the test pressures. Should the results of the two tests at any\nof the test pressures, one taken with the pressure being increased to the test\npoint and the other with the pressure being decreased, vary by more than one\npercent, additional pairs of tests shall be taken until such agreement is\nreached. The average of the readings obtained shall be deemed to be the\ncondition of the counter. (b) If\nmore than four additional pairs of tests are required, the test shall be\nconsidered \"indeterminate.\"\n(c) The\naccuracy at each test point shall be determined by the following formula: Percent Registration =\nObserved Revs. of\n\nCounter * 100\n/\n4\n\nPressure in\n\nPsig. No. of Magnet\n\nTurns\n\nCorrect No. of Counter\n\nTurns\n871/2\n29\n4\n125\n25\n4\n186\n21\n4\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n400.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
