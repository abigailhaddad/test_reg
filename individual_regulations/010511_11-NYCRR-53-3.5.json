Tit. 11 §§ 53-3.5 - Delivery of illustration and record retention\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a basic illustration is used by an insurance producer or other authorized representative of the insurer in the sale of a life insurance policy and the policy is applied for as illustrated, a copy of that illustration, signed in accordance with this Subpart, shall be submitted to the insurer at the time of policy application. A copy also shall be provided to the applicant. If the policy is issued other than as applied for, a revised basic illustration conforming to the policy as issued shall be sent with the policy. The revised illustration shall conform to the requirements of this Subpart, shall be labeled \"revised illustration\" and shall be signed and dated by the applicant or policyowner and producer or other authorized representative of the insurer no later than the time the policy is delivered. A copy shall be provided to the insurer and the policyowner. (b) If no illustration is used by an insurance producer or other authorized representative of the insurer in the sale of a life insurance policy or if the policy is applied for other than as illustrated, the producer or representative shall certify to that effect in writing on a form provided by the insurer. On the same form the applicant shall acknowledge that no illustration conforming to the policy applied for was provided and shall further acknowledge an understanding that an illustration conforming to the policy as issued will be provided no later than at the time of policy delivery.
