  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 413.2 - Payment of tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 171, 284, 287\n(a) Every distributor of motor fuel must pay\nto the Department of Taxation and Finance, with the filing of the return\npursuant to section\n413.1\nof this Part, the tax imposed by article 12-A of the Tax Law at the aggregate\nrate of eight cents per gallon on each gallon of motor fuel the distributor: (1)\nimported or caused to be imported into\n\nNew York State for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State; (2)\nproduced, refined, manufactured or\ncompounded in the State; or\n(3)\nsold in the State, if the motor fuel tax had not been imposed prior to such\nsale, during the period for which the return is made. All tax for the period\nfor which a return is required to be filed is due on the date limited for\nfiling the return, regardless of whether a return is filed or whether the\nreturn filed correctly shows the amount of tax due. (b) A distributor may report and pay the tax\nin whole dollar amounts. If this election is made, the distributor may\ndisregard a fractional part of a dollar, unless it amounts to 50 cents or more, in which case such fractional part must be increased to one dollar. However, such election is not applicable to items which must be taken into account in\nmaking the computations necessary to determine the amount of tax required to be\nshown on the return. (c) All\nremittances for each month must be payable to the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance and must be forwarded together with the return for such\nmonth. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n413.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
