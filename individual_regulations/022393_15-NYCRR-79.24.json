The CVIS records the\nresults of the test and prints the results. The inspection station must give\nthe customer a copy of the print out. (iii)\n\nSpecific instructions regarding the OBD\nII test procedure are found in the \"NYVIP vehicle inspection system operators\nmanual\". (2)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(3)\n\nLow\nenhanced emissions. (i) Low enhanced\ninspection procedure. All non-exempt vehicles not subject to the OBD II\nemissions inspection, including those vehicles with a make of \"custom\" or\n\"homemade,\" are subject to the requirements of this inspection. (ii)\n\nThis test consists of entering the\nappropriate vehicle data, including the results of the safety inspection and\nthe emissions control device check (subdivision [i], items 1-8b of this\nsection. Note: Vehicles with a make of custom or homemade, are\nsubject to the requirements of subdivision [i], item 8b only of this section)\ninto the CVIS. The CVIS records the results of the test and prints the results. The inspection station must give the customer a copy of the print\nout. (iii)\n\nSpecific, detailed\ninstructions regarding the low enhanced inspection procedure are found in\nsubdivision (i) of this section. (c) [\nReserved\n]\n(d) Standards. (1)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(2)\nOBD II test. (i) The New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, in consultation with the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles, shall establish and modify periodically the standards for the OBD II\ninspection, including the weight standards to be used to determine the proper\nOBD II requirements and classifications. (ii)\n\nSuch standards shall include criteria\nestablished by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation in 6\nNYCRR Part\n217. (e) General provisions. (1)\n\nVehicles registered in this State. All\nnon-exempt motor vehicles registered in this State are subject to either an OBD\nII or low-enhanced emissions inspection. All non-exempt vehicles must pass the\nappropriate emissions inspection and the appropriate safety inspection before\nany inspection certificate may be issued. All non-exempt motor vehicles with a\nmake of \"custom\" or \"homemade\" are subject to a low-enhanced emissions\ninspection and must only pass the requirements of subdivision (i), item 8b of\nthis section. (2)\n\nVehicles\nregistered in another state. If a non-exempt motor vehicle with a registration\nfrom another state, or with a New York State registration with an out-of-state\naddress, is presented for inspection at an official inspection station, the\ninspection station must perform the inspection procedure appropriate for the\nvehicle as if it were registered in the county where the inspection is to be\nperformed, and shall issue the appropriate safety or safety/emissions\ninspection certificate if it passes the inspection. (f) Effect of failure of emissions\ninspection. (1)\nOBD II inspection. (i) Subject vehicles must pass the OBD II\nemissions inspection (which includes subdivision [i], items 1-10 of this\nsection, except that diesel-powered vehicles that are subject to the OBD II\nemissions inspection shall not be inspected for items 1 through 8b in\nsubdivision [i] of this section), and safety inspection in order for an\ninspection certificate to be issued. If the vehicle fails any portion of the\ninspection, the inspection station must give the motorist a CVIS-generated\ninspection receipt indicating the reason for failure. An inspection station\ncannot issue a certificate of inspection until appropriate repairs are made and\nthe vehicle passes all applicable portions of the inspection, or, until the\nvehicle meets the conditions in section\n79.5\n(a) of this\n\nPart and qualifies for an emissions waiver. (2)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(3)\n\nLow enhanced inspection. (i) An inspection station shall only issue an\ninspection certificate if the subject vehicle passes the low enhanced emissions\ninspection (subdivision [i], items 1-8 of this section) as well as the safety\ninspection. If the vehicle fails any portion of the inspection, the station\nmust give the motorist a CVIS-generated inspection receipt indicating the\nreason for failure. A certificate of inspection cannot be issued until\nappropriate repairs are made and the vehicle passes all applicable portions of\nthe inspection. Vehicles subject to the low enhanced inspection cannot qualify\nfor an emissions waiver. (g) OBD II and low enhanced emissions\ninspection reinspection and fees. (1)\n\nIf a vehicle fails the safety portion and/or the emissions portion of the\nsafety/emissions inspection, and is not removed from the station by the\ncustomer for repair, the station may not charge for reinspection of the\nvehicle. A test drive by station personnel for the purposes of diagnosis or\nverification of repair does not constitute removal from the station. (2)\n\nIf a vehicle fails both the safety\nportion and emissions portion of the safety/emissions inspection, is removed\nfrom the station by the customer for repair, and if the vehicle is presented\nfor reinspection, that inspection station or any other emissions inspection\nstation must conduct a full inspection of both the safety portion and emissions\nportion during the reinspection of the vehicle, and may charge a fee up to but\nnot more than the applicable fee for the failed portions as set forth in\nsection\n79.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nIf a vehicle fails the\nsafety portion or the emissions portion of the safety/emissions inspection, and\nis removed from the station by the customer for repair and if the vehicle is\npresented for reinspection within 30 days of the rejection, that inspection\nstation or any other emissions inspection station must conduct a full\ninspection of only the failed safety or emissions portion during the\nreinspection of the vehicle, and may charge a fee up to but not more than the\napplicable fee for the failed portion as set forth in section\n79.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nIf a vehicle fails the\nsafety portion or emissions portion of the safety/emissions inspection, and is\nremoved from the station by the customer for repair and if the vehicle is\npresented for reinspection more than 30 days after rejection, that inspection\nstation or any other emissions inspection station must conduct a full\ninspection of both the safety portion and emissions portion during the\nreinspection of the vehicle, and may charge a fee up to but not more than the\napplicable fee for the safety portion and emissions portions as set forth in\nsection\n79.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart.
