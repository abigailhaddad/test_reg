  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 51.4 - Standards for retreaded tires\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No tire shall be retreaded (recapped), distributed, offered for sale or sold in this State for use on the public\nhighways of this State unless such retreading is done in conformance with the\nfollowing standards. (b) Definitions. For the purposes of this section the following terms shall\nhave the following meaning: (1)\n\nFull-treading. The worn tread rubber is rasped or buffed off the top of\nthe tread and over the shoulders as far as the new rubber is to extend. (2)\n\nTop treading. In top treading only the top of the old tread is rasped or\nbuffed off. All the new rubber is applied just to the top of the tread. (3)\n\nUndertread. Rubber between the base of the anti-skid design and buffed\ntire body. (4)\n\nSkid-depth. The distance measured near the center-line of the tire from\nthe base of the anti-skid design to the top of the tread. (5)\n\nNatural rubber. Natural rubber shall include all forms and types of tree, vine, or shrub rubber. (6)\n\nSynthetic rubber. Two types of synthetic rubber are commonly used in\nretreading. These are usually indentified as SBR synthetic rubber and BR\nsynthetic rubber. The former is a butadine-styrene rubber and the latter a type\ncalled stereo synthetic rubber made from butadine and sometimes also called\npolybutadine or PBD. (7)\n\nCold rubber. Cold rubber is a type of synthetic rubber polymerized at\napproximately 41 degrees Fahrenheit, as distinguished from hot rubber\npolymerized at approximately 122 degrees Fahrenheit. (8)\n\nReclaimed rubber. Reclaimed rubber is any rubber derived from the processing\nor treatment of vulcanized rubber or cured scrap rubber. (c) Material\nrequirements. (1)\n\nThe purpose and\nintent of this section is to establish within reasonable limits general guides\nfor the selection of tread rubber and other materials which will give the\nultimate user the highest possible tread wear under normal operating\nconditions. Therefore, the minimum quality tread rubber used must be of a grade\nand quality level which is considered as a manufacturer's highest quality\nexclusive of premium grades designed for high abrasion resistance. (2)\n\nLabelling. Tread rubber shall show whether it is natural rubber, cold\nrubber, or synthetic rubber and will also show rate of cure, such as, fast cure\nor regular cure on each box. (3)\n\nStandard dimensional tolerances. For the purpose of measuring the width and thickness of\ntread rubber, a cut should be made straight across the full width of the tread\nrubber with a sharp knife. The cut should be made not less than three or more\nthan six feet from the outside end of the roll and also it must be away from\nthe point where the weight of the roll or other pressure may have distorted the\ndimensions. (i) Thickness includes\ncushion, if used, but does not include backing. (a) For nominal gauges of\n13\n/\n32\ninch and less, a\ntolerance of minus 0/64 inch and plus\n3\n/\n64\ninch is established. This excludes tread rubbers containing traction producing additives. (b) For nominal gauges of\n14\n/\n32\ninch and up to and\nincluding\n18\n/\n32\ninch, a\ntolerance of minus\n1\n/\n64\ninch\nand plus\n2\n/\n64\ninch is\nestablished. (c) For nominal gauges\nof\n20\n/\n32\ninch and up to and\nincluding\n24\n/\n32\ninch, a\ntolerance of minus\n1\n/\n64\ninch\nand plus\n3\n/\n64\ninch is\nestablished. (d) For nominal gauges\nof\n26\n/\n32\ninch and up to and\nincluding\n32\n/\n32\ninch, a\ntolerance of minus\n2\n/\n64\ninch\nand plus\n4\n/\n64\ninch is\nestablished. (ii)\n\nWidth. (a) For tread rubber\nsizes with a base width of six inches and less, a tolerance of plus\n1\n/\n16\ninch and minus [ inch is\nestablished. (b) For tread rubber\nsizes with a base width of more than six inches, but not more than 12 inches, a\ntolerance of plus [ inch and minus [ inch is established. (c) For tread rubber with a base width of\nover 12 inches, a tolerance of plus 1/4 inch and minus 1/4 inch is\nestablished. (iii)\n\nBevel or wing width. (a) Wing width control. (1)\n\nFor\n\"wing-size\"\ntread rubber with a base width of six inches or\nless, the center line of the crown should coincide with the center line of the\nbase within\n1\n/\n16\ninch. (2)\n\nFor\n\"wing-size\"\ntread rubber with a base width of six inches but\nnot over 12 inches, the center line of the crown should coincide with the\ncenter line of the base within [ inch. (3)\n\nFor\n\"wing-size\"\ntread\nrubber with a base of over 12 inches, the center line of the crown should\ncoincide with the center line of the base within 1/4 inch. (b) Bevel width. For all\n\"Bevel\" tread rubber, the center line of the crown should coincide with the\ncenter line of the base within\n1\n/\n16\ninch. (iv)\n\nWing edge\nthickness. A maximum edge thickness of\n7\n/\n64\ninch is established. (a) The thickness should be measured by using\ncalipers with graduations in 64th's of an inch. (b) The calipers should have the jaws opened\nat\n7\n/\n64\ninch and the wing\nedge inserted. If the edge is admissible, it meets the required\ndimension. (v) Center line position. The center point of the center line mark\nshould be within\n1\n/\n16\ninch of\nthe actual measured center of the crown of the tread rubber when the crown\nwidth is 10 inches or less, and it should be within [ inch of the measured\ncenter of the crown when the crown width is over 10 inches. (4)\n\nPadding stock. The padding stock shall be suitable for filling in worn\n(low) spots under tread rubber and made from a fast cure compound compatible\nwith natural and synthetic rubber. (5)\n\nFiller strip stock. The filler strip stock shall be a minimum of\n4\n/\n32\ninch thickness at the\ncenter line. This stock shall be suitable for filling around the complete\ncircumference of the tire being retreaded to insure the proper undertread, and\nshall be made from a fast cure compound compatible with natural and synthetic\nmaterials. (6)\n\nCement. Vulcanizing cement used for adhesion of conventional tread\nrubber to the buffed tire shall be made with natural rubber and the necessary\ncement must be capable of being vulcanized and suitable for the use intended. Special cements made for the adhesion of particular compounds such as those\nused in extrusion application of tread stock must be specifically compounded to\nmeet all necessary requirements as an adhesive and bonding agent-both before\nand after cure. It is not required that this type of cement be made of any\nspecific rubber type, or that the solvent be a petroleum distillate\nalone. (7)\n\nRubber solvent. The rubber solvent shall consist entirely of petroleum\ndistillate, and shall be water-clear, free from foreign material, acid, water, or antiknock materials. When subjected to distillation in accordance with an\napplicable method, the solvent shall show an initial boiling point (I.B.P.) of\n100 degrees to 140 degrees Fahrenheit, and an end point (E.P.) of 250 degrees\nto 300 degrees Fahrenheit, with no oily residue. (8)\n\nAge limits and storing conditions for\nrepair materials and tread rubber of all types, including strip stock for\nextrusion machines. Tread rubber for pneumatic tires of all types, repair\nmaterials and unvulcanized accessories should be stored in a dry place, protected from the elements and direct exposure to sunlight and the temperature\nof the storage area should be kept below 80 degrees Fahrenheit. Under these\nconditions, tread rubber and repair materials should be expected to remain in a\nsatisfactory condition for six months after date of receipt from the\nmanufacturer. Colder storage conditions extend the shelf life, without harm to\nthe product. Warmer storage conditions shorten the shelf life. Tread rubber and\nrepair materials exposed to temperatures of 80 degrees to 95 degrees\n\nFahrenheit, can be expected to have their shelf life reduced 25 percent and if\nstored at temperatures of 95 degrees to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, a reduction of\n50 percent or more can be expected. Tread rubber and repair materials will not\ntolerate temperatures of over 110 degrees for more than a very short time\nwithout danger of vulcanization. If the tread rubber and repair materials are\nexposed to temperatures which cause freezing or hardening of the stock (which\ncan occur at temperatures below 40 degrees Fahrenheit) the stock must be\ncarefully restored to its original condition by warming it at a temperature\nbetween 70 degrees and 90 degrees Fahrenheit. Tread rubber, repair materials\nand all unvulcanized accessories are made to meet exacting standards and to\nperform under existing field conditions, and at the same time to be as\nsatisfactory as possible for shelf aging. Because these materials are shipped\nto widely varied climates and are subjected to all types of storage the\npossibility of deterioration is always present. The storage period and\nconditions specified reflect general industry experience. Violation of these\nspecifications may be reflected as an appreciable deterioration of a percentage\nof the material affected and does not mean that such material is unusable or\nsubject to failure because of age. (d) Inspection of tire. (1)\n\nCareful inspections shall be made by a\nskilled operator, and shall include placing the tire on a mechanical spreader\nunder adequate lighting, distorting the natural contour of the tire\nsufficiently to expose any evidence of ply separation, impact breaks, or other\ndefects without damaging the bead. (2)\n\nInspection standards. Tires that have a known separation between the plies shall\nnot be retreaded, and should be destroyed. No tires to be accepted for\nretreading may contain any of the following weaknesses or injuries. (i) Ply separation. (ii)\n\nPly fabric injury in the bead area; also\nchafed fabric injuries in tubeless tires. (iii)\n\nBroken, damaged, bent, or exposed bead\nwires. (iv)\n\nFlex breaks. (v) Loose cords on the inner ply or evidence\nof having been run underinflated or overloaded. (vi)\n\nTread separation, other than that which\ncan be removed in the buffing operation. (vii)\n\nMore than surface weather\nchecking. (viii)\n\nGenerally weakened\ncondition due to age, moisture, and/or exposure. (ix)\n\nTubeless tires with porous liners or\ndefective splices in liners. (x) Any passenger motor vehicle casing containing an impact, bruise, or \"X\" type\nbreak, cut or any other type of casing injury requiring what is commonly known\nas a section repair. (xi)\n\nWear\nextending to the fabric. (xii)\n\nAny\ncracks, such as radial or groove cracks which extend to the fabric or which\ncannot be removed without exposing the fabric. (xiii)\n\nAny passenger motor vehicle tire\npreviously repaired, except a satisfactory nail hole repair. (xiv)\n\nAny open liner splice which shows\nexposed fabric. (xv)\n\nAny two-ply\ntire which is so worn that the cords of the top or outside ply will be damaged\nduring the buffing operation. (3)\n\nMoisture. All tires to be processed shall be thoroughly dry and all\ncords free of moisture. (4)\n\nNail holes. All nail holes must be thoroughly cleaned and inspected for\nextent of casing injury. If casing is punctured only and does not require a\nfull section repair or reinforcement, the nail hole may be filled and treated\nin the conventional manner so as to provide a sound tire body for\nprocessing. (e) Processing. (1)\n\nBuffing. The tire shall be uniformly buffed using a matrix template\nor other satisfactory system of measurement to insure proper matching of buffed\ncrown contour with matrix tread contour and overall diameter. The buffed\nsurface should be of a smooth texture and free from moisture, loose cords and\nforeign material which would affect adhesion properties between casing and\ntread rubber. Proper buffing dimensions for each matrix must be posted in the\nbuffing room. These should include: (i) Matrix identification. (ii)\n\nBuffed tread width. (iii)\n\nBuffed crown contour. (iv)\n\nOverall buffed width. (v) Overall buffed diameter. (vi)\n\nBead to bead dimensions where specified\nby matrix manufacturer. (vii)\n\nOverall diameter and cross-sectional data. with minimum and maximum measurements. (2)\n\nCementing. The cementing process should begin within a reasonable time\nafter the buffing operation is completed to avoid the hazards of an oxidized\nsurface. Each container of cement shall be tested for freshness. If solvent is\nused as a thinner, this too must be tested for presence of oil or water. Tires\nto be cemented must be free from moisture and foreign material such as buffing\ndust, dirt, loose cords, etc. Extreme caution must be taken on air lines used\nto blow dust from the surface of a tire. Efficient moisture traps must be\nlocated as close as possible to the air release valve to prevent moisture from\nbeing blown onto the surface of the tread area. (3)\n\nBuilding. (i) Full tread. Shall be\nmade with wing-type tread rubber, and shall extend over shoulders. (ii)\n\nTop tread. Shall extend\nonly across the tread area, thus conforming with that tread known commercially\nas a top tread. (iii)\n\nIf the\nbreaker is exposed on any portion of the buffed area, it shall be covered with\na suitable protective padding stock or cushion gum before applying the tread\nrubber. (iv)\n\nSplicing. Tread rubber shall be skived or butted at one end. The tread rubber shall then be applied to the tire and shall be centered over\nthe entire circumference. After the backing is removed, the cushion surface\nshall not be handled or touched. The other end of the tread rubber shall then\nbe skived or butted to match the end previously skived or butted. (v) Stitching. Stitching or\nrolling of tread rubber shall then be accomplished starting at the center and\nworking to the edges so that air pockets will be eliminated. Wrinkles at edges\nof tread (on wing dies) shall be thoroughly stitched. Edges of top tread rubber\nshall be tight. All air pockets must be eliminated. The use of mechanical\nstitchers or tread builders is recommended for efficiency. However, their\noperation must be checked for extrusion or thinning out of original tread\nrubber die size which causes thin spots, open slices, tread cracking, etc. (vi)\n\nExtrusion. Application of strip stock as used in extrusion\nmachines shall follow directions of equipment manufacturer. (4)\n\nCuring. (i) shall be started as soon as practicable\nafter the building operation has been completed. Curing temperatures, time, and\npressure shall accurately follow mold and rubber manufacturers directions. A\ncorrelation between the curing characteristics of the tread rubber and heating\ncharacteristics of the mold is necessary. Extra curing time must be taken into\nconsideration when using filling strips or padding stock and the rubber cured\naccordingly. (ii)\n\nCuring\nequipment. Molds and/or matrices shall be so designed and installed\nwith sufficient heat so that: (a) Temperatures to within plus or minus 5 degrees Fahrenheit tolerance will be\nmaintained according to mold and/or tread rubber manufacturer's\nrecommendation; (b) Necessary\nprecaution should be taken to provide uniform drainage of condensate from the\nmolds, if steam; (c) Necessary\nprecautions should be taken to obtain uninterrupted flow of current to molds, if electric; (d) Proper sizes of\ncuring tubes and rims shall be inserted in accordance with matrix manufacturers\nspecifications and in accordance with side wall thickness of tire. (iii)\n\nMolds shall be equipped with\ninstruments in good condition, located to indicate mold temperature accurately. They shall be so designed as to cure retreaded tires without damage or\ndistortion. (iv)\n\nAir pressure\nrecommended by equipment manufacturer must be maintained and controlled through\naccurate gauges as close to each outlet as possible in order to insure proper\nreading. (5)\n\nFinal\nfinishing. After curing, the retreader shall make a final examination\nof the tire, checking inside to insure that nail holes and loose cords have\nbeen properly treated and that the tire is not buckled. The outside of the tire\nshall be checked to insure adequate moldings and curing. The tread shall be\nstraight and not porous. Each tire shall be trimmed cleaned and/or\npainted. (6)\n\nTread\nthickness. The tread rubber used shall be of such thickness as to\nprovide the following amount of undertread to adequately meet requirements. Undertread thickness should be gauged after the tire has been retreaded and\ndoes not necessarily reflect tread rubber thickness. Tire size\n\nUnder tread\n\nSkid depth\n\nPassenger: Conventional Designs\n\nLess than 7.003 cross section\n9\n/\n32\n9\n/\n32\n7.003 cross section and larger\n2\n/\n32\n10\n/\n32\n\nPassenger: Mud and Snow Designs\n\nLess than 7.003 cross section\n2\n/\n32\n12\n/\n32\n7.003 cross section and larger\n2\n/\n32\n14\n/\n32\n\nCommercial Truck Tires\n(Less than 203 bead diameter)\n\nLess than 7.503 cross section\n3\n/\n32\n*\n7.503 cross section and larger\n4\n/\n32\n*\nLarge Truck Tires\n(203 bead diameter and larger)\n\nLess than 9.003 cross section\n4\n/\n32\n*\n9.003 cross section and larger\n5\n/\n32\n*\n*\nEqual to that of new 100 level tire of same size and\ntype-minus tolerance\n2\n/\n32\n\". (f) Control\ninstruments. The effective use of time clocks, heat gauges, mold and/or\nmatrix temperature gauges is required for the control of heat, time and air\npressure. These gauges should be calibrated regularly to insure their\naccuracy. (g) Warranty. In order that the consumer may know that the retreaded tire\npurchased actually complies with the specifications set forth in these\nstandards, all tires must carry a guarantee against defects in workmanship and\nmaterial as well as give satisfactory service under normal operating\nconditions. (h) Labelling. No person, firm, association or corporation shall sell, offer or expose for sale, or having in his possession with intent to sell any\nmotor vehicle tire or motorcycle tire which has been retreaded or recapped\nunless the fact that such tire has been retreaded or recapped and the name and\naddress of the person, firm, association or corporation which has done the\nretreading or recapping is plainly shown by a mark or label in the English\nlanguage on both side walls thereof.
