  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 71.7 - Interest subsidies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Maximum\namount of interest subsidy. (1)\n\nInterest\nsubsidies shall be available to program recipients on loans from financing\ninstitutions in principal amounts up to $250,000. (2)\n\nRate. The interest subsidy which the\ndepartment shall pay on loans to program recipients by financing institutions\nshall be equal to the difference between the loan interest rate and the base\nrate established by the department. The base rate shall initially be five\npercent, provided, however, that such base rate shall at no time exceed 75\npercent of the prime rate published daily in the Wall Street Journal. (b) Term. The term of an interest\nsubsidy shall be determined by the department, in its sole discretion, but\nshall not exceed 10 years. (c) Calculation of interest subsidy rate. (1)\n\nThe\namount of an interest subsidy shall be the difference between the total\ninterest due on a loan over the term of the loan, calculated at the financing\ninstitution's lending rate at the time of closing, and the interest due on such\nloan over such period, calculated at the base rate, multiplied by a fraction\nequal to the interest subsidy term divided by the term of the loan. The total\namount of the interest subsidy may be discounted to reflect the payment of\ninterest subsidies in advance of their becoming due. (2)\n\nFor variable rate loans, the amount of\nthe interest subsidy will not change during the subsidy period, regardless of\nfluctuations in the financing institution's lending rate on that loan, except\nin cases where such lending rate drops to a level where the interest subsidy\nwould result in the program recipient receiving a negative net interest rate. In such cases, the amount of the interest subsidy will be reduced\naccordingly. (d) Default\non interest subsidized loan. Except as otherwise provided for in this\nsubdivision, where a program recipient defaults on a loan, interest subsidies\nshall be terminated and any interest subsidy payments being held by the\nfinancing institution shall be returned to the department. The financing\ninstitution shall notify the department, in writing, of the default within 30\ncalendar days of its occurrence. The department, in its sole discretion, may\nauthorize the financing institution to continue to receive interest subsidies\non behalf of the program recipient for a period of time mutually agreed upon by\nthe department and the financing institution, in order for the financing\ninstitution to work out a revised payment schedule with the program recipient. If continued interest subsidies are authorized by the department and loan\npayments are not resumed by the program recipient within 90 days of the initial\ndefault, then all subsidy payments will be terminated immediately. Where a new\npayment schedule is established between the financing institution and the\nprogram recipient, the total interest subsidy originally approved by the\ndepartment will remain unchanged; provided, however, the department may\nestablish a revised schedule of interest subsidy payments on behalf of the\nprogram recipient. (e) Prepayment\nof loan. In the event of the prepayment of a loan, the financing institution\nshall promptly return to the department any unapplied portion of the interest\nsubsidy being held by the financing institution.
