  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-10.19 - Steam gages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each boiler shall have a steam gage connected to the steam space or to the\nwater column or to its steam connection. The steam gage shall be connected to a\nsiphon or equivalent device of sufficient capacity to keep the gage tube filled\nwith water and so arranged that the gage cannot be shut off from the boiler\nexcept by a cock placed near the gage and provided with a tee or lever handle\narranged to be parallel to the pipe in which it is located when the cock is\nopen. Connections to gages shall be of brass, copper, or bronze\ncomposition. (b) Where a pipe\nexceeding 10 feet in length becomes necessary, an exception may be made to the\nrule that the gage must be arranged so that it cannot be shut off except by a\ncock placed near the gage and a shutoff valve or cock arranged so that it can\nbe locked or sealed open may be used near the boiler. Such a pipe shall be of\nample size and arranged so that it may be cleared by blowing out. (c) Each boiler shall be provided with\none-quarter inch pipe-sized valve connection for attaching a test gage when the\nboiler is in service, so that the accuracy of the boiler steam gage can be\nascertained.
