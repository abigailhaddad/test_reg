  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 12.1 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Banking Board recognizes that banks and trust companies\nhave valid business reasons for acquiring, by purchase, lease or rental, residences and similar or related facilities (including the acquisition of\nshares together with a lease in the case of cooperative apartment purchases) to\nhouse directors, officers and employees under circumstances where arranging for\nconventional housing is impractical, whether within or without the United\n\nStates. Such acquisitions would be considered inappropriate by the Banking\n\nBoard, however, if motivated principally by investment\nobjectives. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n12.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
