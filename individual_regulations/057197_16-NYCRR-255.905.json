  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.905 - High consequence areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. To determine which segments of an operator's transmission pipeline\nsystem are covered by sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part, an operator\nmust identify the high consequence areas. An operator must use methods defined\nin section\n255.903\n(f)(1) or\n(2)\nof this Part to identify a high\nconsequence area. An operator must use the method to its entire pipeline\nsystem, or an operator may apply one method to individual portions of the\npipeline system. An operator must describe in its integrity management program\nwhich method it is applying to each portion of the operator's pipeline system. The description must include the potential impact radius when utilized to\nestablish a high consequence area. (See Appendix 14-E.I of this Title for\nguidance on identifying high consequence areas.)\n(b) (1)\n\nIdentified sites. An operator must identify an identified site, for purposes of\nsections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part, from\ninformation the operator has obtained from routine operation and maintenance\nactivities and from public officials with safety or emergency response or\nplanning responsibilities who indicate to the operator that they know of\nlocations that meet the identified site criteria. These public officials could\ninclude officials on a local emergency planning commission or relevant Native\n\nAmerican tribal officials. (2)\n\nIf a\npublic official with safety or emergency response or planning responsibilities\ninforms an operator that it does not have the information to identify an\nidentified site, the operator must use one of the following sources, as\nappropriate, to identify these sites. (i) visible marking (e.g., a sign); or\n(ii)\nthe site is licensed or registered by a\n\nFederal, State, or local government agency; or\n(iii)\nthe site is on a list (including a list\non an internet website) or map maintained by or available from a Federal, State, or local government agency and available to the general\npublic. (c) Newly identified areas. When an operator has information that the area around a\npipeline segment not previously identified as a high consequence area could\nsatisfy any of the definitions in section\n255.903\nof this Part, the operator\nmust complete the evaluation using method (1) or (2). If the segment is\ndetermined to meet the definition as a high consequence area, it must be\nincorporated into the operator's baseline assessment plan as a high consequence\narea within one year from the date the area is identified. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.905\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
