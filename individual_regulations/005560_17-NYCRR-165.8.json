  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 165.8 - Load capacity evaluation\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach bridge which is subject to the inspection provisions\nof this code, shall be rated for safe load carrying capacity. Load ratings\nshall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the AASHTO Manual. If\nit is determined by this load rating process that the maximum legal total load\nunder State law exceeds the load equivalent to the operating rating capacity\nlevel as defined by the AASHTO Manual, the bridge must be load posted subject\nto sections\n233\nand\n234\nof the Highway\n\nLaw, and sections\n1621, 1640, 1650\nand\n1660\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law. (a) Level 1 and level 2 load ratings. Level 1 and level 2 load ratings are defined\nto differentiate between rating analyses of differing degree of sophistication\nand/or comprehensiveness, and to differentiate whether or not the rating is\ncertified by a licensed professional engineer. (1)\n\nLevel 1 load rating: A level 1 rating\nrefers to any fully documented analysis or capacity evaluation that is signed\nand certified by a licensed professional engineer as being complete and correct\nin its computation of bridge load capacity. Generally, a level 1 analysis shall\nbe in conformance with the analysis assumptions and provisions of the AASHTO\nManual. However, evaluation methods and/or analysis assumptions that differ\nfrom the AASHTO provisions are permitted provided that they conform to accepted\nstructural engineering practice, and they are fully documented and certified as\nbeing correct and appropriate by the certifying licensed professional\nengineer. (2)\n\nLevel 2 load rating: A level 2 load rating refers to a specific type of computerized load rating\nanalysis produced by the department as part of its general bridge inspection\nprogram. However, any uncertified rating analysis that substantially conforms\nto the provisions and assumptions of the AASHTO Manual may be referred to as a\nlevel 2 load rating. Level 2 load ratings may be used to identify bridges that\nare likely to be load capacity deficient and must receive further evaluation. Level 2 ratings may be used to assign interim load restrictions to a deficient\nbridge until a level 1 load rating can be undertaken. The department's level 2\nload ratings are computed using a department owned and maintained system of\ncomputer programs whose logic substantially conforms to analysis methods and\nassumptions contained in the AASHTO Manual. For each type of bridge capable of\nbeing analyzed, the level 2 programs contain some general assumptions relating\nto the location of critical components or cross sections to be analyzed. Although they are normally appropriate and generally accurate for typical\nsituations they may not be correct in every case. Although quality control\nreviews are made, the department does not certify its level 2 ratings as being\ncomplete and fully correct in its computation of load capacity. The department\nmaintains computer records of its level 2 data and analysis results, and\nupdates this information on a periodic basis as part of its general inspection\nprocess. (b) Criteria\nfor performing level 1 load rating. (1)\nA\nlevel 1 load rating shall be performed as part of the structural design process\nfor all new and replacement bridges and for all rehabilitation and repair\ndesigns involving a substantial structural alteration to the bridge. The level\n1 load rating results for the new or reconstructed structure shall be\nsummarized in a table placed on the contract drawings which are prepared for\nthe project. (2)\nA level 1 load\nrating shall be included as part of all Structural Integrity Evaluations as\ndefined and required by Section\n165.11\nof this Code. (3)\nA level 1 load rating shall be performed\nwhenever the posted load on a bridge, or full legal load if the bridge is not\nposted, exceeds the operating rating capacity determined by a level 2 load\nrating. (c) documentation of level 1 load ratings. (1)\n\nLoad rating vehicles: all level 1 load ratings shall be based on both the\nAASHTO \"HS\" and \"H\" analysis vehicle configurations. Both the AASHTO \"HS\" and\n\"H\" truck loads and equivalent lane loads shall be used to determine the rating\nvalues. If the inventory rating as defined by the AASHTO manual based on the\n\"HS\" vehicle loading equals or exceeds HS-20 (36 tons), it is not necessary to\ncompute ratings based on the \"H\" loading. Load ratings based on the AASHTO\n\"Typical Legal Load Types\" (Type 3, Type 3S2, Type 3-3) or any other rating\nvehicle configuration are not required by this Code, but may be desirable to\nuse for individual posting evaluations. (2)\n\nRating summary sheet: all level 1 rating\ndocumentation shall contain a rating summary sheet, which provides the\ninventory and operating ratings, as such terms are defined in the AASHTO\nmanual, for the bridge. The rating summary sheet shall also tabulate the\nratings for each individual span or continuous span structural unit. For\nbridges which have structural floor systems, the ratings of the controlling\nfloor system components as well as the main members shall be tabulated. Individual load rating values shall be expressed in terms of the equivalent\nrating vehicle and tonnage as shown: Examples::HS-22 (39.6 tons)\n\nExamples::H-24 (24 tons)\n\nThe level 1 rating summary sheet shall be signed by the\nload rating engineer. (d) Filing requirements for level 1 load\nratings. All level 1 load ratings shall be filed with the Department. The level\n1 load ratings shall be filed by submitting two signed copies of the rating\ncalculations and summary sheets to the Department's Region Office in which the\nrated bridge is located. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n165.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
