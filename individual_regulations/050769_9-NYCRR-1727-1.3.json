(c) Applications, on a form\napproved by the division, shall be available in the housing development's\nrental or management office.

(f) Eligible applicants shall be given one right of refusal of an apartment without\nprejudice to their standing on the waiting list.

A copy of this notice and the application will be\nfiled alphabetically by surname in the ineligible file and retained by the\nhousing company for a period of five years. However, nothing contained herein\nshall apply to applicants who are ineligible because of excess income for the\napartment offered but who would be eligible for an apartment of the same\nbedroom size having higher income limits.
