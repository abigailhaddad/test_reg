  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 90.5 - Special provision for residential customers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this\nsection, and when used in section\n90.6\nof this Part, the following\ndefinitions shall apply: (1)\n\nExisting\nresidential customer is a customer who receives electric service to a dwelling\nunit which such customer uses for his residential purposes and where business\nrates do not apply to the service. An existing residential customer includes an\napplicant for electric service who has transferred dwelling units within a\nutility's service territory and for whom there is a recent payment\nhistory. (2)\n\nNew residential\ncustomer is an applicant for electric service to a dwelling unit which such\ncustomer uses for his residential purposes and where business rates do not\napply to the service, and who does not qualify as an existing residential\ncustomer. (3)\n\nDelinquent in payment\nmeans, unless a more liberal standard is adopted by the utility, that a\nresidential customer has not paid in full a duly rendered bill, or an\nagreed-upon partial payment, for electric service 25 days after the \"to date\"\nof the bill or within a longer period agreed to by the utility. A residential\ncustomer who has not paid in full a bill, or an agreed-upon partial payment, for electric service in circumstances where disconnection for nonpayment is\nprecluded under utility complaint procedures established under section\n143.8\nof this Title or commission\ncomplaint procedures under Part 11 of this Title, shall not be considered\ndelinquent in payment. (4)\n\nPayment\nshall be considered accomplished on the date when the full amount of the bill\nor an agreed-upon partial payment is received by the electric corporation or\ngas and electric corporation or by any of such corporation's agents; provided, however, that if payment is mailed to such corporation or its agents, payment\nshall be considered accomplished as of the mailing by the consumer. (b) Credit risk standards. (1)\n\nAn existing residential customer may not\nbe considered a bad credit risk unless such customer has been delinquent in\npayment two or more times within a recent 12-month period, or unless such\ncustomer's electric service has been discontinued for nonpayment during the\npreceding 12 months. (2)\nA new\nresidential customer may not be considered non-credit-rated unless such\ncustomer is unable to provide, to the satisfaction of the utility, affirmative\nanswers to three or more of the six questions contained in Appendix 15-A of\nthis Title, infra. Each electric corporation and gas and electric corporation\nshall adopt procedures which provide for use of the six questions appearing in\n\nAppendix 15-A of this Title, infra. An electric corporation or gas and electric\ncorporation may determine whether to require a deposit from a new residential\ncustomer in accordance with the credit risk standards provided in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision, if sufficient information is available from a New York\nutility rendering comparable service to determine whether such customer is a\nbad credit risk as defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If a new\nresidential customer can establish prior satisfactory credit history with a\nutility rendering electric service at the customer's most recent address, the\nelectric corporation may not obtain a security deposit from such new\nresidential customer. (c) Residential customer deposits. No\nelectric corporation or gas and electric corporation may require a deposit from\na residential customer unless such corporation shall establish that the\nresidential customer is a bad credit risk or non-credit-rated in accordance\nwith the definitions and standards prescribed in this section. (d) No electric corporation or gas and\nelectric corporation may require a deposit from a residential customer in\nexcess of two times the estimated average monthly bill for a calendar year\nexcept in the case of electric or gas space heating customers where deposits\nmay not exceed two times the estimated average monthly bill for the heating\nseason.
