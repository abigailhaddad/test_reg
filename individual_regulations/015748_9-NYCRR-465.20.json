(1)\n\nThe commissioner, or any designee of the\ncommissioner including, but not limited to, those specifically referred to in\nthese rules, may, on his or her own motion, whenever justice so requires, reopen a proceeding, determination or record, and take such action as may be\ndeemed necessary. (2)\n\nNo case shall\nbe reopened where an appeal has been taken to court from an order dismissing a\ncase for lack of probable cause or lack of jurisdiction. However, the division\nmay request the court to remand such a case for good cause. (b) Reopening a probable cause\ndetermination on application of a respondent. (1)\n\nThe commissioner, or any designee of the\ncommissioner, may, on written application of a respondent, made within 60 days\nafter the division issues a determination of probable cause, whenever justice\nso requires, reopen a proceeding and take such action as may be deemed\nnecessary. The general counsel shall be the designee of the commissioner for\nthe purposes of this subdivision. (2)\n\nRespondent's application must be served\non all parties. Complainant will be given an opportunity to submit a response\nto the application. No additional submissions from the parties will be\naccepted. (c) Time to\nappeal expired. Where a complaint has been dismissed after investigation for\nlack of probable cause or lack of jurisdiction, the time to appeal to court has\nexpired, and less than one year has passed since the dismissal, reopening may\nbe predicated only upon: (1)\nactions\noccurring subsequent to the investigation; or\n(2)\nan allegation of newly discovered\nevidence of wrongdoing, fraud or irregularity which the applicant could not, with due diligence, have discovered before the dismissal of the\ncomplaint. (d) Withdrawn\ncomplaints. Where a complaint has been withdrawn, it may not be reopened except\nupon an allegation that the withdrawal was induced by fraud, coercion, or\nerror, contained in a written application for such reopening made to the\ndivision within one year after the issuance by the division of a notice that\nsaid complaint has been withdrawn, or within one year from the effective date\nhereof. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to limit the complainant's\nright to refile a withdrawn complaint no later than one year after the alleged\ndiscriminatory practice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
