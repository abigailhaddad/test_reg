Tit. 15 § 127.6 - Evidence; discovery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to a hearing, a respondent may make\na request to review nonconfidential information in the hearing file including\ninformation which is not protected by law from disclosure. If the file has been\nsent to the hearing officer or is scheduled to be sent within seven days of\nreceipt of a request by the Safety Hearing Bureau, examination of the\ninformation will be arranged by the hearing officer. The examination will be\nscheduled for a time at least five days prior to the hearing unless a shorter\ntime is mutually agreed between the hearing officer and the requestor. If the\nfile has not been sent to the hearing officer and is not scheduled to be sent\nwithin seven days of receipt of a request by the Safety Hearing Bureau, the\nfile will be made available for examination at the Safety Hearing Bureau before\nthe usual date scheduled for sending the file to the hearing officer. A\nrespondent may elect to examine the file after it is received by the hearing\nofficer rather than while it is in the custody of the Safety Hearing Bureau. If\na request to examine the file is received less than seven days prior to the\nhearing date, the requestor will be afforded an opportunity to examine the file\nimmediately prior to commencement of the hearing or at an earlier time as may\nbe agreed to in the discretion of the hearing officer.

(c) The privileges set forth in article 45 of\nthe Civil Practice Law and Rules shall be applicable in hearings conducted\npursuant to this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
