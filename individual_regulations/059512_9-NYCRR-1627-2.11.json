  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-2.11 - Tenant's refusal to cooperate in income determination\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe failure, neglect or refusal of a tenant to furnish\ninformation concerning his income or that of any member of his household, or to\ncooperate in the verifying of such reported income will be considered as\nnon-cooperation and will be assumed to indicate excess income. Such tenant will\nbe notified of his ineligibility, increased to the vacating rent, and legal\naction taken to obtain his eviction as not complying with the rules and\nregulations of the authority. However, upon submission of proper documents, surcharges, if any, will be assessed on basis of verified income. In no event\nwill credit be given for excess surcharges already assessed as a result of\nfailure, neglect or refusal of tenant to cooperate in income determination as\nset forth in this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1627-2.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
