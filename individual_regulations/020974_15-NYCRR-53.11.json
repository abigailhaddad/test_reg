  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 53.11 - Provisions relating to certain after-market brake linings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Aftermarket\nbrake linings manufactured or distributed prior to July 1, 1966, may meet the\nidentification requirements of this Part by having the necessary information\nspecified in section\n53.6\nof this Part affixed on the\nface of the brake lining, or while such brake linings are in the original box\nor container, on such box or container. (b) The lack of identification as required in\nsection\n53.6\nor subdivision (a) of this\nsection on any after-market brake lining manufactured or distributed prior to\n\nJuly 1, 1966, shall be presumptive evidence that such brake lining has not been\napproved. Such presumption may be overcome by certification from the\nmanufacturer of the lining that such lining was produced from a formulation\nwhich is approved, indicating the formulation number from which such lining was\nproduced and the date such formulation was approved. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n53.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
