(b) Treatment of income. (1)\n\nAt any time after the commencement of a\ncontinuous period of institutionalization, an assessment of the amount of the\ncommunity spouse monthly income allowance and/or family allowance may be\nrequested in accordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (2)\n\nUnless rebutted by a preponderance of the\nevidence, for purposes of determining MA eligibility the following presumptions\nwill apply with respect to the availability of income to an institutionalized\nspouse: (i) No income of the community spouse\nshall be considered available to the institutionalized spouse except as\nprovided for in this section. (ii)\n\nIncome solely in the name of the institutionalized spouse or the community\nspouse shall be considered available only to that respective spouse. (iii)\n\nIncome in the names of the\ninstitutionalized spouse and the community spouse shall be considered available\none half to each spouse. (iv)\n\nIncome in the names of the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse, or\nboth, and also in the name of another person or persons, shall be considered\navailable to each spouse in proportion to the spouse's interest or, if in the\nnames of both spouses and no share is specified, one half of the joint interest\nshall be considered available to each spouse. (v) Income from a trust shall be considered\navailable to each spouse in accordance with the provisions of the trust\ninstrument, or, in the absence of a specific trust provision allocating income, in accordance with the provisions of subparagraphs (ii) through (iv) of this\nparagraph. (vi)\n\nIncome in which\nthere is no instrument establishing ownership shall will be considered to be\navailable one-half to each spouse. (3)\n\nThe eligibility of an institutionalized\nspouse for MA for the first month or partial month of institutionalization will\nbe determined by comparing his/her net available income, computed in accordance\nwith section\n360-4.6\n(a)(1) and\n(2)\nof this Part, and any income actually\ncontributed by the community spouse, to the appropriate MA or PA income\nstandard for one person. Thereafter, the institutionalized spouse's eligibility\nfor MA and liability for the cost of care will be determined in accordance with\nthis section and with sections 360- 1.4(c) and 360-4.9 of this Part until the\nmonth following the month in which he/she ceases to be an institutionalized\nspouse. (4)\n\nIn determining the\namount of the institutionalized spouse's income to be applied toward the cost\nof medical care, services and supplies, the following items will be deducted\nfrom the otherwise available monthly income of the institutionalized spouse in\nthe following order: (i) a personal needs\nallowance; (ii)\na community spouse\nmonthly income allowance, but only to the extent that the income is made\navailable to or for the benefit of the community spouse; (iii)\na family allowance for each family\nmember; and\n(iv)\nany expenses\nincurred for medical care, services or supplies and remedial care for the\ninstitutionalized spouse not subject to payment under this Title or by a third\nparty. (5)\n\nThe community\nspouse will be requested to contribute 25 percent of his/her income in excess\nof the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance and any family allowances\ntoward the cost of necessary care or assistance for the institutionalized\nspouse. An institutionalized spouse will not be denied MA because the community\nspouse refuses or fails to make such income available. However, nothing\ncontained in this paragraph prohibits a social services district from enforcing\nthe provisions of the Social Services Law which require financial contributions\nfrom legally responsible relatives, or recovering from the community spouse the\ncost of any MA provided to the institutionalized spouse. (6)\n\nIf either spouse establishes that the\ncommunity spouse needs income above the level established by the social\nservices district as the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, based\nupon exceptional circumstances which result in significant financial distress\nas defined in paragraph (a)(9) of this section, the department must substitute\nan amount adequate to provide additional necessary income from the income\notherwise available to the institutionalized spouse. (c) Treatment of resources. The following\nrules apply in determining the resources available to the institutionalized\nspouse and the community spouse when establishing eligibility for MA for the\ninstitutionalized spouse. (1)\n\nAt any time\nafter the commencement of a continuous period of institutionalization, either\nspouse may request an assessment of the total value of their resources, or may\nrequest to be notified of the amounts of the community spouse monthly\nallowance, the community spouse resource allowance, and the family allowance, and/or the method of computing such amounts. (i) Assessment. Upon receipt of a request for\nassessment, together with all relevant documentation of the resources of both\nspouses, the social services district must assess and document within 30 days\nthe total value of the spouses' resources and provide each spouse with a copy\nof the assessment and the documentation upon which it was based. If the request\nis not part of an MA application, the social services district may charge a fee\nnot exceeding $25 for the assessment which is related to the cost of preparing\nand copying the assessment and documentation. (ii)\n\nDetermination of allowances. At the\nrequest of either spouse, the social services district must notify the\nrequesting spouse of the amounts of the community spouse monthly income\nallowance, the community spouse resource allowance, and the family allowance, and/or the method of computing such amounts. (iii)\n\nNotice of right to a fair hearing. At\nthe time of an assessment or a determination of allowances pursuant to this\nparagraph, the social services district must provide to each spouse who\nreceived a copy of such assessment or determination a notice of the right to a\nfair hearing under section\n358-3.1\n(g) of\nthis Title. If the assessment or determination is made in connection with an\napplication for MA, the fair hearing notice must be sent to both spouses at the\ntime of eligibility determination is made. Section\n358-3.1\n(g) of\nthis Title provides a fair hearing right to an institutionalized spouse or\ncommunity spouses, after a determination has been made on the institutionalized\nspouses's MA application, if the spouse is dissatisfied with the determination\nof the community spouse monthly income allowance, the amount of monthly income\ndetermined to be otherwise available to the community spouse, the amount of\nresources attributed to the community spouse or to the institutionalized\nspouse, or the determination of the community spouse resource\nallowance. (2)\n\nAt the\ntime of application of the institutionalized spouse for MA, all resources, including resources required to be considered in determining eligibility\npursuant to section\n360-4.4\nof this Subpart, held by\neither the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse, or both, will be\nconsidered available to the institutionalized spouse to the extent that the\nvalue of the resources exceeds the maximum community spouse resource\nallowance. (3)\n\nIn the event that a\ncommunity spouse fails or refuses to cooperate in providing necessary\ninformation about his/her resources, such refusal will be a reason for denying\nMA for the institutionalized spouse because MA eligibility cannot be\ndetermined. However, an institutionalized spouse will not be determined\nineligible for MA in this situation if; the institutionalized spouse executes\nan assignment of his/her right to pursue support from the community spouse in\nfavor of the social services district and the department, or is unable to\nexecute such an assignment due to physical or mental impairment; and to deny\nassistance would be an undue hardship, as defined in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (4)\n\nIf necessary\ninformation about the resources of the community spouse is provided, but the\ncommunity spouse fails or refuses to make available his/her resources in excess\nof the maximum community spouse resource allowance, the institutionalized\nspouse will be eligible for MA only if; the institutionalized spouse is\notherwise eligible; and the institutionalized spouse executes an assignment of\nhis/her right to pursue support from the community spouse in favor of the\nsocial services district and the department, or the institutionalized spouse is\nunable to execute such an assignment due to physical or mental impairment. However, nothing contained in this paragraph prohibits a social services\ndistrict from enforcing the provisions of the Social Services Law which require\nfinancial contributions from legally responsible relatives, or recovering from\nthe community spouse the cost of any MA provided to the institutionalized\nspouse. (5)\n\nAfter the month in\nwhich the institutionalized spouse has been determined eligible for MA during a\ncontinuous period of institutionalization, no resource of the community spouse\nwill be considered available to the institutionalized spouse. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding section\n360-4.4\nof this Subpart, after an\ninstitutionalized spouse is determined eligible for MA, transfers of resources\nby the institutionalized spouse to the community spouse will be permitted to\nthe extent that the transfers are solely to or for the benefit of the community\nspouse and do not exceed the value of the community spouse resource allowance. Such transfers must be made within 90 days of the eligibility determination or\nwithin such longer period as determined by the social services district in\nindividual cases. Such resources must actually be made available to meet the\nneeds of the community spouse in order to be excluded when determining the\ncontinuing eligibility of the institutionalized spouse. (7)\n\nIf either spouse establishes that income\ngenerated by the community spouse resource allowance, established by the social\nservices district, is inadequate to raise the community spouse's income to the\nminimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, the department must establish\nresource allowance adequate to provide such minimum monthly maintenance needs\nallowance from those resources considered to be available to the\ninstitutionalized spouse.
