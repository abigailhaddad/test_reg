The Secretary\nshall prepare a written determination with findings in support of each area to\nbe designated. (b) Before any\nsignificant coastal fish and wildlife habitat area, scenic area of statewide\nsignificance or important agricultural land is designated, timely public notice\nshall be provided and one or more public hearings held. Notice shall appear in\na paper of general circulation in the area of site designation at least 10 days\nprior to the hearing date. Said hearings shall be held at a location convenient\nto those who are likely to be affected by or have an interest in such\ndesignations. Public notice shall include the time and location of the hearing, identify the areas proposed for designation, facilitate public comment by\nannouncing the availability for inspection of the documentation supporting the\nnomination of any site proposed for designation, and by requesting public\ncomment and participation at the hearing. (c) A significant coastal fish and wildlife\nhabitat area shall be eligible for designation only if it has been identified\nand recommended for designation by the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation (DEC). The Secretary shall designate all areas\nidentified and recommended by DEC, unless the Secretary finds, after the public\nreview process: (1)\nthat there was an error\nin the evaluation of the area pursuant to the significant coastal fish and\nwildlife habitat area criteria of section\n602.5\n(a) of this\n\nPart; or\n(2)\nthat designation would\nnot lead to the achievement of the purposes of the significant habitat policy\nfound at section\n600.5\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title. (d) Whenever\nthe Secretary, after public notice, hearing and comment pursuant to subdivision\n(b) of this section, shall determine to designate one or more areas, the\n\nSecretary shall make the appropriate significant area identifications on the\ncoastal area map, and file copies of the amended map with the clerks of each\ncounty and local government within whose jurisdictions the identified areas are\nsituated. The Secretary shall also provide a copy of the amended coastal area\nmap to each adjacent local government with any portion of its jurisdiction\nwithin the boundaries of the coastal area, and to each appropriate State and\n\nFederal agency. (e) The designation\nof significant areas shall take effect on the 15th day of the month following\nthe month during which the amended maps are filed in the office of the clerk of\nthe situs city, town or village. (f) After consultation with appropriate State\nagencies, the Secretary may repeal or modify an existing significant area\ndesignation, but only after repeating the notice procedure for designation\nfound in subdivision (b) of this section, and only upon a finding that repeal\nor modification is justified by changes to the characteristics of the area\nwhich were the basis for the original or subsequent designation.
