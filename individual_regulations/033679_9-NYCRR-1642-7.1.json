  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-7.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A physical\ninventory shall be maintained of all items of nonexpendable equipment and\nsupplies. As a basis for determining which items are to be inventoried, all\nitems which cost $25 or more each shall be considered nonexpendable. (b) Items. (1)\n\nFurniture; fixtures; refrigerators; tools; fixed and movable equipment; etc. The original cost of items falling\ninto this category shall be charged directly to the applicable cost or expense\naccounts (1410.9, 1460.9, 1460.10, 4490.1, 4760.2). As soon as possible after\npurchase or acquisition, the following information shall be recorded on an\ninventory card: description, date purchased, cost, voucher number, location and\nserial numbers. Each inventoriable item should be prominently identified as\nauthority property as soon as possible after acquisition either by stenciling, branding or by the use of metal numbered tags. (2)\n\nCommodities; supplies; materials. Fuel, paint supplies, and such other commodities, supplies, and materials (including\nsmall tools such as are issued to maintenance men) as the division may\nhereafter prescribe or the local agency may choose, shall be charged, in the\nfirst instance, to the inventory accounts provided and charged to the\napplicable cost or expense accounts as consumed or issued. All other\ncommodities, supplies, and materials shall be charged directly to the\napplicable cost or expense accounts. In addition to the general requirement of\na physical inventory for nonexpendable equipment and supplies, the local agency\nshall maintain a perpetual inventory on inventory cards (Exhibit 36 of Appendix\nS-8), whether or not the commodities, supplies and materials are charged to an\ninventory account in the first instance. Entries shall be made on these cards\nfor all stock received and issued. Such postings shall be made at least once a\nweek. No items shall be issued without a written requisition. A semiannual\nphysical inventory taken on September 30 and March 31 of each year shall be\nused to reconcile the balances on the inventory cards and differences between\nthe actual physical count and balances on the cards accounted for. Perpetual\ninventories not controlled by a general ledger inventory account need only be\nkept on a physical quantity basis. Although the same inventory card is used for\nboth (1) and (2), the cards covering the furniture and equipment items should\nbe filed separately from the cards covering the stockroom items. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-7.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
