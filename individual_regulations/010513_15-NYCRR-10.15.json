No sponsor may advertise or imply that it is\nassociated with or is an agent or employee of the Department.

(6)\n\nIf a language\nother than English is used in the course, all advertising related to such\ncourse must contain this fact. (7)\n\nInternet pre-licensing course advertising shall not be combined with any other\nadvertising, such as driving school or insurance agency advertising, unless it\nhas been approved by the Department, in accordance with this section, in order\nto protect the public from potentially confusing or misleading\ninformation. (8)\n\nNo sponsor may\npublish, advertise, or imply that the completion of the course conducted for\npre-licensing will result in \"erasing\", \"masking\" or deleting any information\nfrom a motorist's driving record, the reduction of points, or successful\ncompletion of a road test or driver education.

Such\ndocumentation and the proposed advertising must be reviewed and approved by the\n\nDepartment in accordance with the standards of this section before they may be\nused.
