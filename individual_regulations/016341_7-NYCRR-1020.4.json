A random urinalysis testing program shall\nnot be used for the purpose of harassing or intimidating any inmate. (b) Identifying the inmate to be\ntested. The inmate for whom a urinalysis test is requested shall be identified\nby an employee to a lieutenant or higher authority, and each urinalysis test\nshall be approved by the lieutenant or higher authority and documented on the\nrequest for urinalysis test form. Note: In facilities where sergeants serve as\nwatch commanders, such sergeants may approve urinalysis testing. (c) Ordering the inmate to be tested. The\ninmate ordered to submit a urine specimen for urinalysis testing shall be\ninformed of the underlying reason (whether suspicion, routine or random) why\ns/he is being ordered to submit the specimen. If the inmate refuses to submit\nthe specimen, s/he shall be informed that this refusal constitutes a violation\nof facility rules and that s/he may incur the same disciplinary disposition\nthat a positive urinalysis result could have supported. The resultant\nmisbehavior report shall indicate that the inmate was informed of the\nabove. (d) Obtaining the urine\nspecimen. (1)\n\nThe inmate shall be escorted\n(or shall report) to the facility infirmary, clinic or other appropriate\narea. (2)\n\nSecurity or medical staff\nshall hand to the inmate the specimen bottle, labeled with the inmate's name\nand number, the date, and any other relevant identifying information. This\ninformation shall be typed or written in indelible ink. The inmate shall also\nbe asked if s/he has been taking any medication in the past month, and the\ninmate's response shall be noted on the request for urinalysis test form. If\nthe inmate's response is \"yes\" and the subsequent test results are positive, an\ninquiry shall be made to medical personnel as to what medications the inmate\nhas received in the past month which may lead to a positive result. (3)\n\nSecurity or medical staff shall ensure\nthat the inmate submits an unadulterated urine specimen in the specimen bottle\nprovided by witnessing the inmate urinate into the bottle. The inmate must be\npat frisked prior to submitting the urine specimen and s/he may be required to\nwash hands or wear gloves to further ensure that the specimen submitted is that\nof the inmate. The foregoing shall be conducted by security or medical staff of\nthe same sex, in private and outside the presence of other inmates or staff. Female inmates may be required to urinate into a urine collector or an unused\nplastic cup, rather than the specimen bottle itself. The contents of the\ncollector or the cup shall then be transferred to the specimen bottle by the\ninmate, or by the witnessing staff person in the presence of the\ninmate. (4)\n\nIf the inmate is unable\nto provide a urine specimen immediately, s/he shall be detained until s/he is\nable to provide a urine specimen. Drinking water should be available in an\namount not to exceed eight ounces per hour. An inmate who is unable to provide\na urine specimen within three hours of being ordered to do so shall be\nconsidered to be refusing to submit the specimen. The inmate shall be informed\nthat this refusal constitutes a violation of facility rules and that s/he may\nincur the same disciplinary disposition that a positive urinalysis result could\nhave supported. The resultant misbehavior report shall indicate that the inmate\nwas informed of the above and it should include an alleged violation of rule\n180.14 as described in section\n270.2\nof this Title. (5)\n\nThe staff person\nwitnessing the submission of the specimen by the inmate shall make the\nappropriate notation on the request for urinalysis test form. If the inmate is\nunable within three hours of being ordered or if the inmate refuses to submit a\nurine specimen, this fact shall be noted on the request for urinalysis test\nform. (e) Procedure for\ninmates claiming to be unable to urinate in presence of others. The following\nprocedures shall be employed when the watch commander reasonably believes that\nthe inmate is unable to provide a urine specimen due to an alleged inability to\nurinate in the presence of others (shy bladder). Reasonable belief is based\nupon the following criteria, including, but not limited to: medical or mental\nhealth records supporting the inmate's claim (to be evaluated by health\nservices or OMH staff), prior disciplinary and/or computerized urinalysis\ntesting data indicating a history of urinalysis testing violations, if\napplicable, and the inmate's behavior and demeanor at the time of request for\nthe urine sample. (1)\n\nAuthorization. The\nwatch commander shall be notified by the staff member assigned to obtain the\nurine sample and provide verbal authorization for these procedures. (2)\n\nLocation.

The inmate shall not be allowed to retain any amount of\nwater. (iv)\n\nAn inmate who is unable\nto provide a urine specimen within three hours of the initial order to produce\na sample shall be considered to be refusing to submit the specimen. The inmate\nshall be informed that this refusal constitutes a violation of facility rules\nand that s/he may incur the same disciplinary disposition that a positive\nurinalysis result could have supported. The resultant misbehavior report shall\nindicate that the inmate was informed of the above and it should include an\nalleged violation of rule 180.14 as described in section 207.2 of this Title, noting that the procedures listed above in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this\nparagraph were followed. (f) Process the urine specimen. (1)\n\nIf the facility has urinalysis testing\napparatus: (i) All persons handling the\nspecimen shall make an appropriate notation under Chain of Custody on the\nrequest for urinalysis test form. The number of persons handling the specimen\nshall be kept to the minimum. The specimen shall be kept in a secure area at\nall times. (ii)\n\nPlace the specimen\nin a secured refrigerator if it is not to be tested immediately. If it is\nanticipated that the specimen will not be tested within one day, place it in a\nsecured freezer.

A\nsecond test shall be performed on the same sample. The results of the second\ntest shall be noted on a second urinalysis procedure form. If a positive result\nis obtained from the second test, the individual performing the urinalysis\ntesting shall cause a misbehavior report to be issued. The inmate's copy of the\nmisbehavior report shall be accompanied by the request for urinalysis test\nform, the urinalysis procedure form, the inmate's printed results produced by\nthe urinalysis testing apparatus for the positive tests and a statement of the\nscientific principles and validity of the testing apparatus. (v) If a negative test result is obtained on\nthe second test, the specimen shall be considered negative and no misbehavior\nreport shall be written. (2)\n\nIf the facility does not have its own\nurinalysis testing apparatus, the specimen may be forwarded to an independent\nlaboratory or to another facility that has urinalysis testing apparatus. (i) Place the specimen in a secured\nrefrigerator/freezer if it is not to be forwarded immediately. All persons\nhandling the specimen shall make an appropriate notation on the request for\nurinalysis test form. The number of persons handling the specimen shall be kept\nto a minimum. A log book shall be kept in the vicinity of the\nrefrigerator/freezer, and each person accessing the specimens shall note his\nname, the date, and the time of such access.
