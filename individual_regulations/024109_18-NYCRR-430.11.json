(b) The requirements of this section shall\npertain to all children placed in foster care for whom a uniform case record, as described in Part 428 of this Title, is required.

Whenever possible, a child\nshall be placed in a foster care setting which permits the child to retain\ncontact with the persons, groups and institutions with which the child was\ninvolved while living with his or her parents, or to which the child will be\ndischarged. It shall be deemed inappropriate to place a child in a setting\nwhich conforms with this standard only if the child's service needs can only be\nmet in another available setting at the same or lesser level of care. The\ninitial placement of the child into foster care and all subsequent placements\nmust take into account the appropriateness of the child's existing educational\nsetting and the proximity of such setting to the child's placement location. When it is in the best interest of the foster child to continue to be enrolled\nin the same school in which the child is currently enrolled, the agency with\ncase management, case planning or casework responsibility for the foster child\nmust coordinate with applicable local school authorities to ensure that the\nchild remains in such school. When it is not in the best interests of the\nfoster child to continue to be enrolled in the same school in which the child\nis currently enrolled, the agency with case management, case planning or\ncasework responsibility for the foster child must coordinate with applicable\nlocal school authorities where the foster child is placed in order that the\nfoster child is provided with immediate and appropriate enrollment in a new\nschool; and the agency with case management, case planning or casework\nresponsibility for the foster child must coordinate with applicable local\nschool authorities where the foster child previously attended in order that all\nof the applicable school records of the child are provided to the new\nschool.
