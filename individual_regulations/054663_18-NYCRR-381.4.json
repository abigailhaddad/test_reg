  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 381.4 - Restricted payments in ADC\nState Regulations\n(a) The use of a protective payee, vendor or\nother restricted payment is required: when the relative payee has demonstrated\nsuch inability to manage funds that the best interest of the child is not\nserved; or at the request of the recipient. (b) In making a determination of\nmismanagement in ADC cases, the following considerations shall apply: (1)\n\nMethods shall be in effect to identify\nchildren whose relatives have demonstrated such an inability to manage funds\nthat payments to the relative have not been or are not currently used in the\nbest interest of the child. This means that the relative has misused funds to\nsuch an extent that allowing him or her to manage the ADC grant is a threat to\nthe health or safety of the child. Nonpayment of bills may be used as an\nindication that mismanagement may exist. However, a determination of such\nmismanagement shall not be made solely on the fact that bills are not paid on a\ntimely basis. All relevant considerations shall be taken into account\nincluding, but not limited to the following: (i) The fact that more than one month has\npassed since the bill payment was due and payment has not yet been made or\nnotice of the termination of essential services for nonpayment of bills shall\nbe considered rebuttable presumptive evidence of inability to handle cash. Examples of how this presumption may be rebutted include, but are not limited\nto: (a) where a recipient demonstrates that\nthe family has experienced some emergency or extraordinary event for which it\nwas appropriate for available funds to be spent; (b) where a recipient demonstrates\nextraordinary expenses for necessary items not normally provided for by the\npublic assistance grant or by the medical assistance program or for which\npayment is not otherwise readily available from some other source; (c) where a recipient demonstrates that the\nfamily has withheld the payment of bills as a reasonable exercise of consumer\nrights where there is a legitimate dispute as to whether the terms of an\nagreement have been met. (ii)\n\nWhen a recipient is more than one month\nin arrears, and the vendor or his designated agent desires restricted payment, the vendor or his designated agent must make such request in writing to the\nlocal social services official. Prior to making such written request, the\nvendor or his designated agent shall attempt to collect the overdue payments\nfrom the recipient and shall provide evidence of such attempt to the social\nservices official when the written request is made. (iii)\n\nThe social services official shall\nadvise the recipient whenever a vendor or his designated agent requests\nrestricted payments. (iv)\n\nThe\nsocial services official shall advise the recipient of the decision to restrict\npayment by means of a timely and adequate notice detailing the reasons for the\nproposed action or shall advise the recipient of a decision not to restrict\npayment. (v) When a decision to\nmake restricted payments is made, the decision shall be entered in the case\nrecord and the reasons underlying the decision shall be fully\ndocumented. (vi)\n\nWhen a\ndetermination is made to restrict payment as a result of an action by a vendor\nor his designated agent, the rest of the grant will be paid as an unrestricted\nmoney payment unless additional conditions provide for further\nrestrictions. (2)\n\nCriteria shall be established to identify the circumstances under which\nrestricted payments will be made in whole or in part directly to: (i) another individual who is interested in\nor concerned with the welfare of such child or relative; or\n(ii)\nto a vendor or his designated agent, that is, a person or persons furnishing food, living accommodations or other\ngoods, services or items to or for the child, relative or essential\nperson. (3)\n\nProcedures\nshall be established for making restricted payments. Under this provision, part\nof the payment may be made to the family and part may be made as restricted\npayments. (4)\n\nWhen necessary, under\nappropriate circumstances, foster care shall be provided. (5)\n\nWhen problems and needs for services and\ncare of the recipients are manifestly beyond the ability of the protective\npayee to handle, responsibility shall be assumed by the social services\nofficial for appropriate action to protect the recipients. (c) In those ADC cases where an\napplicant/recipient requests a vendor or protective payment, the following\nconsiderations shall apply: (1)\nthe local\nsocial services district may use any combination of protective, vendor or two-\nparty payment; (2)\nthe request\nshall be in writing from the recipient to whom payment would otherwise be made\nin an unrestricted manner and shall be recorded or retained in the case\nrecord; (3)\nthe restriction shall\nbe discontinued promptly upon written request of the recipient who initiated\nit; and\n(4)\nthe social services\nofficial shall send an adequate notice to the recipient no later than the date\nof commencement or discontinuance of a restricted payment pursuant to this\nsubdivision.
