  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 9B.06 - Bicycles May Use Full Lane Sign (R4-11)\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE entire section; the R4-11 sign shall not be used in\n\nNew York, as its message is not an accurate reflection of Section 1234 of the\n\nNew York State Vehicle and Traffic Law, and could mislead inexperienced\nbicyclists into occupying inappropriate, and unsafe, positions within a\nroadway. On roadways where space is limited and interactions between motorists\nand bicyclists have proven problematic, it is preferable to either provide\npositive guidance to bicyclists in the form of Shared Lane Markings (see\n\nSection 9C.07) and/or warning to motorists in the form of the SHARE THE ROAD\n(W16-1P) plaque (see Section 2B. 19). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n9B.06\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
