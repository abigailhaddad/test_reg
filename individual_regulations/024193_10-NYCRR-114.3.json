Tit. 10 § 114.3 - Village of Saranac Lake\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 72 of the Public Health Law, heretofore set forth, shall apply to the entire drainage area of McKenzie Lake or Pond, situated in the townships of St. Armand and North Elba, Essex County, which forms the source of the public water supply of the village of Saranac Lake, New York. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term lake wherever used in this section is intended to refer to McKenzie Lake or Pond. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, stream, ditch, gutter or other natural channel or permeable artificial pipe or conduit of every kind, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into McKenzie Lake or Pond. (3)\n\nWherever in this section a linear distance of a structure or object from the lake or from a watercourse is mentioned, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of McKenzie Lake or Pond, or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary normal high-water mark of such watercourses. (c) Privies adjacent to the lake and watercourses. (1)\n\nNo water closet, privy, privy vault, pit or cesspool or other place or receptacle of any kind whatever used for the temporary or permanent deposit, reception or storage of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 300 feet of the lake or within 200 feet of any watercourse. (2)\n\nNo water closet, privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other place or receptacle of any kind, used for the temporary or permanent deposit, reception or storage of human excreta, other than the watertight, removable receptacles hereinafter prescribed, shall be located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 600 feet of the lake or of any watercourse. (3)\n\nEvery water closet, privy or place for the deposit, reception or storage of human excreta which is constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain within the aforesaid 600 feet of the lake or of any watercourse shall be arranged in such manner that all of said excreta shall be received and temporarily retained in suitable vessels or receptacles, which shall at all times be maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and which will permit of convenient removal to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid removable receptacles shall be removed to the garbage lot of the village of Saranac Lake, New York, or other accessible and suitable place outside of the watershed of the said McKenzie Lake and the receptacles emptied, cleansed and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in thoroughly sanitary condition and to effectually and strictly prevent any overflow whatever upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal herein specified and that the least possible annoyance or inconvenience be caused to the occupants of the premises or of adjoining premises. The excreta removed shall be thoroughly buried and covered in trenches or thoroughly dug into the soil in such place and manner that no sanitary harm, annoyance or objection may result therefrom. (5)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or the surface of the ground or to the height or flow of the subsoil or surface water or other special local condition, the excretal matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil into the lake or into any watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta shall, after due notice to the owner, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, offal, garbage, putrescible matter, etc. (1)\n\nNo sewage or excremental matter of any kind nor any compost or mixture containing the same shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted or discharged or allowed to escape or pass into the lake or any watercourse nor onto or into the ground within 600 feet of the lake or any watercourse. (2)\n\nNo offal, garbage or putrescible animal or vegetable matter of any kind nor any bath water, wash water or other polluted water or liquid shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or pass into the lake or into any watercourse, nor onto or into the ground within 300 feet from the lake or within 200 feet of any watercourse.

(2)\n\nNo raft, boat, launch or other craft shall be kept or used for any purpose on the lake, except that one row boat may be kept by the water department of the village of Saranac Lake and used only for purposes necessary to the operation, use or maintenance of the lake as a source of water supply to the village of Saranac Lake, and when not so used shall be so kept or fastened as not to be used for any other purpose nor by any other person than the one duly authorized by the said water department.
