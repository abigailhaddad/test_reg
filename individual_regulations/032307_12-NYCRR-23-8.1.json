  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-8.1 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Stability and strength. Mobile cranes, tower cranes and derricks used in\nconstruction, demolition and excavation operations shall be so constructed, placed and operated as to be stable. No component or part of any such crane or\nderrick shall be stressed beyond its rated capacity as determined by the\nmanufacturer or builder. (b) Inspection. (1)\n\nEvery mobile crane, tower\ncrane and derrick shall be thoroughly inspected by a competent, designated\nemployee or authorized agent of the owner or lessee of such mobile crane, tower\ncrane or derrick at intervals not exceeding one month. Such inspections shall\ninclude but not be limited to all blocks, shackles, sheaves, wire rope, connectors, the various devices on the mast or boom, hooks, controls and\nbraking mechanisms. (2)\nA written, dated and signed record of each such inspection shall be completed by the\ncompetent, designated employee or authorized agent who made the inspection on\nan inspection form provided by the commissioner. The most recent record of\ninspection of a moble crane, tower crane or derrick shall be posted inside the\ncab of such crane or derrick under a transparent protective covering or shall\nbe filed in an office on the job site available for examination by the\ncommissioner. Attached to such record of inspection shall be a written\ndesignation naming the competent employee or authorized agent. Such attached\ndesignation shall be signed by the owner or lessee of such mobile crane, tower\ncrane or derrick. (3)\n\nEvery mobile\ncrane, tower crane and derrick shall be inspected before being erected or\noperated for the first time on any job. (4)\n\nAdjustments and repairs to mobile cranes, tower cranes and derricks shall be made only by competent, designated\npersons. (5)\nA preventive\nmaintenance program shall be established for each mobile crane, tower crane and\nderrick based on the manufacturer's recommendations. Dated and detailed records\nof such programs shall be available on the job site for examination by the\ncommissioner. (c) Footings. A firm footing shall be provided for every mobile crane, tower crane\nand derrick. (d) Hoisting mechanism\nbrakes and locking devices. (1)\n\nEvery\npower-operated mobile crane, tower crane and derrick shall be provided with\nhoisting mechanism brakes capable of sustaining at rest one and one-half times\nthe maximum rated load on a single part line. Hand or foot operated brakes\nshall be provided with a substantial locking device to lock any such brake in\nengagement.

(4)\n\nReinforcing rods, conduit and lumber, when of uneven lengths as well as column clamps and similar items which cannot\nbe easily secured to form safe drafts or loads shall be hoisted in boxes. Each\nsuch box shall be substantially constructed and supported from its four corners\nby individual lengths of wire rope having spliced or clipped loops for\nattachment to the load line. The construction and suspension of each such box\nshall be capable of holding at least four times the load for which it is\nintended. (5)\n\nIn steel erection, when a load is suspended from a mobile crane, tower crane or derrick at two or\nmore points with slings, the eyes of the lifting legs of the slings shall be\nshackled together and this shackle or the eyes of the shackled slings shall be\nplaced on the hook. Alternatively, the eyes of the lifting legs may be shackled\ndirectly to the hoisting block, ball or balance beam. The eyes may be placed on\nthe lifting hook without shackles if the hook is of the safety type. (6)\n\nNo more than one load shall be suspended\nfrom the same load line of a mobile crane, tower crane or derrick at one\ntime. (f) Hoisting the\nload. (1)\n\nBefore starting to hoist with a\nmobile crane, tower crane or derrick the following inspection for unsafe\nconditions shall be made: (i) The hoisting\nrope shall be free from kinks. (ii)\n\nMultiple part lines shall not be twisted around each other. (iii)\n\nThe hook shall be brought over the load\nin such manner and location as to prevent the load from swinging when hoisting\nis started. (iv)\n\nThe load is well\nsecured and properly balanced in the sling or lifting device before it is\nlifted more than a few inches. (v) If there is a slack rope condition, it shall be determined that the hosting\nrope is properly seated on the drum and in the sheaves. (2)\n\nDuring the hoisting operation the\nfollowing conditions shall be met: (i) There\nshall be no sudden acceleration or deceleration of the moving load unless\nrequired by emergency conditions. (ii)\n\nThe load shall not contact any\nobstruction. (3)\n\nThe\nside loading of booms on mobile cranes, tower cranes and derricks shall be\nlimited to freely suspended loads. (4)\n\nMobile cranes, tower cranes and derricks\nshall not be used for dragging loads sideways. (5)\n\nMobile cranes, tower cranes and derricks\nshall not hoist, lower, swing or travel while any person is located on the load\nor hook. (6)\n\nMobile cranes, tower\ncranes and derricks shall not hoist or carry any load over and above any person\nexcept as otherwise provided in this Part (rule). (7)\n\nThe operator of any mobile crane, tower\ncrane or derrick shall not leave his position at the controls while any load is\nsuspended nor shall any person be permitted to work or pass under a stationary\nsuspended load. (g) Limitations on modifications of mobile cranes, tower cranes or derricks. No\nload-bearing component or part of any mobile crane, tower crane or power-driven\nderrick shall be replaced by another component or part nor shall any mobile\ncrane, tower crane or derrick be modified by the addition thereto or the\nremoval therefrom of any load-bearing component or part unless such replacement\nor modification shall be as certified by either the manufacturer or builder of\nsuch crane or derrick or by a professional engineer licensed to practice in the\n\nState of New York.
