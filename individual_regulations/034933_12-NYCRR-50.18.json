  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 50.18 - Associated hazards\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the protection against laser radiation, protection shall also be provided against any associated hazards which may be\npresent during the operation of any laser. Such associated hazards include but\nare not limited to the following: (a) Air contaminants. Vaporized target materials and toxic gases, vapors and fumes\nwhich may be associated with any laser may be present in a laser radiation\narea. Such dangerous air contaminants shall be removed or controlled in\naccordance with the provisions of Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 12 relating\nto \"Control of Air Contaminants\" and Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 18\nrelating to \"Exhaust Systems\". Adequate ventilation shall be maintained in each\nlaser installation. (b) Ultra-violet radiation. Ultra-violet radiation levels in excess of 0.5\nmicrowatt/cm2 for seven hours or 0.1 microwatt/cm2 for continuous exposure\nshall be avoided. Because quartz transmits ultra-violet radiation efficiently, particular care shall be taken to protect individuals from such radiation when\nquartz tubes are used in the laser system. (c) Electrical hazards. Any laser and its\nassociated electrical system may present electrical hazards. Every laser, including all associated electrical equipment, shall be so designed, constructed, installed and maintained as to minimize the possibility of\nelectrical hazards. (d) Cryogenic\ncoolants. The storage, handling and use of cryogenic coolants associated with\nlasers shall be such so as to minimize any hazards which such coolants may\npresent. (e) Fire hazards. Every\nlaser and every laser installation shall be designed, constructed, installed, operated and maintained so as to eliminate or reduce any fire hazard. In\naddition, every laser radiation area shall be maintained clear of any\nunnecessary materials in order to minimize any fire hazard. (f) Explosion hazards. Lasers and associated\nequipment may present explosion hazards. Such equipment shall be protected with\nexplosion shields to prevent injury to individuals from such hazards. (g) Ionizing radiation. A laser system may\nproduce ionizing radiation in which case such system shall be in compliance\nwith the provisions of Industrial Code Part (Rule No.) 38 relating to \"Ionizing\n\nRadiation Protection\" in respect to protection against ionizing\nradiation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
