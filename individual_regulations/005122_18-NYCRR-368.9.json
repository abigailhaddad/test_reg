Tit. 18 § 368.9 - Determination of grant and its payment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Allowances and grants to the aged, blind\nor disabled shall be determined and payments shall be made in accordance with\napplicable department regulations. (b) Grants to a child or minor who is blind\nor disabled shall be made as follows: (1)\nA\ngrant for a blind child or minor under age 18 who is not emancipated, shall be\nmade to a related adult member of the household who is caring for the\nchild.

In such case, a protective payment\nshall be made in accordance with department regulations. (3)\n\nGrants to cases receiving vocational\nrehabilitation services from Vocational Rehabilitation Service or Office of\n\nVocational Rehabilitation. A social services district shall grant or continue\nAABD assistance to an eligible applicant or recipient during the period such\nindividual is receiving vocational rehabilitation services from VRS or OVR, insofar as need for assistance is not caused by or increased by the program of\nrehabilitation. Such assistance shall not include the allowance provided by the\nrehabilitation agency to cover the cost of vocational services, which may\ninclude physical restoration services, training opportunities, necessary books\nand tools, and other related services required for the purpose of restoring, developing or improving the working ability of handicapped persons. When a\nperson is in receipt of such services and AABD, cooperative planning shall be\nentered into by the two agencies based on the following principles: (i) The social services district, which is\ngranting AABD to an individual applying for or receiving vocational\nrehabilitation services, shall continue the grant during the period he is\nreceiving training, provided he remains otherwise eligible. (ii)\n\nWhen the vocational rehabilitation\nprogram requires the recipient to reside out of district or out of State, AABD\nassistance shall be continued as long as the recipient remains in training and\nis otherwise eligible. (iii)\n\nIn\ninstances where there is no duplication of shelter costs because of the new\nresidence plan required by the rehabilitation services, the shelter item shall\nbe included in the grant. (iv)\n\nUpon\nnotification that the recipient has been accepted for vocational rehabilitation\nservices, the social services official shall provide that agency with a\ndetailed statement of the current grant and of any subsequent change during the\ntraining period. (v) If the\nrecipient who is in training requires medical treatment or hospitalization not\ndirectly connected with the treatment of conditions which directly affect the\nemployability of the recipent; this shall be provided under MA.
