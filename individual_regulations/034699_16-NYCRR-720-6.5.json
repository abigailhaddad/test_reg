  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 720-6.5 - Gas cost adjustment clauses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. The following definitions shall apply in connection with this\nsection: (1)\n\nGas is natural gas distributed\nby a public utility to its customers without change or after mixing with other\ngas, and pipeline quality gas manufactured from liquified propane. (2)\n\nBase cost of gas is the cost per Ccf, Mcf\nor therm which is included in stated tariff rates and established as the basis\nfor computing the gas cost adjustment. Upon approval by the commission, the\nbase cost of gas can be eliminated from the base tariff rates. (3)\n\nFees are amounts paid to brokers, agents, individuals or clearinghouses, which are directly associated with identifiable\ngas supply purchases. To be included in the average cost of gas computation, such fees are subject to the following conditions: (i) such fees must provide a net reduction in\nthe delivered cost to the public utility on an avoided cost basis, i.e., the\ncombination of gas costs, delivery costs, and fee payments must be less than\nthe cost of the supply that would have been taken but for said\npurchase; (ii)\nthe payment may not\nbe made to an affiliate of the public utility, nor may it be for gas ultimately\npurchased from an affiliate; (iii)\nno costs attributable to public utility personnel, (e.g., wages or expenses)\nmay be included in such fee payment; (iv)\nthe fee payment must be related to a\nspecific gas volume and may not be of a general nature, such as an expense for\nperforming a survey or a start-up expense for a broker, agent, individual or\nclearinghouse; (v) lump sum fees\nmust be recovered over the estimated quantities of gas with which such fees are\nassociated; (vi)\nthe utility must\nfully detail and justify all such costs in annual gas cost recovery\nreconciliations and in rate case presentations as part of the review of gas\npurchasing practices; and\n(vii)\nin\nconjunction with the first claim for recovery of each fee through a gas cost\nadjustment, work papers supporting such filings must clearly set forth the new\nfee and include a statement that the gas supply was not available to the public\nutility without said payment. (4)\n\nRisk management costs are costs\nassociated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or\nreduce overall costs to customers. These costs include transaction costs, and\ngains and losses associated with transactions made in commodities exchanges and\nwith other risk management entities. (b) Statements. Where provisions are made in\ngas schedules for automatic adjustment of rates because of changes in the cost\nof gas, gas corporations or municipalities may elect to file statements to\ntheir schedules in lieu of amendments. Such statements shall not be part of the\nschedule and will not bear a leaf designation. Each statement shall be numbered\nconsecutively. A copy of the effective statement shall be kept available with\neach schedule to which it applies and may be attached to or bound with the\nschedule. If bound with the schedule, statements shall follow all leaves and\nsupplements which are part of the schedule. Every such statement shall be filed\nnot less than three days prior to the date on which it is proposed to be\neffective, except that a new statement may be filed on one day's notice to\nbecome effective not more than five days after the effective date of the\ninitial statement if the replacement of cost estimates in the initial statement\nwith actual figures results in a change in the average cost of gas of more than\nfive percent. Each statement shall contain: (1)\nan identification of the schedules and\nservice classifications to which they apply; (2)\nthe date when the increase or decrease in\nrates shall become effective and the period it will remain in effect; (3)\nthe present average cost to the public\nutility of gas purchased to serve customers subject to the gas\nadjustment; (4)\nthe date at which, and the period for which, the average was determined; (5)\n(i) the\nbase cost of gas (stated separately, when more than one base is used in the\nschedule); and\n(ii)\nif the gas\ncosts are unbundled, the base cost of gas need not be shown; (6)\nthe amount per unit of\nconsumption affected; (7)\na summary\nof refunds or surcharges to be applied to the adjustment; (8)\nthe net amount per unit of consumption\naffected; and\n(9)\nthe weather\nnormalization adjustment factor for each billing cycle for the prior\nmonth. (c) Application\nof charge. The gas adjustment charge shall be applied to bills by prorating the\ngas adjustments in effect during the period of service based on the number of\ndays each gas adjustment is in effect during each billing period, and\ncalculating the average cost of gas using transporter, storage provider, and\nsupplier rates estimated to be in effect on the effective date of the gas\nadjustment (pursuant to subparagraph [d][1][ii] of this section). (d) Average cost of gas. The average cost of\ngas shall be computed as follows: (1)\nby\napplying the fixed rates and charges of the transporters, storage providers, and suppliers to the billing determinants associated with pipeline capacity, storage capacity, and supplier reservation charges, and dividing by, either the\nweather normalized quantities of gas taken for delivery to the utility's own\nsales customers during the 12 calendar months immediately preceding the\ncomputation date, or the forecast quantities of gas to be taken for delivery to\nthe utility's own sales customers during the 12 calendar months ending the\nfollowing August 31st. Fixed costs assigned to non-sales customers should be\nexcluded; (2)\nby applying the\nvariable rates and charges of the transporters, storage providers, and\nsuppliers to the billing determinants associated with the transportation, storage, and gas supply, for the forecasted weather normalized quantities of\ngas to be taken for delivery to the utility's own customers during the month in\nwhich the gas adjustment will be in effect; (3)\nby applying the average unit cost of\nliquefied propane in storage at the date of computation to the quantities of\nsaid product used to serve a utility's own customers during the prior\nmonth; (4)\nby applying the average\nunit cost of gas in storage at the date of computation to the quantities of gas\nestimated to be withdrawn from storage for a utility's own customers during the\nmonth in which gas adjustment will be in effect; (5)\nthe total average cost of gas equals the\namount computed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision plus the amounts computed\nin paragraphs (2)-(4) of this subdivision divided by the forecasted weather\nnormalized quantities of gas to be taken for delivery to the utility's own\ncustomers during the month in which the gas adjustment will be in effect. The\ntotal average cost of gas shall be adjusted to reflect credits from the\nreleased capacity, storage services, and sales and transportation of gas\nprovided to interruptible and off-system customers; (6)\nrisk management costs may be included in\nparagraphs (1)-(4) of this subdivision; and\n(7)\nsupporting data and workpapers underlying\ngas cost adjustments and the historical cost of purchased gas, in the format\nset forth in Appendix 7-H of this Title so as to clearly identify sources of\ngas and related costs as delivered to the utility, shall be filed with the\ncommission and accompany the statement. Supporting documents may be computer\ngenerated. (e) Factor of\nadjustment. The factor of adjustment shall be determined in a rate proceeding. At the conclusion of each succeeding rate proceeding, a new factor of\nadjustment will become effective and continue in effect until a new factor is\nestablished in the next rate proceeding. (f) Refunds. Each utility shall file with the\ncommission, and include in its tariff schedule, a plan to flow through to\nconsumers credits received from suppliers due to rate settlements or\nretroactive rate reductions. Refunds shall include interest, calculated at the\nrate prescribed by the commission, on the unrefunded balances. Where\nexceptional circumstances warrant, the utility may petition the commission for\nwaiver of its filed refund plan. (g) Annual reconciliation. Actual gas cost\nrecoveries shall be reconciled with actual gas expenses each year, and a\nsurcharge or refund to recover gas adjustment under-recoveries or refund gas\nadjustment over-collections shall be computed as follows: (1)\n\nTaking the cost of gas, adjusted for\nsupplier refunds, and liquefied propane consumed, as recorded on its books\nduring the determination period, adjusting that cost to reflect a level of\npurchased gas commensurate with actual sales and the fixed factor of adjustment\nas determined in the preceding rate proceeding, and subtracting therefrom an\namount equal to: (i) the base cost of gas, as\ndefined in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, multiplied by the quantities of\ngas purchased; (ii)\ngas adjustment\nrevenues recorded during the determination period, adjusted to eliminate\nassociated revenue tax recoveries; (iii)\ncosts recorded during the determination\nperiod assignable to gas sold to customers not subject to gas cost adjustments; and\n(iv)\n(iv)\n(a) the\nprevious year's over-collection, including interest, to the extent not\nrefunded; or\n(b) adding the\nprevious year's under-collection, including interest, to the extent not\nrecovered. (2)\n\nThe amount derived in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall be divided by the quantities of gas to be sold by the\nutility to its customers during the surcharge/refund period. (3)\n\nAppropriate adjustment shall be made to\neliminate the effect of net credits which have been included in the gas\nadjustment due to interruptible or other flexibly priced sales. (4)\n\nSurcharge or refund amounts shall bear\ninterest, at a rate prescribed by the commission, on unamortized\nbalances. (5)\n\nThe determination\nperiod to be used in the computation of the surcharge or refund shall be the 12\nmonths ended August 31st of each year. The computation shall be filed with the\ncommission on or before October 15th. The resulting surcharge or refund shall\nbe effective with the first January billing cycle date. (6)\n\nInterim refunds or surcharges during the\n12-month period ended August 31st will be permitted for the purpose of\npreventing large over-collection or under-collection balances from accruing at\n\nAugust 31st. The methodology used to determine the amount of over-collection or\nunder-collection and the method of refund or surcharge shall be determined by\nthe utility and filed with the commission. (h) Gas adjustments based on load\ncharacteristics. Utilities are permitted to calculate gas adjustments for\nvarious service classifications, sub-classes, customer groups, or customers\nbased on load characteristics. Implementation of such gas adjustments must be\napproved by the commission. (i) Alternative gas cost pricing. Utilities are permitted to offer customers\nalternative pricing mechanisms other than those specified above. Risk\nmanagement costs and other costs associated with alternative pricing mechanisms\nshall be excluded from the gas adjustment. Implementation of such alternative\npricing mechanisms must be approved by the commission. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
