  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.7 - Closure and post-closure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. Except as section\n373-3.1\nof this Subpart provides\notherwise: (1)\nsubdivision (b) through\nparagraph (f)(1) of this section (which concern closure) apply to the owners\nand operators of all hazardous waste management facilities; (2)\nparagraph (f)(2) through subdivision (j)\nof this section (which concern post-closure care) apply to the owners and\noperators of: (i) all hazardous waste\ndisposal facilities; (ii)\nwaste\npiles and surface impoundments from which the owner or operator intends to\nremove the wastes at closure to the extent that these sections are made\napplicable to such facilities in sections\n373-3.11\n(f) and\n373-3.12\n(g) of\nthis Subpart; (iii)\ntank systems\nthat are required under section\n373-3.10\n(h) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirements for landfills; and\n(iv)\nstart containment buildings that are\nrequired under section\n373-3.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart to meet the requirement for landfills; (3)\nsubdivision (k) of this section applies\nto owners and operators of units that are subject to the requirements of\nsection\n373-1.2\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Part and are regulated under an enforceable document (as defined in\nsection\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part); and\n(4)\nthe department\nmay replace all or part of the requirements of this section (and the\nunit-specific standards in paragraph [b][3] of this section) applying to a\nregulated unit (as defined in section\n373-2.6\n[a]\nof this\n\nPart), with alternative requirements for closure set out in an approved closure\nor post-closure plan, or in an enforceable document (as defined in section\n373-1.2\n[e][3]\nof\nthis Part), where the department determines that: (i) a regulated unit is situated among solid\nwaste management units (or areas of concern), a release has occurred, and both\nthe regulated unit and one or more solid waste management unit(s) (or areas of\nconcern) are likely to have contributed to the release; and\n(ii)\nit is not necessary to apply the closure\nrequirements of this section (and/or those referenced herein) because the\nalternative requirements will protect human health and the environment, and\nwill satisfy the closure performance standard of paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of\nthis section. (b) Closure performance\nstandard. The owner or operator must close the facility in a manner\nthat: (1)\nminimizes the need for\nfurther maintenance; (2)\ncontrols, minimizes or eliminates, to the extent necessary to protect human health and\nthe environment, post-closure escape of hazardous waste, hazardous\nconstituents, leachate, contaminated runoff, or hazardous waste decomposition\nproducts to the ground or surface waters or to the atmosphere; and\n(3)\ncomplies with the closure requirements of\nthis Subpart, including but not limited to the requirements of sections\n373-3.10\n(h), 373-3.11\n(f), 373-3.12\n(g), 373-3.13\n(g), 373-3.14\n(d), 373-3.15\n(e), 373-3.16\n(e), 373-3.17\n(e) and\n373-3.30\n(c). (c) Closure plan; amendment\nof plan. (1)\n\nWritten plan. (i) By May 19, 1981, or by six months after\nthe effective date of the rule that first subjects a facility to provisions of\nthis section, the owner or operator of a hazardous waste management facility\nmust have a written closure plan. Until final closure is completed and\ncertified in accordance with paragraph (f)(1) of this section, a copy of the\nmost current plan must be furnished to the commissioner upon request, including\nrequest by mail. In addition, for facilities without approved plans, it must\nalso be provided during site inspections, on the day of inspection, to any\nofficer, employee or representative of the department who is duly designated by\nthe commissioner. (2)\n\nContent of plan. The plan must identify steps necessary to perform partial\nand/or final closure of the facility at any point during its active life. The\nclosure plan must include, at least: (i) a\ndescription of how each hazardous waste management unit at the facility will be\nclosed in accordance with subdivision (b) of this section; (ii)\na description of how final closure of\nthe facility will be conducted in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection. The description must identify the maximum extent of the operations\nwhich will be unclosed during the active life of the facility; (iii)\nan estimate of the maximum inventory of\nhazardous wastes ever onsite over the active life of the facility and a\ndetailed description of the methods to be used during partial closures and\nfinal closure, including but not limited to methods for removing, transporting, treating, storing or disposing of all hazardous wastes, and identification of\nand the types of the offsite hazardous waste management units to be used, if\napplicable; (iv)\na detailed\ndescription of the steps needed to remove or decontaminate all hazardous waste\nresidues and contaminated containment system components, equipment, structures\nand soils during partial and final closure, including but not limited to\nprocedures for cleaning equipment and removing contaminated soils, methods for\nsampling and testing surrounding soils, and criteria for determining the extent\nof decontamination required to satisfy the closure performance\nstandard; (v) a detailed\ndescription of other activities necessary during the partial and final closure\nperiods to ensure that all partial closures and final closure satisfy the\nclosure performance standards, including but not limited to groundwater\nmonitoring, leachate collection, and run- on and runoff control; (vi)\na schedule for closure of each hazardous\nwaste management unit and for final closure of the facility. The schedule must\ninclude, at a minimum, the total time required to close each hazardous waste\nmanagement unit and the time required for intervening closure activities which\nwill allow tracking of the progress of partial and final closure (for example, in the case of a landfill unit, estimates of the time required to treat or\ndispose of all hazardous waste inventory and of the time required to place a\nfinal cover must be included); (vii)\nan estimate of the expected year of\nfinal closure for facilities that use trust funds to demonstrate financial\nassurance under section\n373-3.8\n(d) or (f)\nof this Subpart and whose remaining operating life is less than 20 years, and\nfor facilities without approved closure plans; and\n(viii)\nfor facilities where the department\nhas applied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under sections\n373-3.6\n(a)(6), and/or 373-3.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(4) of this section, either the alternative requirements applying to the regulated unit, or a\nreference to the enforceable document containing those alternative\nrequirements. (3)\n\nAmendment of plan. The owner or operator may amend the closure plan at any time\nprior to the notification of partial or final closure of the facility. An owner\nor operator with an approved closure plan must submit a written request to the\ncommissioner to authorize a change to the approved closure plan. The written\nrequest must include a copy of the amended closure plan for approval by the\ncommissioner. (i) The owner or operator must\namend the closure plan whenever: (a) changes\nin operating plans or facility design affect the closure plan; (b) there is a change in the expected year of\nclosure, if applicable; (c) in\nconducting partial or final closure activities, unexpected events require a\nmodification of the closure plan; or\n(d) the owner or operator request the\ndepartment to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit under sections\n373-3.6\n(a)(6), and/or 373-3.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(4) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe owner\nor operator must amend the closure plan at least 60 days prior to the proposed\nchange in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after an\nunexpected event has occurred which has affected the closure plan. If an\nunexpected event occurs during the partial or final closure period, the owner\nor operator must amend the closure plan no later than 30 days after the\nunexpected event. These provisions also apply to owners or operators of surface\nimpoundments or waste piles who intend to remove all hazardous waste at closure\nbut are required to close as landfills in accordance with section\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. (iii)\n\nAn owner or\noperator with an approved closure plan must submit the modified plan to the\ncommissioner at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design\nor operation, or no more than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred\nwhich has affected the closure plan. If an unexpected event has occurred during\nthe partial or final closure period, the owner or operator must submit the\nmodified plan no more than 30 days after the unexpected event. These provisions\nalso apply to owners or operators of surface impoundments and waste piles who\nintended to remove all hazardous waste at closure but are required to close as\nlandfills in accordance with section\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. If the amendment to the plan is a major modification according to\nthe criteria in Subpart 373-1 of this Part, the modification to the plan will\nbe approved according to the procedures in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner\nmay request modifications to the plan under the conditions described in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. An owner or operator with an approved\nclosure plan must submit the modified plan within 60 days of the commissioner's\nrequest, or within 30 days if the unexpected event occurs during partial or\nfinal closure. If the amendment is considered a major modification according to\nthe criteria in Subpart 373-1 of this part, the modification to the plan will\nbe approved in accordance with the procedures in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision. (4)\n\nNotification of partial closure and final closure. (i) The owner or operator must submit the\nclosure plan to the commissioner at least 180 days prior to the date on which\nthe owner or operator expects to begin closure of the first surface\nimpoundment, waste pile, land treatment or landfill unit, or final closure if\nit involves such a unit, whichever is earlier. The owner or operator must\nsubmit the closure plan to the commissioner at least 45 days prior to the date\non which the owner or operator expects to begin partial or final closure of a\nboiler or industrial furnace. The owner or operator must submit the closure\nplan to the commissioner at least 45 days prior to the date on which the owner\nor operator expects to begin final closure of a facility with only tanks, container storage, or incinerator units. Owners or operators with approved\nclosure plans must notify the commissioner in writing at least 60 days prior to\nthe date on which the owner or operator expects to begin closure of a surface\nimpoundment, waste pile, landfill, or land treatment unit, or final closure of\na facility involving such a unit. Owners and operators with approved closure\nplans must notify the commissioner in writing at least 45 days prior to the\ndate on which the owner or operator expects to begin partial or final closure\nof a boiler or industrial furnace. Owners or operators with approved closure\nplans must notify the commissioner in writing at least 45 days prior to the\ndate on which the owner or operator expects to begin final closure of a\nfacility with only tanks, container storage, or incinerator units. (ii)\n\nThe date when the owner or operator\n\"expects to begin closure\" must be either: (a) within 30 days after the date on which\nany hazardous waste management unit receives the known final volume of\nhazardous wastes, or, if there is a reasonable possibility that the hazardous\nwaste management unit will receive additional hazardous wastes, no later than\none year after the date on which the unit received the most recent volume of\nhazardous waste. If the owner or operator of a hazardous waste management unit\ncan demonstrate to the commissioner that the hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes and the owner\nor operator has taken, and will continue to take, all steps to prevent threats\nto human health and the environment, including compliance with all interim\nstatus requirements, the commissioner may approve an extension to this one-year\nlimit; or\n(b) for units meeting the\nrequirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this section, no later than 30 days after\nthe date on which the hazardous waste management unit receives the known final\nvolume of nonhazardous wastes, or if there is a reasonable possibility that the\nhazardous waste management unit will receive additional nonhazardous wastes, no\nlater than one year after the date on which the unit received the most recent\nvolume of nonhazardous wastes. If the owner or operator can demonstrate to the\ncommissioner that the hazardous waste management unit has the capacity to\nreceive additional nonhazardous wastes and the owner or operator has taken, and\nwill continue to take, all steps to prevent threats to human health and the\nenvironment, including compliance with all interim status requirements, the\ncommissioner may approve an extension to this one-year limit. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator must\nsubmit the closure plan to the commissioner no later than 15 days after: (a) issuance of a judicial decree or final\norder, under article 71 of ECL, to cease receiving hazardous wastes or to\nclose; or\n(b) termination of\ninterim status except when a permit is issued simultaneously with termination\nof interim status. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner will provide the owner or operator and the public, through a\nnewspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the plan and\nrequest modifications of the plan within 30 days of the date of the notice. The\ncommissioner will also, in response to a request or at his or her own\ndiscretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a hearing might clarify one or\nmore issues concerning a closure plan. The commissioner will give public notice\nof the hearing at least 30 days before it occurs. (Public notice of the hearing\nmay be given at the same time as notice of the opportunity for the public to\nsubmit written comments, and the two notices may be combined.) The commissioner\nwill approve, modify or disapprove the plan within 90 days of its receipt. If\nthe commissioner does not approve the plan, the owner or operator shall be\nprovided with a detailed written statement of the reasons for refusal, and the\nowner or operator must modify the plan or submit a new plan for approval within\n30 days after receiving such written statement. The commissioner will approve\nor modify this plan in writing within 60 days. If the commissioner modifies the\nplan, this modified plan becomes the approved closure plan. The commissioner\nmust assure that the approved closure plan is consistent with subdivisions\n(b)-(f) of this section and the applicable requirements of sections\n373-3.6, 373-3.10\n(h), 373-3.11\n(f), 373-3.12\n(g), 373-3.13\n(g), 373-3.14\n(d), 373-3.15\n(e), 373-3.16\n(e), 373-3.17\n(e) and\n373-3.30\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. A copy of this modified plan with a detailed statement of reasons\nfor the modifications must be mailed to the owner or operator. (5)\n\nRemoval of wastes and\ndecontamination or dismantling of equipment. Nothing in this subdivision shall\npreclude the owner or operator from removing hazardous wastes and\ndecontaminating or dismantling equipment in accordance with the approved\npartial or final closure plan at any time before or after notification of\npartial or final closure. (d) Closure; time allowed for\nclosure. (1)\n\nWithin 90 days after\nreceiving the final volume of hazardous wastes, or the final volume of\nnonhazardous wastes if the owner or operator complies with all applicable\nrequirements in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, at a hazardous\nwaste management unit or facility, or within 90 days after approval of the\nclosure plan, whichever is later, the owner or operator must treat, remove from\nthe unit or facility, or dispose of onsite, all hazardous wastes in accordance\nwith the approved closure plan. The commissioner may approve a longer period if\nthe owner or operator demonstrates that: (i) (a) the activities required to comply with\nthis paragraph will, of necessity, take longer than 90 days to complete; or\n(b) (1)\nthe hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes, or has the\ncapacity to receive nonhazardous wastes if the facility owner or operator\ncomplies with paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nthere is a reasonable likelihood that the\nowner or operator or another person will recommence operation of the hazardous\nwaste management unit or the facility within one year; and\n(3)\nclosure of the hazardous waste management\nunit or facility would be incompatible with continued operation of the site; and\n(ii)\nthe\nowner or operator has taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent\nthreats to human health and the environment, including compliance with all\napplicable interim status requirements. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator must complete\npartial and final closure activities in accordance with the approved closure\nplan and within 180 days after receiving the final volume of hazardous wastes, or the final volume of nonhazardous wastes if the owner or operator complies\nwith all applicable requirements in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, at the hazardous waste management unit or facility, or 180 days after approval\nof the closure plan, if that is later. The commissioner may approve an\nextension to the closure period if the owner or operator demonstrates that: (i) (a) the\npartial or final closure activities will, of necessity, take longer than 180\ndays to complete; or\n(b) (1)\nthe hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility has the capacity to receive additional hazardous wastes, or\nnonhazardous wastes if the facility owner or operator complies with paragraphs\n(4) and (5) of this subdivision; and\n(2)\nthere is reasonable likelihood that the\nowner or operator or another person will recommence operation of the hazardous\nwaste management unit or the facility within one year; and\n(3)\nclosure of the hazardous waste management\nunit or facility would be incompatible with continued operation of the site; and\n(ii)\nthe\nowner or operator has taken and will continue to take all steps to prevent\nthreats to human health and the environment from the unclosed but not operating\nhazardous waste management unit or facility, including compliance with all\napplicable interim status requirements. (3)\n\nThe demonstrations referred to in\nsubparagraphs (1)(i) and (2)(i) of this subdivision must be made as follows: (i) the demonstrations in subparagraph (1)(i)\nmust be made at least 30 days prior to the expiration of the 90-day period in\nparagraph (1); and\n(ii)\nthe\ndemonstration in subparagraph (2)(i) must be made at least 30 days prior to the\nexpiration of the 180-day period in paragraph (2), unless the owner or operator\nis otherwise subject to the deadlines in paragraph (4). (4)\n\nThe commissioner may allow an owner or\noperator to receive nonhazardous wastes in a landfill, land treatment, or\nsurface impoundment unit after the final receipt of hazardous wastes at that\nunit if: (i) the owner or operator submits an\namended Part 373 application, or a Part 373 application, if not previously\nrequired, and demonstrates that: (a) the unit\nhas the existing design capacity as indicated on the Part A application to\nreceive nonhazardous wastes; and\n(b) there is a reasonable likelihood that the\nowner or operator or another person will receive nonhazardous wastes in the\nunit within one year after the final receipt of hazardous wastes; and\n(c) the nonhazardous wastes will not be\nincompatible with any remaining wastes in the unit or with the facility design\nand operating requirements of the unit or facility under this Part; and\n(d) closure of the hazardous\nwaste management unit would be incompatible with continued operation of the\nunit or facility; and\n(e) the owner\nor operator is operating and will continue to operate in compliance with all\ninterim status requirements; and\n(ii)\nthe Part 373 application includes an\namended waste analysis plan, groundwater monitoring and response program, human\nexposure assessment required under section\n373-1.5\n(d) and (h)\nof this Part, and closure and post-closure plans, and updated cost estimates\nand demonstrations of financial assurance for closure and post-closure care as\nnecessary and appropriate to reflect any changes due to the presence of\nhazardous constituents in the nonhazardous wastes, and changes in closure\nactivities, including the expected year of closure if applicable under\nsubparagraph (c)(2)(vii) of this section, as a result of the receipt of\nnonhazardous wastes following the final receipt of hazardous wastes; and\n(iii)\nthe Part 373 application\nis amended, as necessary and appropriate, to account for the receipt of\nnonhazardous wastes following receipt of the final volume of hazardous wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe Part 373 application\nand the demonstrations referred to in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph are submitted to the commissioner no later than 180 days prior to the\ndate on which the owner or operator of the facility receives the known final\nvolume of hazardous wastes, or no later than 90 days after the effective date\nof this rule in New York State, whichever is later. (5)\n\nIn addition to the requirements in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, an owner or operator of a hazardous waste\nsurface impoundment that is not in compliance with the liner and leachate\ncollection system requirements in sections\n373-2.11\nand\n373-2.14\nof this Part, or section\n373-3.11\nor\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart must: (i) submit with the Part 373 application: (a) a contingent corrective measures plan; and\n(b) a plan for removing\nhazardous wastes in compliance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph; and\n(ii)\nremove all\nhazardous wastes from the unit by removing all hazardous liquids and removing\nall hazardous sludges to the extent practicable without impairing the integrity\nof the liner(s), if any; (iii)\nremoval of hazardous wastes must be completed no later than 90 days after the\nfinal receipt of hazardous wastes. The commissioner may approve an extension to\nthis deadline if the owner or operator demonstrates that the removal of\nhazardous wastes will, of necessity, take longer than the allotted period to\ncomplete and that an extension will not pose a threat to human health and the\nenvironment; (iv)\nif a release that\nis a statistically significant increase (or decrease in the case of pH) in\nhazardous constituents over background levels is detected in accordance with\nthe requirements in section\n373-3.6\nof this Subpart, the owner\nor operator of the unit: (a) must implement\ncorrective measures in accordance with the approved contingent corrective\nmeasures plan required by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph no later than one\nyear after detection of the release, or approval of the contingent corrective\nmeasures plan, whichever is later; (b) may receive wastes at the unit following\ndetection of the release only if the approved corrective measures plan includes\na demonstration that continued receipt of wastes will not impede corrective\naction; and\n(c) may be required by\nthe commissioner to implement corrective measures in less than one year or to\ncease receipt of wastes until corrective measures have been implemented if\nnecessary to protect human health and the environment. (v) during the period of corrective action, the owner or operator shall provide annual reports to the commissioner\ndescribing the progress of the corrective action program, compile all\ngroundwater monitoring data, and evaluate the effect of the continued receipt\nof nonhazardous wastes on the effectiveness of the corrective action. The\ndepartment may require the owner or operator to report semi-annually as needed\nto evaluate the progress of the corrective action program; (vi)\nthe commissioner may require the owner\nor operator to commence closure of the unit if the owner or operator fails to\nimplement corrective action measures in accordance with the approved contingent\ncorrective measures plan within one year as required in subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph, or fails to make substantial progress in implementing\ncorrective action and achieving the facility's background levels; and\n(vii)\nif the owner or operator fails to\nimplement corrective measures as required in subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph, or if the commissioner determines that substantial progress has not\nbeen made pursuant to subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph the comissioner\nshall: (a) notify the owner or operator in\nwriting that the department is terminating interim status, pursuant to Part 621\nof this Title, to require the initiation of closure in accordance with the\ndeadline in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision and provide a detailed\nstatement of reasons for this determination. (e) Disposal or\ndecontamination of equipment, structures and soils. During the partial and final closure periods, all\ncontaminated equipment, structures and soils must be properly disposed of or\ndecontaminated unless otherwise specified in sections\n373-3.10\n(h), 373-3.11\n(f), 373-3.12\n(g), 373-3.13\n(g) and\n373-3.14\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. By removing any hazardous wastes or hazardous constituents during\npartial and final closure, the owner or operator may become a generator of\nhazardous waste and must handle that waste in accordance with all applicable\nrequirements of Part 372 of this Title. (f) Certification of closure and survey\nplat. (1)\n\nCertification of closure. Within 60 days of completion of final closure of a facility, or within 60 days\nof partial closure of any hazardous waste management unit, the owner or\noperator must submit to the commissioner, by registered mail, a certification\nthat the hazardous waste management unit or facility, as applicable, has been\nclosed in accordance with the specifications in the approved closure plan. The\ncertification must be signed by the owner or operator and by an independent\nprofessional engineer registered in New York. Documentation supporting the\nindependent registered professional engineer's certification must be furnished\nto the commissioner upon request until the commissioner releases the owner or\noperator from the financial assurance requirements for closure under section\n373-3.8\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. (2)\n\nSurvey plat. No later\nthan the submission of the certification of closure of each hazardous waste\ndisposal unit, the owner or operator must submit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and to the county clerk\nin the county in which the facility is located, and to the commissioner, a\nsurvey plat indicating the location and dimensions of landfill cells or other\nhazardous waste disposal units with respect to permanently surveyed benchmarks. This plat must be prepared and certified by a professional land surveyor\nregistered in New York. The plat filed with the local zoning authority, or the\nauthority with jurisdiction over local land use, and with the county clerk in\nthe county in which the facility is located, must contain a note, prominently\ndisplayed, which states the owner's or operator's obligation to restrict\ndisturbance of the hazardous waste disposal unit in accordance with the\napplicable regulations of this section. (g) Post-closure care and use of\nproperty. (1)\n(i) Post-closure care for each hazardous\nwaste management unit subject to the requirements of subdivisions (g) through\n(j) of this section must begin after completion of closure of the unit and\ncontinue for 30 years after that date, and must consist of at least the\nfollowing: (a) monitoring and reporting in\naccordance with the requirements of sections\n373-3.6, 373-3.11, 373-3.12, 373-3.13\nand\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart; and\n(b) maintenance and monitoring\nof waste containment systems in accordance with the requirements of sections\n373-3.6, 373-3.11, 373-3.12, 373-3.13\nand\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nAny time preceding closure of\na hazardous waste management unit subject to post-closure care requirements or\nfinal closure, or any time during the post-closure period for a particular\nhazardous waste disposal unit, the commissioner may: (a) shorten the post-closure care period\napplicable to the hazardous waste management unit, or facility (if all disposal\nunits have been closed), if the commissioner finds that the reduced period is\nsufficient to protect human health and the environment (\ne.g., leachate or groundwater monitoring results, characteristics of the hazardous\nwastes, application of advanced technology, or alternative disposal, treatment\nor reuse techniques indicate that the hazardous waste management unit or\nfacility is secure); or\n(b) extend\nthe post-closure care period applicable to the hazardous waste management unit\nor facility if the commissioner finds that the extended period is necessary to\nprotect human health and the environment (\ne.g., leachate or\ngroundwater monitoring results indicate a potential for migration of hazardous\nwastes at levels which may be harmful to human health and the\nenvironment). (2)\n\nThe commissioner may require, at partial\nand final closure, continuation of any of the security requirements of section\n373-3.2\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart during part or all of the post-closure period when: (i) hazardous wastes may remain exposed after\ncompletion of partial or final closure; or\n(ii)\naccess by the public or domestic\nlivestock may pose a hazard to human health. (3)\n\nPost-closure use of property on or in\nwhich hazardous wastes remain after partial or final closure must never be\nallowed to disturb the integrity of the final cover, liners, or any other\ncomponents of the containment system, or the function of the facility's\nmonitoring system, unless the commissioner finds that the disturbance: (i) is necessary to the proposed use of the\nproperty, and will not increase the potential hazard to human health or the\nenvironment; or\n(ii)\nis necessary\nto reduce a threat to human health or the environment. (4)\n\nAll post-closure care activities must be\nin accordance with the provisions of the approved post-closure plan as\nspecified in subdivision (h) of this section. (h) Post-closure plan; amendment of\nplan. (1)\n\nWritten plan. By May 19, 1981, the owner or operator of a hazardous waste disposal unit must have a\nwritten post-closure plan. An owner or operator of a surface impoundment or\nwaste pile from which the owner or operator intends to remove all hazardous\nwastes at closure must prepare a post-closure plan and submit it to the\ncommissioner within 90 days of the date that the owner or operator or\ncommissioner determines that the hazardous waste management unit or facility\nmust be closed as a landfill, subject to the requirements of subdivisions (g)\nthrough (j) of this section. (2)\n\nUntil final closure of the facility, a copy of the most current post-closure\nplan must be furnished to the commissioner upon request, including request by\nmail. In addition, for facilities without approved post-closure plans, it must\nalso be provided during site inspections, on the day of inspection, to any\nofficer, employee or representative of the department who is duly designated by\nthe commissioner. After final closure has been certified, the person or office\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision must keep the approved\npost-closure plan during the post-closure period. (3)\n\nFor each hazardous waste management unit\nsubject to the requirements of this subdivision, the post-closure plan must\nidentify the activities that will be carried on after closure of each disposal\nunit and the frequency of these activities, and include at least: (i) a description of the planned monitoring\nactivities and frequencies at which they will be performed to comply with\nsections\n373-3.6, 373-3.11, 373-3.12, 373-3.13\nand\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart during the\npost-closure care period; (ii)\na\ndescription of the planned maintenance activities, and frequencies at which\nthey will be performed, to ensure: (a) the\nintegrity of the cap and final cover or other containment systems in accordance\nwith the requirements of sections\n373-3.11, 373-3.12, 373-3.13\nand\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart; and\n(b) the function of the\nmonitoring equipment in accordance with the requirements of sections\n373-3.6, 373-3.11, 373-3.12, 373-3.13\nand\n373-3.14\nof this Subpart; (iii)\nthe name, address and phone\nnumber of the person or office to contact about the hazardous waste disposal\nunit or facility during the post-closure care period; (iv)\nfor facilities subject to subdivision\n(k) of this section, provisions that satisfy the requirements of subparagraphs\n(k)(1)(i) and (iii) of this section; and\n(v) for facilities where the department has\napplied alternative requirements at a regulated unit under sections\n373-3.6\n(a)(6), and/or 373-3.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(4) of this section, either the alternative requirements that apply to the regulated unit, or a\nreference to the enforceable document containing those requirements. (4)\n\nAmendment of plan. The owner\nor operator may amend the post-closure plan at any time during the active life\nof the facility or during the post-closure care period. An owner or operator\nwith an approved post-closure plan must submit a written request to the\ncommissioner to authorize a change in the approved post-closure plan. The\nwritten request must include a copy of the amended post-closure plan for\napproval by the commissioner. (i) The owner\nor operator must amend the post-closure plan whenever: (a) changes in operating plans or facility\ndesign affect the post-closure plan; (b) events which occur during the active life\nof the facility, including partial and final closures, affect the post-closure\nplan; or\n(c) the owner or operator\nrequests the department to apply alternative requirements to a regulated unit\nunder sections\n373-3.6\n(a)(6), and/or 373-3.8(a)(4) of this Subpart and/or paragraph (a)(4) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe owner\nor operator must amend the post-closure plan at least 60 days prior to the\nproposed change in facility design or operation, or no later than 60 days after\nan unexpected event has occurred which has affected the post-closure\nplan. (iii)\n\nAn owner or operator\nwith an approved post-closure plan must submit the modified plan to the\ncommissioner at least 60 days prior to the proposed change in facility design\nor operation, or no later than 60 days after an unexpected event has occurred\nwhich has affected the post-closure plan. If an owner or operator of a surface\nimpoundment or waste pile who intended to remove all hazardous waste at closure\nin accordance with sections\n373-3.11\n(f) and\n373-3.12\n(g) of\nthis Subpart is required to close as a landfill in accordance with section\n373-3.14\n(d), the\nowner or operator must submit a post-closure plan to the commissioner within 90\ndays of the determination by the owner or operator or commissioner that the\nunit must be closed as a landfill. If the amendment to the post-closure plan is\na major modification according to the criteria in Subpart 373-1 of this Part, the modification to the plan will be approved according to the procedures in\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision and Part 621 of this Title. (iv)\n\nThe commissioner may request\nmodifications to the plan under the conditions described in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph. An owner or operator with an approved post- closure plan must\nsubmit the modified plan no later than 60 days after the commissioner's\nrequest. If the amendment to the plan is considered a major modification\naccording to the criteria in Subpart 373-1 of this Part, the modifications to\nthe post-closure plan will be approved in accordance with the procedures in\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision. If the commissioner determines that an owner\nor operator of a surface impoundment or waste pile who intended to remove all\nhazardous wastes at closure must close the facility as a landfill, the owner or\noperator must submit a post-closure plan for approval to the commissioner\nwithin 90 days of the determination. (5)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility with\nhazardous waste management units subject to these requirements must submit the\npost-closure plan to the commissioner at least 180 days before the date the\nowner or operator expects to begin partial or final closure of the first\nhazardous waste disposal unit. The date the owner or operator \"expects to begin\nclosure\" of the first hazardous waste disposal unit must be either within 30\ndays after the date on which the hazardous waste management unit receives the\nknown final volume of hazardous waste or, if there is a reasonable possibility\nthat the hazardous waste management unit will receive additional hazardous\nwastes, no later than one year after the date on which the unit received the\nmost recent volume of hazardous wastes. The owner or operator must submit the\npost-closure plan to the commissioner no later than 15 days after: (i) termination of interim status (except\nwhen a permit is issued to the facility simultaneously with termination of\ninterim status); or\n(ii)\nissuance\nof a judicial decree or final orders under article 71 of ECL to cease receiving\nwastes or close. (6)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will provide the owner or operator and the public, through a\nnewspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments on the\npost-closure plan and request modifications to the plan no later than 30 days\nfrom the date of the notice. The commissioner will also, in response to a\nrequest or at his or her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever such a\nhearing might clarify one or more issues concerning a post-closure plan. The\ncommissioner will give public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before it\noccurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as notice\nof the opportunity for the public to submit written comments, and the two\nnotices may be combined.) The commissioner will approve, modify or disapprove\nthe plan within 90 days of its receipt. If the commissioner does not approve\nthe plan, the owner or operator shall be provided with a detailed written\nstatement of reasons for the refusal, and the owner or operator must modify the\nplan or submit a new plan for approval within 30 days after receiving such\nwritten statement. The commissioner will approve or modify this plan in writing\nwithin 60 days. If the commissioner modifies the plan, this modified plan\nbecomes the approved post-closure plan. The commissioner must ensure that the\napproved post-closure plan is consistent with subdivisions (g)-(j) of this\nsection. A copy of the modified plan with a detailed statement of reasons for\nthe modifications must be mailed to the owner or operator. (7)\n\nThe post-closure plan and length of the\npost-closure care period may be modified any time prior to the end of the\npost-closure care period in either of the following two ways: (i) The owner or operator or any member of\nthe public may petition the commissioner to extend or reduce the post-closure\ncare period applicable to a hazardous waste management unit or facility based\non cause, or alter the requirements of the post-closure care period based on\ncause. (a) The petition must include evidence\ndemonstrating that: (1)\nthe secure nature of\nthe hazardous waste management unit or facility makes the post-closure care\nrequirements unnecessary or supports reduction of the post-closure care period\nspecified in the current post-closure plan (\ne.g., leachate or\ngroundwater monitoring results, characteristics of the wastes, application of\nadvanced technology, or alternative disposal, treatment or reuse techniques\nindicating that the facility is secure); or\n(2)\nthe requested extension in the\npost-closure care period or alteration of post- closure care requirements is\nnecessary to prevent threats to human health and the environment\n(\ne.g., leachate or groundwater monitoring results indicate a\npotential for migration of hazardous wastes at levels which may be harmful to\nhuman health and the environment). (b) These petitions will be considered by the\ncommissioner only when they present new and relevant information not previously\nconsidered by the commissioner. Whenever the commissioner is considering a\npetition, the commissioner will provide the owner or operator and the public, through a newspaper notice, the opportunity to submit written comments within\n30 days of the date of the notice. The commissioner will also, in response to a\nrequest or at his or her own discretion, hold a public hearing whenever a\nhearing might clarify one or more issues concerning the post-closure plan. The\ncommissioner will give the public notice of the hearing at least 30 days before\nit occurs. (Public notice of the hearing may be given at the same time as\nnotice of the opportunity for written public comments, and the two notices may\nbe combined.) After considering the comments, the commissioner will issue a\nfinal determination, based upon the criteria set forth in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph. (c) If the\ncommissioner denies the petition, the commissioner will send the petitioner a\nbrief written response giving a reason for the denial. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner may tentatively decide\nto modify the post-closure plan if the commissioner deems it necessary to\nprevent threats to human health and the environment. The commissioner may\npropose to extend or reduce the post-closure care period applicable to a\nhazardous waste management unit or facility based on cause, or alter the\nrequirements of the post-closure care period based on cause. (a) The commissioner will provide the owner\nor operator and the affected public, through a newspaper notice, the\nopportunity to submit written comments within 30 days of the date of the notice\nand the opportunity for a public hearing as in clause (i)(\nb\n)\nof this paragraph. After considering the comments, the commissioner will issue\na final determination. (b) The\ncommissioner will base the final determination upon the same criteria as\nrequired for petitions under clause (i)(\na\n) of this paragraph. A modification of the post- closure plan may include, where appropriate, the\ntemporary suspension rather than permanent deletion of one or more post-closure\ncare requirements. At the end of the specified period of suspension, the\ncommissioner would then determine whether the requirements should be\npermanently discontinued or reinstated to prevent threats to human health and\nthe environment. (i) Post-closure notices. (1)\n\nNo later than 60 days after certification\nof closure of each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must\nsubmit to the local zoning authority, or the authority with jurisdiction over\nlocal land use, and to the county clerk in the county in which the facility is\nlocated, and to the commissioner, a record of the type, location and quantity\nof hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other disposal unit of the\nfacility. For hazardous wastes disposed of before January 12, 1981, the owner\nor operator must identify the type, location and quantity of the hazardous\nwastes to the best of his or her knowledge and in accordance with any records\nthe owner or operator has kept. (2)\n\nWithin 60 days of certification of closure of the first hazardous waste\ndisposal unit, and within 60 days of certification of closure of the last\nhazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or operator must: (i) record with the county clerk, in the\ncounty in which the facility is located, a notation on the deed to the facility\nproperty-or on some other instrument which is normally examined during title\nsearch-that will in perpetuity notify any potential purchaser of the property\nthat: (a) the land has been used to manage\nhazardous wastes; (b) its use is\nrestricted under 6 NYCRR\n373-3.7; and\n(c) the survey plat and record of the type, location and quantity of hazardous wastes disposed of within each cell or other\nhazardous waste disposal unit of the facility required by this subdivision and\nsubdivision (f) of this section have been filed with the local zoning\nauthority, or the authority with jurisdiction over local land use, and with the\ncounty clerk in the county in which the facility is located, and with the\ncommissioner; and\n(ii)\nsubmit a certification, signed by the owner or operator, that the notation\nspecified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph has been made, including a copy\nof the document in which the notation has been placed, to the\ncommissioner. (3)\n\nIf the\nowner or operator, or any subsequent owner or operator, of the land upon which\na hazardous waste disposal unit is located wishes to remove hazardous wastes\nand hazardous waste residues, the liner, if any, and all contaminated\nstructures, equipment and soils, the owner or operator must request a\nmodification to the approved post-closure plan in accordance with the\nrequirements of paragraph (h)(7) of this section. The owner or operator must\ndemonstrate that the removal of hazardous wastes will satisfy the criteria of\nparagraph (g)(3) of this section. By removing hazardous waste, the owner or\noperator may become a generator of hazardous waste and must manage it in\naccordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 372 and 373 of this Title. If the owner or operator is granted a permit modification or otherwise granted\napproval to conduct such removal activities, the owner or operator may request\nthat the commissioner approve either: (i) the\nremoval of the notation on the deed to the facility property or other\ninstrument normally examined during title search; or\n(ii)\nthe addition of a notation to the deed\nor instrument, indicating the removal of the hazardous waste. (j) Certification\nof completion of post-closure care. No later than 60 days after completion of the established\npost-closure care period for each hazardous waste disposal unit, the owner or\noperator must submit to the commissioner, by registered mail, a certification\nthat the post-closure care period for the hazardous waste disposal unit was\nperformed in accordance with the specifications in the approved post-closure\nplan. The certification must be signed by the owner or operator and an\nindependent professional engineer registered in New York. Documentation\nsupporting the professional engineer's certification must be furnished to the\ncommissioner upon request until the commissioner releases the owner or operator\nfrom the financial assurance requirements for post- closure care under section\n373-3.8\n(f)(8)\nof\nthis Subpart. (k) Post-closure requirements for facilities that obtain enforceable\ndocuments in lieu of post-closure permits. (1)\n\nOwners and operators who are subject to\nthe requirement to obtain a post-closure permit under section\n373-1.2\n(e) of this\n\nPart, but who obtain enforceable documents in lieu of post-closure permits, as\nprovided under section\n373-1.2\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Part, must comply with the following requirements: (i) the requirements to submit information\nabout the facility in section\n373-1.5\n(o) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nthe requirements for\nfacility-wide corrective action in section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nPart; (iii)\nthe requirements of\nsection\n373-2.6\n(b) through\n(k) of this Part. (2)\n(i) The\ndepartment, in issuing enforceable documents under this subdivision in lieu of\npermits, will assure a meaningful opportunity for public involvement which, at\na minimum, includes public notice and opportunity for public comment: (a) when the department becomes involved in a\nremediation at the facility as a regulatory or enforcement matter; (b) on the proposed preferred remedy and the\nassumptions upon which the remedy is based, in particular those related to land\nuse and site characterization; and\n(c) at the time of a proposed decision that\nremedial action is complete at the facility. These requirements must be met\nbefore the department may consider that the facility has met the requirements\nof section\n373-1.2\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Part, unless the facility qualifies for a modification to these public\ninvolvement procedures under subparagraph (ii) or (iii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nIf the\ndepartment determines that even a short delay in the implementation of a remedy\nwould adversely affect human health or the environment, the department may\ndelay compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph\nand implement the remedy immediately. However, the department must assure\ninvolvement of the public at the earliest opportunity, and, in all cases, upon\nmaking the decision that additional remedial action is not needed at the\nfacility. (iii)\n\nThe department may\nallow a remediation initiated prior to October 22, 1998 to substitute for\ncorrective action required under a post-closure permit even if the public\ninvolvement requirements of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph have not been\nmet so long as the department assures that notice and comment on the decision\nthat no further remediation is necesssary to protect human health and the\nenvironment takes place at the earliest reasonable opportunity after October\n22, 1998.
