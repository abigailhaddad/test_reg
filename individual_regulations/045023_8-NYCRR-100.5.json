(k) The learning standards for parenting may be met either through a separate course in parenting or through integration in a course in health or family and consumer sciences. (v) Earning a\n\nRegents\ndiploma with advanced designation. To earn a\n\nRegents\ndiploma with an advanced designation a student must complete, in addition to the requirements for a\n\nRegents\ndiploma: (a) additional\n\nRegents examinations\nin mathematics as determined by the commissioner or\napproved\nalternatives pursuant to section\n100.2\n(f) of this Part.
