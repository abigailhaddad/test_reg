In the event of any\nsuch deletion, the records access officer shall provide written notice of that\nfact to the person given access to the record. If the record is such that the\npersonal matters cannot be fully deleted without substantively affecting the\nrecord or the identifying details cannot be effectively deleted, the records\naccess officer shall deny access to such record as provided in section\n1.8\nof this Part. (b) Information that is submitted to the\ndepartment in the course of rendering its economic development services, or is\nderived from such information, may be excepted from disclosure pursuant to\nsection\n87\n(2)(d)\nof the Public Officers Law on the\ngrounds that the information contains trade secrets, proprietary information, or that the information if disclosed would cause substantial injury to the\ncompetitive position of the enterprise submitting such information. A\ncommercial enterprise may submit a request to the records access officer\nseeking an exception as provided for herein. Such exception may extend to\ninformation contained in the request itself, if disclosure would defeat the\npurpose for which the exception is sought. (c) The request for such an exception shall\nbe in writing and state the reasons for the requested exception. It shall also\nspecify the information or portions of the information for which the exception\nis requested. (d) Information\nsubmitted as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section shall be\nreviewed by the records access officer and it shall be his duty to make\ndeterminations concerning the designation of individuals within the department\nwho shall maintain custody of such records or who may inspect such records. Any\nsuch designation shall be in writing and shall be available for\ninspection. (e) Information\nsubmitted as provided in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section shall be\nexcepted from disclosure and shall be maintained apart from other records in a\nlocked file cabinet or other secure facility, until 15 days after the\nentitlement to such exception has been finally determined or such further time\nas may be ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction. (f) On the initiative of the department at\nany time, or upon the request of any person for a record excepted from\ndisclosure pursuant to subdivision (b) and following of this section, the\ndepartment shall: (1)\ngive notice to the\nperson who requested the exception of any request for disclosure and/or of the\ndepartment's intention to determine whether such exception should be granted or\ncontinued; (2)\npermit the person\nwho asked for the exception within 10 business days of receipt of such notice\nfrom the department, to submit a written statement of the necessity for the\ngranting or continuation of the exception from disclosure; (3)\nwithin seven business days of receipt of\nsuch written statement, or within seven business days of the expiration of the\nperiod prescribed for submission of such statement, issue a written\ndetermination granting, continuing or terminating the exception from disclosure\nand stating the reasons therefor; copies of such determination shall be served\nupon the person, if any, requesting the record, the person who asked for the\nexception and the Committee on Open Government. (g) A denial of an exception from disclosure\nunder subdivision (f) of this section may be appealed by the persons submitting\nthe information and a denial of access to the record may be appealed by the\nperson requesting the record as follows: (1)\n\nWithin seven business days of receipt of written notice denying the request for\nan exception or for disclosure, the person asking for the exception or the\nperson requesting disclosure may appeal to the Deputy Commissioner and Counsel, Department of Economic Development, 30 South Pearl Street, Albany, NY\n12245. (2)\n\nThe appeal must be in\nwriting and set forth the name and address of the person asking for the\nexception or the person requesting disclosure; the date of asking for an\nexception or of the request for disclosure and to whom it was delivered; the\nspecific record to which exception or disclosure was denied; the reasons given\nfor such denial; and whether the denial was in writing or is considered to be a\ndenial because of failure of the department to respond in a timely\nmanner. (3)\n\nThe appeal shall be\ndetermined within 10 business days of the receipt of the appeal. Written notice\nof the determination shall be served upon the person, if any, requesting the\nrecord, the person who asked for the exception and the Committee on Open\n\nGovernment. The notice shall contain a statement of the reasons for the\ndetermination.
