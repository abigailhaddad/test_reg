  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 753-3.1 - Timing of notice for excavation or demolition\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nBefore commencing or engaging in any nonemergency excavation or demolition, each excavator shall provide notice of the location and date of the planned\nexcavation or demolition to the one-call notification system serving the\nvicinity in which the excavation or demolition is to take place. (2)\n\nSuch notice shall be served at least two\nbut not more than 10 working days, not including the date of the call, before\nthe commencement date of the excavation or demolition. (b) Excavation or demolition which is\nrequired to be performed promptly as a result of an emergency, disaster or to\ncorrect an immediate hazard may proceed immediately without prior notification\nto operators, if the situation is so serious that the excavation or demolition\ncannot reasonably be delayed. However, excavators shall notify the one-call\nnotification system as soon as possible that such excavation or demolition is\ncommencing or is underway. Extreme caution shall be employed by the excavator\nto prevent damage to existing underground facilities and to avoid endangering\npersons and property. (c) At least\nseven working days in advance of the commencement date of a demolition, the\nexcavator shall request a pre-demolition conference, through the one-call\nnotification system, with all member operators who have underground facilities\nat or near the demolition area. A pre-demolition conference may encompass one\nor more demolition(s) in the project area. A request for a pre-demolition\nconference is not a substitute for the notice of intent to perform demolition\nwork required by this section. (d) Whenever an excavator cancels an excavation or demolition, he or she shall\npromptly communicate the cancellation to facility operators utilizing the\none-call notification system. (1)\n\nWhenever an\nexcavator postpones the commencement date for 10 or less working days, no call\nto the one-call notification system or operators is required. (2)\n\nWhenever an excavator postpones an\nexcavation or demolition more than 10 working days, the same requirements for\nnotice shall pertain to the revised commencement date as listed in subdivision\n(a) of this section. (e) Information requested from an operator for design purposes shall not be a\nsubstitute for the notice of intent to perform excavation or demolition as\nrequired by this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§§\n753-3.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
