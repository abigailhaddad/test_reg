(1)\n\nThe projection of nitrocellulose film\nshall be only from within a booth which meets the requirements of this section\nas to construction, equipment and accessory rooms. (2)\n\nWhere cellulose acetate or safety film is\nused exclusively no projection booth is required but if such a booth is used\nonly the following subdivisions of this section shall apply: paragraph (1) of\nsubdivision (b); subdivision (c); paragraph (2) and (3) of subdivision (e); subdivisions (g), (h) and (i). (3)\n\nAny booth wherein only cellulose acetate or safety film may be used in\naccordance with this Part, shall have posted or painted upon its exterior in\nletters at least two inches high, the following notice: \"No nitrocelluose film shall be used in this\nbooth.\"\n(b) Dimensions and general construction of booths. (1)\n\nMotion picture projection booths shall be\nat least 10 feet from front to rear and eight feet in width and height. The\narea shall be such as to provide not less than 30 inches clearance at the sides\nand rear of each projection machine between lamp housings and 30 inches at the\nrear of each spot or effect machine. (2)\n\nThe walls, ceilings, and floors of such\nbooths shall have a fire-resistance rating of at least one hour. Only\nincombustible material shall be used in the booth construction and all joints\ntherein shall be tight enough to prevent the discharge of smoke. Floor\nsurfacing materials shall be cemented to the floor. Generator, film storage and\nrewinding rooms adjoining projection booths shall be subject to the same\nconstruction requirements as the booths. (c) Exits from booths. (1)\n\nMotion picture projection booths shall\nhave at least two exit doorways, located remote from each other, each at least\n24 inches wide and 68 inches high and provided with self-closing fire doors\nopening out which have a fire-resistance rating of at least three quarters of\nan hour. Any locks on such doors shall be openable without a key from the\ninside. In no case shall any such doors be kept open during any exhibition. Both exit doors shall provide access to an open area or passage not more than\neight inches below the door sill, or, where located at a higher level, to a\nplatform providing access to stairways at least 30 inches wide which may be\nunenclosed, or to one such stairway and a ladder. (2)\n\nSuch platforms shall be at least two feet\ndeep and extend from the hinge jamb of the door to at least two feet beyond the\nlock jamb of the door.

(4)\n\nSuch open areas, passages, stairways, or\nstairway and ladder, shall either directly or through some exitway, provide\naccess to a street. (5)\n\nThe\nrequired exits from the projection booth may be through the rewinding and\ngenerator rooms, respectively, provided that the exits from such rooms are fire\ndoors as required above opening in the direction of exit travel. (d) Operating openings. (1)\n\nOne opening not exceeding 144 square\ninches shall be provided for each motion picture machine and one opening for\nobservation, not exceeding 200 square inches, for each machine. Each opening\nshall be provided with a gravity shutter of not less than one-eighth inch sheet\nmetal or three-eighths inch hard asbestos board with a lap of at least one inch\nall around and set in substantial metal guides. Each shutter shall be\ncontrolled by an approved heat-actuated device near the ceiling and there shall\nalso be an approved heat-actuated device located over each upper projector\nmagazine which will close all shutters. Means shall also be provided for the\nmanual closing of all shutters from a point near each exit door. (2)\n\nThere may be not more than two additional\nopenings neither of which shall exceed seven and one-half square feet in area, for stereopticon or spotlight machines. An additional opening for observation, not exceeding 200 square inches in area, may be provided for the dimmer bank, for the rewinding room and for the toilet room. All such openings shall be\nsimilarly protected by gravity shutters. (e) Handling and storage of film. (1)\n\nNitrocellulose film shall be kept and\nhandled only in projection booths, rewinding rooms or in special storage rooms\nprovided for such purposes. The total quantity so kept or handled shall not\nexceed 50,000 feet at any one time. The quantities of film kept or handled in\nthe respective rooms shall not exceed the following: (i) In a projection booth not more than\n25,000 feet. Film not in use shall be stored in a film cabinet or in I.C.C. containers. (ii)\n\nIn a similarly\nfire-resistant adjoining enclosure separated from the projection booth with\nopenings thereto provided with self-closing fire doors having a rating of at\nleast three quarters of an hour, not more than 25,000 feet shall be stored in a\nfilm cabinet or in I.C.C. containers. (iii)\n\nIn a storage room, which complies with\nthe construction requirements for projection booths, not more than 25,000 feet\nshall be stored in a film cabinet or in I.C.C. containers. (2)\n\nNo flammable liquid or cement exceeding\none pint in amount shall be kept in a projection booth, rewinding or other\naccessory adjoining room. (3)\n\nSmoking is prohibited and a \"NO SMOKING\" sign shall be posted in a conspicuous\nplace in each such room. (f) Film cabinets. (1)\n\nCabinets for the storage of\nnitrocellulose film shall be approved and have a capacity not in excess of\n25,000 feet and shall be either of the sectional or vented type. (2)\n\nThe sectional type shall be so designed\nthat each reel is stored in an individual compartment and can burn out without\ncommunicating fire to film in an adjoining compartment. The racks or drawers\nshall be so arranged that the material immediately adjacent to the partitions\nis kept at least one-half inch away from the partition on either side by\nspacers.
