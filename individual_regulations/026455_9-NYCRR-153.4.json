  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 153.4 - Guidelines approved by director of division of the budget\n\nState Regulations\n(a) These\nguidelines apply to all mortgage modification agreements whereby a housing\ncompany seeks to qualify for moneys from the Project Repair Fund. (b) The existence of a 20-percent or $10 per\nroom per month difference between current rent and total economic rent at an\nHFA-financed housing project will not automatically qualify that project for a\nmortgage modification agreement. Rather, the existence of that situation shall\nbe considered a necessary but not a sufficient test or criterion that must be\nmet if a mortgage modification agreement is to be valid. Mortgage modification\nagreements must also satisfy or meet the other guidelines for mortgage\nmodifications approved by the director of the Division of the Budget as set\nforth in these guidelines. (c) Applicants for mortgage modifications shall demonstrate, in a manner\nsatisfactory to the agency, that all reasonable efforts to manage a project\neconomically and efficiently, to minimize project operating costs, and to\nsecure available Federal subsidies or grants that may be used to increase\nproject income or to effect energy conservation improvements, have been taken. In making this determination, the agency shall consider the findings and\nrecommendations of the commissioner made pursuant to paragraph (i)(2) of this\nsection. Applications for rent or carrying charge increases should not be\ndelayed, nor should project expenditures be allowed to increase without\nsufficient cause, so that a project may eventually qualify for a mortgage\nmodification. (d) Mortgage\nmodification agreements may be made only in those cases when a housing project\nis unable or will be unable, as determined by the commissioner of the Division\nof Housing and Community Renewal (the commissioner) and the executive director\nof the Housing Finance Agency, to fully satisfy, on a timely basis, its\nobligations for debt service, water and sewer or property tax payments for an\nextended period. (e) The inability\nof a housing project to make payments into reserve accounts or to generate a\nreturn on owner's equity because of a shortfall in total project revenues will\nnot be sufficient to qualify that project for a mortgage modification. However, in order to be eligible for a mortgage modification, projects will not be\nrequired to fully expend or disburse the balance of their escrow or reserve\nfunds. (f) The commissioner shall\ncertify that: (1)\nthe project has an approved\noperating budget for the current fiscal year as required by section\n32-a\nof the Private Housing Finance\n\nLaw; (2)\nno expenditures have been\nmade by the project in the current fiscal year except as authorized by that\nbudget, or as authorized by the commissioner or his designated representative; and\n(3)\nhe has reviewed the\nproject's operating budget for the current fiscal year in light of the need for\na mortgage modification and in recognition that the project may fail to make\ntimely and full debt service payments, and has therefore approved only those\nexpenditures necessary to protect the health and safety of tenants and to\nmaintain the project in a habitable condition. (g) The necessity for setting carrying\ncharges or rents below the level of current economic rent shall be\ndemonstrated, together with market surveys and analyses where appropriate. Only\nin extraordinary circumstances shall the carrying charges or rents be below the\nlevel of current economic rent for the full 75 months permitted by section\n60\n(3)(b)\nof the Private Housing Finance\n\nLaw. (h) Only one mortgage\nmodification agreement may be made for any housing project. (i) There shall be: (1)\nan analysis that explains why a mortgage\nmodification, rather than a foreclosure of the project's mortgage lien, is\npreferred and is in the best interests of the State; (2)\nan evaluation, to be prepared by the\ncommissioner of the Division of Housing and Community Renewal, of the quality\nof the management of the housing project. That evaluation shall identify\nexisting and potential management problems at the project, particularly those\nmanagement practices which have a negative effect upon occupancy rates, the\ncollection of rents, building maintenance, operating costs, and the efficient\noperation of the project in general. The commissioner shall also recommend\nappropriate remedies for the problems identified in his evaluation of the\nmanagement of the project and shall review and approve a management improvement\nplan for the project; (3)\nif the\nhousing project has applied for project repair funds as well as for a mortgage\nmodification, in addition to the other evaluations or analyses required as\nspecified in these guidelines, the mortgage modification application shall\ninclude a copy of the certification prepared by an independent consultant\nengaged by HFA as required by paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section\n60\nof the Private Housing Finance Law; (4)\nan estimated operating budget for the\nproject to be prepared by the commissioner of the Division of Housing and\n\nCommunity Renewal, for the duration of the mortgage modification period that\nshows all anticipated project revenues and expenditures and the average annual\ncarrying charges, rental rates or other fees necessary to produce those\nrevenues. The estimated budget shall also show and explain the economic\nassumptions, inflation rates, vacancy rates and other factors affecting project\ncosts and revenues which were used in order to develop the estimated operating\nbudget; (5)\nan estimate prepared by\nthe Housing Finance Agency of the probable impact of the mortgage modification\nagreement upon the relevant debt service fund of the agency, and of the amounts\nwhich the State may be asked to appropriate to that fund under the moral\nobligation provisions of the HFA bond covenants; (6)\na schedule showing the increases in\nrents, carrying charges, equity contributions, garage rents, commercial space\nrentals or other charges imposed by the mortgagor which will be implemented\nduring the period of the mortgage modification; (7)\na statement of all debt service, water\nand sewer, and property tax arrearages accumulated by the project before the\nbeginning of the mortgage modification period, as well as an estimate of the\narrearages that will accumulate during the period of the mortgage modification, and a schedule for the repayment of all such arrearages that is in accordance\nwith Private Housing Finance Law, section\n60\n(3)(b). (j) (1)\n\nThe Executive Director of the Housing\n\nFinance Agency and the Commissioner of the Division of Housing and Community\n\nRenewal shall notify the Director of the Division of the Budget, as soon as is\npractical under the circumstances, that a housing company has applied for or\nexpressed an interest in obtaining: (i) project repair funds; or\n(ii)\na\nmortgage modification agreement necessary to qualify that project for the\nreceipt of project repair funds. (2)\n\nThe director of the Division of the\n\nBudget and his staff shall be kept fully informed of the progress of\nnegotiations among HFA, the housing project and DHCR concerning proposed grants\nfor the correction of construction defects from the Housing Project Repair Fund\nand any mortgage modification necessary to qualify a project to receive those\nmonies. (3)\n\nThe director of the\n\nDivision of the Budget and his staff shall have access to and shall be supplied\nwith draft copies of: (i) all proposed\nmortgage modification agreements; and\n(ii)\nconsultant's reports developed pursuant\nto paragraph (a) of subdivision 3 of section\n60\nof the Private Housing Finance Law; as such are exchanged among the parties to\nthe negotiations, so that the impact of those agreements or reports upon the\nfiscal resources of the State may be evaluated. (4)\n\nThe director of the Division of the\n\nBudget and his staff shall have the opportunity to comment upon and make\nrecommendations for changes to those agreements and reports. (k) Before any mortgage\nmodification agreement to which these guidelines are applicable is recorded, the director of the Division of the Budget shall have certified that such\nagreement complies with these guidelines, or that any noncompliance has been\nwaived pursuant to subdivision (n) of this section. (l) When a housing company has requested\nmonies from the Project Repair Fund, and shall have demonstrated to HFA the\nreasonable likelihood of the existence of construction defects, HFA shall\nengage a consultant to assess the physical condition of the housing project\ninvolved. That assessment shall identify any existing physical defects at the\nproject, determine the extent to which those defects constitute construction\ndefects, identify potentially necessary repairs and replacement, provide an\nopinion as to the adequacy of the project replacement reserves and otherwise\nconform to section\n60\n(3)(a)\nof the Private Housing Finance\n\nLaw. (m) HFA shall recommend to the\ndirector of the Division of the Budget an allocation of appropriated and\navailable monies of the Project Repair Fund among qualifying housing companies\nin accordance with the immediacy and necessity of repairs and availability of\nfunds. (n) The director of the\n\nDivision of the Budget reserves the right to modify, amend or add to the\nmortgage modification guidelines set forth above, or to waive any guideline in\norder to protect the interests of the State.
