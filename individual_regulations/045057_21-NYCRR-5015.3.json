Tit. 21 § 5015.3 - Duty to report\n\nState Regulations\n\nEmployers shall furnish such information and make such\nreports as the system may from time to time require in the discharge of its\nfunctions.

Any agreement by an employer with any member, member's representative or third\nparty to make a report or provide information to the system in a particular\nmanner or to withhold information which is required to be reported to the\nsystem is contrary to public policy and shall be null and void and of no\neffect.
