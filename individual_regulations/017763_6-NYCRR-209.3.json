  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 209.3 - Opacity of emissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person\nwill cause or allow visible emissions to the outdoor atmosphere from any\npotroom group at a primary aluminum reduction plant or any furnace at an anode\nbake plant, for which an application for a permit to construct was received by\nthe commissioner before October 24, 1974, having an average opacity (six\nminutes) of 20 percent or greater, except uncombined water. (b) Upon written application by the owner or\noperator of a source subject to subdivision (a) of this section, the\ncommissioner, at his discretion, may grant an equivalent opacity standard which\nexceeds the applicable opacity standard if the source owner can demonstrate\nthrough acceptable tests for such source that he is in compliance with all\napplicable emission requirements other than the opacity standard and that the\nsource and any associated emission control equipment is being operated and\nmaintained in a manner acceptable to the commissioner. An equivalent opacity\nstandard for an emission source will only be granted where reasonably available\ncontrol technology, as determined by the commissioner, has been utilized. In\nsuch case, the source owner or operator will not cause or allow emissions to\nexceed the equivalent opacity. (c) No person will cause or allow emissions to the outdoor atmosphere from any\npotroom group at a primary aluminum reduction plant or any furnace at an anode\nbake plant for which an application for a permit to construct was received by\nthe commissioner after October 23, 1974, having the following six-minute\naverage opacity, except uncombined water: (1)\n10 percent or greater from any potroom group at a primary aluminum reduction\nplant; and\n(2)\n20 percent or\ngreater from any furnace at an anode bake plant. (d) Section 212.7(a) of this Title will apply\nto any other confined process at a primary aluminum reduction plant or anode\nbake plant for which a permit to construct was received by the commissioner\nbefore October 24, 1974.
