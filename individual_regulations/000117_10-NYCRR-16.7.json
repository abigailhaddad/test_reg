(1)\n\nExcept for doses received from patients released under the provisions of section\n16.123\nof this Part, each licensee or registrant shall conduct operations so that: (i) the dose in any unrestricted area from external sources does not exceed 0.02 mSv (0.002 rem) in any one hour; and\n(ii)\nthe total effective dose equivalent to individual members of the public from the licensed or registered operation, exclusive of the dose contribution from the licensee's or registrant's disposal of radioactive material into sanitary sewerage in accordance with section\n16.8\nof this Part, does not exceed one mSv (0.1 rem) in a year, except where structural modifications to the building or the equipment is required of existing facilities where radiation equipment were installed prior to January 1, 1994 and the use of the radiation source does not change after January 1, 1994 and which result in a total effective dose equivalent to a member of the public which does not exceed five mSv (0.5 rem) in a year. (2)\n\nIf radioactive materials are released into the air or water by any person in such a manner that the radioactive materials may be reconcentrated in the environment or may be added to any other radioactive materials released to the environment, the department may restrict the release by such person to assure that the limits set forth in this Part are not exceeded.

(3)\n\nThe licensee or registrant may petition the department to adjust the effluent concentration values in Appendix 16-C, Table 2, infra, for members of the public, to take into account the actual physical and chemical characteristics of the effluents, such as, aerosol size distribution, solubility, density, radioactive decay equilibrium, and chemical form. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n16.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
