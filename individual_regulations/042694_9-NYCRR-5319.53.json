Tit. 9 § 5319.53 - Error conditions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ngaming device shall be capable of detecting and displaying the error conditions\ndescribed in this section and of illuminating the tower light or sounding an\naudible alarm. Error conditions shall cause a gaming device to lock up and\nrequire attendant intervention except as noted within this section. Error\nconditions shall be cleared either by an attendant or upon initiation of a new\nplay sequence after the error has cleared except for errors described in\nparagraphs (1) and (3) of subdivision (c) of this section, which are deemed\ncritical errors that require further evaluation. Error conditions shall be\ncommunicated to an online monitoring and control system, where\napplicable. (b) Door-open error\nconditions. (1)\n\nAll external doors (e.g., main, belly, top box); (2)\ndrop box\ndoor; (3)\nstacker door; and\n(4)\nany other currency storage\nareas that have a door. (c) Other error conditions. (1)\nNV memory error (for any critical\nmemory); (2)\n\nLow NV memory battery\nfor batteries external to the NV memory itself or low power source; (3)\n\nProgram error or authentication\nmismatch; (4)\n\nReel-spin errors. The\nspecific reel number shall be identified in the error code. This should be\ndetected under the following conditions: (i) a mis-index condition for rotating reels, that affects the outcome of the\ngame; (ii)\nin the final positioning\nof the reel, if the position error exceeds one-half of the width of the\nsmallest symbol excluding blanks on the reel strip; and\n(iii)\nmicroprocessor-controlled reels shall\nbe monitored to detect malfunctions such as a reel that is jammed, or is not\nspinning freely, or any attempt to manipulate the final resting positions of\nsuch reels. (d) Error Codes. For games that use error\ncodes, a description of gaming-device error codes and their meanings shall be\naffixed inside the gaming device. This subdivision shall not apply to\nvideo-based games. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
