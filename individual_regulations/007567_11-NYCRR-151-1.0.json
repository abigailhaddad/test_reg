  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 151-1.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to the September 1, 1984 recodification of the Insurance Law, section 184(7) provided that no workers' compensation rate could be made effective by any rating organization or insurer until such rate had been approved by the superintendent. Following recodification, however, section 2305(b) provides that workers' compensation rates cannot become effective unless either: (a) the filing has been approved; or\n(b) 15 days, which the superintendent may extend to 30 days, elapse without disapproval. Section 2305(e), nonetheless, provides that the superintendent may, by regulation, require specific approval before workers' compensation rates can take effect. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n151-1.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
