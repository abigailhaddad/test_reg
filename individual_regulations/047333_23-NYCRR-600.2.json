  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 600.2 - Definition of finance charge\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Finance charge\nmeans the cost of financing as a dollar amount\nand equals the sum of: (1)\nfor all commercial\nfinancing transactions, all charges that would be included in the finance\ncharge under the federal Truth in Lending Act, Regulation Z, 12 C.F.R. section\n1026.4\n(as amended), and only such charges, if the transaction were a consumer credit transaction and the financer were a\ncreditor according to the definition set forth in\n15 U.S.C. section\n1602(g); (2)\nin any accounts receivable purchase\ntransaction that is not a factoring transaction, the discount taken on the face\nvalue of the accounts receivable; (3)\nin a factoring transaction, the\ndifference between the face value on the invoice and the amount paid directly\nto the recipient upon assignment of the legally enforceable claim to the\nfinancer, inclusive of any factoring fee. For the purpose of the calculation\ndescribed in the preceding sentence, if the transaction involves a reserve\namount, the reserve amount shall also be subtracted from the face value on the\ninvoice only if the financer reasonably anticipates that it will return all\nreserve amounts to the recipient once it has been paid for the legally\nenforceable claim or claims assigned by the recipient or upon termination of\nthe contractual relationship between the financer and the recipient, properly\ncrediting payments made by account debtors and previous collections by the\nfinancer from the recipient, all amounts held in reserve, and payments by\ninsurers on defaulted accounts. In determining what the financer can reasonably\nanticipate, the financer shall consider past performance of similar contracts\n(both those made to the recipient and other similar recipients) and the\npolicies and procedures of the financer; and\n(4)\nin any lease financing transaction, the\nsum of lease payments (including any regular periodic payments and irregular\npayments) and price of the purchase option that the lessee may pay to acquire\nthe leased goods at the end of the lease, less the amount financed. (b) For products where any part of\nthe finance charge is based upon interest that accrues on the outstanding\nprincipal balance owed by the recipient, the interest charge adjusts over time, and it is not possible to calculate the interest charges in advance for the\nentire term of the transaction because the charge adjusts based upon a\nbenchmark rate plus a margin, the provider shall calculate the interest charges\nfor periods of time when the interest charge cannot be calculated in advance\nbased upon the benchmark rate in effect at the time of disclosure and the\nmargin. (c) For the purpose of the\ncalculation required by subdivision (a) of this section, a charge or amount\nthat meets the requirements of subdivisions (a)(i) and subdivisions (a)(ii), (a)(iii), or (a)(iv) of this section shall not be counted twice. (d) For purposes of the calculation required\nby subdivision (a) of this section, avoidable fees and charges that are not\nimposed as an incident to credit are excluded from the finance\ncharge.
