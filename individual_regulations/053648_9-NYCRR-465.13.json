If any party designates an attorney-at-law to represent the party\nbefore the division, such attorney shall file a notice of appearance with the\ndivision. An attorney-at-law who appears for a party to the proceeding at any\nstage therein, including an application for an injunction, shall be deemed to\nremain that party's attorney throughout the proceeding until: (1)\nthe party represented files with the\ndivision a written revocation of the attorney's authority; or\n(2)\nthe attorney files with the division a\nwritten statement of withdrawal from the case; or\n(3)\nthe attorney states on the record at a\ndivision hearing that the attorney is withdrawing from the case; or\n(4)\nthe party represented states on the\nrecord at a division hearing that the attorney's authority is revoked; or\n(5)\nthe division receives notice\nof the attorney's death or disqualification; or\n(6)\nan adverse ruling is made on a motion to\ndisqualify an attorney because of conflict of interest. (b) Notice to attorneys. Copies of all\nwritten communications or notices in the matter directed to the party shall be\nsent either to the attorney alone or to both the party and the\nattorney. (c) Effectiveness of\nservice. Service of any document or paper (except subpoenas and subpoenas duces\ntecum) in the matter on such attorney shall be deemed service on the party\nrepresented; provided, however, that the division may, in addition, serve any\ndocument or paper on the party such attorney represents. (d) Who shall present case in support of\ncomplaint. (1)\n\nIf the complainant is not\nrepresented by an attorney, the case in support of the complaint shall be\npresented before the administrative law judge by the division's agent or\nattorney. However, such agent or attorney shall not have an attorney-client\nrelationship with the complainant. (2)\n\nIf the complainant is represented by an\nattorney, such attorney shall solely present the case in support of the\ncomplaint on the consent of the division attorney. The division attorney shall\nprepare and submit to the administrative law judge or chief administrative law\njudge a statement in lieu of appearance together with the jurisdictional\npapers. (e) The\ncomplainant's and respondent's attorneys shall have full and complete access to\nthe file, and to copies (at reasonable cost) of documents necessary to the\nhearing, at an office maintained by the division convenient to such attorney, by appointment. (f) The\ncomplainant's and respondent's attorneys shall consult with the division\nattorney, or with the administrative law judge at the hearing, concerning any\nproposed settlement of the case, for the purpose of preserving the public\ninterest. (g) The administrative\nlaw judge may, in the exercise of discretion, request the appearance of the\ndivision attorney. (h) Public\ninterest or legal question. (1)\n\nWhere the\ndivision attorney determines that there exists a substantial public interest or\nan important or novel issue of law, the division attorney shall appear at the\nhearing. (2)\n\nIn such case, the\ndivision attorney and complainant's attorney may agree on the procedure to be\nfollowed in the presentation of the case, including joint presentation by such\nattorneys. (3)\n\nThe division\nattorney may at any time withdraw the consent to have the case presented solely\nby the complainant's attorney, and appear at the hearing or submit arguments or\nbriefs. (i) Payment of\naward. When an attorney has ceased to represent a complainant, the division\nshall have no obligation to notify said attorney of any award of money to a\ncomplainant by way of conciliation, settlement, order after hearing or\notherwise, and may consent to or order the delivery and payment of the award by\nthe respondent to the complainant. When a complainant is represented by an\nattorney at the time of an award, the terms of payment thereof shall provide\nthat said award shall be paid in the form of a check or draft made payable to\nthe complainant but delivered to the complainant's attorney.
