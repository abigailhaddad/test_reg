  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 96.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n4231\nof the Insurance Law provides that a life insurance company issuing participating insurance policies and annuity contracts may set aside such sums as may be deemed advisable for the accumulation of surplus. It is necessary and appropriate that these companies establish a financial accounting system whereby the funds so accumulated can be readily identified and managed in a manner that preserves equity among all classes of policyholders. (b) This Part permits mutual life insurers, and stock life insurers issuing participating insurance policies and annuity contracts, to establish a surplus management account and allocate funds thereto in an equitable manner for the purposes set forth in this Part, all pursuant to a plan filed with and approved by the superintendent. The establishment and maintenance of such an account should permit life insurers to embody in their account systems recognized financial management practices that shall not alter established policyholder dividend distribution practices. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n96.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
