(c) Collector means a device designed to\nabsorb incident solar radiation, to convert the solar radiation to thermal\nenergy, and to transfer the thermal energy to a medium passing through or in\ncontact with it. (d) Component\nmeans any device or element of a solar thermal system which can generally be\npurchased separately from the entire system but is essential to the normal\noperation of that system, including collectors, heat exchangers, tanks, pumps, controllers, temperature sensors, meters and fans. Component shall not include\nstandard pipes, ducts, switchboxes or hardware. (e) Connecting parts means those parts other\nthan components which are necessary for the installation of a solar thermal\nsystem and are supplied by the installer of such system. Connecting parts shall\ninclude standard pipes, ducts, switchboxes and hardware. (f) Customer means any person who purchases\nat retail, or contracts with an installer or a servicer for the installation or\nservicing of a solar thermal system. (g) Express warranty means: (1)\nany affirmation of fact or promise made\nin connection with the sale or installation of a solar thermal system or\ncomponent to a customer which relates to the nature of the material or\nworkmanship and affirms or promises that such material or workmanship is\ndefect-free or will meet a specified level of performance over a specified\nperiod or time; or\n(2)\nany\nundertaking in connection with the sale or installation of a solar thermal\nsystem or component to refund, repair, replace or take other remedial action\nwith respect to such system or component; which affirmation, promise or undertaking becomes part of\nthe basis of the bargain resulting in the purchase and/or installation of a\nsolar thermal system by a customer. (h) Heat exchanger means a device that is\nused to transfer heat from one fluid to another through a single or double\nseparating wall. (i) Heat transfer\nfluid means any medium, including air, water or other fluid, which passes\nthrough or in contact with the solar collector for the purpose of carrying\nthermal energy away from the collector. (j) Installer means any person who, for a\nfee, installs or offers to install a solar thermal system. (k) Installation agreement means any\nagreement between an installer and a customer to install a solar thermal\nsystem. (l) Make available means: (1)\nin instances in which the seller or\ninstaller offers to sell or install a solar thermal system at a place other\nthan his place of business, to disclose the fact that he has copies of the\nrequired warranty and product information which will be provided for inspection\nby the prospective customer at any time during the sales presentation, by\norally making such statement and including such statement on any written\nmaterials shown to prospective customers; (2)\nin instances in which the seller or\ninstaller offers to sell or install a solar thermal system at his regular place\nof business, to set out the text of the required warranty and product\ninformation nearby the displayed system or attach such information to the\ndisplayed system, or advertise in a prominent location in the showroom that a\nbinder is available which contains the required warranty and product\ninformation and make such binder available to the customer upon demand; and\n(3)\nin instances in which a\nsolar thermal system is offered for sale through a catalogue or by mail, to\nclearly and conspicuously disclose in such catalogue or solicitation the\nrequired warranty and product information, or a statement that such information\nshall be provided promptly and without charge upon written request. (m) Passive solar thermal system\nmeans a system which relies upon the design and elements of the building to\nenhance the use of natural forces, including solar insulation, winds, and\nnighttime coolness to heat or cool the building by the use of conductive, convective or radiant energy transfer, and which is not primarily dependent\nupon mechanical power for operation. (n) Person means any individual, trustee, agency, partnership, association, corporation, company, municipality, political\nsubdivision or other legal entity. (o) Schematic diagram means a clear and\ncomprehensive line drawing, showing and identifying at a minimum the following\napplicable components of the solar thermal system: number of collectors; type\nof heat transfer fluid; solar storage tanks and auxiliary energy source\nrequired for such tanks; expansion tanks; heat storage media; heat exchangers\nas single wall or double wall; controllers; temperature sensors; valves; fans; pumps; refrigeration units; and interfaces between drinkable water and\nnondrinkable heat transfer fluid. (p) Seller means any person who sells or\noffers for sale, at retail, a solar thermal system. (q) Service agreement means an agreement\nbetween a servicer and a customer to inspect, maintain, repair, replace or\nperform other nonwarranty services related to a solar thermal system over a\nspecified duration of time. (r) Servicer means a person who, for a fee, inspects, maintains, repairs, replaces\nor performs other nonwarranty services related to solar thermal systems or\ncomponents. (s) Solar thermal\nsystem means an arrangement or combination of components designed to provide\nheating, cooling or hot water in a building by the collection or storage of\nsolar energy. Solar thermal systems shall not include passive solar\nsystems. (t) System manufacturer\nmeans any person who manufactures or assembles or designs and packages a solar\nthermal system.
