  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.937 - Continual process of evaluation and assessment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. After completing the baseline\nintegrity assessment of a covered segment, an operator must continue to assess\nthe line pipe of that segment at the intervals specified in section\n255.939\nof this Part and\nperiodically evaluate the integrity of each covered pipeline segment as\nprovided in subdivision (b) of this section. An operator must reassess a\ncovered segment on which a prior assessment is credited as a baseline under\nsection\n255.921\n(e) of\nthis Part by no later than December 17, 2009. An operator must reassess a\ncovered segment on which a baseline assessment is conducted during the baseline\nperiod specified in section\n255.921\n(d) of\nthis Part by no later than seven years after the baseline assessment of that\ncovered segment unless the evaluation under subdivision (b) of this section\nindicates earlier reassessment. (b) Evaluation. An operator must conduct a periodic evaluation as frequently as\nneeded to assure the integrity of each covered segment. The periodic evaluation\nmust be based on a data integration and risk assessment of the entire pipeline\nas specified in section\n255.917\nof this Part. For plastic\ntransmission pipelines, the periodic evaluation is based on the threat analysis\nspecified in section\n255.917\n(d) of\nthis Part. For all other transmission pipelines, the evaluation must consider\nthe past and present integrity assessment results, data integration and risk\nassessment information (section\n255.917\nof this Part), and\ndecisions about remediation (section\n255.933\nof this Part) and\nadditional preventive and mitigative actions (section\n255.935\nof this Part). An operator\nmust use the results from this evaluation to identify the threats specific to\neach covered segment and the risk represented by these threats. (c) Assessment methods. In conducting the\nintegrity reassessment, an operator must assess the integrity of the line pipe\nin the covered segment by any of the following methods as appropriate for the\nthreats to which the covered segment is susceptible (see section\n255.917\nof this Part), or by\nconfirmatory direct assessment under the conditions specified in section\n255.931\nof this Part. (1)\n\nInternal inspection tool or tools capable\nof detecting corrosion, and any other threats to which the covered segment is\nsusceptible. An operator must follow ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 6.2\nin selecting the appropriate internal inspection tools for the covered\nsegment. (2)\n\nPressure test\nconducted in accordance with the testing requirements of this Part. An operator\nmust use the test pressures specified in table 3 of section 5 of ASME/ANSI\nB31.8S, to justify an extended reassessment interval in accordance with section\n255.939\nof this Part. (3)\n\nDirect assessment to address threats of\nexternal corrosion, internal corrosion, or stress corrosion cracking. An\noperator must conduct the direct assessment in accordance with the requirements\nlisted in section\n255.923\nof this Part and with as\napplicable, the requirements specified in section\n255.925, 255.927 or\n255.929\nof this Part. (4)\n\nOther technology that an operator\ndemonstrates can provide an equivalent understanding of the condition of the\nline pipe. An operator choosing this option must notify the department and OPS\n180 days before conducting the assessment, in accordance with section\n255.949\nof this Part. (5)\n\nConfirmatory direct assessment when used\non a covered segment that is scheduled for reassessment at a period longer than\nseven years. An operator using this reassessment method must comply with\nsection\n255.931\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.937\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
