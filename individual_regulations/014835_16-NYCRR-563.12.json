  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 563.12 - Transfers of property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nproperty is transferred from one water plant account to another, from one\nutility department to another, such as from water to electric, from one\noperating division or area to another, to or from accounts 101, Water Plant in\n\nService, 104, Water Plant Leased to Others, and 105, Water Plant Held for\n\nFuture Use, the transfer shall be recorded by transferring the original cost\nthereof from the one account, department, or location to the other. Any related\namounts carried in the accounts for accumulated provisions for depreciation or\namortization shall be transferred in accordance with the segregation of such\naccounts. (b) When depreciable\nproperty is transferred from the water plant accounts to account 121, Nonutility Property, the transfer shall be accomplished by crediting the water\nplant accounts and charging the accumulated provision for depreciation with the\nbook cost of the item transferred; the accumulated provision for depreciation\nshall then be credited, as the estimated salvage, and account 121, Nonutility\n\nProperty, concurrently charged with the market value of the property\ntransferred. If the property is sold within a relatively short time, a debit or\ncredit shall be made to the accumulated provision for depreciation to adjust\nthe estimated salvage to the amount actually realized. If at the time of\ntransfer, the market value is less than the cost new, account 121 may be\ncharged with the cost new (instead of the market value) and account 122, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation and Amortization of Nonutility Property, credited with the difference between such cost and the market value. (c) When nondepreciable land or land rights\nare transferred from the water plant accounts to account 121, Nonutility\n\nProperty, the transfer shall be accomplished by crediting the appropriate plant\naccounts with the book cost of such property and charging account 121, Nonutility Property, with the market value of the property transferred; any\ndifference between the book cost and the market value of the property\ntransferred shall be included in account 117, Accumulated Gains and Losses from\n\nDisposition of Utility Land and Land Rights. If the property is sold within a\nrelatively short time the related gain or loss previously recorded in account\n117, shall be adjusted to the amount actually realized upon sale of such\nproperty.
