  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 453.3 - Ambient conditions; stationary test\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nSound. The ambient A-weighted sound level at the microphone location point\nshall be measured, in the absence of motor vehicle noise emanating from within\nthe clear zone, with fast meter response using a sound level measurement system\nthat conforms to section\n451.2\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe measured ambient level must be 10\ndB(A) or more below that level specified in section\n450.3\nof this Title, Table 1, which\ncorresponds to the maximum permissible sound level reading which is applicable\nat the test site at the time of testing. (b) Wind. The wind velocity at the test site\nshall be measured at the beginning of each series of noise measurements and at\nintervals of five to 15 minutes thereafter until it has been established that\nthe wind velocity is essentially constant. Once this fact has been established, wind velocity measurements may be made at intervals of once every hour. Noise\nmeasurements may only be made if the measured wind velocity is 12 mph (19.3\nkph) or less. Gust wind measurements of up to 20 mph (33.2 kph) are\nallowed. (c) Precipitation. Measurements are prohibited under any conditions of precipitation; however, measurements may be made with snow on the ground. The ground within the\nmeasurement area must be free of standing water. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n453.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
