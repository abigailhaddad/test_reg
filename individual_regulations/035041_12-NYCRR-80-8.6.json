  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 80-8.6 - Test method, flooring material\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Test specimen. Each test specimen shall\nbe a 9 inch by 9 inch (+- 1/16) section of the flooring material to be\ntested. (b) Test apparatus\nrequired. (1)\n\nTest chamber. The test chamber\nshall consist of an open top hollow tube made of noncombustible material with\ninside dimensions 12 x 12 x 12 inches and a minimum of 1/4 inch wall thickness. The flat bottom of the box shall be made of the same material as the sides and\nshall be easily removable. The sides shall be fastened together with screws or\nbrackets and taped to prevent air leakage into the box during use. (2)\n\nSupporting frame. A steel plate, 9 inches\nby 9 inches, 1/4 inch thick with an 8 inch diameter hole in its center and a 1\ninch by 1 inch by 1/16 inch thick shim affixed to the underside of each corner\nshall be required to support the material above the floor of the chamber during\nthe course of the test. (3)\n\nFlattening frame. A steel plate, 9 inches by 9 inches, 1/4 inch thick with an 8\ninch diameter hole in its center shall be required to hold the flooring\nmaterial flat during the course of the test. (4)\n\nPunch. A punch, capable of making a 1/4\ninch diameter hole in the center of the specimen of flooring material to be\ntested, shall be available. (5)\n\nStandard igniting source. A No. 1588 methenamine timed tablet or equivalent\nshall be available. These tablets shall be stored in a desiccator over a\ndesiccant for 24 hours prior to use. Small quantities of sorbed water may cause\nthe tablets to fracture when first ignited. If a major fracture occurs, any\nresults from that test shall be ignored, and it shall be repeated. (6)\n\nHood. A hood capable of being closed and\nhaving its draft turned off during each test and capable of rapidly removing\nthe products of combustion following each test shall be available. The front or\nsides of the hood shall be transparent to permit observation of the tests in\nprogress. (7)\n\nMirror. A small\nmirror mounted above the test chamber at an angle to permit observation of the\nspecimen from outside of the hood shall be available. (c) Test procedure. The following procedure\nshall be followed when testing flooring material: (1)\n\nPlace the test chamber in the\ndraft-protected environment (hood with draft off) with its bottom in place and\nthe supporting frame centered in the bottom of the chamber, shimmed side\ndown. (2)\n\nPunch a 1/4 inch diameter\nhole in the center of the specimen of flooring material to be tested. (3)\n\nPlace the specimen on the supporting\nframe in the position in which it will be used, exercising care that the\nspecimen is horizontal and flat. Place the flattening frame on the specimen and\nposition a methenamine tablet on one of its flat sides with its edge within 1/8\ninch of the edge of the hole in the center of the specimen. (4)\n\nIgnite the tablet by touching a lighted\nmatch or an equivalent igniting source carefully to its top. (5)\n\nContinue each test until the last vestige\nof flame or glow disappears (this is frequently accompanied by a final puff of\nsmoke) or the flaming or smoldering has approached within 1.0 inch of the edge\nof the hole in the flattening frame at any point. Any test in which the tablet\nis extinguished by physical action of the specimen of flooring material shall\nbe disregarded and the test repeated. (6)\n\nWhen all combustion has ceased, ventilate\nthe hood and measure the shortest distance between the edge of the hole in the\nflattening frame and the damaged area. Record the distance measured for each\nspecimen. (7)\n\nRemove the specimen\nfrom the chamber and remove any burn residue from the floor of the chamber. Before proceeding to the next test, the floor must be cooled to normal room\ntemperature or replaced with one that is at normal room temperature. (d) Report. The number of\nspecimens of the four tested in which the damaged area does not extend to\nwithin 1.0 inch of the edge of the hole in the flattening frame shall be\nreported. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n80-8.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
