  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 649.13 - Priority ranking system scoring criteria\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe numerical scores in the priority ranking system for\nproject categories A, B, C, D, E, F, and G are based on the following\ncriteria: A. Existing\n\nPollutant. B. Water\n\nQuality. C. Consistency With\n\nManagement Plan. D. Project\n\nNeed. E. Financial Need (municipal\nprojects only). F. Resiliency. G. Tie Breaking. The total numerical score for the project being scored\nshall be the sum of the scores for criteria A, B, C, D, E and F for municipal\nprojects and criteria A, B, C, D and F for non-municipal projects. Project\ncategory G projects will be selected based upon criteria set forth in the\nIUP. The project score will be based on information in the\napprovable facilities plan, engineering report, or other acceptable\ndocumentation. Projects without approvable facilities plans or engineering\nreports will be scored based on information from other sources and adjusted\nwhen a facilities plan or engineering report is determined to be\napprovable. A. Existing\n\nPollutant Criterion. The project receives a score based on whichever one of the\nfactors (1-4) listed below best describes the pollutant associated with\ncriterion B which may be resolved by the project. Factor\n1. Waterbody not attaining water quality\nstandards: a. A pollutant causing a waterbody's best\nuse(s) to be assessed as \"impaired\" as documented in the assessment factsheet\nfor the waterbody or on the Clean Water Act, section 303(d) List of Impaired\n\nWaters occurring as a result of an untreated, partially treated, or\nintermittent point or nonpoint source. b. A pollutant causing a surface and/or\ngroundwater source to result in a documented restriction of\nuse. 50\n2. Waterbody currently attaining water quality\nstandards with potential impacts to water quality: a. A pollutant causing a waterbody's best\nuse(s) to be assessed as \"stressed\" as documented in the assessment for the\nwaterbody occurring as a result of an untreated, partially treated, or\nintermittent point or nonpoint source. b. A pollutant causing a surface and/or\ngroundwater source to result in a documented negative impact of\nuse. 25\n3. Waterbody attaining water quality standards or\nunassessed: a. A waterbody's best use(s) is unassessed or\nassessed as \"fully supporting\" as documented in the assessment for the\nwaterbody. b. A point or nonpoint source project necessary\nto maintain or protect existing facilities or water quality. 10\n4. Other: A point or nonpoint pollutant project that was\nnecessary to preserve, protect and/or improve surface and/or groundwater\nquality from a pollutant identified in factor 1, 2, or 3 of this criterion and\nwhich construction was complete as defined in section\n649.2\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part prior to being listed in a final IUP. 5\n5\n5. None of the above. 0\n\nPoints may be allocated under either A.1, A.2, A.3, A.4\nor A.5. B. Water Quality\n\nCriterion (WQC). The WQC is determined by the following two factors: 1)\n\nClassification Points Factor (CPF); and\n2)\n\nAssessment Status (AS). The points are modified depending upon the severity of\nimpact on the best use of the receiving water and the potential for the\nproposed project to improve water quality. The WQC is calculated using the following equation: WQC =\nCPF x AS. 1. Classification Points\n\nFactor (CPF). Points are allotted to a project on the basis of State-assigned\nclassification of the receiving water at the point of discharge, or where\nhigher, the classification of downstream surface waters, the use of which is\nimpacted or potentially impacted by the pollutant. Classification\n\nPoints\nA, A-Special, A(T), A(TS), AA, AA-Special, AA(T), AA(TS), SA, GA, GSA\n8\nB, SB, C(T)\n1, C (TS)\n6\nC\n2, SC, I\n3\nD, SD, GSB\n2\n\nImpact on resources which have important\nenvironmental quality impacts such as odor, sludge disposal, sewer maintenance\nequipment, etc. or for a project which received a score under factor 4 of A -\nExisting Source Criterion. 1\n\nNo resource is impacted. 0\n2. Assessment Status Factor (AS). Points are\nallotted to a project based on the best use assessment of the waterbody segment\nor verifiable documentation of the surface water and/or groundwater impact. 3\n\nAssessment Status\n\nDescription\n\nPoints\n\nImpaired/Restricted\n\nWater quality standards are not attained and\nbest use(s) are not supported. 6\n\nStressed/Impacted\n\nWater quality standards are attained but data\nor information indicate a potential impact to best use(s). 3\n\nNone\n\nWater quality standards are attained and best\nuse(s) are supported. 1\nC.

Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n649.13\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 2, 2025/Volume XLVII, Issue 13, eff. 4/2/2025\n(T) and (TS) indicate the application of standards to\nprotect trout and trout spawning, respectively. Classification C without (T) or (TS)\nappended. The procedures for documenting a best use assessment in\naccordance with the Clean Water Act are detailed in the Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Consolidated Assessment and Listing\n\nMethodology. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. The numerical scores in the priority ranking system for\nproject\ncategories A, B, C, D and E are based on the following criteria: A. Existing source. B. Water quality improvement. C. Consistency with management plans. D. Intergovernmental needs. E. Financial need (municipal projects only). F. Economic need. The total numerical score for the\nproject\nbeing scored shall be the sum of the scores for criteria A, B, C, D, E and F for municipal projects and criteria A, B, C, D and F for non-municipal projects. Project\ncategory G projects will be selected based upon criteria set forth in the IUP. The\nproject\nscore will be based on information in the approvable\nfacilities plan\nor\nengineering report. Projects without approvable facilities plans or engineering reports will be scored based on information from other sources and adjusted when a\nfacilities plan\nor\nengineering report\nis determined to be approvable. Projects must be adequately supported by technical documentation, data, reports, etc. A. Existing source criterion. The\nproject\nreceives a score based on whichever of the factors (1-5) listed below best describes the source of\npollution\nassociated with the impairment of use scored under criterion B which may be resolved by the\nproject. Factor\n1. A critical source of\npollution\na. A raw, partially treated or intermittent point or non point source causing or significantly contributing to a priority water problem which has been identified on priority waterbodies list (PWL) as \"precluded\" or \"impaired\" or is resulting in documented use impairment of surface and/or groundwater quality equivalent to \"precluded\" or \"impaired\", or b. A source from which bioaccumulative chemicals of concern (BCCs) would be reduced or eliminated. 50\n2. A significant source of\npollution\nA raw, partially treated or intermittent point or nonpoint source causing or significantly contributing to a priority water problem which has been identified on priority waterbodies list (PWL) as \"stressed\" or \"threatened\" or causing a documented use impairment of surface and/or groundwater quality equivalent to \"stressed\" or \"threatened\". 25\n3. A potential source of\npollution\na. A point or nonpoint source causing or significantly contributing to a water use impairment that is not identified on the priority waterbodies list (PWL) nor causing a documented use impairment of surface water or groundwater quality, or b.

Other A point or non point source\nproject\nthat was necessary to preserve, protect and/or improve surface and/or groundwater quality from a source of\npollution\nidentified in 1, 2, or 3 above and which\nconstruction\nwas complete as defined in section\n649.2\n(a)(9)\nof this Part prior to being listed in a final IUP. 5\n5. None of the above. 0\nB. Water quality improvement criterion (WQIC). The WQIC is determined by the following three factors: 1)\nclassification\npoints factor (CPF); 2)\nimpairment factor (IF); and\n3)\npotential improvement factor (PIF). Based on the existing source identified for criterion A, points are allotted to a\nproject\non the basis of the\n\nState\n-assigned\nclassification\nof the receiving water at the point of discharge, or where higher, the\nclassification\nof downstream surface\nwaters, the use of which is impacted or potentially impacted by the existing discharge. The points are modified depending upon the severity of impairment of the desired best usage of the receiving water and the potential for the proposed\nproject\nto improve water quality. The WQIC is calculated using the following equation: WQIC = CPF × IF × PIF\n1. Classification\npoints factor (CPF).
