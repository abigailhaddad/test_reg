  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-9.2 - Air sampling requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Personal air sampling. Air sampling shall be performed in the worker's\nbreathing zone, by the asbestos contractor for his personnel, as required by\ncurrent OSHA regulations. (b) Daily\nair sampling. Project air sampling shall be conducted daily for the full\nworkshift for large projects, until satisfactory clearance air results have\nbeen obtained for the regulated abatement work area. If more than one daily\nworkshift is required to accomplish the work, air sampling shall be performed\non each workshift. Air sampling is not required on days when there are no Phase\nII C activities. (1)\n\nNumber and location of\nsamples -- large asbestos projects. A minimum of five samples shall be taken on\na daily basis. The location of samples to be taken are the same as specified\nfor Phases II A and II B. (See section\n56-7.1\nand Table 2 within section\n56-4.9\nof this Part.)\n(2)\n\nWork stoppage criteria during Phase II C\nabatement procedures. If air samples collected outside the regulated abatement\nwork area, indicate airborne fiber concentrations at or above 0.01 fibers per\ncubic centimeter, or the established background level, whichever is greater, work shall stop immediately for inspection and repair of barriers and negative\nair ventilation systems as necessary. Clean up of surfaces outside of the\nregulated abatement work area using HEPA-vacuums and wet-cleaning methods shall\nbe performed prior to resumption of abatement activities. A summary of the\nelevated results, clean up activities, the results of barrier and negative air\nsystem inspections including any necessary repairs, shall be documented in the\nsupervisor's daily project log. Work methods shall be altered accordingly to\nreduce fiber concentrations to acceptable levels. (c) Exemption from daily air sampling. Daily\nair sampling is not required on exterior asbestos projects with abatement of\nnon-friable ACM roofing, siding, caulking or glazing compound, tars, sealers, coatings or other NOB ACMs, unless the ACM is rendered friable during removal, or debris falls inside the building/structure. (d) Clearance air sampling. There is no\nexemption from these requirements for small or large size negative pressure\ntent enclosure work areas. The amount of material abated within each regulated\nabatement work area determines the project size clearance air sampling\nrequirements for each regulated abatement work area. (1)\n\nAggressive sampling techniques. The\nfollowing aggressive sampling techniques must be used for Phase II C clearance\nair sampling: (i) Pre-sampling agitation. Before starting the air sampling pumps, the exhaust of forced air equipment\nshall be directed against all walls, ceilings, floors, ledges, and other\nsurfaces in the rooms. This shall continue for at least five minutes per 1,000\nsquare feet of floor space. (ii)\n\nOngoing agitation. At least a 20-inch fan shall be placed in the center of each\nroom. One fan per 10,000 cubic feet of room space shall be used. The fan shall\nbe operated on slow speed and pointed toward the ceiling. (iii)\n\nBegin sampling. The sampling pumps\nshall then be turned on. (iv)\n\nEnd\nsampling. When sampling has been completed, the sampling pump shall be turned\noff first, followed by the fan. (2)\n\nNumber and location of samples -- large\nproject. A minimum of 10 area samples shall be taken. Five samples shall be\ntaken inside the regulated abatement work area and five samples shall be taken\noutside of the regulated abatement work area within the building or structure\nin uncontaminated areas that are within 10 feet of the isolation barriers. One\nadditional inside sample shall be required for every 5,000 sq. ft. above 25,000\nsq. ft. of floor space within the regulated abatement work area. If the entire\nbuilding/structure is the regulated abatement work area, the five area samples\noutside the regulated abatement work area shall be eliminated and one sample\nshall be collected outside the building/structure within 10 feet of isolation\nbarriers. (3)\n\nNumber and location\nof samples -- small project. A minimum of six samples shall be taken. Three\nsamples shall be taken inside the regulated abatement work area and three\nsamples shall be taken outside of the regulated abatement work area, within the\nbuilding or structure, in the uncontaminated areas within 10 feet of the\nisolation barriers. If the entire building/structure is the regulated abatement\nwork area, the three area samples outside the regulated abatement work area\nshall be eliminated and one sample shall be collected outside the\nbuilding/structure within 10 feet of the isolation barriers. (4)\n\nNumber and location of samples -- minor\nasbestos projects and minor size regulated abatement work areas. For a minor\nasbestos project, air samples are not required unless the glove bag or tent\nfails or if it is an incidental disturbance asbestos project, in which case the\nfollowing sampling will be required. Also, if a minor size regulated abatement\nwork area is part of a small or large asbestos project, the following sampling\nwill be required per minor size regulated abatement work area. (i) Clearance air sampling. A minimum of two\nsamples shall be collected. One sample shall be collected inside the regulated\nabatement work area and one sample shall be collected outside of the regulated\nabatement work area, within the building or structure, in an uncontaminated\narea within 10 feet of the isolation barriers. (e) Exemption from clearance air sampling. Clearance air sampling is not required for exterior asbestos projects completed\nwithout a negative pressure enclosure. When clearance sampling is not required\nas per this Part, once the final cleaning is complete, the appropriate\nwaiting/settling or drying time requirements, as defined in section\n56-9.1\nof this Subpart shall\ncommence. Once the appropriate time period has elapsed, a visual inspection\nshall be completed by the project monitor to confirm that the scope of\nabatement work for the asbestos project is complete, and no visible asbestos\ndebris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation remain. The asbestos abatement\ncontractor supervisor must complete a satisfactory visual inspection for\ncompleteness of abatement and cleaning, prior to commencement of the project\nmonitor visual inspection. (1)\n\nProject\nmonitor visual inspection. An appropriately trained and certified project\nmonitor, contracted by the building/structure owner, independent of the\nasbestos abatement contractor, shall complete the visual inspection. The\nproject monitor visual inspection for completeness of abatement and\ncompleteness of cleanup shall be performed as per the provisions of the current\nASTM standard E1368 \"Standard Practice for Visual Inspection of Asbestos\n\nAbatement Projects\". If the property owner is the asbestos abatement contractor\nfor the asbestos project, the owner shall contract with an independent project\nmonitoring firm asbestos contractor for the necessary visual inspection on the\nasbestos project. The asbestos abatement contractor and property owner, prior\nto the scheduling of the required visual inspection, shall provide a complete\nabatement scope of work for the asbestos project to the project monitor. An\nentry shall be made into the asbestos abatement contractor supervisor's daily\nlog by both the supervisor and the project monitor performing the inspection, detailing the findings of the visual inspection. The full name and NYSDOL\nasbestos handling certificate number of the certified project monitor\nperforming the inspection shall also be documented in the supervisor's daily\nlog. If the regulated abatement work area is determined to be acceptable, this\nqualified project monitor may authorize breakdown of the regulated abatement\nwork area, removal of all remaining barriers and waste removal from the\nsite. (2)\n\nExemption from project\nmonitor visual inspection. Asbestos projects which are exempt from clearance\nair sampling requirements at one or two-family owner occupied residential\nbuildings/structures, are also allowed an exemption from the project monitor\nvisual inspection requirements. For asbestos projects utilizing this exemption, once final cleaning is complete, a visual inspection shall be completed by the\nsupervisor to confirm that the scope of abatement work for the asbestos project\nis complete, and no visible debris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation\nremain. The results of this inspection shall be documented by the supervisor in\nthe asbestos abatement contractor daily project log, and once the asbestos\nproject is complete the supervisor shall also obtain the owner's written\nacceptance of the final results of the asbestos project within the daily\nproject log. (f) Satisfactory clearance air sample results. The clearance air sample results\nshall be considered acceptable when the clearance criteria in section\n56-4.11\nof this Part have been\nsatisfied. (g) Unsatisfactory\nclearance air sample results. Required actions if the non-exempt regulated\nabatement work area clearance air sampling results are unsatisfactory are as\nfollows: (1)\n\nRecleaning. If the results of\ninside work area group of air samples are unsatisfactory, recleaning of\nregulated abatement work area surfaces using wet methods is required, with the\nnegative air pressure equipment operating as per the requirements of this Part. If only the results of the outside work area group of air samples are\nunsatisfactory, clean-up of surfaces outside of the regulated abatement work\narea using HEPA-vacuums and wet-cleaning methods shall be performed. (2)\n\nCollection of new samples. (i) If the results of inside work area group\nof air samples are unsatisfactory, after recleaning of work area surfaces, clearance air sampling shall not commence until the appropriate\nwaiting/settling or drying time requirement as per subdivision (f) of this\nsection has elapsed and no visible asbestos debris/residue, pools of liquid, or\ncondensation remain, then collection and analysis of an additional full set\n(both inside and outside work area samples) of clearance air samples as\nrequired by subdivision (d) of this section shall be completed. Samples shall\nbe placed in the same positions as before, and the new samples analyzed for\nconcentrations of airborne fibers. (ii)\n\nIf only the results for the outside work\narea group of air samples are unsatisfactory, following clean-up of surfaces\noutside of the regulated abatement work area, collection and analysis of an\nadditional group of outside work area clearance air samples as required by\nsubdivision (d) of this section shall be completed. Samples shall be placed in\nthe same positions as before, and the new samples analyzed for concentrations\nof airborne fibers. (3)\n\nRepeating air sampling and analysis. The requirements of this subdivision shall\nbe repeated until satisfactory clearance air sampling results have been\nachieved, for all non-exempt regulated abatement work areas throughout the\nentire work site.
