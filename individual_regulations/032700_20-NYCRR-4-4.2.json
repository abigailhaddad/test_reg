  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-4.2 - General Principles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Receipts and net gains (not less than zero) from services and other business\nactivities not otherwise enumerated in section 210-A, such as net gains (not\nless than zero) from the sale of intangible property, as well as receipts from\nthe compensation for certain services, such as commissions, finder's fees, loan\nservicing fees, and fees for professional services are included in New York\nreceipts if the location where the customers derives value from the service or\nother business activity, according to the hierarchy of methods set forth in\nsection 210-A and paragraphs (1) through (4) of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, is in New York State. The corporation must exercise due diligence\nunder each method described in subdivision (b) of this section before rejecting\nit and proceeding to the next method in the hierarchy, and must base its\ndetermination on information known to the corporation or information that would\nbe known to the corporation upon reasonable inquiry. 100% of such receipts are\nincluded in everywhere receipts. (b) The hierarchy of methods referenced in\nparagraphs (1) through (4) of this subdivision used to apportion the receipt\nfrom the service or other business activity must be applied sequentially. A\ncorporation may abandon a method only if, after exercising due diligence, it\nlacks sufficient information to apply that method. (1)\nA corporation must apportion the receipt\nto the location where the benefit of the service or other business activity is\nreceived (\"where benefit received method\"; see sections\n4-4.3\nthrough\n4-4.6\nof this Subpart). (2)\nA corporation must apportion the receipt\nto the delivery destination (\"delivery destination method\"; see section\n4-4.7\nof this Subpart). (3)\nA corporation must apportion the receipt\nin the same way as those receipts from that type of other business activity or\nservice were apportioned in the preceding taxable year (\"preceding taxable year\nmethod\"; see section\n4-4.9\nof this Subpart). (4)\nA corporation must apportion the receipts\nfrom that service or other business activity to New York in the same way as its\nreceipts from other services or business activities in the current taxable year\nare apportioned using the where benefit received method and delivery\ndestination method referenced in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision\n(\"current taxable year method\"; see section\n4-4.10\nof this Subpart). (c) Corporations should refer\nfirst to the special rules for determining where the benefit is received in\nsection\n4-4.3\nof this Subpart prior to\ndetermining if a transaction qualifies as an intermediary transaction. Unless a\nspecial rule in section\n4-4.3\nof this Subpart applies, a\ncorporation should then determine if the rules for intermediary transactions in\nsection\n4-4.8\nof this Subpart apply before\napplying the other rules in this Subpart. (d) In exercising due diligence, the\nfollowing standards apply: (1)\n(i) In applying the rules in this Subpart, if\nthe required information is not readily available to the corporation, the\ncorporation must make reasonable inquiries to a business customer to determine\nthe information required by these rules. (ii)\n\nIf the corporation has more than 250\nbusiness customers purchasing substantially similar services or activities as\npurchased by the particular customer that would be apportioned under this\n\nSubpart and no more than 5% of receipts from such services or activities are\nfrom that particular customer, then the benefit from such service or activity\nis presumed to be received at the customer's billing address (\"business address\npresumption\"). (2)\n\nCorporations must document the steps taken before abandoning each method of the\nhierarchy or step within a level of the hierarchy, such as moving from a\nspecial rule for determining where the benefit is received to the general rule\nfor determining where the benefit is received, including documentation of\nreasonable inquiries made. (3)\n\nWhen\nthe commissioner determines that the corporation had access to, or could have\nobtained upon reasonable inquiries when required, information at the time it\nfiled its original return to apply a method of apportionment that comes earlier\nin the hierarchy than the method utilized by the corporation, the commissioner\nmay require the corporation to use such method. (e) If there is a presumption in applying a\nmethod in the hierarchy, the presumption may be overcome by either the\ncorporation or the Department. (1)\n\nThe\npresumption may be overcome by the corporation if the corporation can prove, by\nclear and convincing evidence, that the method it proposes to use better\nreflects the location where the customer derives value from the service or\nother business activity. In such a case, the location to which the receipts\nfrom the service or other business activity will be apportioned will be based\non the evidence accumulated by the corporation. If the corporation believes it\nhas overcome the presumption and uses an alternative method, upon audit the\n\nDepartment may examine the corporation's alternative method to determine if the\npresumption has been overcome and, if so, whether it was applied in a\nconsistent manner for similar transactions. (2)\n\nThe presumption may be overcome by the\n\nDepartment if the Department can prove, by clear and convincing evidence, that\nthe method it proposes to use better reflects the location where the customer\nderives value from the service or other business activity, and that the\ncorporation had access to, or could have obtained upon reasonable inquiries\nwhen required, information at the time it filed its original return that could\nhave been used to apply the Department's method.
