As\nused in this section, an acceptable accrediting agency shall mean an\norganization accepted by the department as a reliable authority for the purpose\nof accrediting at the postsecondary level and which applies its criteria for\ngranting accreditation in a fair, consistent, and nondiscriminatory\nmanner. (b) Licensure requirement. To meet the professional education and experience requirements for licensure as\na professional engineer in this State, the applicant shall submit evidence of: (1)\ngraduation, including receipt of the\nbachelor's degree in engineering, from a professional program in engineering\nregistered by the department, accredited by an acceptable accrediting agency, or determined by the department to be the substantial equivalent of a\nregistered or accredited program; and\n(2)\ncompletion of a minimum of four years of\nprofessional engineering work experience that meets the requirements of section\n68.2\nof this Part; or\n(3)\ngraduation, including receipt of the\nbachelor's degree in engineering technology, from an engineering technology\nprogram registered by the department or accredited by an acceptable accrediting\nagency; or\n(4)\ngraduation, including receipt of the bachelor's degree in engineering, from a professional\nprogram in engineering determined by the department to be the substantial\nequivalent of a registered or accredited engineering program; or\n(5)\ngraduation, including receipt of the\nbachelor of science degree, in a field related to engineering, engineering\ntechnology, or architecture as determined to be acceptable by the department, and graduation, including receipt of a master's or doctoral degree from a\nprofessional program in engineering determined by the department to be the\nsubstantial equivalent of a registered or accredited engineering program and\nthat contains 24 graduate-level semester hours of engineering; and\n(6)\ncompletion of a minimum of six years of\nprofessional engineering work experience that meets the requirements of section\n68.2. (7)\n\nFor applicants that meet the requirements\nof paragraphs (1), (3), or (4) of this subdivision, the department shall accept\ngraduation, including receipt of a master's or doctoral degree from a\nprofessional program in engineering determined by the department to be the\nsubstantial equivalent of a registered or accredited engineering program and\nthat contains 24 graduate-level semester hours of engineering in lieu of not\nmore than one year of work experience set forth in (b)(2) or (b)(6) of this\nsection. (c) Special\nprovisions. As an alternative to the education/experience credit requirements\nin subdivision (b) of this section, for applicants who seek licensure and\nsubmit an application, with the required fee, to the department prior to April\n6, 2024, the following education/experience credit requirements shall apply: (1)\n\nPrior to licensure the applicant must\naccrue 12 years of acceptable education/experience credit. One year of\neducation/experience credit may be earned for each year of work experience\nacceptable to the State Board for Engineering, Land Surveying and Geology\npursuant to section\n68.2\nof this Part. Two years of\neducation/experience credit may be earned for each year of professional\nengineering education obtained in a program leading to a bachelor's degree in\nengineering and accredited by an acceptable accrediting agency, as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, which specializes in the fields of engineering\nor in a program equivalent to such an accredited professional engineering\nprogram. (2)\n\nEducation/experience\ncredits may also be proportionally earned for various levels and types of\npostsecondary education which, while not entirely the study of professional\nengineering, contain important elements/ content of such study. Such\npostsecondary education should demonstrate the following: (i) that it contains important\nelements/content of the study of professional engineering, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, physical and applied sciences, design, and properties of\nmaterials; (ii)\nthat it is in an\nappropriate subject relevant to the field of professional engineering, such as\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, physical and applied sciences, design, and\nproperties of materials; (iii)\nthat\nit is at an appropriate level of study that would, at a minimum, be the\nmaterial equivalent of study at an undergraduate level; and\n(iv)\nthat it is part of a program accredited\nby an acceptable accrediting agency pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section\nor part of a program equivalent to such an accredited\nprogram. (3)\n\nIn\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section, the\ndepartment shall accept evidence of completion of a master's or doctoral degree\nin engineering in lieu of not more than one year of acceptable\neducation/experience credit.
