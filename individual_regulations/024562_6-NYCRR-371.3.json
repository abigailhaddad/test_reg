  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 371.3 - Characteristics of hazardous waste\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\nA solid waste, as\ndefined in section\n371.1\n(c) of this\n\nPart, which is not excluded from regulation as a hazardous waste under section\n371.1\n(e), is a\nhazardous waste if it exhibits any of the characteristics identified in this\nsection. Note: Section\n372.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle sets forth the generator's responsibility to determine whether the waste\nexhibits one or more of the characteristics identified in this section. (2)\nA hazardous waste which identified by a\ncharacteristic in this section is assigned every EPA hazardous waste number\nthat is applicable as set forth in this section. This number(s) must be used in\ncomplying with the notification requirements of section 3010 of RCRA and all\napplicable recordkeeping and reporting requirements under Part 372 through\n\nSubpart 373-3, and Part 376 of this Title. (3)\n\nFor purposes of this section, the\ncommissioner will consider a sample obtained using any of the applicable\nsampling methods specified in Appendix 19, infra, to be a\nrepresentative sample. A person may employ a sampling method alternative to\nthose listed in Appendix 19 and is not required to demonstrate the equivalency\nof that method under the procedures set forth in section\n370.3\n(a) and (b)\nof this Title. (b) Characteristic of ignitability. (1)\nA solid waste exhibits the characteristic\nof ignitability if a representative sample of the waste has any of the\nfollowing properties: (i) It is a liquid, other than an aqueous solution containing less than 24 percent alcohol by\nvolume, and has a flash point less than 60 degrees Celsius (140 degrees\n\nFahrenheit), as determined by a Pensky-Martens Closed Cup Tester, using the\ntest method specified in the American Society for Testing Materials (ASTM)\n\nStandard D 93-79 or D 93-80 (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); or a Setaflash Closed Cup Tester, using the test method specified in\nASTM Standard D 3278-78 (see section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle). (ii)\n\nIt is not a liquid and\nis capable under standard temperature and pressure, of causing fire through\nfriction, absorption of moisture or spontaneous chemical changes and, when\nignited, burns so vigorously and persistently that it creates a\nhazard. (iii)\n\nIt is an ignitable\ncompressed gas, as defined in\n40 CFR\n261.21(a)(3)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title). (iv)\n\nIt is\nan oxidizer as defined in\n40 CFR\n261.21(a)(4)\n(see section\n370.1[e] of this Title). (2)\nA solid waste that exhibits the\ncharacteristic of ignitability has the EPA hazardous waste number of\nD001. (c) Characteristic of corrosivity. (1)\nA solid waste exhibits the characteristic\nof corrosivity if a representative sample of the waste has either of the\nfollowing properties: (i) it is aqueous and\nhas a pH less than or equal to 2 or greater than or equal to 12.5 as determined\nby a pH meter using method 9040C in\n\nTest Methods for Evaluating Solid\n\nWaste, Physical/Chemical Methods, EPA publication number SW-846 as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle; or\n(ii)\nit is a liquid and\ncorrodes steel (SAE 1020) at a rate greater than 6.35 mm (0.250 inch) per year\nat a test temperature of 55 degrees Celsius (130 degrees Fahrenheit) as\ndetermined by Method 1110A\nTest Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\nA solid waste\nthat exhibits the characteristics of corrosivity has the EPA hazardous waste\nnumber of D002. (d) Characteristic of reactivity. (1)\nA solid waste exhibits the characteristic\nof reactivity if a representative sample of the waste has any of the following\nproperties: (i) it is normally unstable and\nreadily undergoes violent change without detonating; (ii)\nit reacts violently with\nwater; (iii)\nit forms potentially\nexplosive mixtures with water; (iv)\nwhen mixed with water, it generates toxic gases, vapors or fumes in a quantity\nsufficient to present a danger to human health or the environment; (v) it is a cyanide or sulfide-bearing waste\nwhich, when exposed to pH conditions between 2 and 12.5, can generate toxic\ngases, vapors or fumes in a quantity sufficient to present a danger to human\nhealth or the environment; (vi)\nit\nis capable of detonation or explosive reaction if it is subjected to a strong\ninitiating source or if heated under confinement; (vii)\nit is readily capable of detonation or\nexplosive decomposition or reaction at standard temperature and pressure; and\n(viii)\nit is a forbidden\nexplosive as defined in\n49 CFR\n173.54, or is a division 1.1, 1.2 or 1.3\nexplosive as defined in\n49 CFR\n173.50\nand\n173.53\n(see section 370.1[e] of this Title). (2)\nA solid waste that exhibits the\ncharacteristic of reactivity has the EPA hazardous waste number of\nD003. (e) Toxicity\ncharacteristic. (1)\n\nExcept as provided\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, a solid waste exhibits the\ncharacteristic of toxicity if, using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching\n\nProcedure, test method 1311 in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\"EPA publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference\nin section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, the extract from a representative sample of the waste contains any of\nthe contaminants listed in Table 1 at a concentration equal to or greater than\nthe respective value given in that table. Where the waste contains less than\n0.5 percent filterable solids, the waste itself, after filtering using the\nmethodology outlined in method 1311, is considered to be the extract for the\npurpose of this subdivision. (i) Manufactured\ngas plant (MGP) related remediation waste exhibiting the toxicity\ncharacteristic for benzene is not a hazardous waste based on toxicity if the\nfollowing conditions are met: (a) The\nremediation wastes are from former MGP sites being remediated under a\ndepartment order, agreement or State assistance contract, or under the\noversight of the EPA; (b) The\nremediation waste is soil or sediment contaminated with coal tar related\nresiduals that will be thermally treated (as in a combustion boiler unit or in\na thermal desorber) at an off-site facility permitted to receive non-hazardous\ncontaminated soil or at an on-site facility. MGP site remediation waste meeting\nthe applicability requirements that is being sent out of state must comply with\nthe rules and regulations of the receiving state; and\n(c) This exemption does not apply to coal tar\ncontaminated materials which contain significant quantities of purifier wastes\nor any quantity of other hazardous wastes. A significant quantity of purifier\nwaste is defined as any quantity that would cause the MGP site remediation\nwaste mixture, sent for thermal treatment, to contain in excess of 3.5 percent\nsulfur by weight.
