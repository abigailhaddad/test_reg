  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-6.4 - Procedure at end of initial operating period\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Determination of net income or deficit. Inasmuch as account 1470.3, Net Deficit or (Income), will operate as a control\naccount, in accordance with the procedures described in sections 1642-3.8 and\n1642-3.9, the balance of account\n1470.3, as of the date of substantial completion, will automatically reflect, after all adjustments are made for income and expense applicable to the initial\noperating period, the net deficit or income resulting from the operation of the\nproject proper during the initial operating period. When the date of\nsubstantial completion, as concurred in by the commissioner, has been\ndetermined and the adjustments for income and expense as of the date of\nsubstantial completion made, a journal voucher shall be prepared closing the\nsubsidiary income accounts (3000 group) and expense accounts (4000 group)\nindividually. The difference between the sums of the debits to the income\naccounts and the credits to the expense accounts will appear as a balancing\nfigure on the voucher and shall agree with the balance of the control, account\n1470.3. (b) Allocation of prepaid\nexpense, inventories, and payables. After the net income or deficit for the\ninitial operating period has been determined, it may be found that prepaid\nexpenses, as of the date of substantial completion, may have been paid out of\nthe development fund but are applicable to the operating period and that a\ntransfer of funds from the administration fund to the development fund will be\nin order, or vice versa, that prepaid expenses may have been paid out of the\nadministration fund but are applicable to the development period, etc. Similar\nsituations may arise with respect to inventories (such as for fuel and paint\nsupplies) reflected in the balance sheet, accounts payable and accrued\npayables. The local agency shall prepare a schedule analyzing and allocating\nsuch items as between the development and administration funds so that it will\nbe in a position to make the proper transfer of funds. The schedule should also\ntake into account the possible reimbursement of the development fund for such\nitems as petty cash and change funds established therefrom. (c) Transfer of funds. (1)\n\nAt the end of the initial operating\nperiod, a transfer of funds shall be made, by means of an account payable\nvoucher drawn on the appropriate fund, from the development fund to the\nadministration fund, or vice versa, as the case may be, which shall reflect the\nfollowing: (i) Advances made by the\ndevelopment fund to the administration fund. (ii)\n\nNet income or deficit for the initial\noperating period. (iii)\n\nAllocation\nof prepaid expenses, inventories, and payables. (iv)\n\nReimbursement for petty cash and change\nfunds. (2)\n\nThe amount to\nbe transferred shall be determined immediately after the end of the initial\noperating period and the transfer shall be made as soon as funds are available. The amount transferred or to be transferred, may, however, be subject to\nadjustment as a result of the audit of the initial operating period which will\nbe made by the division as soon as practicable after the end of the\nperiod. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-6.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
