  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-26.6 - Allocation of initial sample size to survey unit and class\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Determine\ntotal cost units as follows: (1)\n\nFor each\nsurvey unit in a special assessing unit multiply the number of parcels in each\nsample class by the class cost factor and sum to the survey unit level. Also, for New York City sum to the citywide level. (2)\n\nFor all survey units not within a special\nassessing unit, multiply the number of parcels in each sample class by the\nclass cost factor and the corresponding class difficulty index and sum to the\nsurvey unit level. (3)\n\nSample class\ncost factors are: Sample Class\n\nSample Class Cost\n\nFactor\n1A and 1B\n1.25\n2A and 2B\n4.00\n4\n3.30\nA\n1.30\nB\n2.90\nC\n1.20\n(b) Determine initial sample cost units. (1)\n\nFor each survey unit, calculate the\nsquare root of the total cost units for the survey unit, add 25 and then\nmultiply by the appropriate cost unit workload adjustment factor. In addition\nfor New York City, determine the initial sample cost units by summing the\nproducts to a citywide level. (2)\n\nCost unit workload adjustment factors are: Cost Unit Workload\n\nAdjustment Factor\n\nNew York City\n1.30\n\nNassau County\n0.50\n\nAll other municipalities\n0.82\n(c) Determine tentative class sample size. (1)\n\nFor survey units in special assessing\nunits. (i) Determine the estimated market\nvalue of each sample class by dividing the assessed value of the class by the\nappropriate adjusted class market value ratio, computed from a prior survey and\nadjusted by the cumulative change in level of assessment from the base year\nroll of the prior survey to the base year roll of the current survey. Use the\nclass 1 adjusted class market value ratio for classes 1A and 1B and the class 2\nadjusted class market value ratio for classes 2A and 2B. (ii)\n\nDetermine a survey unit class difficulty\nfactor for each sample class by multiplying the estimated market value of the\nclass, calculated in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, by the class reldev. For New York City there is a class reldev for each survey unit class and for\n\nNassau County there is a set of class reldevs for the cities and a set of class\nreldevs for the towns. (iii)\n\nDetermine a survey unit weighted difficulty factor for each sample class by\nmultiplying each survey unit class difficulty factor, calculated in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, by the square root of the class cost\nfactor and summing the products to a survey unit level. In addition, for New\n\nYork City determine a citywide weighted difficulty factor by summing the\nproducts to a citywide level. (iv)\n\nDetermine, for the survey unit, the tentative sample size for each sample class\nby dividing the survey unit class difficulty factor, calculated in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, by the square root of the class cost factor and then\ndividing the resulting quotient by the survey unit weighted difficulty factor, calculated in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. This result is then\nmultiplied by the survey unit initial sample cost units and rounded to the\nnearest integer. (v) For New York\n\nCity, two additional calculations are required: (a) Divide the survey unit class difficulty\nfactor, calculated in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, by the square root\nof the class cost factor and then divide the resulting quotient by the citywide\nweighted difficulty factor, calculated in subparagraph (iii). This result is\nthen multiplied by the special assessing unit initial sample cost units and\nrounded to the nearest integer. (b) Average the sample class tentative sample size obtained in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph with the sample class tentative\nsample size obtained in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. The quotient is\nrounded to the nearest integer. (2)\n\nFor all survey units exclusive of those\nin special assessing units. (i) Determine the\nsurvey unit class difficulty factor for each sample class by multiplying the\nassessed value of the sample class by the class estimated reldev, and dividing\nthe product by the appropriate indexed class ratio. (ii)\n\nDetermine the survey unit weighted\ndifficulty factor by multiplying each survey unit class difficulty factor, calculated in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, by the square root of the\nclass cost factor and summing the products to a survey unit level. (iii)\n\nDetermine for the survey unit the\ntentative sample size for each sample class by dividing the survey unit class\ndifficulty factor, calculated in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, by the\nsquare root of the class cost factor and dividing the resulting quotient by the\nsurvey unit weighted difficulty factor calculated in subparagraph (ii) and\nmultiplying the result by the survey unit initial sample cost units. Round the\nresults to the nearest integer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8186-26.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
