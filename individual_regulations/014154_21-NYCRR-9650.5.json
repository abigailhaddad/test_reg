Tit. 21 § 9650.5 - Procedure for making requests; responses to request\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any request to inspect and/or copy\nrecords shall be made in writing and addressed to the records access officer. The request shall reasonably describe the record or records sought and shall, whenever possible, supply information regarding dates, file designations or\nother information which will enable the records access officer to identify the\nrecords sought. (b) Within five\nbusiness days or receipt of a request, the records access officer shall respond\nto the request: (1)\n\nIf it is determined that\nthe request should be granted, the records access officer shall so notify the\nrequesting party in a writing which states the time and place at which the\nrequested record may be inspected and the procedures and fees for copying of\nrecords. (2)\n\nIf it is determined\nthat the requested records are exempt from disclosure under the terms of the\n\nFreedom of Information Law and that the request should be denied, the records\naccess officer shall so notify the requesting party in a writing which states\nthe ground for the denial. (3)\n\nIf a\nrequest does not adequately describe the records sought, the records access\nofficer shall notify the requesting party in writing that his request has been\ndenied, stating the reasons why the request does not meet the requirements of\nthis section and extending to the requesting party an opportunity to confer\nwith the records access officer in order to attempt to reformulate the request\nin a manner that will enable the agency to identify the records\nsought. (4)\n\nIf a requested record\ndoes not exist, has been destroyed or otherwise disposed of, the records access\nofficer shall so notify the requesting party in writing. (5)\n\nIf it is determined that a request should\nbe granted in part and denied in part, the records access officer shall so\nnotify the requesting party in a writing which sets forth the information\nrequired by paragraphs (1)-(4), of this subdivision as applicable. (6)\n\nEach writing denying a request in whole\nor in part shall inform the requesting party of his right to appeal the\ndetermination within 30 days and shall state the name of the person or body\ndesignated to hear such appeals. Such person or body shall be identified by\nname, title, business address and telephone number. (c) If the authority is unable to determine\nwithin five business days whether to grant, deny or otherwise respond to a\nrequest for inspection and copying, the records access officer shall, within\nsuch five-day period, acknowledge receipt of the request in writing to the\nrequesting party, stating the approximate date by which a determination with\nrespect to the request will be made. If the authority does not make a\ndetermination with respect to the request within 10 business days from the date\nof such acknowledgement, the request may be construed as a denial of access and\nan appeal may be taken to the person or body designated to hear\nappeals. (d) To prevent unwarranted\ninvasions of personal privacy, the authority, in making records available for\ninspection and copying, may delete identifying details or may withhold records\notherwise available, if deletion of identifying details is impracticable or\nwill not, in fact, prevent an unwarranted invasion of the privacy of the person\nto whome the record refers. An unwarranted invasion of privacy includes, but is\nnot limited to: (1)\ndisclosure of employment, medical or credit histories or personal references of applicants for\nemployment; or\n(2)\ndisclosure of\nitems involving the medical or personal records of a client or patient in a\nmedical facility; or\n(3)\nsale or\nrelease of lists of names and addresses if such lists would be used for\ncommercial or fund-raising purposes; or\n(4)\ndisclosure of information of a personal\nnature when disclosure would result in economic or personal hardship to the\nsubject party and such information is not relevant to the work of the\nauthority; or\n(5)\ndisclosure of\ninformation of a personal nature reported in confidence to the authority and\nwhich is not relevant to the ordinary work of the authority.
