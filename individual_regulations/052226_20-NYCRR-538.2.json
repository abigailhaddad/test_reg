  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 538.2 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1142-A(g), (i), (j), (k)\n(a) Applicability. Parking facility operators which provide parking services\nin New York County (Manhattan) are subject to the special requirements imposed\nby section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this\n\nPart. (b) Hardship. (1)\nA parking facility\noperator may apply to the department for an exemption from complying with some\nor all of the provisions of this Part and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law. The application\nshall be submitted on the form prescribed by the department for such purpose to\nthe Audit Division-Sales Tax Bureau, Building 9, W. A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. The\noperator shall keep a copy of such application and any response from the\ndepartment regarding the application, for a period of at least three years, as\ndescribed in section\n538.4\n(g) of this Part, as part of the additional records required to be kept by section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part. To\nbe granted such an exemption, the operator must demonstrate that: (i) the operator has limited annual\nliability; and\n(ii)\nthe provisions\nof section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part\ncreate undue hardship for the operator. (2)\n\nWhere the department grants any such\nexemption, the department will specify the period of time for which such\nexemption is granted. The department may grant any such exemption for a limited\nperiod of time. The department may impose such other recordkeeping requirements\nin lieu of some or all of the requirements exempted under this subdivision as\nthe department finds necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of\narticles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law, and which permit the department to determine\naccurately the parking facility operator's tax liability. Any such other\nnecessary records shall be kept for a period of at least three years as\ndescribed in section\n538.4\n(g) of this Part, as part of the additional records required to be kept by this\n\nPart and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law. (3)\n\nWhere a parking facility operator's\nannual sales and use tax liability under articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law\nreaches or exceeds $25,000 in any 12-month period, or can reasonably be\nexpected to reach or exceed $25,000 in any such 12-month period, on an\nannualized basis, then any exemption granted under this subdivision to such\noperator shall automatically terminate as of the last day of the sales tax\nquarter (the last day of either February, May, August or November) immediately\nfollowing the quarter in which such liability reaches or exceeds, or can\nreasonably be expected to reach or exceed, $25,000, on an annualized basis. Such operator shall then be required to comply with the provisions of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part on\nand after the first day of the sales tax quarter immediately succeeding the\ndate of termination of exemption. (4)\n\nThe department may terminate or modify\nany exemption granted by the department under this subdivision if: (i) information which the parking facility\noperator provided to the department prior to the date such exemption was\ngranted was inaccurate or incomplete; or\n(ii)\nthe department believes that collection\nof any liability for tax, penalty or interest due from the parking facility\noperator which received an exemption under this subdivision is in\njeopardy. (5)\n(i) If the department finds that the\nfinancial condition of a parking facility operator to which the department has\ngranted an exemption under this subdivision has significantly changed, the\ndepartment may modify or terminate the exemption granted. (ii)\n\nAction may be taken by the department\nunder subparagraph (i) of this paragraph only if: (a) notice of such finding is provided to the\nparking facility operator no later than 30 days prior to the date of such\naction; and\n(b) such notice\nincludes the reasons why the department believes a significant change in the\nfinancial condition of the parking facility operator has occurred. (6)\n\nThe department may\nmodify or terminate an exemption granted by the department under this\nsubdivision in the case of the failure of the parking facility operator: (i) to comply with the provisions of articles\n28 and 29 of the Tax Law or of this Part; (ii)\nto pay any tax liability at the time\nsuch liability is due; or\n(iii)\nto\nfurnish additional information relating to the operator's responsibilities and\nliabilities under such articles 28 and 29 and this Part, as requested by the\ndepartment. (7)\n(i) In determining whether undue hardship has\nbeen shown, a principal factor to be taken into consideration is the amount of\nthe cost to the operator of meeting the requirements of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part. Whether the costs of meeting such requirements create an undue hardship for a\nparking facility operator where the operator is a member of an affiliated group\nof persons shall be considered with regard to whether the costs of meeting such\nrequirements create such a hardship for such group as a whole. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, a\nparking facility operator is a member of an affiliated group of persons where\nthe operator is: (a) (1)\na corporation which is a member of an\naffiliated group of corporations, as such term\naffiliated group of\ncorporations\nis used in paragraph (28) of subdivision (a) of section\n1115\nof the Tax Law read without regard to\nthe exception for clause (ii) of subparagraph (6) of paragraph (b) of\nsubdivision (17) of section\n208\nof the\n\nTax Law; or\n(2)\na partnership in\nwhich one or more members of an affiliated group of corporations (as described\nin subclause [\n1\n] of this clause) have, directly or indirectly, at least a 50 percent capital or profits interest; (b) a partnership where any other person or\npersons (other than a corporation which is a member of an affiliated group of\ncorporations as described in clause [\na\n] of this subparagraph)\nhaving, directly or indirectly, at least a 50 percent capital or profits\ninterest in such partnership are themselves parking facility\noperators; (c) a partnership which\nhas, directly or indirectly, at least a 50 percent capital or profits interest\nin any other parking facility operator or owns, directly or indirectly, at\nleast 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of any corporation which is\na parking facility operator; (d) a\nperson which has, directly or indirectly, at least a 50 percent beneficial\ninterest in an estate or trust which is a parking facility operator; (e) an estate or trust which has, directly or\nindirectly, at least a 50 percent capital or profits interest in any other\nparking facility operator or owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 percent\nin value of the outstanding stock of any corporation which is a parking\nfacility operator; (f) an\nindividual whose sibling, parent, spouse, or child or grandchild (whether or\nnot adopted), or any combination of them, is either a parking facility operator\nor has, directly or indirectly, at least a 50 percent or more capital or\nprofits interest in a parking facility, or owns, directly or indirectly, at\nleast 50 percent in value of the outstanding stock of any corporation which is\na parking facility operator; or\n(g) a corporation where: (1)\nat least 50 percent\nin value of the outstanding stock thereof is directly or indirectly owned\nsolely by an individual or by an individual and the individual's sibling, parent, spouse, or child or grandchild (whether or not adopted), or any\ncombination of them; and\n(2)\nthe\nindividual or the individual's sibling, parent, spouse, or child or grandchild\n(whether or not adopted), or any combination of them, has, directly or\nindirectly, at least a 50 percent or more capital or profits interest in a\nparking facility operator, or owns, directly or indirectly, at least 50 percent\nin value of the outstanding stock of any corporation which is a parking\nfacility operator; or\n(h) a person which is created or acts in\npursuance of a plan having as a principal purpose the evasion of tax under\narticle 28 or 29 of the Tax Law or the avoidance or evasion of compliance with\nthe provisions of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law or this Part. Example 1: A Corp. operates a parking facility in Manhattan. B Corp. owns 100 percent of the stock of A Corp., as well as 100 percent of the stock\nof C Corp. Neither B Corp. nor C Corp. is a parking facility operator. Since A\nand C Corps. are wholly owned subsidiaries of B Corp., A, B and C Corps. are\nall members of an affiliated group of corporations. As such, they are members\nof an affiliated group of persons. If A Corp. has limited annual liability and\napplies to the department for exemption under this subdivision, the department\nwill consider whether the costs for A Corp. to comply with the requirements of\nsection\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part\ncreate undue hardship for the group A, B and C Corps. as a whole, pursuant to\nclause (7)(ii)(\na\n) of this subdivision. It does not matter that\nB and C Corp. are not parking facility operators themselves, since A, B and C\nCorps. are members of an affiliated group of corporations, as described in\nclause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. Example 2: The BMK Partnership operates a parking facility in\n\nManhattan. B, M and K are individuals. B has a 25 percent profits interest in\nBMK and also operates, herself, a parking facility in Manhattan. M also owns a\n25 percent profits interest in BMK and owns 100 percent of a corporation which\noperates a parking facility in Manhattan. K owns the remaining 50 percent\nprofits interest in BMK. K does not own or operate any parking facility. BMK is\nnot a member of an affiliated group of persons for the following reasons: B, herself an operator, owns less than a 50 percent profits interest in the BMK\nPartnership. M also owns less than a 50 percent profits interest in BMK. K, the\nonly owner of at least a 50 percent profits interest in the BMK Partnership, is\nnot himself an operator. Thus, if BMK has limited annual liability and applies\nfor a hardship exemption under this subdivision, the department will consider\nonly whether BMK's costs of complying with the requirements of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part\ncreate an undue hardship for BMK, and will not consider whether such costs\ncreate an undue hardship for BMK together with any of its partners. Example 3: A-1 Partnership owns 80 percent of the capital and profits\ninterest in B Partnership. B Partnership owns 70 percent of the stock of C\nCorp. A-1 Partnership and C Corp. each separately operate a parking facility in\n\nManhattan, but B Partnership does not operate any parking facility. For\npurposes of this subdivision, A-1 Partnership indirectly owns 56 percent of the\nstock of C Corp. through its 80 percent interest in B Partnership which owns 70\npercent of the stock of C Corp. (80 percent × 70 percent). Thus, A-1\n\nPartnership and C Corp., each a parking facility operator, are members of an\naffiliated group of persons. If either A-1 Partnership or C Corp. has limited\nannual liability and applies for an exemption under this subdivision, the costs\nto comply with the requirements of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part of\nthe operator which makes the exemption application will be considered with\nregard to whether such costs create an undue hardship for A-1 Partnership and C\nCorp. together. Example 4: P owns and operates four parking facilities in Manhattan. P\ngives or sells a facility to each of P's three children, C1, C2 and C3. C2 has\nlimited annual liability and applies for a hardship exemption. P, C1, C2 and C3\nare members of an affiliated group of persons, pursuant to clause (7)(ii)(\nf\n) of this subdivision. Thus, the department will consider\nwhether the costs for C2 to comply will create an undue hardship for the group\n(P, C1, C2 and C3) as a whole. Example 5: H and W, husband and wife, own five parking facilities in\n\nManhattan designated as F1, F2, F3, F4 and F5. They transfer facility F1 to CH\nCorp., a corporation wholly owned by H. They transfer facility F2 to CW Corp., a corporation wholly owned by W. They transfer facility F3 to their two\nchildren, Bill & Sue, who form the BillSue Partnership as equal partners to\noperate F3. They transfer facility F4 to H's brother, HB, who transfers it to X\nCorp. in exchange for 30 percent of the outstanding stock of X Corp. The\nremaining 70 percent of X Corp. stock is owned by unrelated persons. HB does\nnot operate any parking facility himself. H & W transfer facility F5 to the\nPQ Partnership pursuant to a secret arrangement whereby PQ will operate F5\nmerely as nominees for H and W, so that H and W will receive the income and\nother benefits of ownership from F5. CH Corp., CW Corp., BillSue Partnership\nand PQ Partnership are members of an affiliated group of persons, but HB and X\nCorp. are not members of the group. CH Corp. and CW Corp. are corporations\nwhich each operate a parking facility where at least 50 percent of the value of\nthe outstanding stock in each corporation is owned by spouses, pursuant to\nclause (7)(ii)(\ng\n) of this subdivision. BillSue Partnership is\na member of the group because at least 50 percent of either the capital or\nprofits interest in the partnership is owned by the child of an individual who\nowns at least 50 percent of the value of the outstanding stock of a corporation\nwhich is an operator, pursuant to clause (\ng\n) of this\nsubdivision. Bill and Sue are the children of H & W who own at least 50\npercent of the value of the outstanding stock in CH Corp. and CW Corp., respectively. PQ Partnership is a member of the group because a principal\npurpose of the transfer of F5 to PQ Partnership was for H & W to evade\ncomplying with the requirements of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this Part, pursuant to clause (7)(ii)(\nh\n) of this subdivision, since H\n& W receive the benefit of ownership of F5. HB is not a member since he\ndoes not operate a parking facility himself. X Corp. is not a member of the\naffiliated group, since HB, H' s brother, does not own at least 50 percent of\nthe value of the outstanding stock of X Corp., and the 70 percent balance of X\nCorp. stock is not owned by any member of the group or any person whose\nownership would make the person a member of the group. If H, W, Bill or Sue or\nCH Corp. or CW Corp. or BillSue Partnership, or any combination of them, owned\nat least 20 percent of X Corp.'s stock, then their holdings, combined with HB's\nholdings of X Corp. stock, would constitute at least 50 percent of the value of\nX Corp.'s stock and X Corp. would be a member of the group with CH Corp., CW\nCorp., BillSue Partnership and PQ Partnership. (c) Exemption\nfrom requirements. (1)\n\nAn organization\ndescribed in section\n1116\nof the Tax Law which is also a parking\nfacility operator is exempt from the requirements of section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nHowever, where any other\nperson operates a parking facility for or on behalf of an organization\ndescribed in section\n1116\nof the Tax Law, such other person\nshall not be exempt from the requirements imposed by section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law and this\n\nPart.
