Tit. 18 § 366.5 - Need standards and allowances\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The amount of the child assistance\nbenefit will be established by the Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget. The maximum\nbenefit a CAP household must receive is dependent upon the number of children\nparticipating in CAP and the district in which the family is residing. Districts are separated into three different categories: Category A, Category B\nand Category C. The maximum benefits and districts which comprise each category\nare: Maximum Monthly CAP Benefits\n\nNumber of CAP Children\n\nCategory A\nCategory B\nCategory C\n1\n$390\n$350\n$280\n2\n$483\n$443\n$373\n3\n$576\n$536\n$466\n4\n$670\n$630\n$560\n5\n$763\n$723\n$653\n6\n$856\n$816\n$746\n7\n$950\n$910\n$840\n\nThe districts in each category are: Category A districts\n\nNassau, Rockland, Suffolk and Westchester. Category B districts\n\nBroome, Delaware, Dutchess, Genesee, Jefferson, Monroe, New York City, Onondaga, Ontario, Orange, Orleans, Otsego, Putnam, Seneca, Sullivan, Tioga, Tompkins, Ulster, Warren and Wayne.

(b) The Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance may develop a benefit methodology which will provide for the\nperiodic adjustment of the benefit level to reflect changes in maximum monthly\ngrants and allowances in the FA program. Under the methodology the office has\ndeveloped, the earned and unearned income of a CAP household is applied against\nthe maximum CAP benefit as described in subdivision (a) of this section to\ndetermine eligibility and benefit amount. (c) Unearned income of a CAP household is\nfully applied against the maximum benefit when determining eligibility and\nbenefit amount. (d) Earned income\nof a CAP household is applied against the maximum benefit after first\ndisregarding a percentage of the earnings. When more than one CAP filing unit\nmember has earned income, the amount of earned income must be combined before\ndisregarding a percentage of the earnings. The percentage of earnings\ndisregarded is 90 percent up to the 1989 monthly poverty level of the CAP\nhousehold and 33 percent above the 1989 monthly poverty level of the CAP\nhousehold. Notes\nN.Y.
