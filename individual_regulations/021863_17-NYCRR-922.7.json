  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 922.7 - Inspection of interior of boiler\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Time of inspection. The interior of every boiler and steam reservoir shall be\nthoroughly inspected before it is put into service and whenever a sufficient\nnumber of flues are removed to allow examination. (b) Flues to be removed. All flues of boilers\nin service, except as otherwise provided, shall be removed at least once every\nfour years, and a thorough examination shall be made of the entire interior of\nthe boiler. After flues are taken out, the inside of the boiler must be\nthoroughly cleaned, all scale being completely removed. This period for the\nremoval of flues may be extended by the commissioner upon application if an\ninvestigation shows that conditions warrant it. (c) Method of inspection. The entire interior\nof the boiler or steam reservoir must then be examined for cracks, pitting, grooving, or indications of overheating, and for damage where mud has collected\nor heavy scale formed. The edges of plates, all laps, seams, and points where\ncracks and defects are likely to develop or which an exterior examination may\nhave indicated, must be given an especially minute examination. It must be seen\nthat braces and stays are taut, that pins are properly secured in place, and\nthat each is in condition to support its proportion of the load. (d) Repairs. Any boiler or steam reservoir\ndeveloping cracks in the barrel shall be taken out of service at once, thoroughly repaired, and reported to be in satisfactory condition before it is\nreturned to service. (e) Lap joint\nseams. Every boiler or steam reservoir having lap joint longitudinal seams\nwithout reinforcing plates shall be examined with special care to detect\ngrooving or cracks at the edges of the seams. (f) Fusible plugs. If boilers are equipped\nwith fusible plugs they shall be removed and cleaned of scale at least once\nevery month. Their removal must be noted on the report of inspection.
