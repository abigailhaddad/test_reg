  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 223.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Part, the general definitions of Part 200 of this Title shall\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nPart, the following definitions will also apply: (1)\n\nAfterburner. A catalytic and/or thermal\ncombustion device used to control air contaminant emissions. (2)\n\nCoke burn-off. The coke removed from the\nsurface of the fluid catalytic cracking unit catalyst by combustion in the\ncatalyst regenerator. (3)\n\nComponent. Any piece of equipment which has the potential to leak volatile\norganic compounds when tested in the manner described in section\n223.10\n(c) of this\n\nPart. These include, but are not limited to, pump seals, compressor seals, seal\noil degassing vents, pipeline valves, flanges and other connections, pressure\nrelief devices, process drains, and open-ended pipes. Excluded from these are\nvalves which are not externally regulated. (4)\n\nFuel gas. Gas generated at a petroleum\nrefinery or any gas generated by a refinery process unit, which is combusted\nseparately or in any combination with any type of natural gas. Fuel gas does\nnot include gases generated by catalytic cracking unit catalyst regenerators\nand fluid coking burners. (5)\n\nFuel\ngas combustion device. Any equipment, such as process heaters, boilers and\nflares, used to combust fuel gas, except facilities in which gases are\ncombusted to produce sulfur or sulfuric acid. (6)\n\nGas service. Any equipment which\nprocesses, transfers or contains a volatile organic compound or mixture of\nvolatile organic compounds in the gaseous phase. (7)\n\nHot well. The collection container for\ncondensed volatile organic compounds. (8)\n\nLight petroleum compound. A petroleum\nderivative for which the temperature at 10 percent recovery is lower than 205°\nC when tested in accordance with ASTM D86, Standard Method for Distillation of\n\nPetroleum Products. (9)\n\nLiquid\nservice. Any equipment which processes, transfers or contains a volatile\norganic compound or mixture of volatile organic compounds in the liquid\nphase. (10)\n\nNoncondensate vapors. Gases removed from process units by a vacuum producing system. As used in this\n\nPart, the term applies to the portion of volatile organic compounds which have\nnot become liquid in condensers. (11)\n\nPetroleum. The oil removed from the\nearth and the oil derived from tar sands, shale and coal. (12)\n\nPetroleum refinery. Any facility engaged\nin producing gasoline, aromatics, kerosene, distillate fuel oils, residual fuel\noils, lubricants, asphalt, or other products through distillation of petroleum\nor through redistillation, cracking, rearrangement or reforming of unfinished\npetroleum derivatives. (13)\n\nProcess\ngas. Any gas generated by a petroleum refinery process unit, except fuel gas\nand process upset gas as defined in this section. (14)\n\nProcess unit turnaround. The process of\nshutdown, inspection, repair and start-up of reactors, fractionators, or other\nprocess units. (15)\n\nProcess upset\ngas. Any gas generated by a petroleum refinery process unit as a result of a\nstart-up, shut-down, upset or malfunction. (16)\n\nRefinery process unit. A set of\ncomponents which are a part of a basic process operation, such as distillation, hydrotreating, cracking or reforming of hydrocarbons. (17)\n\nVacuum producing systems. Equipment used\nto produce and maintain a vacuum in petroleum refinery process equipment as\nsteam ejectors which contact condensers or surface condensers and mechanical\nvacuum pumps. (18)\n\nValves not\nexternally regulated. Valves that have no external controls, such as in-line\ncheck valves. (19)\n\nWastewater\nseparators. Equipment used to separate oils and water from locations downstream\nof process drains. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n223.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
