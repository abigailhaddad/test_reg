  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.21 - Exhibit 21: geology, seismology and soils\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 21 shall contain: A study of the geology, seismology, and soils impacts of\nthe facility consisting of the identification and mapping of existing\nconditions, an impact analysis, and proposed impact avoidance and mitigation\nmeasures, including: (a) a map\ndelineating existing slopes (0-3 percent, 3-8 percent, 8-15 percent, 15-25\npercent, 25-35 percent, 35 percent and over) on and within the drainage area\npotentially influenced by the facility site and interconnections; (b) a proposed site plan showing existing and\nproposed contours at two-foot intervals, for the facility site and\ninterconnections, at a scale sufficient to show all proposed buildings, structures, paved and vegetative areas, and construction areas; (c) a description and preliminary calculation\nof the quantity of cut and fill necessary to construct the facility, including\nseparate calculations for topsoil, sub-soil and rock, and including a plan to\nidentify the presence of invasive species in spoil material and to prevent the\nintroduction and/or spread of invasive species by the transport of fill\nmaterial to or from the site of the facility or interconnections; (d) a description and preliminary calculation\nof the amount of fill, gravel, asphalt, and surface treatment material to be\nbrought in to the facility site and interconnections; (e) a description and preliminary calculation\nof the proposed type and amount of cut material or spoil to be removed from the\nfacility site and interconnections; (f) a description of excavation techniques to\nbe employed; (g) a delineation of\ntemporary cut or fill storage areas to be employed; (h) a description of the characteristics and\nsuitability for construction purposes of the material excavated for the\nfacility and of the deposits found at foundation level, including factors such\nas soil corrosivity, bedrock competence, and subsurface hydrologic\ncharacteristics; (i) a preliminary\nplan describing all blasting operations including location, minimum blasting\ncontractor qualifications, hours of blasting operations, estimates of amounts\nof rock to be blasted, warning measures, measures to ensure safe\ntransportation, storage and handling of explosives, use of blasting mats, conduct of a pre-blasting condition survey of nearby buildings and\nimprovements, and coordination with local safety officials; (j) an assessment of potential impacts of\nblasting to environmental features, above-ground structures and below-ground\nstructures such as pipelines and wells; (k) an identification and evaluation of\nreasonable mitigation measures regarding blasting impacts, including the use of\nalternative technologies and/or location of structures, and including a plan\nfor securing compensation for damages that may occur due to blasting; (l) a description of the regional geology, tectonic setting and seismology of the facility vicinity. (m) an analysis of the expected impacts of\nconstruction and operation of the facility with respect to regional geology, if\nsuch can be determined; (n) an\nanalysis of the impacts of typical seismic activity experienced in the facility\narea based on current seismic hazards maps, on the location and operation of\nthe facility identifying potential receptors in the event of failure, and if\nthe facility is proposed to be located near a young fault or a fault that has\nhad displacement in Holocene time, demonstration of a suitable setback from\nsuch fault; (o) a map delineating\nsoil types on the facility and interconnections sites; (p) a description of the characteristics and\nsuitability for construction purposes of each soil type identified above, including a description of the soil structure, texture, percentage of organic\nmatter, and recharge/infiltration capacity of each soil type and a discussion\nof any de-watering that may be necessary during construction and whether the\nfacility shall contain any facilities below grade that would require continuous\nde-watering; (q) maps, figures, and\nanalyses delineating depth to bedrock and underlying bedrock types, including\nvertical profiles showing soils, bedrock, water table, seasonal high\ngroundwater, and typical foundation depths on the facility site, and any area\nto be disturbed for roadways to be constructed and all off-site\ninterconnections required to serve the facility, including an evaluation for\npotential impacts due to facility construction and operation, including any\non-site wastewater disposal system, based on information to be obtained from\navailable published maps and scientific literature, review of technical studies\nconducted on and in the vicinity of the facility, and on-site field\nobservations, test pits and/or borings as available; (r) an evaluation to determine suitable\nbuilding and equipment foundations, including: (1)\na preliminary engineering assessment to\ndetermine the types and locations of foundations to be employed. The assessment\nshall investigate the suitability of such foundation types as spread footings, caissons, or piles, including a statement that all such techniques conform to\napplicable building codes or industry standards; (2)\nif piles are to be used, a description\nand preliminary calculation of the number and length of piles to be driven, the\ndaily and overall total number of hours of pile driving work to be undertaken\nto construct the facility, and an assessment of pile driving impacts on\nsurrounding properties and structures due to vibration; and\n(3)\nidentification of mitigation measures\nregarding pile driving impacts, if applicable, including a plan for securing\ncompensation for damages that may occur due to pile driving; and\n(s) an evaluation of the\nvulnerability of the facility site and the operation of the facility to an\nearthquake event and a tsunami event. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
