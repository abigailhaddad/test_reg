Tit. 6 § 245.5 - CSAPR SO[2] Group 1 New Unit Set-aside Allocations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For each control period, the department\nwill determine distributions of CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nallowances to any CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit in New York\n\nState that did not receive an allocation for the control period pursuant to\nsection\n245.3\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis part (including an allocation of zero allowances), in accordance with the\nfollowing procedures: (1)\n\nThe department will\nestablish a CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside\nallocation for each control period not to exceed five percent of the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 Budget set forth in section\n245.3\nof this part\n(2)\n\nOnly CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 units may receive CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances\nfrom the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside\nallocations established in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\nCSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nnew unit set-aside allowances may be transferred to CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 units for no more than eight consecutive\ncontrol periods, starting with the latter of the 2017 control period or the\ncontrol period during which the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit\ncommenced, or is projected to commence, operation and ending with the control\nperiod preceding the first control period for which the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit will receive an allocation pursuant to\nparagraph 245.3(b)(2) of this part. (4)\n\nThe designated representative of a CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit must submit a written request to the\ndepartment to reserve for the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit a\nnumber of CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances in the relevant\nCSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account in an\namount no greater than the number representing the unit's potential to emit. The reservation request must be submitted prior to January 1st of the control\nperiod to which the reservation request pertains. The department will not\nconsider any request for the reservation of CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside allowances submitted prior to the issuance of all\npermits and authorizations by the department that are necessary for operation\nof the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit. The reservation request\nmust include information detailing the potential to emit of the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit. (5)\n\nSubject to the number of CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances allocated to each new unit\nset-aside account, following department approval of the request for reservation\nof CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances, the department will\nreserve CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances in the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account before the start\nof the control period for which the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nunit will receive an allocation pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section in\nan amount no greater than the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit's\npotential to emit. (6)\n\nIf more than\none CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit requests the reservation of\nCSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances and the number of requested\nallowances exceeds the allocation to the relevant CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account, the department\nwill reserve CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances from the\naccount for the units in the order in which the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 units submitted approvable reservation\nrequests. For the purposes of this paragraph, requests will be considered\nsimultaneous if they are made in the same calendar quarter. Should approvable\nreservation requests in excess of the allocation to the relevant CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account be submitted in\nthe same calendar quarter by different CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nunits, the department will reserve CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nallowances for those units on a basis proportional to the number of CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances requested by each CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit. (7)\n\nBy July 1st of each year, the department\nwill submit a request to the Administrator, in a format prescribed by the\n\nAdministrator, to transfer reserved CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1\nallowances to the compliance account of the CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 source that includes the relevant CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 unit in an amount no greater than the number representing the unit's\npotential to emit. (8)\n\nAfter the\n\nAdministrator makes the deductions for compliance under\n40 CFR\n97.624\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this\ntitle) for a control period, the department will determine whether any CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances remain in the CSAPR\nSO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account for the control\nperiod. By the July 1st following the control period, the department will\ntransfer any remaining CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 allowances from\nthe CSAPR SO\n2\n\nGroup 1 new unit set-aside account to the\nEERET account. Allowances transferred to the EERET account will be available\nfor sale or other disposition in accordance with section\n245.6\nof this part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
