Tit. 20§ 450.2 - Determination of the need for an amount of bond or other security\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to the\napproval of an application for registration of a petroleum business or during\nany review of a registered petroleum business, the Tax Commission may require\nsuch petroleum business to file a bond or other security with such department. With its application for registration, and at any time subsequent to\nregistration upon the request of the Department of Taxation and Finance, a\npetroleum business must submit to the Department of Taxation and Finance: (1)\na current financial statement (balance\nsheet showing its financial condition with footnotes) independently certified\nby a licensed public accountant or certified public accountant pursuant to an\naudit by such accountant as to the reliability of such statement and, also as\nto the financial condition of such petroleum business; (2)\nits estimated annual tax liability\npursuant to article 13-A of the Tax Law; and\n(3)\nany other information, including a\ncurrent unqualified financial statement, the department may deem\nnecessary. (b) In\ndetermining the amount and the need for the requirement of a bond or other\nsecurity, the department will review the following: (1)\ncurrent financial statements\nindependently certified by a licensed public accountant or certified public\naccountant, with particular emphasis on the net worth (total assets less total\nliabilities) as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples; (2)\nany independent\ninformation concerning an applicant's or petroleum business's nature of\noperation, reliability, overall financial status or history of financial\nsolvency and stability; and\n(3)\nits\ncompliance record which will indicate any delinquencies in filing returns\nand/or payment of taxes due New York State for which the applicant or petroleum\nbusiness may be responsible. (c) Generally, if the net worth of a\npetroleum business is equal to or greater than one and one-half times the\nestimated tax liability for the current year computed on an annual basis due to\n\nNew York State pursuant to article 13-A of the Tax Law, a bond or other\nsecurity will not be required. Generally, if the net worth of a petroleum\nbusiness is less than one and one half times the estimated tax liability for\nthe current year computed on an annual basis due to New York State pursuant to\narticle 13-A of the Tax Law, a bond or other security may be required for the\ndifference between the net worth and such one and one-half times the estimated\ntax liability. For purposes of this calculation, net worth less than zero will\nnot be recognized. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subdivision relating\nto the financial condition of the applicant or petroleum business i.e.,net\nworth, etc.), the amount of bond or other security may be increased or\ndecreased or a bond or other security may be required at any time when such\namount or such bond or other security is necessary as a protection to the\nrevenues under article 13-A of the Tax Law. (d) (1)\n\nIf\nan applicant or a petroleum business fails to supply a current financial\nstatement as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section, the applicant will\nnot be registered or such petroleum business' registration will be cancelled. However, the Tax Commission, on petition, either through the hearing process or\non the motion of the Tax Commission, may waive the requirement for a\ncertification by a licensed public accountant or by a certified public\naccountant. If such requirement is waived, the Tax Commission may instead\nrequire alternative certification or require the applicant or petroleum\nbusiness to file a bond or other security in such amount as it deems\nappropriate, regardless of the net worth or financial status of the applicant\nor petroleum business. (2)\n\nIf an\napplicant or a petroleum business fails to supply any of the information\nrequired by paragraphs (a)(2) and (3) of this section, the applicant will not\nbe registered or such petroleum business' registration will be\ncancelled.
