(1)\nA person acting pursuant to law or\nregulation who submits any information to the Office of Mental Health may, at\nthe time of submission, request that the office except such information from\ndisclosure under section\n87\n(2)(d)\nof the Public Officers Law. This\nsection provides that an agency may deny access of records or portions thereof\nthat are trade secrets or are submitted to an agency by a commercial enterprise\nor derived from information obtained from a commercial enterprise and which, if\ndisclosed, would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the\nsubject enterprise. Where the request itself contains information which if\ndisclosed would defeat the purpose for which the exception is sought, such\ninformation shall be excepted from disclosure. (2)\n\nThe request for an exception shall be in\nwriting and state the reasons why the information should be excepted from\ndisclosure. (3)\n\nThe person\nsubmitting the information shall clearly identify those records or portions of\nrecords for which the exception is requested.

(2)\n\nThe\nappropriate office deputy commissioners or facility directors, or their\ndesignees, shall be responsible for the custody of such records. (3)\n\nEach employee who has custody of records\ncontaining trade secrets shall take appropriate measures to safeguard such\nrecords and to protect against their unauthorized disclosure. (4)\n\nSimple and effective devices to identify\nand maintain repositories for records containing trade secrets shall be used so\nthat their security is maintained.

Copies of such determination shall be served upon the\nperson, if any, requesting the record, the person who requested the exception, and the Committee on Open Government. (2)\n\nThe following factors are among those the\noffice may consider in making a determination to grant or continue an exception\nfrom disclosure under section\n87\n(2)(d)\nof the Public Officers Law: (i) any provisions of the Mental Hygiene Law\nor other law which authorize or restrict access to the records; (ii)\nwhether or not the records are trade\nsecrets or are submitted to an agency by a commercial enterprise or derived\nfrom information obtained from a commercial enterprise which, if disclosed, would cause substantial injury to the competitive position of the commercial\nenterprise; (iii)\nthe written\nrequest for an exception from disclosure and the reasons stated\ntherein; (iv)\nthe written\nstatement, if any, of the necessity for the granting or continuation of the\nexception from disclosure; (v) factors pertaining to determining whether or not a trade secret exists shall\ninclude, but not be limited to: (a) the extent\nto which the information is known outside of the business of the person or\nentity submitting the information; (b) the extent to which it is known by the\nperson's or entity's employees and others involved in the business; (c) the extent of measures taken by the\nperson or entity to guard the secrecy of the information; (d) the value of the information to the\nperson or entity and to competitors; (e) the amount of effort or money expended by\nthe person or entity in developing the information; and\n(f) the ease or difficulty with which the\ninformation can be properly acquired or duplicated by others; (vi)\nfactors pertaining to\ndetermining whether disclosure would cause substantial injury to the\ncompetitive position of the person or entity shall include but not be limited\nto: (a) the commercial value of the\ninformation to competitors; (b) the\ndamage which disclosure could cause to the submitting person or entity; and\n(c) whether and at what cost\nthe information can be obtained from other sources.
