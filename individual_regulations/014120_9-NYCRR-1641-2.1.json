CONTROL ACCOUNTS\nAccounts controlling income and expense applicable to\nthe operating period of the project proper shall be maintained in the general\nledger, as follows: Income Control\n\nThis account shall control all income applicable to the\noperating period of the project proper and shall be supported by the detailed\nincome accounts, in the 3000 group of accounts, the definitions of which will\nbe found immediately following those of the 1400 group of development cost\naccounts. 4000 Expense Control Account\n\nThis account shall control all expenses applicable to\nthe operating period of the project proper and shall be supported by the\ndetailed expense accounts in the 4000 and 6000 group of accounts, the\ndefinitions of which will be found immediately following those of the 3000\ngroup of detailed income accounts. The restriction of the use of the general ledger\ncontrol accounts defined above to income and expense applicable to the\noperating period of the project proper should be noted. Income and expense from\noperations during other phases of the local agency's program are capitalized\nand controlled by various development cost accounts. The latter are supported, as are the 3000 and 4000 Control Accounts defined above by detailed income and\nexpense accounts of the 3000, 4000 and 6000 groups, maintained in separate\nincome and expense analysis ledgers. See, for example, account 1420.4, Site\n\nIncome, and account 1420.5, Site Expense, for the control of income and expense\nfrom the operation of the site of the project proper prior to construction, account 1470.3, Net Deficit or (Income), for income and expense during the\ninitial operating period, and account 1440.16, Offsite Clearance, account\n1440.17, Rehabilitation, and account 1440.18, Relocation of Buildings, for the\nincome and expense of operations in connection with the related\nprograms. 1400 GROUP-DEVELOPMENT COSTS\n1410 Direct Costs\n(b) It is anticipated that questions and problems will\narise concerning the extent of the distribution and allocation of costs\nincluded in this group of accounts to the other development cost accounts and\nto the cost of the related programs. Small agencies, whose personnel and\nfacilities discharge multiple function and large agencies which maintain\ncentral offices and larger staffs making possible some separation of functions, will be faced with these problems in varying degrees. In general, for the\npurpose of simplicity, the secondary distribution of general overhead, service, and other direct costs from the 1410 group of accounts to the other development\ncost accounts or to the cost of related programs will not be required unless\nthe Subchapter, or the commissioner within his discretion specifically so\ndirects, or approval of the division has been obtained by the local agency for\na plan to serve as the basis of such distribution. It should be borne in mind\nthat the classification of development cost accounts is designed not only for\naccounting purposes, but also to serve as a basis for the preparation of\ndevelopment cost budgets, for executive control, and for compilation of\nfinancial statistics and reports, for which purposes an objective\nclassification of overhead costs such as is provided herein has many advantages\nover a functional classification of cost accounts involving secondary\ndistributions. Moreover, even from an accounting point of view, the practical\nand theoretical difficulties of an equitable distribution over the various\nphases of development and related programs proceeding simultaneously and, at\ntimes, in highly fluid states, should be considered. Many questions regarding\nthe classification and distribution of overhead expenditures (as well as other\nexpenditures) may be resolved by reference to the application for financial\nassistance and the approved development cost budget. Other questions should be\nreferred to the division. 1410.1 Payroll-Executive\n(a) This account shall include the salaries of\nexecutive employees whose services are certified by the local agency to be an\nexpense attributable to the planning, financing, construction, or operation\nduring the development period of a State-aided project, including related\nprograms. The term\nexecutive employees, as used\nin this Subchapter, includes but is not necessarily limited to the executive\nsecretary and staff, accountants, comptrollers, stenographers, typists, clerks, office-machine operators, switchboard operators, file clerks, messengers, errand boys, and similar employees. Do not include the salaries of such\nemployees attached to technical, legal, or informational staffs. (See accounts\n1410.2, 1410.4 and 1410.16.)\n1410.2 Payroll-Technical\n(a) This account shall include the salaries of\ntechnical employees of the local agency, including, but not limited to, engineers, architects, draftsmen, technical clerks, and stenographers, typists, secretaries, or other executive employees attached to the technical staff. Do\nnot include the salaries of employees comprising the inspection staff at the\nsite (see account 1430.7) or technical salaries for services (such as drawing\nthe actual construction plans) normally performed by other than agency\nemployees and covered by other classifications. (See account 1430.1.)\n(b) No distribution of charges made to this account to\nthe costs of related programs shall be made unless the division so directs or\napproves a plan to serve as the basis for such distribution. 1410.4 Legal Services and Expenses\n(a) This account shall include the compensation of\nattorneys, whether in the form of fees, retainers, or salaries, and necessary\nexpense in connection with the application for financial assistance, financing\nand re-financing, general legal advice and assistance, consultations, attendance at meetings, preparation of minutes, contracts and other legal\npapers and instruments, litigation, liquidated matters, and other legal\nservices and expenses not chargeable to other accounts. Do not include fees of\noutside bond counsel employed in connection with the temporary financing of\ndevelopment costs (see account 1410.14) or legal services or expenses in\nconnection with the acquisition of land, title examination, closing of title, condemnation proceedings, summary proceedings, or the collection of rents, which shall be charged to the appropriate accounts in the 1420 or 1440 groups, unless authority counsel is compensated on a flat retainer basis which, it will\nbe seen, will include the two latter types of services. (b) Where counsel for a local agency is compensated for\nordinary and usual legal services during the development period on a retainer\nbasis, the entire retainer shall be charged to this account, unless the\ndivision directs otherwise or approves a plan to serve as the basis of the\ndistribution of the retainer. The retainer agreement should be in writing, enumerating the services to be rendered by the attorney and the agreement\nshould be approved by the local agency and the contract submitted to the\ndivision for approval. Ordinary and usual legal services include, but are not\nlimited to general legal advice and assistance, consultations, attendance at\nmeetings, preparation of minutes, contracts, and other legal papers, documents\nand instruments, litigation, liquidated matters, summary proceedings, legal\nservices in connection with the application for financial assistance, and with\nfinancing operations. It is apparent that legal services and expenses in\nconnection with summary proceedings and collection of rents, if charged for\nseparately on a fee basis, will be charged to the appropriate accounts in the\n1420 or 1440 groups. A schedule of fees should be submitted to this office for\napproval. (c) For services other than ordinary and usual legal\nservices, such as in connection with the acquisition of land, title\nexamination, closing of title, condemnation proceedings, or any other services\nconcerning the business of the project which might require special treatment\nand the compensation for which is not included in the retainer, the charges\nshall be distributed to the appropriate development cost accounts (including\nthis account) and to the costs of the related programs. (d) Where compensation of agency counsel is wholly on a\nfee basis, the fees for ordinary and usual legal services shall be charged to\nthis account in the same manner that a retainer would be, and the fees for\nother than ordinary and usual legal services shall be charged to the\nappropriate development cost accounts (including this account) and to the costs\nof the related programs. (e) Where counsel is an employee of the local agency on\na salary basis, the distribution to the legal cost accounts and costs or\nrelated programs of legal salaries, including the salaries of secretaries, stenographers, typists, clerks, and other executive employees attached to the\nlegal staff, shall be on a timesheet or other basis approved by the\ndivision. 1410.5 Travel\n(b) No distribution or allocation of travel expense to\nother development cost accounts or to the costs of related programs shall be\nmade unless the division so directs or approves a plan to serve as the basis\nfor such distribution. (c) See \"Rules and Regulations Governing Traveling\n\nExpense Chargeable to State-aided Projects\", Subpart 1640-10. 1410.6 Rent-Office\n(a) This account shall include rent paid for space\nnecessary for the conduct of business in connection with the development of the\nproject and related programs. It shall also be charged with the cost, when paid\nby the local agency, of light, heat, moving of office furniture and equipment, alterations of office space, and leasehold improvements in connection with the\nestablishment and operation of the office. 1410.7 Furniture and\n\nFixtures-Office\n(b) Where separate offices are maintained in connection\nwith the management of site or offsite property prior to demolition, or for the\nrelocation of tenants, or for the use of field inspection staff, or in\nconnection with the offsite clearance, rehabilitation or relocation of\nbuildings programs, the original cost of furniture and fixtures required for\nthe separate offices shall be charged directly to the appropriate development\ncost accounts provided for the respective activities. No distribution or\nallocation of furniture and fixture costs to other development cost accounts, or to the cost of related programs shall otherwise be made, unless the division\nso directs or approves a plan to serve as a basis for such distribution or\nallocation. (c) Items charged to furniture and fixtures shall have\nan estimated useful life extending beyond the development period, and may be\nused for management or other purposes related to the development or operation\nof the project and related programs as the need arises. Within the prescribed\nlimitations, the original purposes and intended location for which the item was\npurchased shall determine to which account the charge shall be made. Subsequent\ntransfers to other purposes or locations shall not be reflected in the cost or\nexpense accounts. A physical inventory shall however be maintained of all items\ncharged to furniture and fixtures, which shall also furnish the current\nlocation and ultimate disposition of each item so charged. (d) In addition to the budgetary limitations governing\nexpenditures in general, purchases of items charged to furniture and fixtures\ncosting $100 or more shall require the separate prior approval of the\ndivision. (e) Bearing in mind that items having a relatively long\nlife may be needed for only a short time, consideration should be given to the\nadvantageous disposition of items when the need has passed and to the relative\nmerits of renting over purchasing. Proceeds from the sale of furniture and\nfixtures made prior or subsequent to the date of substantial completion shall\nbe credited to the account to which the item was originally charged, providing\nthe development costs accounts remain open for the receipt of such credit. Subsequent sales, shall be credited to account 3590, Miscellaneous Project\n\nIncome, unless the item sold is to be replaced, in which event, the proceeds\nshall be credited to the cost of replacement. 1410.8 Office Supplies and Sundry\n1410.9 Employees Retirement Fund\n(a) This account shall be charged with the amount of\nthe local agency's contributions to retirement or pension funds, in connection\nwith payrolls chargeable to development costs or to the costs of related\nprograms, except as hereinafter provided. No charge shall be made to this\naccount prior to the date of entry of the local agency into the retirement\nsystem. 1410.10 Communication Services\n1410.11 Photographs\n(b) Photographs similarly related to the progress of\nrelated programs (offsite clearance, rehabilitation, and relocation of\nbuildings) shall be charged directly to the appropriate cost accounts\nprovided. 1410.12 Fidelity Bonds and Insurance\n\nPremiums\n(a) This account shall be charged with the costs of\npremiums for fidelity bonds on officers and employees'; workmen's compensation\ninsurance covering members, officers, and employees of the local agency and the\n\nState's construction advisor, vehicles; fire insurance on office furniture, fixtures and equipment; public liability insurance with respect to office space\noccupied by the local agency; robbery and safe burglary insurance; costs of\narmored car service; and insurance of valuable and staffs; liability, fire, and\ntheft insurance on automobiles, including employees' papers, where carried by\nthe local agency. (d) No distribution or allocation of fidelity bond and\ninsurance premiums of the types chargeable to this account, to other\ndevelopment cost accounts or to the costs of related programs shall otherwise\nbe made unless the division so directs, or approves a plan to serve as the\nbasis of such distribution or allocation. While the number of types of\ninsurance chargeable to this account appears formidable, the premiums will be\nfound to be fairly nominal either individually, or in the aggregate, unless\nworkmen's compensation insurance on other than office and similar classes of\nemployees is involved. (e) Reference should be made to account 1420.3 for the\ncharging of other types of insurance carried by the local agency during the\ndevelopment period. 1410.13 Advertising\n(b) The cost of advertising in connection with the\nprocuring of bids for demolition and other contracts in connection with the\noffsite clearance, rehabilitation of buildings, or relocation of buildings\nprograms shall be charged directly to the appropriate cost accounts provided\nfor the respective activities. 1410.14 Fiscal Expense\n(a) This account shall be charged with the fees of\noutside bond counsel employed by the local agency in connection with the\nissuance of temporary loan notes to parties other than the State, the cost of\nadvertising, and other expenses in connection with temporary financing during\nthe development period.

It will be found that most such\namendments will be prepared by the local agency's own staff and that the costs\nof paper, printing, mimeographing, stationery, stenographic and typing\nservices, etc., will be absorbed and reflected in the other accounts of the\n1410 group. In general, therefore, only such costs or expenses as have been\nincurred on account of the application or amendments thereto, and which would\nnot have been incurred if there were no application or amendments thereto\nshould be charged to this account. (b) No distribution or allocation of application costs\nshall be made to the costs of related programs unless the division so\ndirects. (c) No overruns beyond the budgeted amount for this\nitem will be permitted without the prior approval of the division. 1420 Carrying Charges\n\nThis major group of cost accounts shall include\ninterest on indebtedness, taxes on property included within the project proper\nand the cost of specified types of insurance for the project proper during the\ndevelopment period; income and expense of operating the project proper prior to\nconstruction; the cost of issuing State housing bonds and the premium on the\nbonds, if any. 1420.1 Interest Expense\n(a) This account shall be charged with interest during\nthe development period on funds borrowed to finance the development of the\nproject proper, but such charges shall not be made beyond the date of\nsubstantial completion of the project proper. No further allocation of interest\ncharges for the development of the project proper shall be made to account\n1420.5 (Site Expense) or to the 1470 (Preoccupancy) group of accounts. (b) It should be noted that only that portion of the\ntotal interest charge incurred which is allocable to the development of the\nproject proper is charged to account 1420.1. Interest allocable to the related\nprograms (Offsite Clearance; Rehabilitation; Relocation of Buildings) is\ncharged to the development cost accounts provided for each program. See section\n1644-2.4\nof Part 1644 of this\n\nSubchapter, for details as to the basis of the interest allocation and as to\nthe cut-off points for the interest charges allocable to the respective related\nprograms. (c) Premiums of $100 or less on temporary loan note\nissues shall be credited directly to this account. Premiums of more than $100\nshall however be credited to account 2230 upon receipt, and written off to\naccount 1420.1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in section\n1644-2.5. 1420.2 Interest Income\n(a) This account shall be credited, to the extent that\ninterest on borrowed funds has been charged to account 1420.1, with interest\n(to the date of substantial completion) on Development Fund Investments and\ninterest on mortgages acquired by the local agency during the period of land\nacquisition. (b) Development Fund Investments, including those made\nby the local agency directly, or by the State Comptroller on behalf of the\nlocal agency, shall, however, be regarded as having been made first, from funds\nallocated to offsite clearance, to the extent that funds have been borrowed for\nthat purpose, and secondly, from other funds, interest being credited\naccordingly. The allocation of interest income to the offsite clearance\n(1440.16) group of accounts shall cease on the date of substantial completion, or the date of liquidation of the program, whichever is earlier. 1420.3 Insurance\n(a) This account shall be charged with the cost of\npremiums for the following types of insurance, in connection with operations on\nthe site of the project proper, for the period ending with the date of\nsubstantial completion of the project proper: (1) Owners, landlords and tenants public liability\ninsurance covering land, buildings to be demolished, and newly constructed\nbuildings. (2) Fire and extended coverage insurance on buildings, including buildings to be demolished and newly constructed buildings. (3) Fire insurance on materials paid for directly by\nthe local agency and stored off the site. (4) Boiler insurance, where carried. Insurance normally carried by contractors and included\nin the contract amount may, under unusual circumstances, be carried by the\nlocal agency. The premiums, in such event, shall also be charged to this\naccount. This account shall be charged with the cost of premiums\nfor owners contingent (protective) liability insurance carried for the\nprotection of the local agency while demolition and construction operations are\nin progress. The full premium for this insurance should be charged to this\naccount, and no portion allocated to operations. (b) Premiums on the types of insurance listed in\nparagraph (a) above, carried in connection with property acquired for the\noffsite clearance, rehabilitation, or relocation of buildings programs shall be\ncharged to the respective cost accounts provided. (c) Reference should be made to account 1410.12 for the\ncharging of other types of insurance during the development period. (d) The local agency should be guided in all insurance\nmatters by Part 1630 of this Chapter. 1420.4 Site Income\n(a) This account shall reflect the income from the\noperation of the site of the project proper for housing and other\nincome-producing purposes from the date of acquisition to the beginning of the\ninitial operating period. Rentals received from tenants occupying dwelling\nunits, stores, or other space on the site of the project proper, rentals for\nrent of parking lots, revenues from outdoor advertising signs, or other\nsources, and all other income arising from the use of the property of the\nproject proper shall be credited to this account. (b) A separate income analysis ledger shall be\nmaintained and the applicable subaccounts of the 3000 group of accounts shall\nbe employed in accounting for such site income during development. The monthly\nreports submitted during the development period shall include a report of site\nmanagement income on form DH-621. This account (1420.4) shall operate as a\ncontrol account in lieu of account 3000. While trial balances of the income\nanalysis ledger should be taken periodically to see if they agree with the\ncontrol, periodical closings of either the control or subsidiary accounts will\nnot be required. The report of site income on form DH-621 will therefore\nreflect the cumulative income from the beginning of the site management period\nin the\ncumulative\ncolumn on the form, the income for the\ncurrent month being reported on the\ncurrent\ncolumn of the\nform. (c) A space inventory and a tenants accounts receivable\nledger shall also be maintained during the site management period. The full\nscheduled rent shall be charged, and vacancy loss recorded, until such time as\nthe local agency, in anticipation of demolition, has declared, by appropriate\nresolution, that the vacant dwelling units in a particular building or\nbuildings, or those vacated subsequent thereto, shall not be re-rented. Effective with the first day of the month following that in which such\nresolution has been passed, only the scheduled rent of dwelling units in such\nbuilding or buildings as are not vacant shall be charged, and vacancy loss\nshall not be recorded. Write-offs of rent in connection with the relocation of\nsite tenants, as authorized by a resolution by the local agency approved by the\ndivision, shall be considered a necessary cost of removal, and charged to\naccount 1440.13, Relocation of Tenants. Other authorized write-offs shall be\ncharged to the collection loss subaccount of account 1420.5, Site Expense. The\ndivision will not approve such write-offs unless it is satisfied that the local\nagency has been pursuing an aggressive collection policy and has exhausted all\nmeans of collection to the maximum extent practicable. 1420.5 Site Expense\n(b) Workmen's compensation insurance premiums and\nemployees' retirement fund contributions shall be charged to this account to\nthe extent that employees' salaries are so charged. Other overhead and service\ncosts falling in the 1410 classification of accounts shall not be charged to\nthis account unless separate office is maintained for site management and such\ncosts are directly connected with the operation of that office, or the local\nagency has obtained the approval of the division for a plan to serve as the\nbasis for the distribution or allocation of such charges. (c) Expenditures required to repair and maintain vacant\nbuildings on the site of the project proper shall be charged to this account, but expenditures in connection with the preparation of buildings for demolition\nshall be charged to account 1440.14. (d) This account shall also be charged with the initial\nand replacement costs of personal property, such as ranges and refrigerators, required to operate the buildings on the site for income-producing purposes, pending demolition. Where the personal property, however, is conveyed\nsimultaneously with the real property as part of the one transaction, the\nentire consideration for the property shall be charged to account 1440.1. Land\n\nPurchase Price, and no attempt should be made to separate the consideration for\nthe personal property from that for the real property for charging to the\nrespective accounts. Sales of personal property, however acquired, shall be\nconsidered sales of salvage and shall be credited to account 1440.14, Demolition and Clearing. (e) Applicable subaccounts of the 4000 group shall be\nemployed in accounting for the expenses of site management, this account being\noperated as a control account in lieu of account 4000. A separate Expense\n\nAnalysis Ledger shall be maintained and the monthly reports submitted during\nthe development period shall include a report of site management expense on\nform DH-621. While trial balances of the site management books should be taken\nperiodically to see if they agree with the control, periodical closings of the\ncontrol and subsidiary accounts will not be required, as during the project\nmanagement period. The report on form DH-621 will therefore reflect in the\ncumulative\ncolumn of the form the cumulative expense of\noperating the project site from the beginning of the site management period and\nthe current column of the form will reflect the results of operation for the\ncurrent month being reported. 1420.6 Real Estate Taxes\n(a) This account shall be charged with real estate\ntaxes on land and improvements included within the site of the project proper, but not beyond the date of substantial completion of the project proper. No\nallocation of tax charges shall be made to Site Expense (account 1420.5) or to\nthe Preoccupancy (1470) group of accounts. (b) Real estate taxes on property acquired for the\noffsite clearance, rehabilitation or relocation of buildings programs shall be\ncharged to the respective cost accounts provided. (c) All real property acquired by a local agency in\nconnection with the development of the project proper is taxed on the basis of\nthe assessed valuation of the retained land and the improvements thereon, as of\nthe date of the contract for State aid. So much of the value of the property\nincluded in a State project, as represents an increase over the assessed\nvaluation of the property retained both land and improvements, as of the date\nof the contract for State aid, is exempt from any and all State, county, city, village, town, school and special district taxes. In no event may any\nmunicipality or county assess the property included in the project proper at an\namount in excess of the actual cost of the project. (d) Where a contract for State aid is amended, the date\nof the original contract, and not of the amendments thereto, shall govern with\nrespect to assessed valuations, unless the amendment provides for the\nacquisition of land and improvements, not previously included. In such event, the date of the amended contract shall govern with respect to the additional\nland and improvements. (e) Except for local property taxes, a local agency is\nexempt from the payment of any taxes or fees to the State or any subdivision\nthereof, or to any officer or employee of the State or any subdivision\nthereof. (f) The taxation of real property acquired by a local\nagency in connection with related offsite clearance, rehabilitation, or\nrelocation of buildings programs presents special problems. These should be\nreferred to the division, individually for ruling. 1420.7 Cost of Borrowing\n(a) This account shall be charged with the actual\ndirect costs incurred by the State in connection with the issuance of housing\nbonds, as certified by the State Comptroller. Such cost will include printing, advertising, etc. Do not include fiscal and other fees (see account 1410.14) or\nother costs incurred by the local agency in connection with temporary or\npermanent financing. (b) The cost of borrowing shall be considered a\ndevelopment cost of the project proper and shall be charged to this account\nwhether the issue of bonds is prior or subsequent to the date of substantial\ncompletion. The final development cost of the project shall not be determined\nuntil the cost of borrowing is certified by the State Comptroller. No\ndistribution or allocation of the cost of borrowing shall be made to the costs\nof related programs unless the division otherwise directs. 1420.8 Premium on State Housing\n\nBonds\n(a) This account shall be credited with the premium, if\nany, realized from the sale of State housing bonds, as certified by the State\n\nComptroller. (b) The premium shall be considered a credit to\ndevelopment costs whether the issue of bonds is prior or subsequent to the date\nof substantial completion. The Comptroller may deposit the premium into the\n\nState Housing Debt Fund and apply it to the payment of the next interest\npayment due on the bonds. If all or a portion of such interest payment has been\ncharged to operating expenses, a transfer of funds from the Administration Fund\nto the Development Fund will be required. See Part 1644, Debt Service, for\nentries and procedures. 1420.9 War Delay Period\n\nThis account was established to determine the\nadditional development cost of a project due to the delay resulting from World\n\nWar II.

These surveys are made in\nconnection with land acquisition, and as a basis for the architectural and\nengineering design of the project, after the site has been selected and\napproved and the contract for State aid signed. They should not be confused\nwith the Housing Survey (see account 1410.17), or surveys of alternative sites\nmade in connection with the application for financial assistance (see account\n1410.19), or surveys made in connection with the relocation of tenants (see\naccount 1440.13). 1440.5 Appraisal Fees\n\nThis account shall be charged with the cost of fees for\nthe appraisal of all land and improvements to be acquired for the project\nproper, on sites approved by the commissioner.

The Public Housing Law also permits the payment of the necessary costs of\nremoval for business or commercial tenants on the site, but not in excess of\n$500 for any one tenant. Rents due from site tenants and cancelled, as an\ninducement to remove from the site, in accordance with a resolution of the\nlocal agency, as approved by the division, shall be a charge to the necessary\ncost of removal to the extent provided by such resolution. Subaccounts or other\nanalysis of the charges to this account shall be maintained of the necessary\ncosts of removal, and of the other relocation costs. Local agency procedures\nrelating to the payment of relocation costs to residential and commercial\ntenants should be submitted to the division for prior approval. 1440.14 Demolition and Clearing\n(a) This account shall be charged with the net cost of\ndemolition and of clearing the site of the project proper, including\ndemolishing and clearing away of structures, other improvements, and debris on\nthe site, water charges, if any, for wetting down during demolition, boarding-up vacant properties prior to demolition, stripping properties of\npiping, equipment, etc., to reduce loss by theft, the wages of watchmen\nemployed on the site prior to completion of demolition, the moving and storing\nof salvaged equipment, such as refrigerators and ranges, pending final sale, erection of sidewalks, bridges and fences around cleared parcels, etc. Where\nany of these items are included in a demolition contract, the contract price\nshall be charged to this account. Where the contract calls for a payment to be\nmade to the local agency, this account shall be credited. This account shall\nalso be credited with amounts received on sale of salvage. The use of a\nschedule or subaccounts to analyze the entries made to this account is\nrecommended. Suggested classifications are: (1) Demolition and Clearing-Contract\n(2) Salaries of Watchmen\n(3) Demolition and Clearing-Other Expense\n(4) Sales of Salvage\n(b) Where the project plan calls for moving buildings\non the site of the project proper to another location, in lieu of demolition, all costs in connection therewith shall be charged to account 1440.18, Relocation of Buildings.

(b) See account 2113, Deposits-Other Than Tenants, for\nthe handling of deposits, binders or options received by the local agency in\nconnection with the sale of site land. 1440.16 Offsite Clearance\n(a) This account shall be charged with the net cost of\nthe offsite clearance program, giving effect to any credits from the operation\nof the offsite property, the sale of salvage, the sale of land, interest\nreceived on investments of offsite funds, etc. (b) Where a tract of land included in the offsite\nclearance program is ceded without cost to a municipality in accordance with\nthe loan and subsidy contract, no accounting entry is necessary. The authority\nshould bear in mind that its liability for real estate taxes on the tract\nceases as of title vesting date and that insurance policies applicable to the\ntract should be cancelled and unearned premium recovered. In addition, the\nlocal agency should indicate the transfer on the land record card for the\nparcel (see §\n1646-4.3\n). (c) Offsite clearance represents a program within a\nprogram, related to the development of the project proper, and embracing the\nacquisition of the offsite property, operation in some cases, of the property\nprior and subsequent to demolition, demolition and clearing, and finally, the\ndisposition of the land. Accordingly, all costs in connection with the offsite\nclearance program, including all credits related thereto, shall be capitalized\nand charged to this account until such time as the program has been liquidated. Ordinarily, all offsite clearance activity will have been completed before the\nfinal development cost is determined. (d) A separate cost analysis ledger shall be\nmaintained, using the account classification of the 1400 group of subaccounts\nto the extent applicable, according to the following general scheme. 1440.16(10)\n\nDirect Costs, Offsite\n1440.16(10.1)\n\nPayroll-Executive\n1440.16(10.2)\n\nPayroll-Technical\n1440.16(10.4)\n\nLegal Services and Expenses, etc. 1440.16(20)\n\nCarrying Charges, Offsite\n1440.16(20.1)\n\nInterest\n1440.16(20.3)\n\nInsurance\n1440.16(20.4)\n\nOffsite Income\n1440.16(20.5)\n\nOffsite Expense\n1440.16(20.6)\n\nTaxes\n1440.16(40)\n\nLand Acquisition Cost, Offsite\n1440.16(40.1)\n\nLand Purchase Price\n1440.16(40.2)\n\nFixture Awards\n1440.16(40.3)\n\nInterest on Condemnation Awards\n1440.16(40.15)\n\nSale of Offsite Land, etc. 1440.16(80)\n\nOther Charges and Credits to Offsite\n\nClearance Cost, etc. In general, it will be found that all offsite clearance\ncosts will fall into the above classifications and that there will be no\noccasion to use the Architectural and Engineering (1430), Structures, Equipment\nand Improvements (1460), Preoccupancy Charges and Credits (1470), or\n\nContingency (1490) classifications. (e) The definitions, instructions, and procedures with\nrespect to the classification of development costs for the project proper shall\napply with equal force and effect to the classification of offsite clearance\ncosts. (g) The monthly report submitted during the development\nperiod of the project proper shall include a separate report of offsite\nclearance costs on form DH 213, and a report of the results of offsite\nmanagement on form DH 621. When the project proper has entered the management\nperiod these reports shall be made quarterly. The reports shall continue to be\nmade until final disposition of the offsite property. In general, only such costs or expenses as have\nbeen incurred on account of the offsite clearance program, and which would not\nhave been incurred if there were no offsite program, should be charged to\n\nOffsite Clearance, account 1440.16. They are here summarized as\nfollows: (1)\n\nDirect Costs (1410 group). Where\nseparate offices are maintained in connection with the offsite clearance\nprogram, or offsite management, the costs of operating such offices, including\nthe salaries of executive personnel employed therein, office rent, furniture\nand fixtures, sundry office expense, communications services, and premiums for\nfire, public liability, safe and robbery insurance applicable thereto shall be\ncharged to the cost of offsite clearance. Workmen's compensation insurance\npremiums and employees retirement fund contributions shall be charged to this\naccount to the extent that payrolls are so charged. Photographs showing the\nprogress of offsite clearance work, and the cost of advertising for bids for\ndemolition of offsite property shall be charged to this account directly, as\nshall the cost of other than ordinary and usual legal services, in connection\nwith offsite clearance, not covered by a retainer. No distribution or\nallocation of Direct Costs (1410 group) to the cost of offsite clearance, shall\notherwise be made, unless the division so directs, or approves a plan to serve\nas the basis of such distribution. (2)\n\nCarrying Charges (1420 group). Offsite clearance shall be charged with the interest on funds borrowed to\nfinance the offsite clearance program until the project is declared\nsubstantially completed or the program is liquidated, whichever is earlier. Taxes and insurance on offsite property shall be charged to offsite clearance\nuntil the program is liquidated. Any insurance carried by the authority to\nprotect the local agency during demolition operations on offsite property\nshould also be charged to the 1440.16 group of accounts. No distribution, as\nbetween the project proper and the offsite clearance program, shall be made of\nthe cost of borrowing, or the premium on State housing bonds. Interest on\noffsite clearance funds investments shall be credited in accordance with the\nprocedure described under 1420.2. 1440.17 Rehabilitation\n(a) This account shall be charged with the net cost of\nrehabilitating existing buildings, giving effect to any credits from the\noperating of the rehabilitated property, the sale of the property, etc. (b) Rehabilitation represents a program within a\nprogram, related to the development of the project proper, and embracing the\nacquisition of buildings, their conversion, modernization, and rehabilitation\nfor occupancy, the operation of the rehabilitated buildings, and their eventual\ndisposition. All costs and expenses of the rehabilitation program, and all\ncredits related thereto, shall be capitalized and charged to this account until\nsuch time as the program is liquidated. Ordinarily, all rehabilitation activity\nwill have been completed before the date of substantial completion. (c) A separate cost analysis ledger shall be\nmaintained, using the account classifications of the 1400 group as subaccounts\nto the extent applicable, according to the following general scheme: 1440.17(10)\n\nDirect Costs, Rehabilitation\n1440.17(10.1)\n\nPayroll-Executive, etc. 1440.17(20)\n\nCarrying Charges, Rehabilitation\n1440.17(20.1)\n\nInterest\n1440.17(20.4)\n\nRehabilitation Income\n1440.17(20.5)\n\nRehabilitation Expense, etc. 1440.17(30)\n\nArchitectural and Engineering, Rehabilitation, etc. 1440.17(30.1)\n\nFees-Under Contract, etc. 1440.17(40)\n\nLand Acquisition Costs, Rehabilitation\n1440.17(40.1)\n\nLand Purchase Price\n1440.17(40.15)\n\nSale of Rehabilitated Property, etc. 1440.17(60)\n\nStructures, Equipment and Improvements, etc. 1440.17(80)\n\nOther Rehabilitation Costs and Credits, etc. (d) The definitions, instructions, and procedures with\nrespect to the classification of development costs for the project proper shall\napply with equal force and effect to the classification of rehabilitation\ncosts. (3) No provisions shall be made for reserves for\nvacancy and collection losses, painting and decoration, replacements, or\namortization. (4) Rentals must be set at levels high enough to cover\nall operating costs. Deficits in operation, if any, will be met out of\ndevelopment funds, not subsidies. (5) Provision for amortization of indebtedness, subsequent to the issue of State housing bonds, will all be charged to project\nmanagement expense, and will not be a charge to rehabilitation. (f) The local agency upon the request of the division\nshall submit a quarterly report on rehabilitation cost and operations. See\nsection\n1646-7.2, Schedule Number 10 and\nsection\n1646-7.13\nfor further details as to\nthe required forms to be furnished with the quarterly report. (g) Rehabilitation costs shall include all costs\ndirectly connected with or attributable to the rehabilitation program. In general, only such expenses as have been incurred on account of the\nrehabilitation program, and which would not have been incurred if there were no\nrehabilitation program, should be charged to Rehabilitation, account\n1440.17. Procedures with respect to the distribution or allocation of\n\nDirect Costs (1410 group) and Carrying Charges as between the project proper\nand the rehabilitation program, have been described under the various\nsubaccounts of these groups, to which reference should be made. They are here\nsummarized, as follows: (1)\n\nDirect Costs (1410 group). Where\nseparate offices are maintained in connection with the rehabilitation\ndevelopment program, the costs of operating such offices, including the\nsalaries of executive personnel employed therein, office rent, furniture and\nfixtures, sundry office expense, communication services, and premiums for fire, public liability, safe and robbery insurance applicable thereto shall be\ncharged to this account. Where separate offices are maintained in connection\nwith rehabilitation management, the costs of operating such offices as\ndescribed above, shall be charged to account 1440.17(20.5), Rehabilitation\nexpense. The cutoff point for separate office costs as between rehabilitation\ndevelopment and rehabilitation management shall be the first day of the month\nfollowing that in which 95 per cent of the total dwelling units included in the\nrehabilitation program became available for occupancy. Workmen's compensation\ninsurance premiums and employees retirement fund contributions shall be charged\nto the 1410 group of accounts to the extent that payrolls are so charged. Photographs showing the progress of rehabilitation work and the cost of\nadvertising for bids for rehabilitation contracts shall be charged to this\naccount directly, as shall the cost of other than ordinary and usual legal\nservices in connection with the rehabilitation development program not covered\nby a retainer. No distribution or allocation of Direct Costs (1410 group) to\nthe cost of rehabilitation shall otherwise be made, unless the division so\ndirects, or approves a plan to serve as the basis of such distribution. (2)\n\nCarrying Charges (1420 group). During the rehabilitation development program, this account shall be charged\nwith the interest on funds borrowed to finance the rehabilitation program, and\nwith taxes and insurance on property acquired in connection therewith, as well\nas with insurance required to protect the local agency during construction\noperations. Beginning with the first day of the month following that in which\n95 per cent of the total dwelling units included in the rehabilitation program\nbecame available for occupancy, the 1440.17(20.5) group of accounts shall be\ncharged with the interest on funds borrowed to finance the program and taxes\nand insurance on the property acquired for the rehabilitation program. No\ndistribution, as between the project proper and the rehabilitation program, shall be made of the cost of borrowing, or the premium on State housing\nbonds. 1440.18 Relocation of Buildings\n(a) This account shall be charged with the net cost of\nrelocating existing buildings giving effect to any credits from the operation\nof the buildings, or their sale, etc. (b) Relocation of buildings represents a program within\na program, embracing the acquisition and preparation of the sites to which the\nbuildings are to be moved, preparation of the moved buildings for occupancy, operation of the buildings, and finally, their disposition. Accordingly, all\ncosts in connection with the relocation of buildings program, including all\ncredits related thereto, shall be capitalized and charged to this account until\nsuch time as the program is liquidated. Ordinarily, all relocation of buildings\nactivity will have been completed before the final development cost is\ndetermined. An analysis of the cost of relocation, revenues, and expenses, with\nrespect to each building relocated shall be maintained. (c) A separate cost analysis ledger shall be\nmaintained, using the account classifications of the 1400 group as subaccounts\nto the extent applicable, according to the following general scheme: 1440.18(10)\n\nDirect Costs, Relocation of\n\nBuildings\n1440.18(10.1)\n\nPayroll-Executive, etc. 1440.18(20)\n\nCarrying Charges, Relocation of\n\nBuildings\n1440.18(20.1)\n\nInterest\n1440.18(20.4)\n\nRelocated Building Income\n1440.18(20.5)\n\nRelocated Building Expense, etc. 1440.18(30)\n\nArchitectural and Engineering, Relocation\nof Buildings\n1440.18(30.1)\n\nFees-Under Contract, etc. 1440.18(40)\n\nLand Acquisition Costs, Relocation of\n\nBuildings\n1440.18(40.1)\n\nLand Purchase Price\n1440.18(40.15)\n\nSale of Relocated Property, etc. 1440.18(60)\n\nStructures, Equipment, and\n\nImprovements\n\nFor contract and other costs in connection with\nmoving, preparing new site, connecting and disconnecting utilities, plumbing, heating, electrical work, etc. 1440.18(80)\n\nOther Relocation of Buildings Cost and\n\nCredits\n\nIn general, it will be found that all relocation of\nbuildings costs will fall into the above classifications. It will also be\nfound, generally speaking, that the buildings included in the relocation of\nbuildings program will have been acquired in connection with the assembly of\nthe site of the project proper or the offsite, and are being moved to house\nsite tenants, in lieu of demolition. In such event, the cost of the building\nitself shall remain as a charge to the land acquisition costs of the site, or\noffsite, the relocation of buildings account being charged only for the costs\nof moving, acquiring and preparing the new site, etc. (d) The definitions, instructions, and procedures with\nrespect to the classification of development costs for the project site shall\napply with equal force and effect to the classifications of relocation of\nbuildings costs. The full scheduled rent shall be charged, and vacancy\nloss recorded, beginning with the first day of the month following that in\nwhich 95 per cent of the total dwelling units included in the relocation of\nbuilding program become available for occupancy. Prior to this date, such\n\nDirect Costs (1410 classification) not attributable to the operation of a\nseparate relocation of buildings management office, and such Carrying Charges\n(1420 classification) as are chargeable to relocation of building costs shall\nbe charged to the appropriate accounts in the 1440.18(10) and 1440.18(20)\ngroups (exclusive of account 1440.18[20.5]) but subsequent thereto, such costs\nshall be charged to Relocated Buildings Expense, account 1420.18(20.5). Other\nfeatures of the accounting during the operation of the relocated buildings\nare: (3) No provisions shall be made for reserve for vacancy\nand collection losses, painting and decorating, replacements or\namortization. (4) Rentals must be set at levels high enough to cover\nall operating costs. Deficits in operation, if any, will be met out of\ndevelopment funds, not subsidies. (5) Provision of amortization of indebtedness, subsequent to the issue of State housing bonds, will be charged to project\nmanagement expense and will not be a charge to Relocation of Buildings. (f) The local agency shall submit a quarterly report on\nrelocation of buildings cost and operations. See section\n1646-7.2, schedule number 11 and\nsection\n1646-7.13\nfor further details as to\nthe required forms to be furnished with the quarterly report. (g) Relocation of building cost shall include all costs\ndirectly connected with or attributable to the relocation of buildings program. In general, only such costs of expenses as have been incurred on\naccount of the relocation of buildings program, and which would not have been\nincurred if there were no relocation of buildings program, should be charged to\n\nRelocation of Buildings, account 1440.18. Procedures with respect to\nthe distribution or allocation of Direct Costs (1410 group) and Carrying\n\nCharges (1420 group), as between the project proper and the relocation of\nbuildings program have been described under the various subaccounts of these\ngroups, to which reference should be made. They are here summarized as\nfollows: (1)\n\nDirect Costs (1410 group). Where\nseparate offices are maintained in connection with the relocation of buildings\ndevelopment program, the costs of operating such offices, including the\nsalaries of executive personnel employed therein, office rent, furniture and\nfixtures, sundry office expense, communication services, and premiums for fire, public liability, safe and robbery insurance applicable thereto shall be\ncharged to this account. Where separate offices are maintained in connection\nwith relocation of buildings management, the costs of operating such offices as\ndescribed above, shall be charged to account 1440.18(20.5), Relocation of\n\nBuildings Expense. The cutoff point for separate office costs as between\nrelocation of buildings development and relocation of buildings management\nshall be the first day of the month following that in which 95 per cent of the\ntotal dwelling units included in the relocation of buildings program became\navailable for occupancy. Workmen's compensation insurance premiums and\nemployees retirement fund contributions shall be charged to 1410 group of\naccounts to the extent that payrolls are so charged. Photographs showing the\nprogress of relocation of buildings work and the cost of advertising for bids\nfor relocation of buildings contracts shall be charged to this account\ndirectly, as shall the cost of other than ordinary and usual legal services in\nconnection with the relocation of buildings development programs not covered by\na retainer. No distribution or allocation of Direct Cost (1410 group) to the\ncost of relocation of buildings shall otherwise be made, unless the division so\ndirects, or approves a plan to serve as the basis of such distribution. (2)\n\nCarrying Charges (1420 group). During the relocation of buildings development program, this account shall be\ncharged with the interest on funds borrowed to finance the relocation of\nbuildings program, and with taxes and insurance on property acquired in\nconnection therewith, as well as with insurance required to protect the local\nagency during the moving and construction operations. Beginning with the first\nday of the month following that in which 95 per cent of the total dwelling\nunits included in the relocation of buildings program became available for\noccupancy, the 1440.18(20.5) group of accounts shall be charged with the\ninterest on funds borrowed to finance the program and taxes and insurance on\nthe property acquired for the relocation of buildings programs. No\ndistribution, as between the project proper and the relocation of buildings\nprogram, shall be made of the cost of borrowing, or the premium on State\nhousing bonds. 1460 Structures, Equipment and\n\nImprovements\n(c) The account numbers to which contracts are charged\nshould not be confused with the contract numbers used by the local agency to\nidentify individual contracts and in reporting to the division on the schedule\nof contract awards. Contract numbers for the major contracts and the accounts\nto which they should be charged follow. Subaccount numbers for contracts\ncharged to the 1460 group should be assigned as described above: Contract no. Contract\n\nAccount no. 1\n\nSurveys\n1440.4\n2\n\nTest Borings\n1430.4\n3\n\nArchitects\n1430.1\n4\n\nDemolition\n1440.14\n5\n\nFoundations\n1460.1\n6\n\nGeneral Construction\n1460.1\n7\n\nHeating and Ventilating\n1460.3\n8\n\nElectrical\n1460.4\n9\n\nPlumbing\n1460.2\n10\n\nElevators\n1460.8\n11\n\nTesting of Concrete\n1430.10\n12\n\nStreet and Yard Improvements\n1460\n13\n\nTopsoil and Planting\n1460.5\n14\n\nRefrigerators\n1460.7\n15\n\nRanges\n1460.6\n\nWhere a contract is awarded to more than one\ncontractor, the individual contracts should be distinguished by suffixing a\nletter of the alphabet in the order of the awards. Thus, demolition contracts\nwould be identified as 4A, 4B, 4C etc. When contracts are combined, the\ncombined contract shall be identified by using the component contract numbers. Thus, foundations and general construction are sometimes awarded as one\ncontract. If so, the contract should be identified as contract no. 5-6. (d) A physical inventory shall be maintained of all\nitems of equipment charged to this group of accounts. (e) Site, as used herein, refers to the site of the\nproject proper. (f) Mandatory account numbers to be used in the 1460\ngroup are as follows: 1460.1 General Construction\n\nThis account shall be charged with the value of the\nwork completed by the general contractor. The total of this account should\nagree with the amount entered in the column headed, \"Value of Work Completed\"\non the Schedule of Contract Awards, Exhibit 26 of Appendix S-11. 1460.2 Plumbing\n\nThis account shall be charged with the value of work\ncompleted by the plumbing contractor.

The total of this account\nshould agree with the amount entered in the column headed, \"Value of Work\n\nCompleted\" on the Schedule of Contract Awards, Exhibit 26 of Appendix\nS-11. 1460.6 Ranges\n\nThis account shall be charged with the cost of ranges\npurchased by the local agency for the tenant's apartments. This account shall\nalso be charged with the cost of ranges purchased during the development period\nin excess of the current requirements and to be used for future replacement\nwhere a tenants' range becomes inoperative. Any range purchased for use of the\ncommunity center shall be charged to account 1460.9, Management Equipment.

The total\nshould agree with the amount entered in the column headed, \"Value of Work\n\nCompleted\" on the Schedule of Contracts Awards, Exhibit 26 of Appendix\nS-11. 1460.9 Management Equipment\n\nThis account shall be charged with the original cost of\nnonexpendable equipment purchased during the development period and with the\noriginal cost on nonexpendable equipment purchased after substantial completion\nfrom development funds. As a basis for determining which items are\nnonexpendable, all items which cost $25 or more each shall be charged to this\naccount. Items of management equipment which cost less than $25 shall be\ncharged to account 1410.8 during construction, to account 1470.3 (4490) during\ninitial occupancy and to account 4490 after substantial completion. Some\nexamples of the type of management equipment to be charged to this account are\nas follows: (1)\n\nAutomotive equipment. Trucks, jeeps, automobiles, tractors, etc. (2)\n\nOperating service equipment. Garbage and trash cans, floor waxing machines, etc. (3)\n\nMaintenance and repair equipment.

This account shall also be charged with any initial supplies\nthat are received at the project after substantial completion and charged to\n\nDevelopment Fund. A physical inventory shall be maintained of these supplies in\naccordance with Subpart 1642-7. 1460.11 Temporary Heat\n\nThis account shall be charged, with the costs of\nheating the buildings (fuel and labor) by the contractor prior to the\nacceptance of the buildings by the local agency. 1460.12 Future Painting\n\nUnder some circumstances, the initial painting of the\nproject may be deferred until after initial occupancy or after substantial\ncompletion. In such cases, the estimated cost of the initial painting will be\nset aside from Development Funds. The cost of such initial painting should be\ncharged to this account (1460.12). 1470 Preoccupancy Charges and\n\nCredits\n\nThis major group of cost accounts shall include all\ncosts incidental to the initial operation of the project proper, including the\ndirect costs of selecting tenants, preliminary expenses prior to the beginning\nof the initial operating period, and any net deficit or income during the\ninitial operating period. 1470.1 Tenant Selection Costs\n\nThis account shall be charged directly with all\nsalaries of personnel especially employed for tenant selection and with all\nexpenses incidental to tenant selection such as the cost of receiving, processing, and investigating applications up to the end of the initial\noperating period. Thereafter, this type of expense will be considered a part of\nthe regular operating expenses and charged to the operation of the project\nproper. 1470.2 Preliminary Expenses\n(a) This account shall be charged with all expenses\n(except tenant selection costs) directly attributable to the initial operation\nof the project proper or to preparations for the operation of a project, which\nhave been incurred, or are applicable to the\nperiod prior to the\nbeginning of the initial operating period. Preliminary expenses\ninclude, for example, the salaries of the project manager and staff, janitorial\nand maintenance salaries, project office expense, costs of preparing and\nprinting booklets for the instruction of tenants, etc. Interest on\nindebtedness, insurance on newly constructed buildings, and taxes shall not be\nincluded, nor shall expenses falling within the Direct Costs (1410) group of\ndevelopment cost accounts, unless it is clearly established that such costs\nwould not have been incurred if the project proper were not being operated or\nbeing put into operation. (b) It is anticipated that the period of preliminary\noperation, during which project operating expenses are chargeable to this\naccount will be relatively short. Hence, the charges will be made directly to\nthis account without the employment, as subaccounts, of the standard\nclassification of project management expense accounts (4000 group) prescribed\nfor use during the initial operating period. 1470.3 Net Deficit or (Income)-Initial Operating\n\nPeriod\n(a) This account shall reflect the net deficit or\nincome resulting from the operation of the project during the initial operating\nperiod. This account shall operate as a control account, the standard\nclassifications of project management income and expense (3000 and 4000 groups)\nbeing maintained as subsidiary accounts to the extent applicable. Separate\nincome and expense analysis ledgers shall be maintained during this period and\nreports of income and expense on form DH-621 shall be rendered\nquarterly. (b) Management expenses during the initial operating\nperiod shall include only the actual expenses of operating the project proper, such as salaries of the project manager and staff, janitorial and maintenance\nsalaries, project office expenses, operating services, and utilities. Tenant\nselection costs, interest on indebtedness, insurance on newly constructed\nbuildings and taxes shall not be included, nor shall provisions be made for any\nreserves or for accrual of subsidies. Expenses falling within the Direct Costs\n(1410) or Carrying Charges (1420) group of development cost accounts shall not\nbe charged to management expense during the initial operating period unless it\nis clearly established that such expenses would not have been incurred if the\nproject were not being operated. (c) No vacancy loss shall be recorded prior to the last\nday of the month during which 95 per cent of the projects' dwelling units\nbecome available for occupancy or the date of substantial completion as\ndetermined by the commissioner, whichever is earlier, only the scheduled rents\nof such dwelling units as have been rented being taken into income. Subsequent\nthereto, the full scheduled rent shall be charged and vacancy loss shall be\nrecorded. 1480 Other Charges and Credits to Development\n\nCosts\n\nThis account is established to record charges and\ncredits to development costs for which provision has not been made in other\ndevelopment cost accounts. In general, it will be found that most credits\narising during the development period will follow the charge. Thus, amounts\nreceived from sales of salvage, or from demolition contractors are credited to\naccount 1440.14, Demolition and Clearing, etc. Charges and credits from the\nfollowing typical sources shall, however, be made to this account, a\nsubanalysis being maintained: (1) Gain or loss on disposition of development fund\ninvestments, whether sold prior or subsequent to the date of substantial\ncompletion. (2) Gain or loss on settlement of insurance claims\napplicable to the period prior to the date of substantial completion, except\ninsofar as to the claims relate to offsite management, or to other related\nprograms. (3) Losses incurred during the development period not\ncovered by insurance as, for example, with respect to property damage caused by\nwater, except insofar as the losses relate to offsite management or to the\nrelated programs. 1490 Contingencies and Working\n\nCapital\n(a) This account is established, for budgetary purposes\nonly, to provide a cushion between estimated development costs, as budgeted, and the maximum amount that the State agrees to lend and the local agency\nagrees to borrow under the loan contract. The amount to be set up for\ncontingencies shall be approved by the division. This account shall include\nsuch amounts as may be included in the State loan for working capital. The\ndefinitive amount of loan funds reserved for working capital will not, however, be determined until the project is declared physically completed by the\ncommissioner. See section\n1646-8.1\nfor the accounting\nentries. Until such time as the amount of Working Capital has been certified by\nthe commissioner, this account shall be handled as if the funds were reserved\nsolely for contingencies. (c) Inasmuch as account 1490 is provided for budgetary\npurposes only, no account is set up for it in the cost analysis ledger, nor are\nany overruns or other development costs charged to the account by means of\nformal accounting entries in the manner that development costs are charged to\nthe other development cost accounts. The application of Contingency Funds to\nauthorized overruns is reflected only on form DH-213, in the manner described\nabove. No request for an advance of Contingency Funds, as such, should\ntherefore be made on any certificate of purposes. (d) The term\noverrun\nis also used in\nconnection with the excesses of expenditures over amounts requested in approved\ncertificates of purposes. Such overruns are subject to special rules as to\napprovals, source of funds, etc. (see Part 1646, Development Period Accounting)\nand should be distinguished from overruns on budgeted amounts inasmuch as the\nlatter are the only type of overruns for which Contingencies are set up. INCOME ACCOUNTS-3000 GROUP\n3000 Income Control Account\n(a) This account shall control all income, operating\nand nonoperating, and shall be supported by detailed income accounts in the\n3000 group of accounts. Account 3000, the control account, shall be maintained\nin the general ledger, and the detailed income accounts shall be maintained in\nan income analysis ledger. Refer to Part 1642, Basic Instructions, for setting\nup and operating the control and subsidiary accounts. (b) Income accounts are arranged under the following\ngeneral headings: 3110 Dwelling Rent Schedule 3111 Dwelling\n\nVacancy Loss 3390 Non-Dwelling Rental 3510 Sales and Services to Tenants 3590\n\nMiscellaneous Project Income 3610 Interest Earned 3800 Subsidies\n\nBreakdowns in addition to those prescribed for the\ndetailed income accounts may be desirable on very large projects or under\nspecial circumstances. Such additional breakdowns may be made so long as the\ninformation in the form of the prescribed accounts will be available. 3110 Dwelling Rent Schedule\n(b) In addition to the amount charged for shelter rent, this account shall be credited with the charges for all utilities supplied by\nthe project, whether included in the gross rent or billed separately, and\nincluding excess utility charges. (c) In charging rents to tenants, there shall be no\nvariation from the established rent schedule adopted by the local agency and\napproved by the commissioner. The local agency may, however, charge higher than\nscheduled rents, subject to division approval, in exceptional cases where\noccupants of dwelling units whose family incomes are in excess of the limits\nestablished for eligibility for admission to the project, and continued\noccupancy therein, under section\n156\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, and who cannot find suitable accommodations outside of the\nproject. Such surcharges shall also be credited to this account. (d) The local agency, for control, charging and\nanalytical purposes will reflect the basic rent schedule, surcharges and excess\nutility charges as follows: 3110.1 Basic Rent Schedule 3110.2 Dwelling Rent\n\nSurcharges 3110.3 Retroactive Surcharges 3110.4 Excess Utility Charges\n(e) For the recording of entries on the books of\naccount, see Part 1642, Basic Instructions. 3111 Dwelling Vacancy Loss\n(b) For the recording of the entries on the books of\naccount, see Part 1642, Basic Instructions. 3390 Net Non-Dwelling Rent\n\nThis account shall be credited with all rental charges\nmade to lessees of non-dwelling facilities (including charges and surcharges\nfor utilities and equipment, whether included in the rent of billed\nseparately). Vacancy loss shall not be computed for any of the accounts in this\ngroup. Non-dwelling facilities include stores, garages, parking spaces, doctor's offices, community facilities, etc. Charges to non-dwelling tenants\nfor goods and services other than those provided as part of the rental charge, as hereinabove defined, shall not be included in this account (see account\n3510, Sales and Services to Tenants). 3510 Sales and Services to Tenants\n(b) This account shall represent the gross charges made\nto tenants accounts for the goods and services rendered and not the net\ndifference between the amount charged and the cost thereof.

The cost\nof labor in connection with repairs and maintenance of the heating system shall\nnot be charged to this account (see account 4402), unless performed by above\nlisted employees. 4400 Repairs and Maintenance\n(a) In performing its statutory function of providing\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing for those income groups which would otherwise\nbe unable to afford such housing, a project employs an aggregate of physical\nassets in the form of structures, site improvements, fixed and movable\nequipment, etc., to produce revenue, or to provide necessary facilities for the\noperation of the project, or because of their utility or function. Costs must\nbe incurred to preserve and maintain the revenue-producing capacity of these\nassets and their utility and function during their useful lives, and to replace\nthese assets at the end of their useful lives. These costs may be classified as\nfollows: (1)\n\nMaintenance. This term refers to\nthe measures undertaken to keep an asset in good operating condition over its\nuseful life, as by regular cleaning, oiling, adjusting, inspecting, overhauling, etc., or to maintain a certain standard of appearance, utility, or\nfunction, as by painting, renewing or replacing parts, or to prevent an asset\nfrom wearing out or breaking down before its time. Behind the idea of\nmaintenance is the thought that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of\ncure. Just as the Division of Housing feels that the best materials obtainable\nshould go into the construction of a project, so it feels that local agencies\nshould aggressively pursue policies of full maintenance. The regular type of\ncleaning done with a mop, broom, scrubbing, brush or dust cloth is not included\nherein, but represents a special type of maintenance classified as Operating\n\nServices-Janitorial (see account 4210). (2)\n\nRepairs. This term refers to the\nmeasures necessary to put an asset in good operating condition, or restore its\nutility, function or revenue-producing capacity after a condition has been\nreached which maintenance has been unable to prevent. Repairs, like\nmaintenance, may involve labor alone, or labor and materials, or the renewal or\nreplacement of parts, but, generally speaking, neither repairs nor maintenance\nmaterially add to the value of the asset, or to its utility, function, or\nrevenue-producing capacity or appreciably prolong its life expectancy. They\nmerely serve to keep the asset in an ordinary efficient operating condition and\nup to a certain standard of appearance, utility or function. (3)\n\nRenewals. This term refers to the\nreplacing of parts of an asset by other parts, as contrasted with the\nreplacement of the entire asset. As indicated above, maintenance and repairs\nmay include renewals. Sometimes the renewals may be so extensive, however, that\nthey constitute an arresting of deterioration or restoration of depreciation, thereby prolonging the life of the asset beyond its normal span. Consideration\nhas been given this factor in arriving at replacement reserve fund\nrequirements. (4)\n\nReplacements. This term refers to\nthe replacing of an entire asset by another asset, as contrasted with the\nreplacing of parts of that asset. The latter operation has been above defined\nas a \"renewal\". A simple illustration is a refrigerator. Replacing a motor\nwould be a renewal, replacing the entire refrigerator would be a replacement. As the asset becomes more complex, however, it becomes more difficult to\ndistinguish between a renewal and a replacement. For example, the replacing of\na steam boiler may be a renewal or replacement depending on whether the boiler\nis considered by itself or as part of the heating system. For the purposes of\nclassifying expenditures in this system of accounts, however the distinction is\nnot too important. When an asset has reached the end of its useful life, or\nwhen neither maintenance nor repairs have been able to keep the asset in\nefficient operating condition, or up to a certain standard of appearance, utility, or function, or when the item has lost or suffered serious impairment\nof its utility, function, or revenue-producing capacity through wear, damage, obsolescence, or lack of proper maintenance and repair, it should be replaced. The useful life of any asset installed or used in a project depends on the care\nwith which it has been maintained and repaired. If maintenance and repairs are\nneglected, early replacement of the item neglected with [\nsic\n]\nbe necessary. It is evident that replacement costs are dependent on the\nadequacy and degree of maintenance and repairs. Deferred maintenance may be in\nthe long run, shortsighted economy. Generally speaking, the division will\ninsist that policies of full maintenance be followed. (b) Expenditures for maintenance, repairs, renewals, and replacements, (hereinafter referred to as MRR&R expenditures) are\nclassified either as charges to current revenues, in which case they are\ncharged to the 4400 group of expense accounts, or as replacements in which case\nthey are charged to account 2510, Reserve for Replacements. The classification\nof the charges shall be made in accordance with the following procedure: (1) A detailed description and cost estimate of all\nreplacements planned for the budget year will be incorporated in each annual\noperating budget submitted to the division for review and approval. (2) In the event that the need for an unanticipated\nreplacement occurs, the local agency shall request division approval of a\ncorresponding amendment in the operating budget. (3) MRR&R expenditures for those items which are\nspecifically provided for in the approved annual operating budget, shall be\ncharged direct to account 2510, Reserve for Replacements, as described in Part\n1647, Operating Period Accounting. All other MRR&R expenditures not so\nprovided for shall be charged to the 4400 group of expense accounts. (c) Charges to the 4400 group of accounts shall include\nlabor, supplies, material, expendable equipment, contract costs, and such fixed\nor movable equipment as [do] not constitute charges to the Reserve for\n\nReplacements, account 2510, or account 6210, Operating Improvements. Many\nconstruction contracts, such as roofing, refrigerators, ranges, contain\nguarantee provisions as to performance, as do many types of maintenance\ncontracts. Where such contracts are in force, items of MRR&R expense\nincurred by a project, as by failure of the guarantor to perform, or otherwise, shall be held in suspense in account 1690, Sundry Suspense and Clearance, until\nliquidated under the guarantee provisions of the contract. 4401 Maintenance Supervision\n\nSalaries\n\nThis account shall be charged with the salaries and\nwages of personnel engaged at the project in the supervision of operating\nservices, utilities, or repair and maintenance activities, as for example the\nsuperintendent and assistant superintendent titles.
