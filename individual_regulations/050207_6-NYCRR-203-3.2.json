  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 203-3.2 - Natural Gas actuated Pneumatic Devices and Pumps\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability: The requirements of this\nsection apply to all natural gas actuated pneumatic devices and pumps located\nat gathering and boosting locations. (b) Continuous bleed natural gas pneumatic\ndevices: (1)\n\nBeginning January 1, 2023, continuous bleed natural gas pneumatic devices shall not vent natural gas to\nthe atmosphere except as described in 203-2.2(b)(2)(i) and shall comply with\n203-3.2(b)(2)(ii)-(v) and the LDAR requirements specified in Subpart\n203-7. (2)\n\nContinuous bleed natural\ngas actuated pneumatic devices installed prior to January 1, 2023 may be used\nprovided they meet all of the following requirements: (i) No device shall vent natural gas at a\nrate greater than six (6) standard cubic feet per hour (scfh) when the device\nis idle and not actuating. (ii)\n\nAll\ndevices must be clearly marked with a permanent tag that identifies the vented\nemissions rate as less than or equal to six (6) scfh. (iii)\n\nAll devices must be tested by January\n1, 2024 and then tested annually, no later than thirteen (13) months and no\nearlier than eleven (11) months from the previous test using a direct\nmeasurement method (high volume sampling, bagging, calibrated flow measuring\ninstrument); and, (iv)\n\nAny device\nwith a measured emissions flow rate greater than six (6) scfh shall be\nsuccessfully repaired within fourteen (14) days from the date of the initial\nemission flow rate measurement. (v) The owner or operator shall maintain a record of the flow rate measurement and\nshall report the result to the Department within sixty (60) days after\ncompleted. (c) Continuous bleed natural gas actuated pneumatic devices and pumps which need to\nbe replaced or retrofitted to comply with the requirements specified shall do\nso by either: (1)\n\nCollecting all vented\nnatural gas with the use of a vapor collection system as specified in Subpart\n203-8; or, (2)\n\nBy using compressed\nair or electricity in lieu of natural gas to operate. (d) Intermittent bleed natural gas actuated\npneumatic devices: Beginning January 1, 2023, intermittent bleed natural gas\nactuated pneumatic devices shall comply with the LDAR requirements specified in\n\nSubpart 203-7 when the device is idle and not controlling. (e) Natural gas actuated pneumatic pumps: Beginning January 1, 2023, natural gas actuated pneumatic pumps shall not vent\nnatural gas to the atmosphere and shall comply with the LDAR requirements\nspecified in Subpart 203-7.
