No other gratuities shall be deemed to have been received: (1)\n\nIf there is an agreement between the\nemployer and the union having jurisdiction over the banquet waiters providing\nthat the service employees shall receive from the employer for each function a\nfixed sum designated as \"wages and tips\" and the agreement prohibits any\nsoliciting of gratuities by waiters from patrons.
