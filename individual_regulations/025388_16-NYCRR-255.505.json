  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.505 - Strength test requirements for steel pipelines to operate at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each segment of\na steel pipeline that is to operate at a pressure of 125 psig (862 kPa) or more\nmust be strength tested in accordance with this section to substantiate the\nproposed maximum allowable operating pressure. (b) The test pressure shall be at least equal\nto 90 percent of SMYS or 1.5 times the maximum allowable operating pressure\nwhichever is less. (c) The test\nmedium may be water, inert gas or air. For facilities to be operated above 20\npercent SMYS in any class location or facilities to be operated at 125 psig\n(862 kPa) or more in a Class 4 location the medium may only be water unless\nthere are no buildings intended for human occupancy within 300 feet (91.4\nmeters) of the pipeline facilities being tested and prior approval is granted\nby the department to use air or inert gas as the test medium. (d) Except as provided in subdivisions (f)\nand (g) of this section, the strength test must be conducted by maintaining the\npressure at or above the test pressure for at least 12 hours after\nstabilization. (e) A calibrated\nrecording pressure gauge that will indicate increments of five psig (34.5 kPa)\nor less, where practicable, shall be attached to the test section. The gauge\nmust be calibrated at least hourly for the first and last two hours of the\ntest. Calibration is against a dead-weight tester, or equivalent device, attached to the test section. (f) For a short length of pipeline which has not been backfilled and where, throughout its entire length, its entire circumference can be readily examined\nvisually for the detection of leakage, the duration of the test may be reduced\nto four hours following stabilization. (g) At least five business days prior to\nstarting the test, the operator shall make notification. In order to maintain\ncontinuity of service during emergencies, shorter notice is\npermissible. (h) Tests under this\nsection are not considered as satisfactorily accomplished unless certified by\nan inspector of the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.505\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
