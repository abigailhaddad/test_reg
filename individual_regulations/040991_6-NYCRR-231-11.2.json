  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-11.2 - Reasonable possibility requirements for insignificant modifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nrequirements of this section do not apply if potential-to-emit is used in lieu\nof projected actual emissions in determining the project emission potential for\na proposed modification. (b) For a\nmodification with a project emission potential which, when added to all\nemissions excluded under section\n231-4.1\n(b)(42)(i)\n('c') of this Part, is less than 50 percent of the applicable significant\nproject threshold in table 3, table 4 or table 6 of Subpart 231-13 of this\n\nPart, the facility owner or operator, in addition to complying with any\nrequirements under Part 201 of this Title, must maintain the following\ninformation for a minimum of five years: (1)\na description of the modification; (2)\nan identification of each new or modified\nemission source(s) including the associated processes and emission\nunit; (3)\nthe calculation of the\nproject emission potential for each modified emission source(s) including\nsupporting documentation; and\n(4)\nthe date the modification commenced operation. These recordkeeping requirements apply to exempt and\ntrivial activities but do not affect their exempt or trivial permitting status\nunder Subpart 201-3 of this Title. (c) For a modification with a project\nemission potential which, when added to any emissions excluded in accordance\nwith section\n231-4.1\n(b)(42)(i)\n('c') of this Part, equals or exceeds 50 percent of the applicable significant\nproject threshold in table 3, table 4 or table 6 of Subpart 231-13 of this Part\nand the project emission potential is less than the applicable significant\nproject threshold, the facility owner or operator must submit an application to\nmodify the facility permit under the minor permit provisions of Subpart 201-6\nof this Title, and must: (1)\nmaintain the\nfollowing information for a minimum of five years: (i) a description of the\nmodification; (ii)\nan\nidentification of each new or modified emission source(s) including the\nassociated processes and emission unit; (iii)\nthe calculation of the project emission\npotential for each modified emission source(s) including supporting\ndocumentation; and\n(iv)\nthe date\nthe modification commenced operation. (2)\nmonitor the emissions of each regulated\nNSR contaminant from the emission source(s) that will increase as a result of\nthe modification, and calculate and maintain a record of the annual emissions, in tons per year on a calendar year basis, for a period of five years following\nresumption of regular operations after the modification, or for a period of 10\nyears following resumption of regular operations after the change if the\nmodification increases the design capacity of or potential to emit the\nregulated NSR contaminant at such emission source(s). The calculation of actual\nemissions must use the same methodology that was used in the application for\nthe project; and\n(3)\nsubmit a\nreport to the department within 30 days after the end of each year during which\nrecords must be generated in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision. The report must contain: (i) the name, address, and telephone number of the major facility; (ii)\nthe annual emissions as calculated\npursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\na comparison of actual annual emissions\nto the projected actual emissions and, if applicable, an explanation as to why\nthe actual annual emissions exceeded the projected actual emissions.
