  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-9.5 - Additional facility closure requirements for above ground disposal\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Facility\nclosure of land disposal facilities that have above ground disposal units must\ninclude measures to: (1)\nprotect the above\nground disposal unit against frost, weathering, and erosion of its\nfoundation; (2)\nprovide resistance\nto the infiltration of water into the above ground disposal unit; (3)\ndirect surface water away from the above\nground disposal unit and the waste; (4)\nprovide an additional barrier to the\nrelease of radionuclides into the environment; and\n(5)\nprotect against inadvertent intrusion, if\nrequired by section\n382.33\n(a) or\n382.34\nof this Title. (b) To meet the requirements of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, the permittee may either: (1)\ncover the disposal units as described in\nsubdivision (c) of this section; or\n(2)\npropose alternative measures that will\nmeet the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) through (5) of this section and\ndemonstrate to the department that, with those measures in effect, the\naboveground disposal units will meet the performance objectives after\ninstitutional control ends. (c) The requirements of subdivision (a) of\nthis section may be met by backfilling around the sides of the aboveground\ndisposal units and installing a multilayer earthen cover, in accordance with\nsection\n383-7.6\n(c) of this\n\nPart, over the disposal units and the backfill. To minimize the potential for a\nbuildup of water against the sides of the disposal unit, the backfill material\nmust be free draining with a permeability greater than 1 x 10-4 centimeters per\nsecond and must be of sufficient height and extent to support the cover. The\ncover must be of sufficient extent to direct infiltrating or percolating water\naway from the disposal units. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-9.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
