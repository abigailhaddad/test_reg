  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.7 - New York tax guidances (NYT-Gs)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nNew York tax guidances are informational\nstatements of the division's interpretation of the Tax Law and regulations and\nare based on a particular set of facts. Tax guidances consist of redacted\nversions of selected letters and memoranda and responses to withdrawn petitions\nfor advisory opinion. (2)\n\nNew York\ntax guidances are accurate on the date they are issued and are limited to the\nfacts set forth therein. A tax guidance is based on the statutes, regulations, and judicial and Tax Appeals Tribunal precedent in effect on the date the tax\nguidance is issued or in effect for the specific time period at issue in the\ntax guidance. Any changes in these legal authorities or in division policies\nafter the date the tax guidance is issued may affect the conclusions stated\ntherein. (b) Dissemination. New York tax guidances are published by the division and widely\ndisseminated. Tax guidances are provided to all taxpayers and tax practitioners\nwho have requested to be notified when a tax guidance is issued. Tax guidances\nare distributed, or otherwise made available, to all personnel of the division\nand are available on the department's website. (c) Force and effect. New York tax guidances\nare advisory in nature and are merely explanatory. Accordingly, tax guidances\ndo not have legal force or effect, do not set precedent, and are not binding. They are vehicles to assist taxpayers and others to understand the law and\nregulations and promote voluntary compliance. New York tax guidances are\ncurrent as of the date issued. Subsequent judicial decisions, Tax Appeals\n\nTribunal decisions, or changes in the law, regulations, or division policies\ncould affect the validity of the information presented in a New York tax\nguidance. New York tax guidances are not generally modified, but are retained\nto indicate the division's policies at the time of issuance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
