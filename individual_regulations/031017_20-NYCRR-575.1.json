  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1401, 1402, 1405-B\nAs used in this Part, unless otherwise expressly stated, the terms set forth in this section are defined as follows: (a) Person\nmeans an\nindividual, partnership, society, association, joint stock company, corporation, estate, receiver, trustee, assignee, referee or any other person\nacting in a fiduciary or representative capacity, whether appointed by a court\nor otherwise, any combination of individuals, and any other form of\nunincorporated enterprise owned or conducted by two or more persons. (b) Controlling interest\nmeans: (1)\nin the case of a corporation, either fifty percent or more of the total combined voting power of all classes\nof stock of such corporation, or fifty percent or more of the capital, profits\nor beneficial interest in such voting stock of such corporation; and\n(2)\nin the case of a partnership, association, trust or other entity, fifty percent or more of the capital, profits or beneficial interest in such partnership, association, trust or other\nentity. (See section\n575.6\nof\nthis Part.)\n(c) Real property\nmeans every estate or right, legal or equitable, present or future, vested or contingent, in lands, tenements or hereditaments, including buildings, structures and other improvements thereon, which are\nlocated in whole or in part within the State of New York. It does not include\nrights to sepulture. (d) (1)\n\nConsideration means the price actually\npaid or required to be paid for the real property or interest therein, including payment for an option or contract to purchase real property, whether\nor not expressed in the deed and whether paid or required to be paid by money, property, or any other thing of value. It includes the cancellation or\ndischarge of an indebtedness or obligation. It also includes the amount of any\nmortgage, purchase money mortgage, lien or other encumbrance, whether or not\nthe underlying indebtedness is assumed or taken subject to. However, consideration does not include the amount of any lien or encumbrance remaining\nthereon at the time of sale where the conveyance involves a one-, two-, or\nthree-family house or individual residential condominium unit or where the\nconsideration for the conveyance is less than $500,000. With respect to any\nconveyance of stock in a cooperative housing corporation in connection with the\ngrant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold by the owner thereof, other than\nthe original conveyance of stock by the cooperative housing corporation or the\ncooperative plan sponsor, where the property is an individual residential unit, the consideration for the interest conveyed will exclude the amount of any\nliens on certificates of stock or other evidences of an ownership interest in\nand a proprietary lease from a corporation or partnership, formed for the\npurpose of cooperative ownership of residential interest in real estate\nremaining thereon at the time of conveyance. No exclusion is made on account of\nany lien or encumbrance placed upon the property in connection with the\nconveyance, or by reason of deferred payments of the purchase price whether\nrepresented by notes or otherwise. Example 1: A three-family house is sold for $850,000. The grantee\nassumed an existing $200,000 mortgage, obtained an additional $550,000 mortgage\nfrom a bank and paid $100,000 in cash. The tax is imposed upon $650,000, because the $850,000 consideration is reduced by the $200,000 mortgage which\nremained on the qualifying residential property at the time of the sale. However, the $850,000 cannot be reduced by the new $550,000 mortgage obtained\nby the grantee in connection with the sale. The result would have been the same\nif the grantee had purchased the property subject to an existing $200,000\nmortgage which remained on the property at the time of the sale. Example 2: A commercial building is sold for $800,000. The grantee\nassumed an existing $300,000 mortgage and paid $500,000 in cash. The tax is\nimposed on the entire $800,000 because the consideration exceeds $500,000 and\nthe building is not qualifying residential property. No exclusion is allowed\nfor the existing $300,000 mortgage. The result would have been the same if the\ngrantee had purchased the property subject to an existing $300,000 mortgage\nand/or obtained an additional mortgage with respect to the\n$500,000. (2)\n\nIn the case of\na creation of a leasehold interest or the granting of an option with use and\noccupancy of real property, consideration includes, but is not limited to: (i) the present value of the rental and other\npayments attributable to the use and occupancy of the real property or interest\ntherein; (ii)\nthe amount paid for\nan option to purchase or renew; and\n(iii)\nthe present value of rental or other\npayments attributable to the exercise of any option to renew. (3)\n\nIn the case of a creation of a\nsubleasehold interest, consideration includes, but is not limited to: (i) the present value of the sublease rental\npayments attributable to the use and occupancy of the real property; (ii)\nthe amount paid for an option to renew; and\n(iii)\nthe present value of\nrental or other payments attributable to the exercise of any option to renew, less the present value of the remaining prime lease rental payments required to\nbe made. (4)\n\nIn the case\nof the transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest in any entity that\nowns real property, consideration means the fair market value of the real\nproperty or interest therein, apportioned based on the percentage of the\nownership interest transferred or acquired in the entity. Example: An individual purchased fifty percent of the stock of the\nABC corporation which owned real property with a fair market value of $300,000. The ABC corporation would compute the transfer tax due on this conveyance of an\ninterest in real property based upon consideration of $150,000 ($300,000 × 50\npercent). (5)\n\nIn the case of\nan assignment or surrender of a leasehold interest or the assignment or\nsurrender of an option or contract to purchase real property, consideration\ndoes not include the present value of the remaining rental payments required to\nbe made pursuant to the terms of such lease or the amount to be paid for the\nreal property pursuant to the terms of the option or contract being assigned or\nsurrendered. Example: A leases real property to B for a term of 20 years. The\nlease does not contain any option to purchase the real property. In year five\nof the lease, B assigns its leasehold interest to C for $100,000. B owes\ntransfer tax on the assignment. The tax is computed on consideration of\n$100,000. (6)\n\nIn the case of\n(i) the original conveyance of shares of stock in a cooperative housing\ncorporation in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary leasehold\nby the cooperative corporation or cooperative plan sponsor and (ii) the\nsubsequent conveyance by the onwer thereof of such stock in a cooperative\nhousing corporation in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary\nleasehold for a cooperative unit other than an individual residential unit, consideration includes a proportionate share of the unpaid principal of the\nmortgage on the real property of the cooperative housing corporation comprising\nthe cooperative dwelling or dwellings. Such share is determined by multiplying\nthe total unpaid principal of the mortgage by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the number of shares of stock in the cooperative housing corporation\nbeing conveyed in connection with the grant or transfer of a proprietary\nleasehold and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of stock\nin the cooperative housing corporation. (7)\n\nWhen a grantor agrees to extend the\nclosing date of the contract in return for an additional sum of money, the\nadditional sum of money is included as consideration unless the following\ncriteria are met: (i) The agreement between\nthe grantor and grantee must state that the payment is for the time\ndelay. (ii)\n\nThe amount of money\nmust be reasonable for the length of delay. (e) (1)\n\nConveyance\nmeans the transfer or transfers of any interest in\nreal property by any method, including but not limited to sale, exchange, assignment, surrender, mortgage foreclosure, transfer in lieu of foreclosure, option, trust indenture, taking by eminent domain, conveyance upon liquidation\nor by a receiver, or transfer or acquisition of a controlling interest in any\nentity with an interest in real property. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, conveyance\nof real property does not include a conveyance pursuant to devise, bequest or\ninheritance; the creation, modification, extension, spreading, severance, consolidation, assignment, transfer, release or satisfaction of a mortgage; a\nmortgage subordination agreement, a mortgage severance agreement, an instrument\ngiven to perfect or correct a recorded mortgage; or a release of lien of tax\npursuant to the Tax Law or the Internal Revenue Code. (f) Interest in the real\nproperty\nincludes title in fee, a leasehold interest, a beneficial\ninterest, an encumbrance, development rights, air space and air rights, or any\nother interest with the right to use or occupancy of real property or the right\nto receive rents, profits or other income derived from real property. It also\nincludes an option or contract to purchase real property. It does not include a\nright of first refusal to purchase real property. (g) Grantor\nmeans the person\nmaking the conveyance of real property or interest therein. Where the\nconveyance consists of a transfer or an acquisition of a controlling interest\nin an entity with an interest in real property, grantor\nmeans\nthe entity with an interest in real property or a shareholder or partner\ntransferring stock or partnership interest, respectively. (h) Grantee\nmeans the person\nwho obtains real property or interest therein as a result of a\nconveyance. (i) Recording\nofficer\nmeans the county clerk of the county, except in a county\nhaving a registrar, where it means the registrar of the county, or in the City\nof New York where it means the city registrar. (j) Commissioner\nmeans the\n\nCommissioner of Taxation and Finance or his or her delegates. (k) Department\nmeans the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (l) Fair market value\nmeans\nthe amount that a willing buyer would pay a willing seller for real property. It is generally determined by a appraisal based upon the value of the real\nproperty at the time of conveyance. It is not net fair market value, which is\nfair market value less the amount of any mortgages on the property. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
