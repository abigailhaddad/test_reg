  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 670.15 - Calendar preference; calendar notice; oral argument; post-argument submissions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Oral argument. A maximum of 15 minutes shall be allowed for argument\nto each attorney who has filed a brief, except as set forth in subdivision (b)\nof this section. (b) Argument proscribed. Argument is not permitted on issues involving\nmaintenance; spousal support; child support; counsel fees; the legality, propriety or excessiveness of sentences; determinations made pursuant to the\nsex offender registration act; grand jury reports; and calendar and practice\nmatters including but not limited to preferences, bills of particulars, correction of pleadings, examinations before trial, physical examinations, discovery of records, interrogatories, change of venue, and transfers of\nactions to and from the Supreme Court. (c) Who may argue. Not more than one attorney shall be heard for each\nbrief filed unless, upon application made in writing at least seven days before\nthe matter appears on the court's calendar, the court shall have granted\npermission to allow more than one attorney to argue. (d) Adjournment of oral\nargument. After filing a brief and until a matter has been\nplaced on the court's calendar, counsel shall advise the court, in writing and\non a continuing basis, of commitments that will interfere with counsel's\nability to appear on a particular date. Requests for leave to adjourn oral\nargument of an appeal or proceeding which appears on the court's calendar are\nstrongly disfavored. Such requests may be granted only where unusual\ncircumstances are present, as explained in a writing in which counsel indicates\nwhy he or she cannot appear for oral argument, why no other attorney can appear\nin his or her place, and why oral argument is necessary. Requests for leave to\nadjourn oral argument of an appeal or proceeding are within the discretion of\nthe court. (e) Submission. A party who originally elected to argue may notify\nthe clerk of the intention to submit the cause without argument and need not\nappear at the call of the calendar. (f) Rebuttal. Rebuttal argument shall not be permitted, except with\nleave of the court given at the time of argument. (g) Citations to recent\nauthority. After a cause has been placed on the calendar and\nprior to argument or submission of that cause, any party who previously\nsubmitted a brief may inform the court by letter, a copy of which is\ncontemporaneously provided to the other parties to the appeal, of the citation\nto any decisions, statutes, ordinances, rules, regulations, or other similar\nmatter not previously cited in that party's brief which arose subsequent to the\nfiling thereof, without additional argument. Except for good cause shown, the\ncourt will not accept precedent at the call of the calendar where a copy\nthereof has not previously been given to the other parties. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n670.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
