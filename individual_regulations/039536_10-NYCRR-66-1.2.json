For the purposes of this definition, the term\n\nNew York City Department of Health\nand\n\nMental Hygiene\nshall mean such agency or any successor agency responsible for the CIR. (3)\n\nHealth care provider\nfor the purposes of this section shall mean any person authorized by law to order an immunization or any health care facility licensed under article 28 of the Public Health Law or any certified home health agency established under section\n3606\nof the Public Health Law. (4)\n\nDesignees\nshall mean individuals, acting under the authority of a health care provider or another category of authorized user, who have been specifically delegated responsibility to access NYSIIS or the CIR and perform the functions permitted the primary authorized user. (5)\n\nEmancipated minors\nshall mean those children less than 18 years of age who by virtue of a court decision declaring them emancipated, or who because they are otherwise emancipated under the law, are able to make their own decisions regarding health care services. (6)\n\nRegistrants shall mean all individuals for whom an immunization or exemption to immunization or blood lead analysis is recorded in the system, at any time following January 1, 2008 for NYSIIS and January 1, 1994 for the CIR.

An authorized user in a category below may designate the ability to access the system to others where indicated.

(2)\n\nMandated reporters must report any immunization to a child less than 19 years of age to either NYSIIS or the CIR, depending on the location of administration of the vaccine. (3)\n\nArticle 28 facilities or certified home health agencies established under section\n3606\nof the Public Health Law in which providers are responsible for administration of vaccines may, when agreed to by the facility and the provider ordering the vaccination, assume reporting responsibility for the authorized individuals administering vaccines within their facilities. (4)\nA person who administers but does not order immunizations is not responsible for reporting the immunizations to the system, unless acting as a designee of the health care provider who ordered the immunization and under whose supervision the vaccine was administered. The ordering health care provider remains responsible for supervising his/her designee and ensuring that appropriate and timely reporting occurs. (5)\n\nWhen vaccines are administered based on non-patient specific orders, the health care provider ordering the immunizations shall ensure that required data elements for each vaccination are submitted to NYSIIS or the CIR, depending on the location of administration of the vaccine.

All data elements reported to NYSIIS or the CIR must be submitted electronically except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (i) Direct online entry of immunization information into NYSIIS. Authorized users with read/write access and their designees may submit information directly to the statewide system using their individual access accounts. (ii)\n\nHealth care providers with existing electronic information systems compatible with NYSIIS. Such providers may request, on an individual or group basis, permission to download information from current systems into a department-prescribed file format for transfer directly to NYSIIS. The provider is responsible for the costs/programming needed to effect these data transfers, ensuring that transfers are completed on a timely basis and updating provider-specific data systems when changes are made to these systems. (iii)\n\nHistorical immunization information previously submitted to a regional registry. Health care providers who have submitted immunization records to one of the regional immunization registries (Healthy Shot or Immunization Registry and Information Source [\"IRIS\"]) may authorize submission of this regionally-archived immunization history information to the statewide system. (iv)\n\nSubmission of immunization information to NYSIIS or the CIR. Providers must submit immunization information to NYSIIS or the CIR, dependent upon the IIS operating in the area in which they practice, not the IIS appropriate to the patient's area of residence. Exchange of information between IIS's will be the responsibility of NYSIIS and the CIR. (3)\n\nExceptions to reporting requirements to NYSIIS. (i) Hospitals participating in the statewide perinatal data system are exempted from entering immunization information directly into NYSIIS for newborns during their initial hospital stay.

Providers ordering immunizations must submit immunization information to NYSIIS or the CIR within 14 days of administration of the immunization. Providers must also submit information regarding immunizations not previously reported for each registrant. For NYSIIS only: (i) Providers must submit any missing information requested by NYSIIS within 14 days of the issuance of the request. (ii)\n\nFor individuals exempt from administration of vaccines, providers must submit patient information, including the reason that such immunization may be detrimental to the child's health, as defined in subdivision (l) of section\n66-1.1\nof this Subpart, to the statewide immunization information system within 14 days following the in-person clinical interaction that occurs at or after what would normally have been the due date for administration of an age-appropriate immunization to that child, according to current national immunization recommendations\n(d) Allowable access levels and permitted uses of NYSIIS and/or CIR data by authorized users specific to the organization they are representing.
