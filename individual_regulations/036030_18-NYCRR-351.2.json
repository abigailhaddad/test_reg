All resources, except one vehicle which\nis evaluated as described in section\n352.23\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Title, shall be evaluated according to their equity value. Equity value\nmeans fair market value less encumbrances (legal debts). (1)\n\nFinancial resources.

Such screening will be performed at the time of application and\nperiodically thereafter, unless the recipient is actively participating in\nsubstance use disorder treatment in accordance with the provisions of this\nsubdivision, but no more frequently than every six months, unless the district\nhas reason to believe that an applicant or recipient is misusing or dependent\non alcohol and/or drugs. (ii)\n\nWhen\nthe screening process indicates that there is reason to believe that an\napplicant or recipient is misusing or dependent on alcohol or drugs, or there\nis other evidence that an applicant or recipient is misusing or dependent on\nalcohol or drugs, the local district must require the applicant or recipient to\nundergo a formal substance use disorder assessment, which may include drug\ntesting, to be performed by substance use disorder professional credentialed by\nthe Office of Addiction Services and Supports. The assessment may be performed\ndirectly by the district or pursuant to contract with the district. (iii)\n\nIf the formal assessment determines\nthat the applicant or recipient is unable to work by reason of his or her need\nfor treatment for substance use disorder, or the applicant or recipient has\nbeen ordered to participate in substance use disorder treatment by a court of\ncompetent jurisdiction, the social services official must refer the individual\nto an appropriate substance use disorder treatment program. (iv)\n\nTo be considered an appropriate\ntreatment program, the treatment program must: (a) be licensed or certified by the Office of\n\nAddiction Services and Supports or operated by the United States Department of\n\nVeterans Affairs and be determined by the social services official to meet the\nrehabilitation needs of the individual, in accordance with standards developed\nby the Office of Addiction Services and Supports; (b) develop a treatment plan for the\nindividual which includes an expected date of availability for work related\nactivities and provide a copy of such plan to the local district responsible\nfor payment, in a manner consistent with 41 CFR part\n2; (c) provide at a minimum of every three\nmonths, a treatment progress report for each recipient of public assistance to\nthe local district responsible for payment of public assistance benefits; and\n(d) request approval by the\nlocal district responsible for payment of public assistance benefits prior to\nchanging an individual's level of treatment care. (v) If the local district is responsible for\npayment of treatment, the district can require in- district treatment, provided\nan appropriate treatment program is available. When residential treatment is\nappropriate for a single custodial parent, the social services official must\nmake diligent efforts to refer the parent to a program that would allow the\nfamily to remain intact for the duration of the treatment. (vi)\nA person who fails to participate in the\nscreening or in the assessment is ineligible for public assistance. Other\nmembers of a household which includes a person who has failed to participate in\nthe screening or assessment must, if otherwise eligible, receive public\nassistance only through non-cash safety net assistance. (vii)\n\nIf a person required to participate in\ntreatment pursuant to this subdivision fails to consent to disclosure of\nnecessary treatment information by the treatment program to the social services\ndistrict, or subsequently revokes such consent, such person will be ineligible\nfor public assistance. Other members of the household which includes such\nperson will, if otherwise eligible, receive public assistance only through\nnon-cash safety net assistance. (2)\n\nRehabilitation services. (i) A person referred to, or participating\nin, a treatment program pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and the\nhousehold in which he or she resides will receive non-cash safety net\nassistance while the person is participating in such treatment program, if the\nhousehold is otherwise eligible for public assistance. If a person referred to\ntreatment cannot participate in that treatment because treatment is not\npresently available, that person and the household in which he or she resides\nwill receive non-cash safety net assistance if the household is otherwise\neligible for public assistance. (ii)\n\nLocal districts are required to monitor\ntreatment progress at a minimum of every three months. (iii)\n\nIf an applicant for or recipient of\npublic assistance is required to participate in an appropriate rehabilitation\nprogram and fails to participate in such program without good cause or leaves\nsuch program prior to completion of the program without good cause, or if an\napplicant or recipient has been suspended from the receipt of social security\ndisability benefits or supplemental security income benefits by reason of\nnoncompliance with requirements of the Federal social security administration\nfor treatment for substance abuse or alcohol abuse, the person must be\ndisqualified from receiving public assistance for the time periods set forth\nbelow. Failure to participate in such program is defined as failure to comply\nwith the established treatment plan including scheduled treatment sessions. The\napplicant or recipient is required to document compliance with the treatment\nplan. The question of whether the applicant or recipient has completed the\nprogram will be determined solely by using the guidelines and rules of the\nrehabilitation program. (a) For the first\nfailure to participate in or complete the program or to comply with the\nrequirements of the Federal social security administration, until the failure\nceases or for 45 days, whichever period of time is longer. (b) For the second such failure, until the\nfailure ceases or for 120 days, whichever period of time is longer. (c) For the third and subsequent failures, the person is disqualified until the failure ceases or for 180 days, whichever\nperiod is longer. The household in which the person resides will continue\nto receive non-cash safety net assistance, if otherwise\neligible. (iv)\n\nThe\napplicant or recipient must be considered to have good cause for failing to\nparticipate or failing to complete a rehabilitation program when: (a) the local district, the facility and the\napplicant or recipient agree that the applicant or recipient is in need of a\ndifferent program than the one to which he or she was referred or which he or\nshe is attending and the applicant or recipient has enrolled in a\nrehabilitation program which the local district has determined appropriate; or\n(b) a verified unforeseen\ncircumstance occurs that is beyond the applicant's or recipient's control such\nas illness or a death in the family. (v) Persons disqualified from receiving\npublic assistance pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph who would\notherwise be eligible for public assistance and who return to required\ntreatment prior to the end of the disqualification period and are receiving\ncare in an Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse certified congregate care\n\nLevel II facility, as defined in section\n352.8\nof this Title or United\n\nStates Veterans Hospital residential treatment program, are eligible for\nnon-cash safety net assistance. (vi)\n\nIf a recipient required to participate\nin an appropriate treatment program receives a personal needs allowance, such\nallowance must be made as a restricted payment to the treatment program and\nmust be a conditional payment. If such recipient leaves the treatment program\nprior to completion of the program, any accumulated personal needs allowance\nmust be considered an overpayment and returned to the local district which\nprovided the personal needs allowance. (3)\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, an\nadult is any individual in the household who is 18 years of age or over who is\napplying for or in receipt of public assistance, except an individual 18 years\nof age who is a full-time student regularly attending a secondary school, or in\nthe equivalent level of vocational or technical training.

(2)\n\nAny individual during\nthe 10-year period that begins on the date the individual is convicted in\n\nFederal or State court of having made a fraudulent statement or representation\nwith respect to his or her place of residence in order to receive public\nassistance, medical assistance or food stamps simultaneously from two or more\nstates, or supplemental security income in two or more states.

(4)\n\nAny individual who is a minor child who\nhas been or is expected to be absent from the home of his or her parent or\nother caretaker relative for a consecutive period of 45 days or more without\ngood cause. In addition, no assistance may be given to any parent or other\ncaretaker relative who fails to notify the social services district of the\nabsence of the minor child within five days after it becomes clear to the\nparent or relative that the child will be absent for a consecutive period of 45\ndays or more.
