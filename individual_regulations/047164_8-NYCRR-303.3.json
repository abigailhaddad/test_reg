  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 303.3 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n\nApplication for payment of moving expenses and for any\nincidental expenses and supplemental relocation payments shall be made to the\ntrustees of the State University of New York acting by and through the office\nof university land acquisition, hereinafter referred to as \"the trustees,\" upon\nforms prescribed by said office and shall be accompanied by such information\nand evidence as said office may require and payment of such will be made to\neligible persons under the circumstances and to the extent set forth\nbelow. (a) General provisions\napplicable to both residential and commercial relocations. (1)\n\nWhen property appropriation maps have\nbeen filed in the Department of State and the occupant of the property has been\nnotified of such pending acquisition by the State, the eligible persons are\nauthorized to proceed with the relocation. (2)\n\nMoving expenses shall not include the\ncost of moving any fixtures or equipment considered part of the realty from the\nacquired property nor will reimbursement be made for any cost of construction\nor improvement to the new location or for any remodeling, redecorating or\nreinforcing of the new structure to accommodate the eligible person or his\npersonal property. (3)\n\nIn case of a\npartial taking by the State, removal from the area being acquired to a\nremainder area shall be considered a relocation eligible for the collection of\nmoving expenses if removal of personal property of an eligible person is\nnecessary. (4)\n\nMoving expenses\nshall not include any indirect losses or any losses due to\nnegligence. (5)\n\nWhere an eligible\nindividual or family occupies bona fide living quarters on the same premises as\na business concern (including the operation of a farm), they may be considered\nas a separate eligible person in determining the amount of payment for\nresidential moving expenses. (6)\n\nAfter an eligible person has vacated the property, no moving expense payments\nwill thereafter be made to any party with respect to the subsequent occupancy\nof the same property. (7)\n\nIn\naddition to residential or commercial moving expenses, as herein provided, any\nowner of any property acquired by the trustees shall be reimbursed for\nincidental expenses as defined in this Part. (8)\n\nIn a case where advance payment of moving\nexpenses or supplemental relocation payments are requested on the basis of\nhardship, the claimant must submit in advance a written application setting\nforth the full extent and circumstances of the hardship. A written\ndetermination will then be made by the trustees. If the trustees determine that\na hardship exists, an advance payment of reasonable, necessary moving expenses\nor supplemental relocation payments will be made. The trustees may rely upon\nbids from reputable movers when making an advance payment of moving expenses\nand upon a signed contract for the purchase of a replacement property or a\nsigned lease or other acceptable firm commitment for a rental unit when\ndetermining the good faith of an eligible person in making advance supplemental\nrelocation payments. (9)\n\nIf a\nclaimant is not satisfied with the trustees determination of his eligibility\nfor the moving expense or relocation payment claimed, he may request a\nconference with the director of the office of land acquisition and submit\nwhatever evidence he wishes in support of his position. A written determination\nof the final decision will then be directed to the claimant with a full\nexplanation of the basis of the determination. (b) General provisions applicable only\nto commercial moves. (1)\n\nThe moving\nexpenses payment in the case of an owner or tenant of a business concern\n(including the operation of a farm) shall be the amount of their actual\nreasonable and necessary moving expenses plus a contingency allowance of five\npercent of that amount as well as reimbursement for any incidental expenses\nresulting from the acquisition. (i) Any\nmoving expense payment, including an advance payment based upon hardship, for\nactual reasonable and necessary moving expenses shall be within the limits of\nbids from at least one reputable mover to be furnished by the business concern\nor farm operation, and when the trustees deem it advisable, upon inventories\nwhich the trustees shall cause to be taken on or about the vesting date and\nimmediately preceding the relocation. (2)\n\nIn lieu of actual reasonable and\nnecessary moving expenses, as set forth in section\n303.5\nof this Part, an owner or\ntenant of a business concern (including a farm operation) who discontinues or\nrelocates, may elect to receive a fixed relocation payment of $5,000 or the\namount of his average annual net earnings, whichever is the lesser, subject to\nthe following conditions: (i) A business\nconcern must show, to the satisfaction of the trustees, that a substantial loss\nof existing patronage as defined in this Part would occur upon dislocation and\nthat it is not part of a chain of even one other similar business not being\nacquired by the State or Federal government. (ii)\nA farm operator, to be eligible, must\nshow to the satisfaction of the trustees that the relocation or discontinuance\nof the farm operation was necessitated by the acquisition.

(3)\n\nThe eligible\nindividual or family must notify the trustees in writing at least three weeks\nbefore the actual move of a selection of payment on the basis of actual\nreasonable and necessary moving expenses or the fixed, room-count, lump-sum\ndislocation allowance. (4)\n\nIn case\nof failure to notify the trustees as provided above, it will be assumed that\nthe eligible individual or family waives the right of selection and will be\npaid a lump-sum amount based on the counted-room schedule as set forth in\nsection\n303.4, plus the dislocation\nallowance of $100. (5)\n\nWhere more\nthan one individual or family occupy the same residential quarters and move to\nseparate locations, each such individual or family may qualify for moving\nexpenses, incidental expenses and supplemental relocation payments as provided\nin this Part. (6)\n\nIn those cases\nwhere a multiple dwelling is acquired, a finder's fee payment may be made to an\neligible owner or tenant, when in the discretion of the trustees, such fees are\ndetermined to be a usual, customary and necessary expense for relocating in the\nlocality involved. The finder's fee shall be reimbursed only when relocation is\nmade within three months of the State's written request to vacate.

(1)\n\nIn the case\nof a mobile home on an individual lot or in a typical mobile home park, where\nsuch mobile home is attached to service lines such as water, gas, electric and\nsewage and occupies space on a weekly, monthly or term lease basis, the owner\nof such mobile home, when required to remove the mobile home to clear the site\nof a project, is eligible for payment to move his mobile home, equipment and\nappurtenances from the premises. Such payment will be made only upon the basis\nof detailed, receipted bills or such other evidence of expenses incurred deemed\nacceptable to the trustees. (2)\n\nProviding an agreement of adjustment, purchase or partial payment is made with\nthe owner of a mobile home which has been acquired by the State as real\nproperty and the mobile home is returned to the owner under the agreement as\npart of the consideration in the claim, no allowance for moving expenses will\nbe made to the owner upon the removal of the entire mobile home including all\npersonal property from the premises unless it is necessary to remove\nsubstantially all of their personal effects, houseshold equipment and furniture\nfrom the mobile home before it is moved, in which case actual necessary moving\nexpenses may be allowed if substantiated by detailed, receipted bills or by\nsuch other evidence as may be acceptable to the trustees. Such owner-occupant\nwill be eligible for supplemental relocation payments. (3)\n\nIn the event that a mobile home is\nacquired as part of the realty and compensated as such, and such owner-occupant\nor tenant relocates from such mobile home, he shall be eligible to receive\ncompensation for actual reasonable and necessary moving expenses based upon\nreceipted bills acceptable to the trustees or in accordance with a room-count, lump-sum payment as set forth in this Part.
