  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.5 - Motion practice\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. To better enable the parties to expeditiously resolve the controversy, this Part permits an application to the tribunal and to an administrative law\njudge for an order, known as a motion. Motions for costs or disbursements or\nmotions related to discovery procedures as provided for in the CPLR will not be\nentertained. With the exception of motions filed pursuant to section\n3000.9\nof this Part, the tribunal and the administrative law judge shall be guided but\nnot bound by the CPLR in resolving motions made pursuant to this\n\nPart. (b) Procedure for filing a\nmotion. A motion to the tax appeals tribunal shall be addressed to and filed\nwith the secretary. All other motions shall be addressed to and filed with the\nadministrative law judge assigned to the proceeding or, if an administrative\nlaw judge has not been assigned, to the supervising administrative law judge. All motions shall be made in writing, except that oral motions may be made at\nhearings or in exceptional circumstances with permission of the secretary or\nthe supervising administrative law judge. A copy of each written motion shall\nbe served on the adverse party. Unless a different time period is otherwise\nprescribed by this Part or by direction of the administrative law judge, the\nadverse party shall have 30 days after the date of service of the motion to\nfile a response and to serve a copy on the moving party. Replies to responses\nwill not be entertained except with permission of the administrative law judge\nor the secretary. Papers may be filed or served as provided in section\n3000.22\nof this Part. (c) Contents. A\nnotice of motion must be typewritten and specify the supporting papers (e.g., affidavits, admissions) upon which the motion is based and, in separate\nnumbered paragraphs, the relief demanded and the grounds for such relief. Any\nbrief shall be filed with the motion and a copy served on the adverse party. Any answering brief must be served with the response to the motion. Oral\nargument is not heard on a motion unless specific application is made for oral\nargument by a party and the administrative law judge or the secretary grants\nthat application. (d) Issuance of\norder. All motions shall be decided on the moving papers, supporting papers and\noral argument, if any. An order by an administrative law judge or by the\ntribunal will be issued within ninety days after a response has been served or\nthe time to serve a response has expired. With notice to the parties, the time\nperiod for issuing a summary determination may be extended to six\nmonths. (e) Postponement of\nhearing. The filing of a motion does not constitute cause for postponement of a\nhearing from the date set, unless such continuance is specifically ordered by\nthe administrative law judge following receipt of such motion. (f) Review. An order by an administrative law\njudge on any motion which does not finally determine all matters and issues\ncontained in the petition, for purposes of review by the tribunal, shall not be\ndeemed final and conclusive until the administrative law judge shall have\nrendered a determination on the remaining matters and issues. An order by the\ntribunal which does not finally determine all matters and issues contained in\nthe petition, for purposes of review under article 78 of the CPLR, shall not be\ndeemed final and conclusive until the tribunal shall have rendered a decision\non the remaining matters and issues.
