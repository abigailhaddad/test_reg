  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7077.5 - Programming\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon admission\nto a residential rehabilitation unit, program and mental health staff shall\nadminister assessments and develop an individual rehabilitation plan in\nconsultation with the incarcerated individual, based upon the individual's\nmedical, mental health, and programming needs. Such plan shall identify\nspecific goals and programs, treatment, and services to be offered, with\nprojected time frames for completion and discharge from the residential\nrehabilitation unit. (b) Incarcerated individuals admitted to a residential rehabilitation unit shall be\noffered at least six (6) hours of daily out-of-cell congregate programming, services, treatment, recreation, activities and/or meals, with an additional\nminimum of one hour for exercise. Exercise in all residential rehabilitation\nunits shall take place in a congregate setting, unless exceptional\ncircumstances mean doing so would create a significant and unreasonable risk to\nthe safety and security of other incarcerated individuals, staff, or the\nfacility. (c) Incarcerated\nindividuals in residential rehabilitation units shall be offered programming\nled by program or therapeutic staff five (5) days per week, except on\nrecognized state legal holidays. All other out-of-cell time may include\npeer-led programs, time in a dayroom or out-of-cell recreation area with other\npeople, congregate meals, volunteer programs, or other congregate\nactivities. (d) An incarcerated\nindividual in a residential rehabilitation unit shall have access to programs\nand work assignments comparable to core programs and types of work assignments\nin general population. Such incarcerated individuals shall also have access to\nadditional out-of-cell, trauma-informed therapeutic programming aimed at\npromoting personal development, addressing underlying causes of problematic\nbehavior resulting in placement in a residential rehabilitation unit, and\nhelping prepare for discharge from the unit and to the community. (e) If established that an incarcerated\nindividual committed a violent felony act while in a residential rehabilitation\nunit and poses a significant and unreasonable risk to the safety and security\nof other incarcerated individuals or staff, the chief administrative officer\nmay restrict such individual's participation in programming and out-of-cell\nactivities as necessary for the safety of other incarcerated individuals and\nstaff. If such restrictions are imposed, the facility must provide at least\nfour (4) hours out-of-cell time daily, including at least two (2) hours of\ntherapeutic programming and two (2) hours of exercise, and must make reasonable\nefforts to reinstate access to programming as soon as possible. In no case may\nsuch restrictions extend beyond fifteen (15) days unless the individual commits\na new violent felony act justifying restrictions on program access, or if the\nchief administrative officer reasonably determines that the individual poses an\nextraordinary and unacceptable risk of imminent harm to the safety or security\nof incarcerated individuals or staff. Any extension of program restrictions\nbeyond fifteen (15) days must be meaningfully reviewed and approved at least\nevery fifteen (15) days by the chief administrative officer. Each review must\nconsider the impact of therapeutic programming provided during the fifteen (15)\nday period on the individual's risk of imminent harm and the chief\nadministrative officer must articulate in writing, with a copy provided to the\nincarcerated individual, the specific reason why the individual currently poses\nan extraordinary and unacceptable risk of imminent harm to the safety or\nsecurity of other incarcerated individuals or staff. In no case may\nrestrictions imposed by the chief administrative officer extend beyond ninety\n(90) days unless the individual commits a new violent felony act justifying\nrestrictions on program access. (f) Restraints shall not be used when incarcerated individuals are participating in\nout-of-cell activities within a residential rehabilitation unit unless an\nindividual assessment is made that restraints are required because of a\nsignificant and unreasonable risk to the safety and security of other\nincarcerated individuals or staff.
