  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.23 - Drip pads\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraph\n(1)(ii) of this subdivision, the requirements of this section apply to owners\nand operators of facilities that use new or existing drip pads to convey\ntreated wood drippage, precipitation, and/or surface water run-off to an\nassociated collection system. Existing drip pads are those constructed before\n\nDecember 6, 1990 and those for which the owner or operator has a design and has\nentered into binding financial or other agreements for construction prior to\n\nDecember 6, 1990. All other drip pads are new drip pads. The requirement at\nsubparagraph (d)(2)(iii) of this section to install a leak collection system\napplies only to those drip pads that are constructed after December 24, 1992\nfor which the owner or operator has a design and has entered into binding\nfinancial or other agreements for construction prior to December 24, 1992. (ii)\n\nFor F034 and F035 wastes\nas defined in section\n371.4\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Title, subparagraph (i) of this paragraph applies, except that the\nreferenced dates are revised to January 17, 1995. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of any drip pad\nthat is inside or under a structure that provides protection from precipitation\nso that neither runoff nor run-on is generated is not subject to regulation\nunder paragraph (d)(5) or (6) of this section, as appropriate. (3)\n\nThe requirements of this section are not\napplicable to the management of infrequent and accidental drippage in storage\nyards provided that: (i) The owner or\noperator maintains and complies with a written contingency plan that describes\nhow the owner or operator will respond immediately to the discharge of such\ninfrequent and incidental drippage. At a minimum, the contingency plan must\ndescribe how the owner or operator will do the following: (a) clean up the drippage; (b) document the cleanup of the\ndrippage; (c) retain documents\nregarding cleanup for three years; and\n(d) manage the contaminated media in a manner\nconsistent with Federal and New York State regulations. (b) Assessment of\nexisting drip pad integrity. (1)\n\nFor\neach existing drip pad as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, the owner\nor operator must evaluate the drip pad and determine that it meets all of the\nrequirements of this section, except the requirements for liners and leak\ndetection systems of paragraph (d)(2) of this section. No later than the\neffective date of these regulations, the owner or operator must obtain and keep\non file at the facility a written assessment of the drip pad, reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State that attests to the results of the evaluation. The assessment must\nbe reviewed, updated and re-certified annually until all upgrades, repairs, or\nmodifications necessary to achieve compliance with all of the standards of\nsubdivision (d) of this section are complete. The evaluation must document the\nextent to which the drip pad meets each of the design and operating standards\nfor liners and leak detection systems, specified in paragraph (d)(2) of this\nsection. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator\nmust develop a written plan for upgrading, repairing, and modifying the drip\npad to meet the requirements of paragraph (d)(2) of this section, and submit\nthe plan to the commissioner no later than two years before the date that all\nrepairs, upgrades, and modifications are complete. This written plan must\ndescribe all changes to be made to the drip pad in sufficient detail to\ndocument compliance with all the requirements of subdivision (d) of this\nsection. The plan must be reviewed and certified by an independent qualified\nprofessional engineer registered in New York State. (3)\n\nUpon completion of all upgrades, repairs, and modifications, the owner or operator must submit to the commissioner, the\nas-built drawings for the drip pad together with a certification by an\nindependent qualified professional engineer registered in New York State\nattesting that the drip pad conforms to the drawings. (4)\n\nIf the drip pad is found to be leaking or\nunfit for use, the owner or operator must comply with the provisions of\nparagraph (d)(13) of this section or close the drip pad in accordance with\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (c) Design and installation of new drip\npads. Owners and operators of new drip pads must ensure that\nthe pads are designed, installed, and operated in accordance with one of the\nfollowing: (1)\nall of the applicable\nrequirements of subdivisions (d) (except subparagraph [d][1][iv]), (e) and (f)\nof this section; or\n(2)\nall of the\napplicable requirements of subdivisions (d) (except paragraph [d][2]), (e) and\n(f) of this section. (d) Design and operating requirements. (1)\n\nDrip pads must: (i) be constructed of non-earthen materials, excluding wood and non-structurally supported asphalt; (ii)\nbe sloped to free-drain treated wood\ndrippage, rain and other waters, or solutions of drippage and water or other\nwastes to the associated collection system; (iii)\nhave a curb or berm around the\nperimeter; (iv)\n(a) have a hydraulic conductivity of less\nthan or equal to 1 ×- 10\n-7\ncentimeters per\nsecond, e.g., existing concrete drip pads must be sealed, coated, or covered with a surface material with a hydraulic conductivity of\nless than or equal to 1 ×- 10\n-7\ncentimeters\nper second such that the entire surface where drippage occurs or may run across\nis capable of containing such drippage and mixtures of drippage and\nprecipitation, materials, or other wastes while being routed to an associated\ncollection system. This surface material must be maintained free of cracks and\ngaps that could adversely affect its hydraulic conductivity, and the material\nmust be chemically compatible with the preservatives that contact the drip pad. The requirements of this provision apply only to existing drip pads and those\ndrip pads for which the owner or operator elects to comply with paragraph\n(c)(2) instead of paragraph (c)(1) of this section; (b) the owner or operator must obtain and\nkeep on file at the facility a written assessment of the drip pad, reviewed and\ncertified by an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State that attests to the results of the evaluation. The assessment must\nbe reviewed, updated and recertified annually. The evaluation must document the\nextent to which the drip pad meets the design and operating standards of this\nsubdivision, except for paragraph (2) of this subdivision; (v) be of sufficient structural strength and\nthickness to prevent failure due to physical contact, climatic conditions, the\nstress of daily operations, e.g., variable and moving loads\nsuch as vehicle traffic, movement of wood, etc. Note: DEC will generally consider applicable standards\nestablished by professional organizations generally recognized by the industry\nsuch as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) or the American Society of\n\nTesting and Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural integrity requirement of\nthis paragraph. (2)\n\nIf an owner/operator elects to comply\nwith paragraph (c)(1) instead of paragraph (c)(2) of this section, the drip pad\nmust have: (i) A synthetic liner installed\nbelow the drip pad that is designed, constructed, and installed to prevent\nleakage from the drip pad into the adjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or\nsurface water at any time during the active life (including the closure period)\nof the drip pad. The liner must be constructed of materials that will prevent\nwaste from being absorbed into the liner and to prevent releases into the\nadjacent subsurface soil or groundwater or surface water during the active life\nof the facility. The liner must be: (a) constructed of materials that have appropriate chemical properties and\nsufficient strength and thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients\n(including static head and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact\nwith the waste or drip pad leakage to which they are exposed, climatic\nconditions, the stress of installation, and the stress of daily operation\n(including stresses from vehicular traffic on the drip pad); (b) placed upon a foundation or base capable\nof providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above\nand below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression or uplift; and\n(c) installed to cover all surrounding earth that could come in contact with the\nwaste or leakage; and\n(ii)\nA leakage detection system immediately\nabove the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and operated to\ndetect leakage from the drip pad. The leakage detection system must be: (a) constructed of materials that are: (1)\nchemically resistant to the waste managed\nin the drip pad and the leakage that might be generated; and\n(2)\nof sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlaying materials and by any\nequipment used at the drip pad; (b) designed and operated to function without\nclogging through the scheduled closure of the drip pad; and\n(c) designed so that it will detect the\nfailure of the drip pad or the presence of a release of hazardous waste or\naccumulated liquid at the earliest practicable time. (iii)\nA leakage collection system immediately\nabove the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and operated to\ncollect leakage from the drip pad such that it can be removed from below the\ndrippad. The date, time, and quantity of any leakage collected in this system\nand removed must be documented in the operating log. (3)\n\nDrip pads must be maintained such that\nthey remain free of cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other deterioration that could\ncause hazardous waste to be released from the drip pad. Note: See paragraph (13) of this subdivision for remedial\naction required if deterioration or leakage is detected. (4)\n\nThe drip pad and associated collection\nsystem must be designed and operated to convey, drain, and collect liquid\nresulting from drippage or precipitation in order to prevent run-off. (5)\n\nUnless protected by a structure, as\ndescribed in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndesign, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of\npreventing flow onto the drip pad during peak discharge from at least a\n24-hour, 25-year storm, unless the system has sufficient excess capacity to\ncontain any run-off that might enter the system. (6)\n\nUnless protected by a structure or cover\nas described in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, the owner or operator must\ndesign, construct, operate and maintain a run-off management system to collect\nand control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year\nstorm. (7)\n\nThe drip pad must be\nevaluated to determine that it meets the requirements of paragraphs (1) through\n(6) of this subdivision and the owner or operator must obtain a statement from\nan independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New York State\ncertifying that the drip pad design meets the requirements of this\nsection. (8)\n\nDrippage and\naccumulated precipitation must be removed from the associated collection system\nas necessary to prevent overflow onto the drip pad. (9)\n\nThe drip pad surface must be cleaned\nthoroughly in a manner and frequency such that accumulated residues of\nhazardous waste or other materials that are removed, with residues being\nproperly managed as hazardous waste, so as to allow weekly inspections of the\nentire drip pad surface without interference or hinderance from accumulated\nresidues of hazardous waste or other materials on the drip pad. The owner or\noperator must document the date and time of each cleaning and the cleaning\nprocedure used in the facility's operating log. The owner/operator must\ndetermine if the residues are hazardous as per section\n372.2\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title and, if so, must manage them under Parts 370 through 374 and Part\n376 of this Title and section 3010 of RCRA. (10)\n\nDrip pads must be operated and\nmaintained in a manner to minimize tracking of hazardous waste or hazardous\nwaste constituents off the drip pad as a result of activities by personnel or\nequipment. (11)\n\nAfter being removed\nfrom the treatment vessel, treated wood from pressure and non- pressure\nprocesses must be held on the drip pad until drippage has ceased. The owner or\noperator must maintain records sufficient to document that all treated wood is\nheld on the pad following treatment in accordance with this\nrequirement. (12)\n\nCollection and\nholding units associated with run-on and runoff control systems must be emptied\nor otherwise managed as soon as possible after storms to maintain design\ncapacity of the system. (13)\n\nThroughout the active life of the drip pad and as specified in the permit, if\nthe owner or operator detects a condition that may have caused or has caused a\nrelease of hazardous waste, the condition must be repaired within a reasonably\nprompt period of time following discovery, in accordance with the following\nprocedures: (i) Upon detection of a condition\nthat may have caused or has caused a release of hazardous waste\n(\ne.g., upon detection of leakage in the leak detection\nsystem), the owner or operator must: (a) enter a record of the discovery in the facility operating log; (b) immediately remove the portion of the\ndrip pad affected by the condition from service; (c) determine what steps must be taken to\nrepair the drip pad and clean up any leakage from below the drip pad, and\nestablish a schedule for accomplishing the repairs; (d) within 24 hours after discovery of the\ncondition, notify the commissioner of the condition and, within 10 working\ndays, provide written notice to the commissioner with a description of the\nsteps that will be taken to repair the drip pad and clean up any leakage, and\nthe schedule for accomplishing this work. (ii)\n\nThe department will review the\ninformation submitted, make a determination regarding whether the pad must be\nremoved from service completely or partially until repairs and cleanup are\ncomplete and notify the owner or operator of the determination and the\nunderlying rationale in writing. (iii)\n\nUpon completing all repairs and\ncleanup, the owner or operator must notify the department in writing and\nprovide a certification signed by an independent, qualified professional\nengineer registered in New York State, that the repairs and cleanup have been\ncompleted according to the written plan approved by the department in\naccordance with clause (i)(\nd\n) of this paragraph. (14)\n\nShould a permit be necessary, the commissioner will specify in the permit all design and operating practices\nthat are necessary to ensure that the requirements of this subdivision are\nsatisfied. (15)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must maintain, as part of the facility operating log, documentation of\npast operating and waste handling practices. This must include identification\nof preservative formulations used in the past, a description of drippage\nmanagement practices, and a description of treated wood storage and handling\npractices. (e) Inspections. (1)\n\nDuring\nconstruction or installation, liners and cover systems (\ne.g., membranes, sheets, or coatings) must be inspected for uniformity, damage and\nimperfections (\ne.g., holes, cracks, thin spots, or foreign\nmaterials). Immediately after construction or installation, liners must be\ninspected and certified as meeting the requirements of subdivision (d) of this\nsection by an independent qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State. This certification must be maintained at the facility as part of\nthe facility operating record. After installation, liner and covers must be\ninspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence or tears, punctures, or blisters. (2)\n\nWhile a drip pad\nis in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect\nevidence of any of the following: (i) deterioration, malfunctions or improper operation of run-on and runoff control\nsystems; (ii)\nthe presence of\nleakage in and proper functioning of leak detection system; and\n(iii)\ndeterioration or cracking of the drip\npad surface. Note: See paragraph (d)(13) of this section for remedial action\nrequired if deterioration or leakage is detected. (f) Closure. (1)\n\nAt closure, the owner or operator must\nremove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system\ncomponents (pad, liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, and structures and\nequipment contaminated with waste and leakage, and manage them as hazardous\nwaste. (2)\n\nIf, after removing or\ndecontaminating all residues and making all reasonable efforts to effect\nremoval or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the owner or\noperator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed or\ndecontaminated, the owner or operator must close the facility and perform\npost-closure care in accordance with closure and post- closure care\nrequirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-2.14\n[g]\nof\nthis Subpart). For permitted units, the requirement to have a permit continues\nthroughout the post-closure period. In addition, for the purpose of closure, post-closure, and financial responsibility, such a drip pad is then considered\nto be a landfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements\nfor landfills specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart. (3)\n(i) The\nowner or operator of an existing drip pad, as defined in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, that does not comply with the liner requirements of subparagraph\n(d)(2)(i) of this section must: (a) include\nin the closure plan for the drip pad under section\n373-2.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart both a plan for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in\ncase not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure; and\n(b) prepare a contingent\npost-closure plan under section\n373-2.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in case not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at\nclosure. (ii)\n\nThe cost\nestimates calculated under sections\n373-2.7\n(c) and\n373-2.8\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart for closure and post-closure care of a drip pad subject to this\nparagraph must include the cost of complying with the contingent closure plan\nand the contingent post-closure plan, but are not required to include the cost\nof expected closure under paragraph (1) of this subdivision.
