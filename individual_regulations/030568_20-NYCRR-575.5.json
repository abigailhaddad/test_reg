  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.5 - Grandfathered conveyances\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1415, 365(f)(3) of Chapter 61, Laws of\n1989\n(a) A conveyance of real property\noccurring on or after July 1, 1989 is subject to the tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart unless the conveyance did not involve the delivery of a deed and was made\npursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or before February 16, 1989. A conveyance of real property occurring on or after July 1, 1989 is\nsubject to the tax imposed by section\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law and described in\nsection\n575.3\nof this Part unless the conveyance was made pursuant to a binding written\ncontract entered into on or before February 16, 1989. The date of execution of\nthe contract must be confirmed by independent evidence such as the recording of\nthe contract, payment of a deposit or such other facts and circumstances as may\nbe determined by the commissioner. (b) Where a contract for the conveyance of\nreal property was entered into on or before February 16, 1989, and is later\namended, the conveyance is still considered to be made pursuant to a contract\nentered into on or before February 16, 1989, so long as the amendment to the\ncontract is of a nonsubstantial nature. The determination of what constitutes a\nnonsubstantial change will be made on a case by case basis. However, any change\nin the amount of consideration for the real property will be considered a\nsubstantial change to the contract and, thus, such conveyance is\ntaxable. (c) Where the closing date\nprovided for in a grandfathered contract is postponed, with additional payments\nby the grantee, the conveyance will be considered to be made pursuant to a\ncontract entered into on or before February 16, 1989 if it is shown that the\nadditional payments do not constitute additional consideration. (See section\n575.1\n[d][7]\nof this Part.)\n\nExample 1: A, the owner of real property, executed a binding written\ncontract on February 6, 1989 to lease the property with an option to purchase\nto B for $1,000 a month for ten years. B paid $1,000 as a deposit on the lease\non that date. The final closing of the transaction occurred on July 10, 1989. The creation of the lease with the option to purchase is a grandfathered\nconveyance which is not subject to tax since it did not involve the delivery of\na deed, was made pursuant to a binding written contract entered into on or\nbefore February 16, 1989, and the date of the execution of the contract was\nconfirmed by independent evidence (payment of the deposit by B). Example 2: Same facts as in example 1 except that on March 1, 1989, the contract was amended to provide that B would pay $500 semi-monthly instead\nof $1,000 monthly. This amendment is considered to be of a nonsubstantial\nnature and, therefore, the conveyance is still considered to be a grandfathered\nconveyance not subject to tax. Example 3: Same facts as in example 1 except that on June 11, 1989, the contract was amended to provide that B would pay $1,200 each month instead\nof $1,000. This is a change in the amount of consideration for an interest in\nthe real property. Therefore, the conveyance is subject to tax since it no\nlonger qualifies as a grandfathered conveyance. Example 4: On February 1, 1989, D executed a binding written contract\nto sell his personal residence, a one-family home, to E for $1,200,000. E gave\nD a check for $10,000 as a deposit on the contract on that date. D conveyed the\nproperty to E on July 5, 1989. This conveyance is a grandfathered conveyance\nfor purposes of the additional tax imposed by section\n1402-a\nof the Tax Law and described in\nsection\n575.3\nof this Part since it was made pursuant to a binding written contract entered\ninto on or before February 16, 1989 and the date of execution of the contract\nis confirmed by independent evidence (payment of the deposit by E). However, the conveyance remains subject to the transfer tax imposed by section\n1402\nof the Tax Law and described in section\n575.2\nof this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
