  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 20.1 - Disqualification or removal of superintendents, teachers and other employees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The school\nauthorities of each school district shall take all necessary action to put into\neffect the following procedures for disqualification or removal of\nsuperintendents, teachers or other employees who violate the provisions of\nsection\n3021\nof the\n\nEducation Law or section 12-a of the Civil Service Law.[FN*]\n(1)\n\nPrior to the appointment of any\nsuperintendent, teacher or employee, the nominating official, in addition to\nmaking due inquiry as to the candidate's academic record, professional\ntraining, experience and personal qualities, shall inquire of prior employers, and such other persons as may be in a position to furnish pertinent\ninformation, as to whether the candidate is known to have violated the\naforesaid statutory provisions, including the provisions with respect to\nmembership in organizations listed by the Board of Regents as subversive in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section. No person who is found to have\nviolated the said statutory provisions shall be eligible for\nemployment. (2)\n\nThe school\nauthorities shall require one or more of the officials in their employ, whom\nthey shall designate for such purpose, to submit to them in writing, not later\nthan October 31, 1949, and not later than September 30th of each school year\nthereafter, a report on each teacher or other employee. Such report shall\neither: (i) state that there is no evidence\nindicating that such teacher or other employee has violated the statutory\nprovisions herein referred to, including the provisions with respect to\nmembership in organizations listed by the Regents as subversive in accordance\nwith subdivision (b) of this section; or\n(ii)\nwhere there is evidence indicating a\nviolation of said statutory provisions, including membership in such a\nsubversive organization, recommend that action be taken to dismiss such teacher\nor other employee, on the ground of a specified violation or violations of the\nlaw. (3)\n\nThe school\nauthorities shall themselves prepare such reports on the superintendent of\nschools and such other officials as may be directly responsible to them, including the officials designated by them in accordance with paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision. (4)\n\nThe school\nauthorities shall proceed as promptly as possible, and in any event within 90\ndays after the submission of the recommendations required in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, either to prefer formal charges against superintendents, teachers, or other employees for whom the evidence justifies such action, or to\nreject the recommendations for such action. (5)\n\nFollowing the determination required in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision, the school authorities shall immediately\ninstitute proceedings for the dismissal of superintendents, teachers or other\nemployees in those cases in which, in their judgment, the evidence indicates\nviolation of the statutory provisions herein referred to. In proceedings\nagainst persons serving on probation or those having tenure, the appropriate\nstatutory procedure for dismissal shall be followed. In proceedings against\npersons serving under contract and not under the provisions of a tenure law, the school authorities shall conduct such hearings on charges as they deem the\nexigencies warrant, before taking final action on dismissal. In all cases, all\nrights to a fair trial, representation by counsel and appeal or court reviews, as provided by statute or the Constitution, shall be scrupulously\nobserved. (b) Pursuant\nto chapter 360 of the Laws of 1949, the Board of Regents will issue a list, which may be amended and revised from time to time, of organizations which the\nboard finds to be subversive in that they advocate, advise, teach or embrace\nthe doctrine that the Government of the United States, or of any state or of\nany political subdivision thereof, shall be overthrown or overturned by force, violence or any unlawful means, or that they advocate, advise, teach or embrace\nthe duty, necessity or propriety of adopting any such doctrine, as set forth in\nsection 12-a of the Civil Service Law.[FN* ] Evidence of membership in any\norganization so listed on or after the 10th day subsequent to the date of\nofficial promulgation of such list shall constitute prima facie evidence of\ndisqualification for appointment to or retention of any office or position in\nthe school system. Evidence of membership in such an organization prior to said\nday shall be presumptive evidence that membership has continued, in the absence\nof a showing that such membership has been terminated in good faith. (c) On or before the first day of December of\neach year, the school authorities of each school district shall render to the\n\nCommissioner of Education a full report, officially adopted by the school\nauthorities and signed by their presiding officer, of the measures taken by\nthem for the enforcement of these regulations during the calendar year ending\non the 31st day of October preceding. Such report shall include a statement as\nto: (1)\nthe total number of superintendents, teachers and other employees in the employ of the school district; (2)\nthe number of superintendents, teachers\nand other employees as to whom the school authorities and/or the officials\ndesignated by them have reported that there is no evidence indicating that such\nemployees have violated the statutory provisions herein referred to, including\nthe provisions with respect to membership in organizations listed by the\n\nRegents as subversive; and\n(3)\nthe\nnumber of superintendents, teachers and other employees in whose cases the\nschool authorities and/or the officials designated by them have recommended\nthat action be taken to dismiss the employees in question, on the grounds of\nspecified violations of the law or evidence of membership in a subversive\norganization. Such report shall also include, for the group listed under\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision, a statement of: (4)\nthe number of cases in which charges have\nbeen or are to be preferred and the status or final disposition of each of\nthese cases; (5)\nthe number of\ncases in which the school authorities have concluded that the evidence reported\nby the designated officials does not warrant the preferring of charges; and\n(6)\nthe number of cases in\nwhich the school authorities have not determined, as of October 31st of the\nschool year in question, on the action to be taken. (d) Immediately upon the finding by school\nauthorities that any person is disqualified for appointment or retention in\nemployment under these regulations, said school authorities shall report to the\n\nCommissioner of Education the name of such person and the evidence supporting\nhis disqualification, including a transcript of the official records of\nhearings on charges, if any, which have been conducted.
