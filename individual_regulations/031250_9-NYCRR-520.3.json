  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.3 - Administering non-judicial punishment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nGeneral. (i) The initial determination to\nimpose non-judicial punishment, the types and severity of the punishment to be\nimposed and for what class of offenses, as well as the initial determination to\nsuspend, vacate a suspension, mitigate, remit or set aside punishment, should\nbe based on information that the commander determines to be reliable. In making\nthis determination, he/she is not bound by the military rules of evidence or\nstandards of proof applicable in a trial by court-martial. However, the\ncommander's action must be temperate, well conceived, just and conducive to\ngood discipline. The servicing JA has the responsibility to advise and help the\ncommander evaluate the facts and determine what offense was committed, if any. However, the basic burden of decision remains with the commander. (ii)\nA person not authorized to impose\nnon-judicial punishment in a given case may recommend to a commander who is so\nauthorized, the imposition of non-judicial punishment on an offender if the\nrecommendation is based upon the commission of an offense punishable under the\n\nNew York State Military Law. Such recommendation may not include the nature or\nextent of punishment to be imposed, or any remedial action to be taken if\npunishment is imposed. (iii)\n\nIf\nnon-judicial punishment action is to be brought, it should be commenced as soon\nas possible after a punishable offense has been committed, in order to promote\nswift corrective action and meaningful rehabilitation of the\noffender. (iv)\n\nThe action is\ncommenced on the date and time the notification that a punishable offense has\nbeen committed, is mailed or delivered to the offender. (v) Any punishment imposed in the action is\ndeemed to have included all offenses known to have been committed before the\naction commenced. Any offense known to have been committed before the first\naction has been commenced may not be the basis of a separate non-judicial\npunishment action commenced after the first action has been commenced. Once the\nfirst action has been commenced, offenses thereafter committed may be the basis\nof additional non-judicial punishment actions in accordance with principles of\nfairness and justice. For example, assume a notification of intent to\nimpose/recommend non-judicial punishment in dated 10 June 1980, alleging the\ncommission by SGT Jones of an AWOL offense for May 1980. If another\nnotification of intent to impose/recommend non-judicial punishment is dated 8\n\nJuly 1980 alleging AWOL offenses by the same SGT Jones for unattended UTA's on\n10 June 1980, a potential multiple offenses problem arises. To avoid this\nproblem (which at the time of the first notification, a 10 June 80 AWOL may not\nhave been anticipated), the approximate time of the commencement of the first\naction should be indicated on the notification under the commencement date\nsection (see DMNA form 1063 (Appendix L-2[A25])). Also, the times or the\nnumbers (UTA 1, 2, 3, or 4) of the UTA(s) unattended because the offender was\nAWOL and which were on the same date in the second action as was the date of\nthe first notification, should be stated in the \"charge\" block 1 of the second\nnotification. Thus all notifications should bear the time and date of\ncommencement, and, if a UTA - AWOL situation, the number of the UTA which is\nthe basis of the AWOL. (vi)\n\nThe\nseverity of non-judicial punishment once imposed for any offense, may not\nthereafter be increased by the commander imposing the punishment, his successor\nin command, or superior authority, but may be suspended, mitigated, remitted or\nset aside by any of these persons as stated in subparagraphs (ii)- (iii) of\nthis paragraph. (vii)\n\nAn offender\nhas no right to demand trial by court-martial in lieu of non-judicial\npunishment. The commander authorized to impose the punishment may nevertheless, at any time, proceed by court-martial, even though he had initially elected to\ncommence a non-judicial punishment action. In this event, all requirements for\ncourt-martial authority apply. (viii)\n\nAll correspondence concerning the\nprocessing of non-judicial punishment actions should substantially conform to\nthe applicable forms in Appendix L-2 of this Part. (ix)\n\nAll correspondence and indorsements in\nthe action must be dated or provide for a date, and at least one complete\nrecord submitted to the commander, NYANG, through HQ NYANG/SJA must bear\noriginal signatures or reproductions thereof on those parts of the record that\nrequire signatures and have been signed. This does not apply where the offender\nhas not signed, though required to do so. (x) Where the offender has a right to submit\nmatters in extenuation, mitigation, or defense before punishment may be\nimposed, or as part of an appeal, or has a right to appeal, only the\nresponsible commander may, upon timely request by the offender, grant\nreasonable extensions of time to submit such matters or exercise the right to\nappeal. Timely requestmeans request submitted within the time stated to reply\nto the correspondence. (a) Any replies to\ncorrespondence by the offender submitted late may not be considered, unless the\noffender shows good cause for the delay and the matters submitted are\nmeritorious. No further opportunity to show good cause or merit need be\nprovided to the offender. Late means beyond the time required without\nextensions having been granted. (b) Whether or not the late matters are considered, the responsible commander will\nnote the date the late matters were submitted and forward them through the unit\nJA for inclusion in the record, to the next superior authority or the\ncommander, NYANG through HQ NYANG/SJA, as appropriate. (c) If the late matters are not to be\nconsidered, the responsible commander shall so state, including any comments he\nwishes to make. (d) If the\nresponsible commander finds good cause shown for the delay and that the matters\nsubmitted late have merit, he shall so state, including any comments he wishes\nto make, and he may use such as the basis for any otherwise permissible\nremedial action under this Part, if the punishment has already been\nimposed. (e) If non-judicial\npunishment actions are commenced in cases where the same offense has been\ncommitted by two or more offenders at the same time, date, and place, the\nactions must be separate for each offender. (2)\n\nNotification of intent to\nimpose/recommend non-judicial punishment. (i) The commander authorized to impose non-judicial punishment or the person\nrecommending the imposition of non-judicial punishment, as the case may be, must mail or deliver to the offender written notification of the following: (See DMNA form 1063 (Appendix L-2[A25])). (a) the specific offense(s) alleged to have been committed, the time, date and\nplace of commission, and the statute allegedly violated; and\n(b) the intention to impose non-judicial\npunishment or the intention to recommend the imposition of such punishment for\nsuch offense to the commander authorized to impose non-judicial\npunishment; (c) the right of the\noffender to submit any matter in extenuation, mitigation, or defense to the\ncharges; but that the offender need not do so, since any statement made by him\nmay be used as evidence against him in a trial by court-martial; and\n(d) the directions to the offender to\nacknowledge receipt of notification of the intended action by signing, dating\nand returning it within a specified period (usually at least 10 days from the\ndate of mailing or delivery) to decide whether or not to submit any matters in\nextenuation, etc. accompanied by any such matters; and the advice that the\naction may nevertheless proceed upon the failure to reply or submit matters\nwithin the required time. (3)\n\nCertificate of mailing or personal\ndelivery. (See DMNA form 1065 [Appendix L-2(A27)])\n(i) Personal delivery. The individual who\npersonally delivers the correspondence will certify on DMNA form 1065 that he\nhas done so, and specify the date, place and person to whom delivered. (a) Generally, to ensure that best efforts at\nnotification were made, personal delivery to a person of suitable age and\ndiscretion other than the offender should only be made when delivery is at the\nlast known residence of the offender and the offender is not present or will\nnot accept delivery. (b) If\npersonal delivery was attempted at the last known residence of the offender, and neither the offender nor another person of suitable age and discretion\nthereat could or would accept delivery when it was attempted, the person\nattempting delivery may leave the correspondence in a place at such residence\nwhere it is reasonably likely to be found. He will also state on the\ncertificate specifically where at the residence the correspondence was\nleft. (c) No other evidence of\npersonal delivery is required but it is recommended that any receipts returned\nor obtained be placed in the record of the punishment which is to be ultimately\nplaced in the field personnel record of the offender. (ii)\n\nMailing. Any mailing under this\nregulation may be by ordinary mail. The person mailing the correspondence so\nthat it should ultimately be delivered by the United States Postal Service to\nthe last known residence of the offender, must certify on DMNA form 1065\n(Appendix L-2[A27]) that the specific correspondence was mailed on a specific\ndate. No other evidence of mailing is necessary. (iii)\n\nIn a non-judicial punishment action, mailing or delivering the correspondence to the last known address of the\noffender is sufficient. The person receiving such correspondence at such\naddress need not be the offender. (a) Where, during the processing of the action, correspondence is mailed or delivered to\nthe offender at more than one address and there is no receipt by or delivery\npersonally to the offender, the person making the certificate must indicate the\nreasons for mailing or delivering the correspondence to the different\naddresses. (4)\n\nAcknowledgement of receipt of\nnotification. The acknowledgement shall be the first indorsement to the\nnotification of intent to impose/recommend non-judicial punishment. (DMNA form\n1063 [Appendix L-2[A(25)]). The offender must be given a clear choice of\nwhether or not he wishes to submit matters in extenuation, mitigation or\ndefense. If he chooses to submit such matters, he must include the statement\nthat they are attached to the acknowledgment, or will be sent within the\nspecified time to reply to the notification. (5)\n\nImposition of punishment and notice of\nright to appeal. The punishment may not be imposed until the earlier of the\nthree following dates: the reply date specified in the notification; the date\nthe offender has actually replied; or the date the notification has been\nreturned unclaimed, addressee unknown, etc. The imposition of punishment should\nbe the second indorsement to the notification and includes (DMNA form 1064\n[Appendix L-2(A26)]): (i) A statement that\neither: (a) the matters submitted in\nextenuation, mitigation, or defense were considered and are attached. (It is\nhere that the commander imposing the punishment may state the reasons why\nnotwithstanding the matters submitted, punishment will nevertheless be\nimposed); or\n(b) no acknowledgment\nor receipt of the notification was timely received; or the notification was\nreturned unclaimed, addresse unknown, etc. as of a certain date; or the\nnotification was received on a certain date, but no matters in extenuation, mitigation, or defense have been timely submitted. (ii)\n\nThe punishment imposed. Include, if\ndesired, any admonitions or reprimands in separately numbered\nparagraphs. (iii)\n\nAny suspension, mitigation, remission, or setting aside of any specified portion or all of the\npunishment if done at this time; and a specified date for the termination of\nthe suspension for that part, or all of the punishment if suspended at this\ntime. (Any punishment imposed without remedial action taken at this time is\ndeemed executed on the date of the punishment indorsement, for purposes of any\nremedial action which can be taken in the future). (iv)\n\nIf an unsuspended reduction is imposed, the new date of rank in the grade to which reduced. (v) Advice of right to appeal from the\nimposition of non-judicial punishment in accordance with Military Law, section\n130.15\n(d), whether or not the punishment is suspended, mitigated, or remitted\nat this time, and the right to submit matters to be considered on an\nappeal. (vi)\n\nThe directions to\nacknowledge receipt of the punishment indorsement by signing, dating and\nreturning it within a specified period (usually at least 10 days from the date\nthe punishment indorsement was mailed or delivered), and to decide whether or\nnot to appeal, accompanied by any matters to be considered on the appeal; and\nthe advice that the action may nevertheless proceed upon the failure to reply\nor submit matters within the required time. (vii)\n\nThe commander may add a statement\nexpressing his expectations that the offender's misconduct will not further\noccur, and that in the future, the offender will redeem this lapse in his\nconduct. (viii)\n\nThe decision as to\nappropriate punishment should be discussed with the servicing JA after the\nmember has had an opportunity to present matters in defense, mitigation or\nextenuation. This determination can never be made properly until after careful\nconsideration of all matters which the member presents. However, in the event\nthat military member does not present proper matters, it is proper, before\nimposing the non-judicial punishment, to discuss appropriate punishment with\nthe servicing JA, based upon the available information. (6)\n\nAcknowledgement of receipt of punishment\nand notice of right to appeal indorsement (DMNA form 1064 [Appendix L-2(A27)]). The offender must be given a clear choice of whether or not he elects to\nappeal, and whether or not he desires to submit matters for consideration on an\nappeal. If he chooses to submit such matters, advise him they should be\nattached to the acknowledgment. (7)\n\nCertificate of mailing or personal delivery. Comply with the provisions of\nparagraph (3) of this section (DMNA form 1065 [Appendix L-2(A27)]). (8)\n\nProcessing the action, with or without an\nappeal. The next indorsement on DMNA form 1064 (Appendix L-2[A26]) will depend\non whether or not the offender has timely elected to appeal and submitted\nmatters to be considered on the appeal. (i) If the offender timely appeals and timely submits matters to be considered on\nthe appeal, the officer who imposed the punishment, shall by indorsement, forward the record (including the matters submitted to be considered on appeal, and any written comments on said matters such officer wishes to make), to the\nnext superior authority to decide the appeal. (ii)\n\nIf the offender timely appeals, but does\nnot timely submit matters to be considered on the appeal, whether or not he has\nindicated a desire to submit such matters on the acknowledgement of receipt of\npunishment and notice of right to appeal indorsement, the officer who has\nimposed the punishment shall state the lack of timely submission in his\nindorsement, and proceed as in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nIf no acknowledgment of receipt of the\npunishment and notice of right to appeal indorsement has been timely received\nfrom the offender, or, if such indorsement has been returned unclaimed, addressee unknown, etc., before the reply date, or, if there is evidence the\nacknowledgement has been received by the offender, on a certain date but no\nappeal election and matters to be considered on the appeal have been timely\nsubmitted, or if the offender timely elects not to appeal; the officer who\nimposed the punishment shall, by indorsement, forward the record together with\nan applicable statement why the punishment is not being appealed, to his/her\nservicing JA. (iv)\n\nThe JA servicing\nthe officer imposing punishment shall cause a review of the record to be made\nand if found free from defects shall affix to the record a certificate of legal\nsufficiency and forward two copies of the record to the JA servicing the\nappellate authority for legal sufficiency review. (v) The JA servicing the appellate authority\nshall log and cause a legal sufficiency review to be made of the record. If the\naction is not legally sufficient then same will be returned for corrective\naction. If the action is legally sufficient, then a certificate of legal\nsufficiency shall be affixed and a copy of the action with certificate shall be\nkept for the appellate authority records. (9)\n\nThe appellate authority shall decide any\nappeal, may include reasons for his decisions, and shall return the record to\nthe unit which forwarded the record, for further processing in accordance with\nthis regulation, including directing the offender to acknowledge receipt of the\ndecision on the appeal (DMNA form 1064 [Appendix L-2(A26)]).
