Such master or other persons must produce such manifest for\ninspection at the request of a representative of the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance or a police or peace officer. (2)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nshall prescribe two forms for purposes of the uniform manifest requirements of\nthis section. One such form must be used for the transportation of motor fuel\nin New York State from points of origin within the State, and the second form\nmust be used for the transportation of motor fuel in New York State from points\nof origin outside this State. The manifests required by this section must be\ncompleted prior to the commencement of any transportation of motor fuel in this\n\nState and must be uniquely and consecutively numbered. (b) (1)\n\nWith respect to multiple loadings or deliveries, a separate completed manifest\nmay be made relating to the motor fuel loaded or offloaded at each terminal, account or site. Multiple entries relating to each loading and offloading may\nbe made on a completed manifest prescribed by the department for such\npurpose. (2)\n\nIn lieu of a separate\ncompleted manifest for each loading or delivery of motor fuel, or a completed\nmanifest containing multiple entries, under such terms and conditions as the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance shall prescribe within the uniform manifest: (i) multiple sections of the form or forms\nprescribed by the department regarding the circumstances of each loading or\ndelivery; or\n(ii)\nloading tickets, delivery tickets or invoices which contain all of the information required in\nsuch sections; may, prior to the commencement of any transportation of motor\nfuel, be appended to an original manifest which otherwise contains all of the\nrequired information with respect to the transportation of such motor fuel. Each such section, loading ticket, delivery ticket and invoice in conjunction\nwith the original manifest must contain all of the information required by this\nsection. Such sections, loading or delivery tickets and invoices are integral\nparts of the manifest and such sections must reflect the manifest number and a\nconsecutive alphabetical suffix. (c) Where motor fuel is being imported for\nuse, distribution, storage or sale in the State, the manifest must indicate the\nname of the person importing or causing such fuel to be imported. Such person's\nname must be contained in the current listing of registered distributors\nprepared by the department. The department will periodically make available to\nall licensed importing transporters, licensed terminal operators (see Part 418\nof this Title) and registered distributors a current listing of every\nregistered distributor. Additionally, the department will make available\nlistings of distributors whose registration has been cancelled or\nsuspended. (d) If, after motor fuel\nis loaded by the transporter, there are changes with respect to the particulars\ncontained on the manifest and the transporter has knowledge of such changes, the manifest must immediately be amended by the transporter to reflect such\nchanges. (e) Reproductions of the\nofficial uniform manifest forms are permitted and are acceptable, provided that\nthey are facsimiles of the official forms in the exact same formats and if\nreproduced on paper, are of the same approximate size as the official forms.

(2)\n\nThe absence of the place of delivery of\nthe motor fuel on the manifest with respect to motor fuel being imported into\nthe State gives rise to the presumption that such fuel is being imported for\nuse, distribution, storage or sale in this State. (3)\n\nThe absence of the name of a registered\ndistributor on the manifest with respect to imported motor fuel for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State gives rise to the presumption that\nsuch motor fuel is being imported or caused to be imported by a person other\nthan a registered distributor.

In the case of automotive fuel other than\nmotor fuel (\ni.e., diesel motor fuel) transported from a source\nwithin this State, in addition to any other information required to be set\nforth in the manifest, such manifest must indicate the name and diesel motor\nfuel registration number of the distributor. (i) In addition to any other requirements\nimposed by statute or regulation, every barge, tanker or other vessel used to\ntransport motor fuel in New York State's jurisdiction must be plainly and\nvisibly marked on both sides thereof, and above the waterline, with the word\ngasoline\nor any other appropriate name of the motor fuel being\ntransported. Such markings must be in letters at least eight inches high and of\nproportionate width. Where a single product, such as gasoline, is not\nconsistently transported, the inclusive terms\nmotor fuel\nor\ndiesel motor fuel\nmay be so marked depending upon the nature\nof the product transported.
