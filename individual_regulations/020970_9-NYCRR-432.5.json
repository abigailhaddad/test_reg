(1)\n\nUpon completion of\na park project, the project sponsor shall submit a dated and signed project\nboundary map showing the location of the project and all related support\nfacilities acquired or developed pursuant to this Part. The map shall also\nindicate all structures, facilities and encroachments on the property which are\nused for non-park purposes, such as power lines, easements, school buildings or\nclubhouses. (2)\n\nIn cases where the\nproject is a discrete portion of the park, the project boundary map shall\ninclude as much of the park as would be required for the project to be operated\nby itself, including all support facilities such as roadways, parking lots, comfort stations and landscaping, except that utilities for the facility may be\nprovided from elsewhere in the park. (3)\n\nThe office shall review the proposed\nproject boundary map to determine its compliance with this section and any\nguidelines of the office and shall notify the project sponsor of its\ndetermination. The project boundary map shall define the public park facilities\nfor which State assistance was provided pursuant to this Subchapter. (b) Alienation mitigation. The act\nof the Legislature authorizing the alienation of facilities acquired or\ndeveloped by a municipality pursuant to this Part shall require the\nsubstitution of other lands and any other requirements which the commissioner\ndeems appropriate. (c) Substitute\nproperty. Substitute property must meet the following criteria to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner: (1)\nthe\nfair market value of the substitute property must be no less than the fair\nmarket value of the property being alienated; (2)\nthe substitute property must be of\nreasonably equivalent usefulness and location to the lands being alienated; and\n(3)\nthe substitute property\nmust be of equal environmental value and usefulness to the lands being\nalienated. A determination of equivalent environmental value and usefulness\nwill include an evaluation of how the substitute parcel develops, expands or\nenhances public access to water bodies, promotes water based recreation, or\nenhances the natural, cultural or historic aspects of water bodies. (d) Leasing of State-funded\nfacilities. The lease of facilities acquired or developed pursuant to this\n\nSubchapter is an alienation and requires the express authority of an act of the\n\nLegislature. However, substitution of other lands is not necessary if the lease\nprovides for the following: (1)\nthe leased\npremises must be operated as a public park and/or recreational facility; that\nis, all programs and activities must be offered to all members of the public on\nthe same terms and conditions which shall be subject to the approval of the\noffice; (2)\nthe leased premises\nmust be identified in signage, public records and publicity as a public park\nand/or recreational facility; (3)\nat any time the facility ceases to be operated as a public park and/or\nrecreational facility, the lease will terminate and the facility shall\nimmediately revert to the project sponsor; and\n(4)\nall revenues received by the project\nsponsor from the lease of the facility shall be used for the acquisition of\nother park facilities or capital improvements to municipal park and\nrecreational facilities and shall not supplant monies otherwise appropriated. The project sponsor shall submit to the office certified copies of budget\ndocuments showing its anticipated expenditures for capital park purposes from\nall revenue sources with the use of the lease proceeds as a segregated\nitem. (e) Granting of an\neasement over project lands. If an act of the Legislature grants an easement\nover parkland for utility purposes and requires that the lands continue to be\nused for public park and recreation purposes, substitute property will not be\nrequired. (f) Review of alienation\nproposals by the office. (1)\n\nThe project\nsponsor shall submit to the office a proposal pertaining to the alienation of\nparklands receiving State assistance under this Part as early in the planning\nprocess as possible.

The qualifications of the appraiser and\nthe format of the appraisals shall be in accordance with section\n431.6\nof this\n\nTitle; (iv)\ndocumentation\nestablishing the project sponsor's compliance with the State Environmental\n\nQuality Review Act; (v) a complete\nsummary of public input supporting or opposing both the decision to alienate\nand the adequacy of the substitute property; and\n(vi)\nadditional material such as the proposed\ndeed for the substitute property, plans and drawings of developed or proposed\nfacilities or an archeological survey. (3)\n\nThe office will review the proposal and\nprovide its comments and recommendation to the project sponsor along with such\nadditional information as it deems relevant in sufficient time for the proposal\nto be considered by the Legislature at its next regular session. (g) Legislative approval. It shall\nbe the responsibility of the project sponsor to contact its legislative\nrepresentatives with regard to the introduction of legislation authorizing the\nalienation of parklands. The project sponsor shall give such legislative\nrepresentatives the comments and recommendations of the office. (h) Revised project boundary map.
