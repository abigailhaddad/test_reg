  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 337.5 - Recovery of disability beneficiaries\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Comptroller may, once each year\nfollowing the retirement of a member on a disability allowance, and upon the\nbeneficiary's application shall require such disability beneficiary to undergo\na medical examination. No examination upon a beneficiary's application may be\nrequired until one year following the final determination granting disability\nretirement. Such examination shall be made at a place mutually agreed upon by\nthe Comptroller and such beneficiary. In the event that any such disability\nbeneficiary shall refuse to submit to a medical examination, the retirement\nallowance shall be discontinued until the member submits to a medical\nexamination. If such refusal shall continue for one year, all pension rights\nshall be forfeited. The following indicia of a disability beneficiary's ability\nto return to the duties of the position from which such individual retired on\naccount of disability, and any other reasonable indicia, shall be considered in\ndetermining whether it is appropriate to require the medical examination of a\ndisability beneficiary (who has not requested such medical examination) for the\npurposes of this Part: (1)\nmedical evidence or\nrecords submitted to the Retirement System that indicates that the disability\nbeneficiary may be able to perform the duties of the former position; (2)\nvideotape, photographs or other\ndocumentation or evidence submitted to the Retirement System which indicates\nthat the disability beneficiary may be able to perform the duties of the former\nposition; (3)\na determination by\nthe Social Security Agency, Workers' Compensation Board or similar entity which\nindicates that the disability beneficiary may be able to perform the duties of\nthe former position; (4)\ndocumentation with respect to the disability beneficiary's earnings in a\nposition or positions which may reasonably be construed as indicating that the\ndisability beneficiary may be able to perform the duties of the former\nposition. (b) Following\nsuch examination, or examinations, the Comptroller shall render a determination\nbased upon the report of the medical board. Where the Comptroller determines\nthat a beneficiary who had retired from a competitive class position is no\nlonger incapacitated for the performance of gainful employment, the Comptroller\nshall certify to the applicable civil service department or commission, that\nthe beneficiary is a preferred eligible to be placed upon the appropriate\neligible list or lists, if any exist. Disability payments shall continue until\nsuch time as the beneficiary is first offered a position in public service at a\nsalary grade equal to or exceeding that of the position from which the\nbeneficiary had retired. (c) In the\nevent that a beneficiary had not retired from a competitive class position, or\nin the event that there exists no eligible list which encompasses the\ncompetitive class position from which he or she had retired, disability\npayments shall cease one calendar year from the date of the Comptroller's\nredetermination, and the beneficiary shall, if he or she had been vested at the\ntime of retirement, be restored to membership in the New York State Employees'\nRetirement System.
