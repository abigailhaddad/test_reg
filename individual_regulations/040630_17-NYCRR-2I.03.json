  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2I.03 - General Service Signs for Freeways and Expressways\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 00A The Freeway General Service (D9-18) sign (see Figure\n2I-3) is for use on freeways to inform motorists about certain services\nconveniently accessible at exits. Standard: 00B The Freeway General Service shall have white letters, symbols, arrows, and borders on a blue background. Letter and numeral sizes\nshall comply with the minimum requirements of Tables 2E-1 through 2E-4. 00C The Freeway General Service sign shall carry the\nsymbols for one or more of the following services only: Food (D9-8), Gas\n(D9-7), Diesel Fuel (D9-11), Alternative Fuel -- Compressed Natural Gas\n(D9-11a), Electric Vehicle Charging (D9-11b), Alternative Fuel -- Ethanol\n(D9-11c), Propane Gas (D9-15), Lodging (D9-9), Tent Camping (D9-3), Trailer\n\nCamping (D9-3a), Telephone (D9-1), Hospital (D9-2), or Tourist Information\n(D9-10) (see Section\n2D.45\n). 00D Only symbols shall be permitted on the Freeway General\n\nService sign. The D9-18a and D9-18c signs shall not be used in New York. Option: 00E For numbered interchanges, the exit number may be\nincorporated within the sign legend (D9-18b) or displayed on an Exit Number\n(E1-5P) plaque (see Section\n2E.31\n). Guidance: 00F The Freeway General Service sign should be used where\nthe overall public interest is better served by omitting brand and facility\nnames. Where the public interest would be better served by including such\ninformation, Specific Service signs (see Chapter 2J) should be used\ninstead. 00G Freeway General Service signs should be limited to\nareas which are rural in character. They should not be used in urbanized areas\nwhere the availability of motorist services is evident or may reasonably be\nassumed. 00H Freeway General Service signs should not be used on\napproaches to interchanges with other freeways, on approaches involving lane\ndrops, or on approaches where diagrammatic Advance Guide signs (see Section\n2E.33) are used. They should also not be used where it would be inconvenient\nfor motorists leaving the freeway to re-enter to resume their travel. 00I Freeway General Service signs should only be used where\nnecessary General Service symbol signs are in place on the exit ramp, and at\nsubsequent locations where traffic must turn to reach the particular\nservices. Option: 00J Where Tourist-Oriented Directional signs (see Chapter\n2K) provide guidance at locations where turns are necessary, the follow-up\n\nGeneral Service Symbol signs may be omitted. Support: 00K Ramp signs are usually not necessary at double-exit\ninterchanges. They are also generally not needed at single-exit interchanges\nfor businesses which are readily visible from the ramp terminal. Standard: 00L No more than six services, including any appended\npanels, shall be displayed on one Freeway General Service sign. 00M The qualified services available shall be shown at\nspecific locations on the Freeway General Service sign. To provide flexibility\nfor the future, when the service might become available, the sign space\nnormally reserved for a given service symbol shall be left blank when that\nservice is not present. 00N Symbols for businesses which are operated on a seasonal\nbasis shall be removed or covered when the businesses are closed. Guidance: 00O The symbols on a Freeway General Service sign should be\ndisplayed as follows: A. Six services: Top row--Gas, Food, and Lodging\n\nBottom row--Phone, Hospital, and Camping\nB. Four services: Top row--Gas and Food\n\nBottom row--Lodging and Phone\nC. Three services: Top row-- Gas, Food, and Lodging\n\nOption: 00P Signing for Diesel Fuel, Propane Gas, or other\nalternative fuel services may be substituted for any of the general services or\nappended to such signs. The International Symbol of Accessibility for the\n\nHandicapped (D9-6) sign may be used for facilities that qualify. 00Q Substitutions of other services for any of the services\nshown above may be made by placing the substitution in the lower right (four or\nsix services) or extreme right (three services) portion of the sign panel. An\naction message or an interchange number may be used for symbol signs in the\nsame manner as they are used for word message signs. The Diesel Fuel symbol or\nthe Propane Gas symbol may be substituted for the symbol representing fuel or\nappended to such assemblies. The Tourist Information sign may be substituted on\nany of the above configurations. 00R At rural interchange areas where limited road user\nservices are available and where it is unlikely that additional services will\nbe provided within the near future, a supplemental plaque displaying one to\nthree services may be appended below a post-mounted interchange guide\nsign. Standard: 00S If more than three services become available at rural\ninterchange areas where limited road user services were anticipated, the\nappended sign plaque described in Paragraph 00R shall be removed and replaced\nwith an independently mounted General Service sign as described in this\n\nSection. Option: 00T A separate Telephone sign may be installed if telephone\nfacilities are located adjacent to the route at places where public telephones\nwould not normally be expected. The Recreational Vehicle Sanitary Station\n(D9-12) sign may be used as needed to indicate the availability of facilities\ndesigned for dumping wastes from recreational vehicle holding tanks. In some\nlocations, signs may be used to indicate that services are not\navailable. Guidance: 00U To be eligible for a Freeway General Service sign, businesses or facilities should meet the requirement set forth for Specific\n\nService signs (see Chapter 2J) and General Service signs (see Section\n2I.02\n). Option: 00V The eligibility requirements for a particular type of\nservice may be satisfied by a single business or facility, or jointly by two or\nmore businesses or facilities in reasonably close proximity. Standard: 00W Where eligibility for signing involves more than one\nbusiness or facility, all shall be within the specified travel distance limit\nfrom the exit gore, and guidance to all shall involve the same General Service\nsymbol sign on the exit ramp and at all subsequent locations. 00X Only one Freeway General Service sign shall be used in\neach travel direction at a single-exit interchange. The number of Freeway\n\nGeneral Service signs per travel direction approaching a double-exit\ninterchange shall be limited to one for each exit. Option: 00Y Where the services associated with each exit of a\ndouble-exit interchange are identical, one Freeway General Service sign, covering both exits, may be used. 00Z If the distance to the next point where services are\navailable is greater than 10 miles, a NEXT SERVICES XX MILES (D9-17P) plaque\n(see Figure 2I-2) may be installed below the Exit Direction sign (see Section\n2E.36). Standard: 00AA Where used at a numbered interchange, the Freeway\n\nGeneral Service sign shall be supplemented with the interchange number, as\nillustrated in Figure 2I-3. 00BB Where used at an unnumbered interchange, the Freeway\n\nGeneral Service sign shall be supplemented with an action message such as NEXT\nEXIT or SECOND RIGHT, as illustrated in Figure 2I-3. 00CC Symbols on the Freeway General Service sign shall be\nidentical in design and meaning to those used on General Service symbol signs\n(see Section\n2I.02\n). Guidance: 00DD Symbols on the Freeway General Service signs should be\n18 inches high or 18 inches wide, as appropriate. They should be arranged so\nthat the horizontal spaces between them are uniform. The Gas and Diesel Fuel\nsymbols should not ordinarily be displayed together on the Freeway General\n\nService sign. Also, the Trailer Camping and Tent Camping symbols should not\nordinarily be displayed together. Option: 00EE The Gas and Diesel Fuel symbols, or both the Trailer\n\nCamping and Tent Camping symbols, may be included where it is deemed in the\npublic interest to do so. Guidance: 00FF The Freeway General Service sign should be placed at\nleast 800 feet from any other guide sign. 00GG At a single-exit interchange, the Freeway General\n\nService sign should be placed between the Advance Guide sign and the Exit\n\nDirection sign. If more than one Advance Guide sign is used, the Freeway\n\nGeneral Service sign should be placed after the last one. 00HH Where a Supplemental Guide sign (see Section 2E.35) is\nused, the Freeway General Service sign should be placed to follow it. Where a\nNYI9-5 or NYI9-10 ATTRACTION sign (see Chapter 2J) is used, the Freeway General\n\nService sign should be placed to follow it. Standard: 00II Where two Freeway General Service signs are used at a\ndouble-exit interchange, the signs for both exits shall be placed at the same\nlocation. The Freeway General Service sign for the first exit to be encountered\nshall be placed immediately above the Freeway General Service sign for the\nsecond exit. Guidance: 00JJ The Freeway General Service signs for double-exit\ninterchanges should be positioned between the Advance Guide sign and the Exit\n\nDirection sign for the first exit. If more than one Advance Guide sign is used, the Freeway General Service signs should be placed after the last one. Where a\n\nSupplemental Guide sign is used, the Freeway General Service signs should be\nplaced to follow it. Where NYI9-5 or NYI9-10 ATTRACTION signs are used, the\n\nFreeway General Service signs should be placed after them. 00KK Where only one Freeway General Service sign is used at\na double-exit interchange, it should be positioned between the Advance Guide\nsign and the Exit Direction sign for the first exit. If more than one Advance\n\nGuide sign is used, the Freeway General Service sign should be placed after the\nlast one. Where a Supplemental Guide sign is used, the Freeway General Service\nsign should be placed to follow it. Where NYI9-5 or NYI9-10 ATTRACTION signs\nare used, the Freeway General Service sign should be placed after them. Option: 00LL The Freeway General Service sign may be supplemented\nwith a Truck Parking (D9-16) General Service sign to indicate the availability\nof truck parking at a nearby service area if the criteria listed in Section\n2I.02\nare met. Guidance: 00MM Where a Truck Parking sign is used in conjunction with\nthe Freeway General Service sign, the Truck Parking sign should be placed\nimmediately beneath, and centered horizontally on, the Freeway General Service\nsign.
