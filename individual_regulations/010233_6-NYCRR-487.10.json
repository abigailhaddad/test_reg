  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 487.10 - Evaluation of significant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The applicant\nshall use generally accepted statistical methods to evaluate the physical\nconditions identified pursuant to section\n487.9\n(b) of this\n\nPart for the impact study area and each of the comparison areas to evaluate\nwhether and to what extent the impact study area has significant and adverse\ndisproportionate environmental impacts. (b) The applicant shall then compare and\ncontrast the physical conditions of the impact study area that would result\nfrom construction and operation of the proposed facility, as identified in\nsection\n487.9\n(d)(3)\nof\nthis Part, with the physical conditions in each of the comparison areas to\nevaluate whether the proposed facility results in or contributes to any\nsignificant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts in the impact\nstudy area. The applicant shall evaluate whether or not there are any\nsignificant and adverse disproportionate cumulative impacts to air quality in\nthe impact study area in accordance with its approved air modeling protocol\npursuant to section\n487.7\nof this Part. (c) The applicant shall discuss to the\nfullest extent possible and with sufficient detail the nature and magnitude of\nany significant and adverse disproportional environmental impact based on each\nof the comparisons made pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section, and the\nnature and magnitude of the total of all the disproportionate environmental\nimpacts in the impact study area. (d) In the event that the applicant's\nevaluation indicates that the proposed facility is likely to result in or\ncontribute to any significant and adverse disproportionate environmental impact\nin the impact study area during its construction or operation, the applicant\nshall identify the specific measures it will take to avoid, offset or minimize\neach impact for the duration that the certificate is issued to the maximum\nextent practicable using verifiable measures. The applicant shall include in\nits evaluation a discussion of the effect these measures would have on the\napplicant's conclusions about any significant and adverse disproportionate\nenvironmental impacts in the impact study area. The applicant shall avoid any\ndisproportionate impact to the maximum extent practicable, or, if the applicant\ncannot avoid the impact, the applicant shall minimize the disproportionate\nimpact to the maximum extent practicable. If the disproportionate impact cannot\nbe completely avoided or minimized, the applicant shall offset the impact, with\npriority given to offset measures that will benefit the area where the degree\nof significant and adverse disproportionate impact is greatest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n487.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
