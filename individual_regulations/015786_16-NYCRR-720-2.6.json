  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 720-2.6 - Short notice-resale of telephone service\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Public Service Commission has determined that it is\nin the public interest to permit liberal modification of service offerings\nwithin the limits authorized by a reseller's certificate of public convenience\nand necessity. It has also determined that it is in the public interest to\npermit rates for resale of telephone services to fluctuate freely between the\nmaximum and minimum rates established in filed tariffs. Because good cause for\nflexibility in service offerings and rates has been shown for this industry, changes in the maximum and minimum rates, except major rate changes as defined\nby Public Service Law, section 92(2), may become effective immediately upon\ncompliance with the notice provisions of State Administrative Procedure Act, section 202. All companies increasing or decreasing a charge within the\napplicable maximum and minimum rates or making a service change shall notify\naffected customers and the commission of the new charge or service change no\nlater than the date the charge is first applied or the date the service change\nis first implemented. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§§\n720-2.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
