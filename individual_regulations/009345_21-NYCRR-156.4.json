(d) An applicant for a canal work permit shall obtain workers' compensation\ninsurance and/or workers' disability benefits coverage in accordance with the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Board requirements. (b) Permit for use of Canal\n\nCorporation property. Any party who plans to use and/or occupy canal lands or\nfacilities must apply for and obtain a revocable permit for use of Canal\n\nCorporation property. The application and issuance of this permit is\nadministered by the Division Office of Canals for a fee as determined in\naccordance with this subdivision. (1)\n\nFees for use of canal lands and facilities. (i) Permit fees for use of canal lands and\nfacilities will be based on the property's fair market rental value as\nestablished by the Canal Corporation by an analysis, comparison and use of the\nmost comparable rentals and sales found in the market, with the exception of\npermits described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. The fee will be based\nupon a consideration of the use made of the permitted area, including placement\nof, but not limited to docks, ramps, slips and floats. (ii)\n\nPermit fees for canal land used in\nconjunction with adjoining residences or camps for access to the canal waters\nor maintained as part of the permittee's property shall be $50 per year. This\ntype of permit is restricted to upland owners and includes only lands between\nan upland residence or campsite and the canal waters; the permitted area cannot\nexceed one acre of land and cannot contain any building improvements. The\npermit gives the permittee the right of exclusive access across the canal lands\nto the canal waters. An additional charge of $50 will be imposed if the\npermittee elects to erect and/or maintain a dock, ramp, slip or float within\nthe canal waters. (2)\n\nPowerline, telephone and other communication crossings. (i) Aboveground crossings. The annual permit\nfees for aboveground powerline, telephone and other communication crossings\nwill be based on 50 percent of the occupied property's fair market rental value\nas determined by the Canal Corporation. The area necessary to accommodate the\ncrossings will be computed by multiplying the required width of the corridor by\nthe length of the corridor as measured along its centerline. The required\ncorridor widths will vary based on the size and type of the bearing structure\nand the capacity of the transmission line. The minimum prescribed corridor\nwidths are as follows: Powerline voltage\n\nMinimum prescribed corridor\nwidth\n765kv\n250 feet\n500kv\n175 feet\n230 to 345kv\n150 feet\n115 to 138kv\n100 feet\n34.5 to 69kv\n50 feet\n23kv or less (includes telephone or other\ncommunication crossings)\n25 feet\n\nThe corridor width of a multiline crossing will be\ndetermined by taking one-half the prescribed corridor width for each outside\nline and adding it to the distance between them. In no case shall the total\ncorridor width be less than the required width for the powerline having the\ngreatest voltage capacity. If more than one transmission line is attached to\nthe same bearing structure, the corridor width will be that required for the\ntransmission line with the greatest voltage capacity. The annual permit fee\nwill be computed by multiplying the corridor area by 50 percent of the\nproperty's fair market rental value. If the area within the corridor is over\nwater, it will be appraised using the value of adjoining canal upland. (ii)\n\nUnderground crossings. The\nannual permit fee for underground powerline, telephone and other communication\ncrossings will be computed in the same manner as aboveground, except the\ncorridor width will be a minimum 25 feet regardless of the line's voltage\ncapacity. (3)\n\nPipeline\ncrossings. (i) Aboveground (at grade). The\nannual permit fees for all aboveground pipelines will be based on 100 percent\nof the occupied property's fair market rental value as determined by the Canal\n\nCorporation. The area which is required to accommodate an aboveground pipeline\ncrossing will be computed by multiplying the length of the pipeline by a\n25-foot minimum corridor width. (ii)\n\nUnderground. The annual permit fee for\nan underground pipeline crossing will be based on 50 percent of the occupied\nproperty's fair market rental value as determined by the Canal Corporation. The\narea which is required to accommodate the underground crossing will be computed\nby multiplying the prescribed corridor width times the length of the pipeline. The minimum prescribed corridor widths for underground pipelines are as\nfollows: Pipeline-diameter\n\nMinimum prescribed corridor\nwidth\n\nUnder 6 inches\n15 feet\n6 inches or more\n25 feet\n(4)\n\nVendors. For temporary or periodic\noccupancy, $5 per day, $50 minimum or $250 per year. (5)\n\nWater usage. The fee will be based on a\nreview of comparable prices of water available in the geographic area but will\nnot exceed two percent of the cost per gallon charged by the nearest potable\nmunicipal water supplier. (6)\n\nFor\nuses not specified in this subdivision, the fee will be based on all relevant\nfactors, such as nature and extent of use of canal property. (7)\n\nMinimum fee. The minimum fee for a permit\nfor use of Canal Corporation property will be $50. (8)\n\nLate charge. If the permit fee has not\nbeen paid in full by the 15th day after it has become due, an additional charge\nof two percent per month will be due and owing to the Canal\n\nCorporation. (9)\n\nCanal\nidentification plates. The Canal Corporation will issue canal identification\nplates to all approved holders of a permit for use of Canal Corporation\nproperty. These plates must be conspicuously posted on the property while the\npermit is in force and must be removed and returned to the Canal Corporation\nwhen the permit is no longer in force. (10)\n\nPeriodic review of permit fees. The\n\nCanal Corporation may revise fees for a permit for use of Canal Corporation\nproperty periodically to reflect fair market rental value. Written notice will\nbe given to the permittee. (11)\n\nProcedure for contesting determination of permit fees. (i) The permit applicant or permittee may\ndispute a permit fee determination within one month of being informed thereof\nby delivering or mailing, by certified mail, a request for a conference to the\ndivision office of canals having jurisdiction. This request must specify and\ndocument reasons for disagreement with the fee. Such conference shall be\nscheduled and conducted in the division office of canals. The permit applicant\nor permittee may have representation at the conference. After all relevant\ninformation has been presented and analyzed, the division director shall within\n14 days notify the permit applicant or permittee of the decision in\nwriting. (ii)\n\nThe division\ndirector's decision may be appealed by the permit applicant or permittee within\n30 days of the receipt of the decision, in writing, to the New York State Canal\n\nCorporation, P.O. Box 189, Albany, NY 12201, by certified mail.
