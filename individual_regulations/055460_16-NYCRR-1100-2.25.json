(b) A list of all local ordinances, laws, resolutions, regulations, standards and other requirements applicable to the\ninterconnection to or use of water, sewer, and telecommunication lines in\npublic rights of way that are of a substantive nature, together with a\nstatement that the location of the facility as proposed conforms to all such\nlocal substantive requirements, except any that the applicant requests that the\n\nOffice elect not to apply. (c) A\nlist of all local substantive requirements identified pursuant to subdivision\n(a) or (b) of this section for which the applicant requests that the Office\nelect to not apply to the facility. Pursuant to Public Service Law article\nVIII, the Office may elect to not apply, in whole or in part, any local law or\nordinance which would otherwise be applicable if it makes a finding that, as\napplied to the proposed facility, it is unreasonably burdensome in view of the\nCLCPA targets and the environmental benefits of the proposed facility. For each\nlocal substantive requirement identified by the applicant, a statement\njustifying the request shall be provided. The statement of justification shall\nshow with facts and analysis the degree of burden caused by the requirement, why the burden should not reasonably be borne by the applicant, that the\nrequest cannot reasonably be obviated by design changes to the facility, that\nthe request is the minimum necessary, and that the adverse impacts of granting\nthe request shall be mitigated to the maximum extent practicable consistent\nwith applicable requirements set forth in this Part. The statement shall\ninclude a demonstration: (1)\n\nFor requests\ngrounded in the existing technology, that there are technological limitations\n(including governmentally imposed technological limitations) related to\nnecessary facility component bulk, height, process or materials that make\ncompliance by the applicant technically impossible, impractical or otherwise\nunreasonable; (2)\n\nFor requests\ngrounded in factors of costs or economics (likely involving economic modeling), that the costs to consumers associated with applying the identified local\nsubstantive requirements would outweigh the benefits of applying such\nprovisions; and\n(3)\n\nFor requests\ngrounded in the needs of consumers, that the needs of consumers for the\nfacility outweigh the impacts on the community that would result from refusal\nto apply the identified local substantive requirements. (d) A summary table of all local substantive\nrequirements identified pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section in\ntwo columns listing the provisions in the first column, and a discussion or\nother showing demonstrating the degree of compliance with the substantive\nprovisions in the secondcolumn.

If no other arrangement can be made, the\n\nNew York State Department of State should be identified. The statement of\nidentification shall include a description of the preliminary arrangement made\nbetween the applicant and the entity that shall perform the review, approval, inspection, and compliance certification, including arrangements made to pay\nfor the costs thereof including the costs for any consultant services necessary\ndue to the complex nature of such facilities. If the applicable City, Town or\n\nVillage has adopted and incorporated the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention\nand Building Code for administration into its local electric, plumbing and\nbuilding codes, the applicant may request that the Office expressly authorize\nthe exercise of the electric, plumbing and building permit application, inspection and certification processes by such City, Town or Village. (f) An identification of the zoning\ndesignation or classification of all lands constituting the facility site and a\nstatement of the language in the zoning ordinance or local law by which it is\nindicated that the facility is a permitted use at the facility site.
