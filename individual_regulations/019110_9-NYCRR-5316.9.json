  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5316.9 - Kiosk terminal requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Kiosk\nterminal security. The main door, which shall be locked, shall be manufactured\nof materials that are suitable for allowing only legitimate access to the\ninside of the kiosk terminal (i.e., locks, doors and their associated hinges)\nshall be capable of withstanding determined and unauthorized efforts to gain\naccess to the inside of the kiosk and shall leave evidence of tampering if such\nan entry is made. (b) Kiosk\nterminal wiring. A kiosk shall be designed so that power and data cables into\nand out of the kiosk can be routed so that such cables are not accessible to\nthe general public. This requirement is for kiosk integrity reasons only, not\nfor health and safety. Security-related wires and cables that are routed into a\nlogic area shall be fastened securely within the interior of the kiosk\nterminal. (c) On/off switch. An\non/off switch that controls the electrical current shall be located in a place\nthat is readily accessible within the interior of a kiosk so that power cannot\nbe disconnected from outside of the kiosk using the on/off switch. The on/off\npositions of the switch shall be labeled. (d) Switches and jumpers. If a kiosk contains\nswitches and/or jumpers, all switches or jumpers shall be documented fully for\nevaluation by a licensed independent testing laboratory. (e) Kiosk terminal identification. A kiosk\nshall have an identification badge affixed to the exterior of the cabinet by\nthe manufacturer. Such badge shall not be removable without leaving evidence of\ntampering and shall include the following information: (1)\nthe manufacturer; (2)\na unique serial number; (3)\na kiosk model number; and\n(4)\nthe date of manufacture. (f) Patron safety. Electrical and\nmechanical parts and design principals of a kiosk terminal shall not subject a\npatron to any physical hazards. The manufacturer of the devices or those that\npurchase the devices shall be responsible for safety and electromagnetic\ncompatibility testing. (g) Kiosk\nintegrity. The licensed independent testing laboratory shall perform certain\ntests to determine whether or not outside influences affect performance or\ncreate cheating opportunities. This certification applies exclusively to tests\nconducted using current and retrospective methodology. During the course of\ntesting, the laboratory shall inspect for marks or symbols indicating that a\ndevice has undergone product safety compliance testing. The laboratory shall\nalso perform, where possible, a cursory review of submissions and information\ncontained therein related to electromagnetic interference, radio frequency\ninterference, magnetic interference, liquid spills, power fluctuations and\nenvironmental conditions. Electrostatic discharge testing is intended only to\nsimulate techniques observed in the field being used to attempt to disrupt the\nintegrity of the kiosk. A kiosk shall be able to withstand the following tests, resuming operation without operator intervention: (1)\nelectro-static interference. Protection\nagainst static discharges requires that the kiosk's conductive cabinets be\ngrounded in such a way that static discharge energy shall not damage\npermanently or inhibit permanently the normal operation of the electronics or\nother components within the kiosk. Kiosks may exhibit temporary disruption when\nsubjected to a significant electro-static discharge greater than human body\ndischarge, but they shall exhibit the capacity to recover and complete any\ninterrupted function without loss or corruption of any control or critical data\ninformation associated with the kiosk. The tests shall be conducted with a\nseverity level of a maximum of 27 kilovolts air discharge; and\n(2)\nstate of kiosk. For commercial components\ninvolved in functions covered by this standard that are affected (e.g., a\npersonal computer monitor), there shall be a method to determine the state the\nkiosk was in if any of the components fail from static discharge. (h) Tower light. A kiosk involved\nin functions covered by this Part shall have a light located conspicuously on\nits top, that automatically illuminates when an error condition has occurred or\na call attendant (if applicable) has been initiated by the patron. This\nrequirement may be substituted for an alternate means that alerts gaming\nfacility staff of error conditions and patron seeking assistance occurrences. Alternative means to alert staff may be considered on a case-by-case\nbasis. (i) Requirements for\nexternal doors/external compartments. The interior of the kiosk cabinet shall\nnot be accessible when all doors are closed and locked. Doors shall be\nmanufactured of materials that are suitable for allowing only legitimate access\nto the inside of the kiosk cabinet (i.e., locks, doors and their associated\nhinges). Doors shall be capable of withstanding determined and unauthorized\nefforts to gain access to the inside of the kiosk cabinet and shall leave\nevidence of tampering if such an entry is made. (j) Kiosk logic door and logic area. A kiosk\nshall use a logic area that is a separately locked cabinet area (with its own\nlocked door) that houses electronic components that have the potential to\nsignificantly influence the operation of the kiosk. There may be more than one\nsuch logic area in a kiosk. (k) Electronic components. Electronic components that are recommended to be housed\nin one or more logic areas are: (1)\na central\nprocessing unit and any program storage device that contains software that may\naffect the integrity of the kiosk, including, without limitation, accounting, system communication and peripheral firmware devices involved in, or that\nsignificantly influence the intended operation of a kiosk or accounting, revenue or security. Any exceptions shall be evaluated on a case-by-case\nbasis; (2)\ncommunication-controller\nelectronics and components housing the communication program storage device. Any exceptions shall be evaluated on a case-by-case basis; and\n(3)\nthe non-volatile (NV) memory back-up\ndevice, if applicable, shall be kept within a locked logic area. (l) Coin/token and currency\ncompartments. Coin or token and currency compartments shall be locked\nseparately or similarly secured as approved by the commission in writing from\nthe main kiosk cabinet area. Access to the currency storage area shall be\nsecured via separate key locks and the kiosk shall be fitted with sensors that\nindicate door open/close or stacker receptacle removed, provided power is\nsupplied to the kiosk. If the kiosk is interfaced with a monitoring system, these alerts shall be sent to the system when possible. (m) Video monitors/touch screens. Video\nmonitor touch screens shall meet the following criteria: (1)\nA touch screen, if applicable, shall be\naccurate and once calibrated shall maintain that accuracy for at least the\nmanufacturer's recommended maintenance period. (2)\nA touch screen, if applicable, shall be\nable to be re-calibrated without access to the kiosk cabinet other than opening\nthe main door. (3)\n\nThere shall be\nno hidden or undocumented buttons/touch points, if applicable, anywhere on the\nscreen that affect negatively or impact the proper operation of the kiosk, except as provided for by the instructions for patron kiosk usage. (n) Back-up of memory. A kiosk\nshall have the ability to retain data for all critical memory and shall be\ncapable of maintaining the accuracy of all information required for 30 days\nafter power is discontinued from the kiosk.
