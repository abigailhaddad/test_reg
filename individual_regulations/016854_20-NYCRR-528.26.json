(3)\n\nThe exemption does not apply with respect\nto the purchase or use of: (i) trucks; (ii)\nmotor fuel and/or\ndiesel motor fuel; (iii)\nshop\nequipment; (iv)\ntools (other than\ntools sold as part of original equipment of a vehicle); (v) tractors tractor, trailers and\nsemitrailers when used in combination which have gross vehicle weights of\n26,000 pounds or less; (vi)\nmobile\nhomes and/or factory-manufactured homes; and\n(vii)\ntaxable services other than those\nsubject to tax pursuant to section\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax Law. The exemption certificate for tractors, trailers, or\nsemitrailers may not be used for purchases of tangible personal property or\nservices described in subparagraphs (i)-(iv) and (vi)-(vii) of this\nparagraph. (b) Definitions. The following terms shall apply for purposes of this\nsection. (1)\nA\ntractor\nis a motor vehicle designed and used as the power unit in combination with a\nsemitrailer or trailer, or two such trailers in tandem. Any such motor vehicle\nshall not carry cargo except that a tractor and semitrailer engaged in the\ntransportation of automobiles may transport motor vehicles on part of the power\nunit. (2)\nA\nsemitrailer\nis any trailer which is so designed that when\noperated the forward end of its body or chassis rests upon the body or chassis\nof the towing vehicle. (3)\nA\ntrailer\nis any vehicle not propelled by its own power, drawn\non the public highways by a motor vehicle (as defined in section\n125\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law) except\nfor: (i) motorcycle sidecars; (ii)\nvehicles being towed by a nonrigid\nsupport; and\n(iii)\nvehicles\ndesigned and primarily used for other purposes and only occasionally drawn by\nsuch a motor vehicle. (4)\n\nGross vehicle weight\nis\nthe unloaded weight of the vehicle plus the unloaded weight of the heaviest\nmotor vehicle, trailer, semitrailer, dolly or other device to be used in\ncombination with such vehicle plus the weight of the maximum load, exclusive of\nthe weight of the driver, and his/her helper, which may be carried or drawn by\nsuch vehicle. (5)\n\nUnloaded\nvehicle weight\nis the actual weight of the vehicle, which includes all\nequipment: (i) necessary for the performance\nof the function of the vehicle as a vehicle; (ii)\nnecessary for the safety of the\nvehicle; (iii)\npermanently attached\nto the vehicle; (iv)\nused\nexclusively for the protection of the load carried by the vehicle; or\n(v) used exclusively for the loading or\nunloading of the vehicle. (6)\n\nQualifying vehicle\nis a\ntractor, trailer or semitrailer, provided such qualifying vehicle is used in\ncombination with any vehicles where the gross vehicle weight of such\ncombination exceeds 26,000 pounds. Trailers and semitrailers which otherwise\nmeet the requirement for exemption when combined with a tractor are considered\na qualifying vehicle though combined with a truck. (c) Purchases. (1)\n\nGenerally, the purchase or lease of a\nqualifying vehicle or property installed on such vehicle for its equipping, maintenance or repair may be made without the payment of sales tax provided the\npurchaser gives to the vendor a properly completed exemption certificate for\ntractors, trailers and semitrailers within 90 days of the delivery of the\nproperty. Example 1: An individual engaged in the transportation of property\npurchases a new tractor from a dealer. The purchase agreement calls for the\ntractor to be fully equipped for long-haul situations. Such optional equipment\nincludes the addition of a sleeper unit, an AM-FM stereo radio, splash guards, roof-mounted wind deflector and a built-in toolbox with hand tools included. The purchaser intends to use the tractor in combination with a trailer which\nwhen loaded will exceed 26,000 pounds gross vehicle weight. The purchase of the\ntractor and all optional equipment is exempt from sales tax provided the\npurchaser gives the vendor a properly completed exemption certificate for\ntractors, trailers or semitrailers, within 90 days of the delivery of the\nproperty. (2)\n(i) The purchase of the services of\ninstalling, maintaining, servicing or repairing tangible personal property\n(ordinarily taxed pursuant to section\n1105[c][3] of the Tax Law)\nperformed on (\na\n) qualifying vehicles for the equipping, maintenance or repair thereof, or (\nb\n) property installed on\nqualifying vehicles for the equipping, maintenance or repair thereof, may be\nmade without the payment of sales tax. Property installed by the vendor of the\nservice and transferred as part of such service is also exempt from tax\nregardless of whether the charges therefor are separately stated on the bill\ngiven to the customer. The purchaser must provide the vendor with a properly\ncompleted exemption certificate for tractors, trailers and semitrailers within\n90 days of the date the services were performed to avail itself of the\nexemption. Example 2: The owner of a qualifying vehicle has the vehicle serviced\nat a truck repair center. The services performed consist of changing the oil\nand oil filter, checking all fluid levels, and replacing light bulbs. Charges\nfor such services and parts are exempt from the sales tax provided the\npurchaser gives to the vendor a properly completed exemption certificate for\ntractors, trailers or semitrailers within 90 days of the date the services were\nperformed. Example 3: The owner of a dump truck has the same services provided to\nits vehicle as in example 2. Although the gross vehicle weight of the dump\ntruck exceeds 26,000 pounds, the services are subject to tax because the\nexemption is limited to services performed on qualifying tractors, trailers, semitrailers or property installed on such vehicles and does not apply to\nservices performed on other motor vehicles. (ii)\n\nServices other than those subject to tax\npursuant to section\n1105 (c)(3)\nof the Tax Law\nperformed on qualifying vehicles or on property installed on qualifying\nvehicles are not exempt from tax pursuant to section\n1115 (g)\nof the Tax Law. Thus, the service of producing, fabricating, processing, printing or imprinting\ntangible personal property, performed on qualifying vehicles or property\ninstalled on qualifying vehicles, for a person who directly or indirectly\nfurnishes such property (not purchased by him for resale) are subject to tax. Example 4: The purchase of vehicle painting services for the purpose\nof advertisement, product promotion, company identification or decorative value\nare subject to sales and use taxes. (3)\n(i) Generally, the purchase of parts and supplies (excluding motor fuel and diesel\nmotor fuel) that are installed on or attached to qualifying vehicles for their\nequipping, maintenance or repair may be made without the payment of sales tax\nprovided the purchaser gives to the vendor a properly completed exemption\ncertificate for tractors, trailers or semitrailers within 90 days of the\ndelivery of the property. Such purchases include but are not limited to the\nfollowing: (a) vehicle repair and replacement\nparts; (b) vehicle fluids\n(\ne.g., oil, brake fluid, transmission fluid, coolant, etc.)\nexcluding motor fuel and/or diesel motor fuel; (c) cargo restraint systems; (d) anti-theft devices; (e) safety decals; (f) wind deflectors; (g) splash guards; (h) tractor hose retrievers; and\n(i) dollies which convert semitrailers to\ntrailers. (ii)\n\nThe\npurchase of tools (other than those sold as part of the original equipment of a\nvehicle), shop equipment and supplies that do not become part of or attach to a\nqualifying vehicle are subject to tax at the time of purchase. Such purchases\ninclude but are not limited to the following: (a) road flares and reflectors; (b) hand tools; (c) service jacks; (d) tire changers; (e) battery chargers; (f) parts washers; (g) truck/tractor washers; (h) work stands; and\n(i) wheel balancers. The exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or\nsemitrailers may not be used for purchases of tangible personal property\ndescribed in this subparagraph. (4)\n\nBulk purchases by registered vendors. (i) Purchases in bulk of parts and supplies\ndescribed in subparagraph (3)(i) of this subdivision for qualifying and\nnon-qualifying vehicles when made by a person which is registered as a vendor\nfor purposes of the New York State sales and use tax may be made without the\npayment of sales tax to the extent that the use of such parts and supplies\ncannot be identified at the time of purchase. However, use tax must be paid\nwhen such parts and supplies are installed on a nonqualifying vehicle or when\nused in the equipping, maintenance or repair of a nonqualifying vehicle. Such\ntax should be paid with and reported on the vendor's return filed for the\nperiod in which such parts and supplies are so used. Such person must maintain\nrecords sufficient to identify the use of all such parts and supplies. (See\nsubdivision [d] of this section and Part 533 of this Title.)\n\nExample 5: Company A, a registered vendor, owns, operates and services\nits own fleet of trucks, tractors, trailers and semitrailers. Company A makes\nbulk purchases of oil, oil filters, glo-plugs, brake fluid, brake pads, and\ntires all of which are intended for use on its qualifying vehicles. It may\npurchase all such parts and supplies exempt from sales tax by giving the vendor\na properly completed exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or\nsemitrailers. However, Company A is liable for the use tax on the cost of any\nparts and supplies purchased for use on its qualifying vehicles but used on\nthose of its vehicles which do not qualify for the exemption. Company A is\nrequired to maintain adequate records to identify the vehicles on which such\nparts and supplies were used. (ii)\n\nWhere parts and supplies described in\nsubparagraph (3)(i) of this subdivision are identifiable for use on\nnonqualifying vehicles, no exemption is authorized and the person making such\npurchases is required to pay the tax at the time of purchase. Example 6: Company B, a registered vendor, owns, operates and services\nits fleet of trucks, tractors and trailers. Company B makes purchases in bulk\nof tires for its fleet from two suppliers. All tires for its nonqualifying\ntruck fleet are purchased from Supplier No. 1 while all tires for its\nqualifying vehicles are purchased from Supplier No. 2. In this instance, Company B is required to pay the tax at the time of its purchases from Supplier\n\nNo. 1 but may issue an exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or\nsemitrailers for its purchases from Supplier No. 2. (iii)\n\nWhen a person, which is a registered\nvendor, pays tax at the time of purchase of parts and supplies later used in a\nmanner which qualifies for exemption, it may apply for a refund or credit of\nsuch tax. (See subdivision [e] of this section for provisions relating to\nrefunds and credits.)\n(5)\n\nBulk purchases by other than registered\nvendors. (i) Purchases of parts and supplies\ndescribed in subparagraph (3)(i) of this subdivision made in bulk by a person\nwhich is not required to and is, thus, not registered as a vendor for New York\n\nState sales and use tax purposes are exempt only to the extent that all such\npurchases are for use on qualifying vehicles. In order to make exempt\npurchases, a properly completed exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or\nsemitrailers must be furnished to the vendor within 90 days of the sale. The\npurchaser is required to maintain adequate records to identify the vehicles on\nwhich such parts and supplies were used. (ii)\n\nWhen parts and supplies described in\nsubparagraph (3)(i) of this subdivision are purchased by a person which is not\na registered vendor and such person cannot, at the time of purchase, identify\nthose parts and supplies which will be used on a qualifying vehicle, such\nperson must pay the tax at the time of purchase. Such person may apply for a\nrefund of tax paid with respect to those purchases of property installed upon a\nqualifying vehicle for its equipping, maintenance or repair. (See subdivision\n[e] of this section for provisions relating to refunds and credits.)\n(iii)\n\nWhen purchases of parts and supplies\nare identifiable for installation on or use in the equipping, maintenance or\nrepair of nonqualifying vehicles, no exemption is authorized and the purchaser\nis required to pay the tax due at the time of purchase. (d) Vendor and customer\nobligations. (1)\n\nIn general, the burden\nof proving a receipt is not taxable is upon the vendor and the customer. The\nvendor's sales records must either provide sufficient detail to independently\ndetermine the taxable status of each sale and the amount of tax due and\ncollected thereon or be substantiated by analysis of supporting records. Any\nvendor who willfully fails to keep any required records shall be subject to\ncriminal liability. In order to prove a sale was exempt from tax, exemption\ncertificates must be received, dated and retained. For purposes of this\nexemption, the vendor must obtain from the purchaser or its authorized\nrepresentative, a properly completed exemption certificate for tractors, trailers or semitrailers within 90 days of the date of sale. In addition, the\nname of the business entity and the authorized representative must be shown on\nall invoices for such purchases whether made by cash, check or charged to the\ncustomer's account when such purchases are made by the customer. When services\nare performed on vehicles, the customer invoice must contain information\nsufficient to identify the vehicle on which such services are performed\n(\ne.g., highway use tax permit number for tractors or vehicle\nregistration/license plate number for trailers). Vendors accepting exemption\ncertificates must maintain a method of associating sales made for exempt\npurposes with the certificates on file. A properly completed certificate timely\nreceived in good faith within 90 days of the sale, will relieve the vendor of\nits liability to collect tax on transactions to which the certificate applies. In such event, the burden of proving a transaction is not taxable shall be\nsolely upon the customer. A certificate is not received in good faith if\naccepted in the sale of tangible personal property or a service which is\ndesignated on the front or reverse side of the certificate as not being exempt\nfrom tax. In such a case the vendor and customer are each liable for the sales\nand compensating use tax due. (2)\n\nCustomer obligations. Any person who willfully issues a false or fraudulent\nexemption certificate with intent to evade tax shall be subject to civil and\ncriminal penalties. A properly completed certificate timely received in good\nfaith, will relieve the vendor of its liability to collect tax on transactions\nto which the certificate applies. In such event, the burden of proving a\ntransaction is not taxable shall be solely upon the customer. Sales and\ncompensating use tax will be due with respect to any vehicle, parts or supplies\nwhich are purchased free of tax and later used in a manner which does not\nqualify for exemption. Unless a customer keeps records sufficient to prove that\nproperty purchased without payment of tax was used in an exempt manner, it\nshall be presumed that compensating use tax is due with respect to such\nproperty. (3)\n(i) For more complete rules with respect to\ncollection of tax and vendor's obligations see Parts 532 and 533 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nFor criminal penalties\nfor failure to keep required records, see Tax Law, section 1817(j). (iii)\n\nFor civil and criminal penalties for\nfalse or fraudulent use of an exemption certificate, see Tax Law, sections\n1145(a)(5) and 1817(m). (e) Refund or credit. Refunds and credits of sales tax imposed and paid on\npurchases subject to the exemption described in subdivision (a) of this section\nshall be administered in accordance with the provisions of Part 534 of this\n\nTitle and section\n1139\nof the\n\nTax Law.
