Tit. 9 § 6500.6 - Award amount and schedule of reduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The executive director in consultation\nwith the advisory council will determine the types of projects to be funded\nfrom the allocation for each fiscal year based on factors which shall include, but need not be limited to: (1)\nconsistency\nwith the requirements and intent of the Jobs Two Thousand for New York State\n(J2K) Act; (2)\ndemand as evidenced\nby the number and type of applications previously received for this and other\nprograms administered by NYSTAR; and\n(3)\npublic comments and requests received by\nNYSTAR or other appropriate evidence of need. (b) Consistent with the number of\napplications and the funds appropriated, the executive director in consultation\nwith the advisory council may limit the maximum amount of State assistance\navailable for any project. (c) The\n\nFaculty Development Program is intended to provide interim State assistance to\ngenerate long-term commitment by the award recipient to the funded\nentrepreneurial research endeavor. Accordingly, the proportion of State\nassistance to the total cost of the proposal decreases relative to the\nincreased financial responsibility borne by the award recipient as reflected in\nthe required increase in match set forth in section\n6500.5\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n6500.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
