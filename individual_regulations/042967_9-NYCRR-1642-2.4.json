  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-2.4 - Accounts payable vouchers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Description of accounts payable voucher form. The authorization for the\nissuance of a check shall be an accounts payable voucher, prepared in advance\nof the drawing of the check and recorded in the cash disbursements-voucher\nregister (see §\n1642-3.3\n). A specimen form of\naccounts payable voucher is shown as Exhibit 1 of Appendix S-8. These forms\nshould be printed in an original only and are to be provided by the local\nagency. The former requirement for the printing of these forms in an original\nand duplicate, with the duplicate reserved for submission to the division has\nbeen eliminated. The forms should not be prenumbered when printed. A separate\nseries of accounts payable vouchers shall be used for each type of fund. Thus, for each single or multiple development project, there shall be one series of\naccount payable vouchers for the development fund, another for the\nadministration fund, etc., regardless of the number of bank accounts\nconstituting each fund. The vouchers in each such series shall be numbered in\nsequence. Vouchers shall be filed by series and by number. It is suggested that\nthe vouchers for the various series be printed on different colors of paper and\nthat the voucher number be preceded by some identifying character, such as D\nfor development fund, A for administration fund, etc. The name of the local\nagency, the name and number of the project, the name of the fund and the name\nof the bank on which the checks are to be drawn, if known at the time the\nprinting order is given, may be preprinted on the form. In this connection, it\nmay be well to bear in mind that only limited quantities, relatively, of\nvoucher forms will be required for the reserve and security deposits funds and\nthat, in lieu of ordering the printing of separate series, therefore, consideration may be given to using administration fund voucher forms, suitably\nmodified, for vouchering disbursements from these funds. (b) Preparation of accounts payable vouchers. (1)\n\nAll the information set forth in the\nspecimen form of accounts payable voucher shall be furnished. The original\ninvoice, or other claim for payment shall be attached to the voucher. Each\nvoucher shall be supported by the following evidence: (i) evidence that the expenditure has been\nduly authorized before it was incurred; (ii)\nevidence that the services have been\nrendered or that the materials, in the specified quantity, quality and kind, have been received; (iii)\nevidence\nthat the claim represents a proper charge to the project. (iv)\nevidence that the claim is correct as to\nprices and amount and that all calculations, extensions, and footings have been\nverified; (v) evidence that the\namount of the claim contained in the voucher or any part thereof has not been\nincluded in or made part of any voucher previously approved for\npayment; (vi)\nevidence that the\nterms of any contract applicable thereto have been complied with; (vii)\nevidence of division approval, where\nsuch approval is required. (2)\n\nThe person designated by the local agency\nto approve vouchers for payment shall satisfy himself that the required\nsupporting evidence is attached to or forms part of the voucher before affixing\nhis approval thereto. The forms that such evidence may take are described in\nsubdivision (c) below. (c) Invoices and other claims for payment. Invoices should be based on purchase orders or contracts. Exceptions are claims\nfor payment for travel expenses, utility services, payrolls, payroll\nwithholdings, reimbursement of petty cash fund, rent refunds, security deposit\nrefunds, and transfers of funds. All extensions and footings shall be checked\nin detail and the initials of the employees responsible for the computations\nshall be indicated on each invoice or other claim for payment. The project or\nprojects affected and the accounts to be charged as well as the amounts to be\nso charged shall be entered on the invoice or other claims for payment as a\nbasis for preparing the accounts payable voucher. Instructions in connection\nwith the various types of claims for payment follow: (1)\n\nInvoices based on purchase orders. (i) Where the invoice is based on a purchase\norder, the copy of the purchase order received by the accounting department at\nthe time of issuance shall be filed alphabetically by vendor. The receiving and\ninspection report, when received, shall be filed with the copy of the purchase\norder. When an invoice is received from the vendor, it shall be checked against\nthe purchase order and the receiving and inspection report for propriety of\npayment and accuracy of billing. (ii)\n\nIf vendors are requested to submit\ninvoices in duplicate, the duplicates may be used to maintain a vendors file of\npaid invoices filed alphabetically by vendors, and appropriately cross\nreferenced by voucher and check numbers, for checking for duplication of\nbilling and payment. Further control over the duplication of payments may be\nachieved by maintaining a creditors ledger with accounts for each vendor. This\ndevice has the merit of providing a historical record, in summary form, of\ninvoices received and payments made. After preparing the voucher, the original\ninvoice, the copy of the purchase order and the receiving and inspection report\nshall be attached to the voucher. Separate vouchers shall be prepared for each\nvendor but individual vouchers need not be prepared for each invoice. Purchase\norders shall be in agreement with invoice or differences satisfactorily\nexplained. Appropriate procedures, which will depend on the structure and\norganization of the local agency's staff, should be adopted to control the\npayment of invoices in the event that partial shipments are received on\npurchase orders. (iii)\n\nLocal\nagencies are enjoined to pay bills promptly and to take advantage of all\ndiscounts. Where bills are discounted, only the net amounts, after the\ndiscount, shall be charged to the applicable cost, expense, or inventory\naccounts. (2)\n\nInvoices\nbased on contracts. (i) Construction and\ndemolition contracts. Contracts for demolition and clearing and for structures, equipment and improvements (see account 1460) represent special cases in that\nthe contractor submits his claim for payment on a special form provided by the\ndivision (form DH-356, Periodical Estimate for Partial Payment) rather than on\nhis own invoice. A list of the documents required to support an accounts\npayable voucher drawn to make payments to such contractors, and instructions in\nconnection with the preparation thereof, will be found in Part 1646. Development Period Accounting. (ii)\n\nContracts for the purchase of land. Contracts for the purchase of land also\nrepresent a special case in that the local agency is not invoiced by the\nvendors, but payments are made in accordance with the contract terms. Such\npayments, as well as the contract itself, must have the prior approval of the\ndivision. Instructions for the vouchering of payments on land contracts will be\nfound in Part 1646. Development Period Accounting. (iii)\n\nOther contracts. Upon receipt, contracts shall be filed alphabetically by contractor. Active contracts may be\nsegregated from inactive. A contract record card containing pertinent\ninformation as to payment terms may be established for contracts involving\nrecurring payments. However, where the contract falls within the group of\ndevelopment contracts to which contract numbers are assigned (see the\ndefinition of account 1460, Structures, Equipment and Improvements, in Part\n1641) the contract shall be recorded in a contractors ledger (see §\n1642-3.12\n), the maintenance of\nwhich is mandatory. A receiving and inspection report shall be received by the\naccounting department for all deliveries of materials and for all services\nclaimed to have been rendered. When an invoice is received from the contractor, it shall be checked against the contract and the receiving and inspection\nreport, if required, for propriety of payment and accuracy of billing. After\npreparation of the voucher, which shall bear reference to the contract, the\ninvoice and the receiving and inspection report shall be attached to the\nvoucher. (3)\n\nTravel\nexpenses. Travel claims shall be prepared by the person desiring to be\nreimbursed and shall be submitted to the local agency together with the\nrequired supports for audit in accordance with the travel regulations of the\nlocal agency (see §\n1640-10.1, Travel regulations, for\nthe required supports and for the maximum travel expenses chargeable to\n\nState-aided projects). The travel claim shall be approved, after audit, by the\nperson designated by the local agency prior to being vouchered for payment. The\ntravel claim and the supports shall be attached to the accounts payable\nvoucher. (4)\n\nUtility services. When\na bill for utility services is received, the bill, prior to payment, shall be\nchecked against the contract or rate schedule (or the extract or summary\nthereof) to make certain that (i) the schedule approved by the division is\ncorrectly applied, and (ii) consumption figures are correct, and (iii) all\ndiscounts, such as those for prompt payment of the bill, etc., have been\napplied. After this is done, all calculations on the face of the bill should be\nchecked for mathematical accuracy. If any substantial discrepancies not due to\nchanges in project operating conditions or to seasonal factors are observed, a\ndetailed investigation, including a check of previous bills by the utility\ncompany, should be undertaken. Where the review of the billing is satisfactory, a voucher shall be prepared for the amount and the utility bill shall be\nattached to the voucher. (5)\n\nPayrolls. (i) The authorization for the\npreparation of an accounts payable voucher to pay salaries and wages of local\nagency officers and employees shall be a duly certified and approved payroll, prepared in accordance with Subpart 1642-8. The payroll shall be attached to\nthe voucher. In the accounting information on the voucher, the gross amount of\nthe payroll is distributed to the applicable cost or expense accounts in\naccordance with the payroll summary analysis (Exhibit 30, Appendix S-8), and\nthe difference between this amount and the actual net cash disbursements\ncredited to the appropriate accounts for deductions, such as income tax\nwithholdings, etc. Individual pay checks may be issued to each\nemployee. (ii)\n\nThe use of a\nseparate payroll fund bank account is ordinarily indicated only where the\nauthority is operating more than one project or a central office. After the\npayroll and accounts payable voucher have been prepared, a check is drawn, on\nthe particular fund applicable, to transfer the net amount of the payroll to\nthe payroll fund. Individual pay checks are then drawn on the latter. In the\naccounting information on the voucher, the net amount of the payroll is charged\nto account 1640, Payroll Clearance. The gross amount of the payroll is later\ndistributed by means of a journal voucher based on the payroll summary analysis\n(see Subpart 1642-8 and Exhibit 30) to the applicable cost or expense accounts. The credit entries for the same journal voucher are obtained from the payroll\n(Exhibit 29, Appendix S-8); the next amount paid (column 9) is credited to\naccount 1640, Payroll Clearance; and payroll deductions such as retirement\nfund, income taxes withheld, etc. (column 8) are credited to the appropriate\naccounts, 2138 and 2117.1, etc. (6)\n\nPayroll withholdings. Accounts payable\nvouchers prepared to authorize disbursements of amounts withheld from salaries\nfor income taxes, pension fund contributions, etc., shall be supported by the\nappropriate documents such as are required by law or by an original invoice or\nother claim for payment of the organization to whom the payments are to be\nmade, listing the individual amounts. The supporting material shall be attached\nto the voucher. In the accounting information on the voucher, the account\npreviously credited with the deduction shall be charged. (7)\n\nReimbursement of petty cash fund. Accounts payable vouchers prepared to reimburse the petty cash fund shall be\nsupported by the petty cash vouchers and attached invoices and by an analysis\nsheet, based on the petty cash vouchers, distributing the amount of the\nreimbursement to the applicable cost or expense account. The reimbursement\nshall be for the total of the petty cash vouchers and all the supports\nmentioned shall be attached to the accounts payable voucher. In the accounting\ninformation section of the latter, the applicable cost or expense accounts\nshall be charged in accordance with the supporting analysis of the petty cash\nvouchers and development fund or administration fund, whichever is applicable, shall be credited. See section\n1642-2.5\nfor the operation of the\npetty cash fund. (8)\n\nRent refunds. Formal requests for rent refunds approved by the project manager or other\ndesignated official shall be attached to the accounts payable voucher prepared\nto authorize the issuance of a check for such refund. Computation of the amount\nof the refund shall be verified prior to preparation of the voucher. In the\naccounting information section of the voucher, the amount refunded shall be\ncharged to account 1122, Tenants Accounts Receivable. (9)\n\nSecurity deposits refunds. Formal\nrequests for security deposit refunds approved by the project manager or other\ndesignated official shall be attached to the accounts payable voucher prepared\nto authorize the issuance of a check for such refund. The request for security\ndeposit refund should show the amount of the security deposit, interest earned\nand unpaid charges deductible from the security deposit (but not in excess of\nthe security deposit plus interest thereon) and the balance, if any, payable to\nthe tenant. In the accounting information section of the voucher, account 2114, Tenants Security Deposits, is charged with the gross amount of the security\ndeposit balance before any deductions, and account 1114, Security Deposits\n\nFund, is credited with the sum of the two charges. Separate checks are drawn\nfor the amount deductible for unpaid charges, which check is drawn to the order\nof the administration fund, and for the net amount to be refunded to the\ntenant. The check for the unpaid charges deducted is credited, when deposited, to account 1122, Tenants Accounts Receivable, which will have already been\ncharged. (10)\n\nTransfers of funds. Accounts payable vouchers authorizing transfers between funds shall be\nsupported by a full explanation, attached to the voucher, of the reason for the\ntransfer. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
