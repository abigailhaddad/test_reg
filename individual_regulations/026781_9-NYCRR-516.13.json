  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.13 - Summary courts-martial\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Summary courts-martial generally. (1)\n\nComposition. A summary court-martial is composed of one officer. Whenever\npracticable, a summary court-martial should be an officer whose grade is not\nbelow Lieutenant Commander of the Naval Militia or Major of the Army National\n\nGuard or Air National Guard. When only one officer is present with a command or\ndetachment, that officer is to be the summary court-martial of that command or\ndetachment. When more than one officer is present with a command or detachment, the convening authority may not be the summary court-martial of that command or\ndetachment. (2)\n\nFunction. The\nfunction of the summary court-martial is to promptly adjudicate minor offenses\nunder a simple procedure. The summary court-martial is to thoroughly and\nimpartially inquire into both sides of the matter and shall ensure that the\ninterests of both the State and the accused are safeguarded and that justice is\ndone. A summary court-martial may seek advice from a judge advocate or legal\nofficer on questions of law, but the summary court-martial may not seek advice\nfrom any person on factual conclusions which should be drawn from evidence or\nthe sentence which should be imposed, as the summary court-martial has the\nindependent duty to make these determinations. (3)\n\nJurisdiction. Subject to section\n516.2\nof this Part, summary courts-martial have the power to try persons subject to the code, except officers and warrant officers. (4)\n\nPunishments. Summary courts-martial have\nthe power to sentence to confinement at hard labor not exceeding 25 days; fines\nnot exceeding $25; confinement at hard labor in lieu of fines imposed not\nexceeding one day for each dollar of fine imposed; forfeiture of pay and\nallowances not exceeding $25; reprimand; reduction of noncommissioned officers\nto an inferior grade; and to combine any two or more of such punishments in the\nsentences imposed (ML, 130.20[c]). Summary courts-martial also may not combine\nan alternative sentence of confinement at hard labor in lieu of fine with any\nother sentence authorized in subdivision (d) except reprimand and reduction if\nthe result would exceed the jurisdictional limitations of a summary\ncourts-martial. (5)\n\nCounsel. The\naccused at a summary court-martial does not have the right to counsel. If the\naccused has civilian counsel provided by the accused and qualified under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 502(d)(3), that counsel must be permitted to represent the accused\nat the summary court-martial if such appearance will not unreasonably delay the\nproceedings and if military exigencies do not preclude it. (6)\n\nPower to obtain witnesses and evidence. A\nsummary court-martial may obtain evidence pursuant to N.Y.R.C.M. 703. (b) Convening a summary\ncourt-martial.

(2)\n\nWhen convening authority is accuser. If\nthe convening authority or the summary court-martial is the accuser, it is\ndiscretionary with the convening authority whether to forward the charges to a\nsuperior authority with a recommendation to convene the summary court-martial. If the convening authority or the summary court-martial is the accuser, the\njurisdiction of the summary court-martial is not affected. (3)\n\nProcedure.
