  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 385.2 - Participation and exemptions for applicants and for recipients of public assistance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General participation requirements. All\napplicants for and recipients of public assistance must participate in public\nassistance work activities assigned by the social services official in\naccordance with the requirements of this Part. Such applicants and recipients\nwho fail to comply without good cause with the requirements of this Part shall\nbe subject to the provisions of section\n385.12\nof this Part. (b) Exemptions from the requirement to\nparticipate in work activities. An applicant for or recipient of public\nassistance is exempt from participation in public assistance work activities\npursuant to the requirements of this Part if he/she is determined by the social\nservices official to be: (1)\nill or injured\nto the extent that he/she is unable to engage in work activities for up to\nthree months, as verified by medical evidence; (2)\n60 years of age or older; (3)\nunder the age of 16 or under the age of\n19 and attending full-time a secondary, vocational or technical\nschool; (4)\ndisabled or\nincapacitated in accordance with the provisions of subdivision (d) of this\nsection; (5)\nneeded in the home\nbecause another member of the household requires his/her presence due to a\nverified mental or physical impairment, and the social services official has\ndetermined that no other member of the household is appropriate to provide such\ncare. For the purposes of this paragraph, the term verified shall mean that a\nlicensed physician or certified psychologist has made the determination that\nsuch an impairment exists and that the household member is in need of\ncare; (6)\npregnant, beginning 30\ndays prior to the medically verified date of the delivery of the\nchild; (7)\nthe parent or other\ncaretaker relative in a one parent household of a child under 12 months of age\nwho is personally providing care for such a child. This exemption must last for\nno longer than 12 months for any parent or caretaker relative's life; (i) the exemption shall last no longer than\nthree months for any one child unless the social services official makes a\ndetermination to extend the exemption for the child for up to the total\n12-month maximum for the life of such parent or caretaker relative; (ii)\nto the extent that the total of 12\nmonths of exemption have not been exhausted by such parent or caretaker, the\nsocial services official shall apply the exemption to the parent or caretaker\nin the case of a child under three months of age, but shall determine whether\nto apply such exemption in the case of a child more than three months of\nage. (c) Documentation of exemption. (1)\n\nIf an\napplicant for or recipient of public assistance claims that he/she should be\nexempt from work activities pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section for\nreasons other than a medical limitation on his/her ability to work the social\nservices official shall notify the individual verbally or in writing of the\nopportunity to provide to the social services official, within 10 calendar days\nof such notification, such evidence as the social services official deems\nnecessary in order for the social services official to determine whether the\napplicant or recipient should be exempt from work activities. An applicant or\nrecipient who claims that he/she should be exempt from work activities for\nreasons other than a medical limitation and who fails to provide documentation\nthat he/she should be exempt will be deemed to have failed to meet the\neligibility requirements for assistance pursuant to Part 351 of this Title. Failure of such documentation to substantiate the claimed exemption shall not\nitself cause the individual to be ineligible for public assistance. (2)\nA recipient of public assistance who\npreviously has been determined to be exempt from work activities pursuant to\nsubdivision (b) of this section for reason(s) other than a medical limitation\non his/her ability to work, and who claims that he/she should remain exempt, must provide such evidence as the social services official deems necessary in\norder for the social services official to determine whether the recipient\nshould continue to be exempt from work activities. A recipient who fails to\nprovide such evidence shall be deemed to have failed to meet the requirements\nfor continued eligibility pursuant to Part 351 of this Title. A recipient may\nnot be required to repeatedly produce a document already in the social services\ndistrict's files regarding a condition which the social services official\ndetermines is not subject to change. (d) Disability and work limitation\nprovisions. (1)\nA social services official\nmust, at application and recertification, or whenever he/she has reason to\nbelieve that an applicant for or recipient of public assistance might have a\nphysical or mental impairment, inquire whether such individual has any medical\ncondition which would limit his/her ability to participate in work\nactivities. (2)\n\nShould the\napplicant or recipient declare that he/she has a mental or physical impairment, the social services official: (i) shall\nnotify the individual verbally or in writing of the opportunity to present to\nthe social services official, within 10 calendar days of such notification, any\nmedical documentation, including but not limited to, drug prescriptions and\nreports of the individual's treating health care practitioner (hereinafter\nreferred to as the individual's practitioner). Such documentation must contain\na specific diagnosis resulting from any medically appropriate tests and specify\nany work limitation of the individual; and/or\n(ii)\nmay refer the individual to a health\ncare practitioner certified by the New York State Office of Disability\n\nDeterminations (hereinafter referred to as the district's practitioner) for a\ndetermination of the individual's medical condition; (a) if the social services official refers an\nindividual to the district's practitioner prior to such individual submitting\ndocumentation from the individual's practitioner, the individual shall make\nhis/her best efforts to bring the documentation to the examination by the\ndistrict's practitioner, so that it may be reviewed as a part of the\nexamination; (b) in such instances, any documentation available from the individual's practitioner must be\nsubmitted to the district's practitioner no later than four days after the\nexamination, provided that in no instance shall such time period exceed 10\ncalendar days from the notification set forth in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph, or the district's practitioner will not be required to consider it\nas a part of the evidence used to determine the individual's medical\ncondition. (3)\n\nIn evaluating an individual's claim of a\nphysical or mental impairment, the social services official shall have sole\ndiscretion in determining whether any documentation provided by the individual\nor by the individual's practitioner is sufficient evidence of the claimed or\ndeclared impairment. (4)\n\nIn\nevaluating the initial claim of a mental or physical impairment made by an\napplicant, or the continuing claim of a medical impairment made by a recipient\nwho has been previously determined exempt from participation in work\nactivities, the social services official may require the individual to\ncooperate with measures to verify such claim and/or to submit documentation as\ndescribed in subparagraph (2)(i) of this subdivision as a condition of\neligibility for public assistance and SNAP in accordance with the requirements\nof Parts 351 and 387 of this Title. Failure of such documentation to\nsubstantiate the claimed impairment shall not itself cause the individual to be\nineligible for public assistance. (5)\n\nIn evaluating the ongoing claim of a\nmental or physical impairment made by an individual who has been determined by\nthe social services official not to be exempt after a determination made in\naccordance with the requirements of this section, the social services official\nmay require the individual to provide additional documentation from the\nindividual's practitioner. Such individual remains non-exempt until and unless\na different determination is made by the social services official. (6)\n(i) In\nthe absence of any claim of mental or physical impairment on the part of the\nindividual, if the social services official suspects that such individual has a\nmental or physical impairment, the social services official shall refer the\nindividual to the social services district's health care practitioner for an\nexamination and determination of his/her medical condition. (ii)\n\nThe social services official shall\nnotify the individual of an opportunity to present any medical documentation\navailable from the individual's practitioner at the time of the examination, or\nin any event no later than four days from the date of that examination if the\nindividual wishes such documentation to be considered by the district's\npractitioner in the determination of the individual's medical\ncondition. (7)\n\nAt the\ntime that the social services official or the district's practitioner makes a\ndetermination of an individual's medical condition, the social services\nofficial shall notify the applicant or recipient in writing of such\ndetermination and of the right to request a fair hearing to contest such\ndetermination within 10 days of such notification. (i) If the individual requests a fair hearing\nwithin the 10-day period, the social services official shall not assign the\nindividual to work activities pending the fair hearing determination, except\nthat the social services official may, during the pendency of a determination\npursuant to this section assign an individual, with the agreement of such\nindividual, to a limited work assignment which would be consistent with any\nlimitations associated with the mental or physical impairments alleged by the\nindividual. (ii)\n\nNotwithstanding\nany requirement of Part 358 of this Title, an individual shall not have the\nright to a fair hearing to contest such determination if he/she requests a fair\nhearing after the 10-day period specified in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (8)\n(i) At any time after an applicant or\nrecipient alleges that he/she has a mental or physical impairment which would\nlimit his/her assignment to work activities, or render him/her exempt from\nassignment to work activities and the social services official has reason to\nbelieve that the individual misrepresented that he/she suffered from such an\nimpairment, the social services official shall notify the individual in writing\nof a potential sanction, the duration of which is consistent with the\nprovisions of section\n385.12\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (ii)\n\nThe social services\nofficial shall effect such sanction if: (a) he/she determines, based upon clear medical evidence, that there is no medical\nbasis for the individual's claim that he/she is unable to participate in work\nactivities based upon a physical or medical impairment; and\n(b) he/she determines that the individual\nintentionally misrepresented his/her medical condition. (9)\n\nIf the social services\nofficial refers an applicant or recipient to the social services district's\npractitioner for an examination as a result of a mental or physical impairment\nclaim by the applicant or recipient, in accordance with the provisions of this\nsection, the examiner shall: (i) review and\nconsider all records or information timely provided by the individual or\nhis/her treating health care practitioner that are pertinent to the claimed\nmedical condition; (ii)\nprovide to\nthe social services official in writing a specific diagnosis as evidenced by\nmedically appropriate tests or evaluations in determination of the individual's\nclaimed condition; (iii)\nindicate\nto the social services official and the individual in writing, a medical\nopinion which specifies whether the medical condition alleged by the individual\nis present or absent; the social services official shall be responsible for\nensuring that the applicant or recipient does receive such written medical\nopinion; (iv)\nreport to the social\nservices official the presence of any condition other than that which was\nalleged by the individual, but which was discovered in the course of the\nexamination, which may interfere with the individual's ability to fully engage\nin work activities; (v) determine\nwhether the individual is: (a) disabled and\nexempt from participation in work activities assigned in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part; provided, however, that such determination shall\nspecify the duration of time for which the disability shall prevent the social\nservices official from making an assignment to work activities; (b) work limited, having specific identified\nlimitations affecting the type of work activity to which the individual may be\nassigned; provided, however, that such determination shall specify the duration\nof time for which such work limitations shall apply to such\nindividual; (c) neither disabled\nnor work limited. (vi)\nprovide a written determination, when issuing an opinion that differs from that\nof the individual's treating health care practitioner, that specifies the\nreason for disagreement with the determination and present evidence that\nsupports the examiner's opinion. (10)\n\nThe social services official shall not\nassign to work activities any individual for whom a medical determination is\npending, either as the result of a request by an applicant or recipient or\ndirection of the social services official, until such a determination is\nrendered pursuant to the requirements of this section unless the individual\nagrees to a limited work assignment consistent with the individual's alleged\nmedical condition. (11)\n\nNotwithstanding any other requirement of this section, an individual who is\neligible to receive comprehensive health services through a special needs plan\nas set forth in paragraph (m) or (n) of subdivision one of section\n364-j\nof\nthe Social Services Law and the regulations promulgated thereunder, regardless\nof whether such a plan is operating in the social services district in which\nthe individual resides, shall be considered to be either disabled or work\nlimited, as determined by the social services official. (12)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraphs (1) through\n(11) of this subdivision, an individual whom the social services official\nsuspects as having, or who indicates that he/she has an impairment that is due\nto alcohol or substance abuse, shall be subject to the requirements of section\n351.2\n(i) of this\n\nTitle. (13)\n(i) An individual shall be deemed to be work\nlimited if the social services official determines that, in accordance with the\nprovisions of this section for determining disabilities, such individual has\nmental or physical impairments which would limit his/her ability to engage in\nwork activities in accordance to the requirements of this Part. (ii)\n\nIn the case of an individual who is work\nlimited, the social services official shall assign such individual to work\nactivities only if the assignment: (a) is\nconsistent with the individual's treatment plan when such plan is prescribed by\nthe individual's practitioner and/or the social services district's\npractitioner; (b) where no\ntreatment plan exists, that the assignment is consistent with the individual's\nmental and physical limitations; and\n(c) is determined to be appropriate by the\nsocial services official who is satisfied that such individual is able to\nperform the work assigned and that such assignment will assist the individual's\ntransition to self-sufficiency. (14)\n\nThe social services official shall, when\nassigning a recipient who is work limited to work activities pursuant to\nsection\n385.9\nof this Part, inform in\nwriting the individual responsible for supervising such activities of any\nlimitations of the recipient. (e) Restoration to self-sufficiency. An\nindividual who has been determined to be exempt from participation in work\nactivities in accordance with the requirements of this Part due to being\ndisabled pursuant to this section, who in the judgment of the social services\nofficial has the potential to be restored to self-sufficiency through\nrehabilitation, may be required, when determined appropriate by the social\nservices official, to: (1)\nprovide\ninformation from the individual's practitioner or submit to an examination by\nthe social services district's practitioner in order to determine whether or\nnot the individual can recover from a mental or physical impairment; (2)\naccept medical care provided by the\nsocial services official or made available through other agencies to assist the\nindividual in recovering from a mental or physical impairment and in restoring\nthe individual to self-sufficiency; (3)\naccept referral to and enrollment in a\nprogram of vocational rehabilitation, training and other essential\nrehabilitation designed to restore an individual to self-sufficiency; (4)\ngive evidence, as requested by the social\nservices official, that he/she is participating in a program assigned by the\nsocial services official in accordance with the provisions of this\nsubdivision. (f) Engaged-in-work requirement. (1)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this subdivision, the term engaged-in-work shall be defined by the\nsocial services official. Such definition shall be included in the social\nservices district's local plan prepared pursuant to the requirements of section\n385.10\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe social services official shall ensure\nthat each parent or caretaker of a dependent child, when such parent or\ncaretaker is receiving public assistance funded through the Federal Temporary\n\nAssistance to Needy Families Program, is engaged-in-work as soon as\npracticable, but no later than 24 months (whether or not consecutive) from\ninitial receipt of assistance. For the purposes of this paragraph, the initial\nreceipt of assistance for individuals who were receiving such assistance on or\nbefore December 2, 1996 shall be December 2, 1996.
