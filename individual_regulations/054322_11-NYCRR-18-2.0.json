  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 18-2.0 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThis Subpart was initially promulgated in 1979. However, in November 1987, the members of the New York Insurance Exchange, Inc. voted to suspend writing new and renewal business, and no business has been written on the Exchange since that time. In November 1999, the New York Insurance Exchange, Inc. was liquidated. Nonetheless, because article 62 remains in the Insurance Law, this Subpart is continued. The original statutory references have been retained. (2)\n\nSection 425-a, now article 62 of the Insurance Law, was added by chapter 480 of the Laws of 1978, effective July 20, 1978, and was amended by chapter 11 of the Laws of 1979, effective February 28, 1979. Subdivision 1 of section 425- a, now section 6201(a), provides for the creation of a New York insurance exchange, subject to such regulations as may be promulgated by the superintendent; subdivision 6 of section 425-a, now section 6203(d), gives the superintendent authority to establish limitations on investments in members of the exchange. (b) This Subpart implements the provisions of subdivision 6 of section 425-a, now section\n6203 (d)\nof the Insurance Law by establishing the limitations on investments as set forth in section\n18-2.2\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n18-2.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
