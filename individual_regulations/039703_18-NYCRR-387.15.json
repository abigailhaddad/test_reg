  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 387.15 - Determining food stamp benefit levels\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Calculating net monthly income. To\ndetermine a household's net monthly income the following calculations shall be\nperformed: (1)\n\nAdd the gross monthly income\nearned by all household members and the total monthly unearned income of all\nhousehold members, subtract income exclusions, thereby determining the\nhousehold's total gross income. (2)\n\nMultiply the total gross monthly earned income by 20 percent and subtract that\namount from the total gross income. (3)\n\nSubtract the standard deduction as\ndescribed in section\n387.12\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nDetermine if the\nhousehold is entitled to an excess medical deduction as described in section\n387.12\n(c). If the\nmedical expenses exceed $35, then subtract that portion which exceeds\n$35. (5)\n\nSubtract monthly dependent\ncare expenses, if any, as described in section\n387.12, up to the maximum amount\nallowed. (6)\n\nDeduct child support\npayments, if any, made to nonhousehold members as set forth in section\n387.12\nof this Part. (7)\n\nTotal the allowable shelter expenses as\ndescribed in section\n387.12\nto determine shelter costs. Subtract from total shelter costs 50 percent of the household's monthly income\nafter all the above deductions have been subtracted. The remaining amount, if\nany, is the excess shelter cost. If there is no excess shelter cost, the net\nmonthly income has been determined. (8)\n\nIf there is excess shelter cost, compute\nthe shelter deduction by subtracting the excess shelter cost up to the maximum\namount allowed (unless the household is entitled to the full amount of its\nexcess shelter expenses) from the household's monthly income after all other\napplicable deductions. Households not subject to a capped shelter expense\n(those having an aged or disabled member) will have the full amount exceeding\n50 percent of their net income subtracted. (b) Rounding. The cents amounts associated\nwith each income and allowable amount specified in paragraphs (a)(1)-(7) of\nthis section shall be utilized throughout the computation of the net monthly\nincome. (c) Destitute migrant\nhouseholds shall have their net monthly income calculated for the month of\napplication in accordance with subdivisions (a) and (b) of this section except\nthat only such income which is received between the first of the month and the\ndate of application shall be used in the calculation. Any income from a new\nsource which is anticipated after the day of application shall be disregarded\nfor the month of application. (d) All households which are not categorically eligible households must have their\nnet incomes, as calculated in subdivisions (a), (b) and (c) of this section, compared to the monthly net income eligibility standards for the appropriate\nhousehold size as specified in section\n387.10\nof this Part to determine\neligibility for the month. In addition to meeting the net income eligibility\nstandards, households which are not categorically eligible households and do\nnot contain an elderly or disabled member also must have their gross incomes, as calculated in accordance with subdivisions (a)(1), (b) and (c) of this\nsection, compared to the gross monthly income standards for the appropriate\nhousehold size as specified in section\n387.10\nto determine eligibility\nfor the month. (e) To determine a\nhousehold's food stamp entitlement, once eligibility has been established, multiply the food stamp net income by 30 percent. Any result ending in cents\nshall be rounded up to the nearest higher dollar. Subtract this figure from the\nappropriate coupon allotment for the household size. The final figure is the\nhousehold's food stamp entitlement. Basis of coupon issuance tables provided by\nthe department may be used in lieu of the calculation. (f) If the calculation of benefits in\naccordance with section\n387.14\n(a)(1)\nof\nthis Part for an initial month would yield an allotment of less than $10 for\nthe household, no benefit shall be issued to the household in that initial\nmonth. (g) Except during an initial\nmonth, all eligible one- and two-person households shall receive minimum\nmonthly allotments of $10. All eligible households with three or more members\nwhich are entitled to $1, $3 and $5 allotments shall receive allotments of $2, $4 and $6, respectively, so as to correspond to current coupon book\ndenominations.
