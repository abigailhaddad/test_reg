  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.8 - Geomembrane liners\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Materials\nrequired. The geomembrane base liner material must be constructed of HDPE\npolymer that is acceptable to the department. (b) Construction requirements. (1)\n\nThe geomembrane in both the primary and\nsecondary composite liner systems must be installed in direct and uniform\ncontact with the underlying low-permeability soil layer or GCL in a manner that\nminimizes waves and avoids creases and must be field seamed to control fluid\nmigration from the landfill. Any waves must be less than two inches in\nheight. (2)\n\nGeomembranes must be\ninstalled at a minimum slope of two percent, except slopes parallel to the\nleachate collection pipe must have a minimum slope of one percent. (3)\n\nThe surface of the supporting soil upon\nwhich the geomembrane will be installed must be free of stones, organic matter, cracks, irregularities, protrusions, loose soil, and any abrupt changes in\ngrade. (4)\n\nThe anchoring system\nmust be constructed as shown on the approved engineering drawings to eliminate\npotential liquid leakage into the secondary leachate collection and removal\nsystem by, at a minimum: (i) diverting\nsurface water run-off away from the anchoring system; and\n(ii)\nseaming the primary and secondary\ngeomembranes together. (5)\n\nField seams must be constructed in\naccordance with the following: (i) field\nseams must be oriented parallel to the line of maximum slope (i.e., oriented\nalong, not across the slope). In corners and irregularly shaped locations, the\nnumber of field seams must be minimized. The number of horizontal seams must be\nminimized. Horizontal seams must be more than five feet from the toe of slope\nin either direction. (ii)\nfield\nseams must be primarily made by using a dual-track thermal fusion seaming\nmethod. Extrusion welding of field seams must be minimized to the extent\npractical; (iii)\nthe seam area must\nbe free of moisture, dust, dirt, debris, and foreign material before\nseaming; (iv)\nfield seaming is\nprohibited when either the ambient air temperature measured one meter above the\ngeomembrane or the temperature of the surface of the geomembrane is below\n32° F, when the temperature of the surface of the geomembrane exceeds\n158° F, when the ambient air temperature measured one meter above the\ngeomembrane is above 120° F, during periods of sustained winds in excess of\n20 miles per hour, or during periods of precipitation; and\n(v) the field crew foreman of the liner\ninstaller must have a documented minimum qualification of installing at least\n50 acres of previous landfill or comparable geosynthetic systems, on a minimum\nof five different projects. Each welding machine must be operated by a welding\ntechnician who has been certified to operate the welder by a certification\nprogram acceptable to the department. (6)\n\nAll rolls of geomembrane materials stored\nat the landfill must be enclosed in protective wrapping, such as the original, unopened packaging or covered with an opaque tarpaulin, to ensure protection\nfrom direct sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, flames or welding sparks, temperatures in excess of 160° F, mud, debris and other deleterious\nmaterials, and any other environmental condition that may damage the physical\nproperty values of the material. The storage location must be stable, dry, and\nwell-drained. The surface on which the material is stored must be free of sharp\nobjects. Rolls of smooth geomembrane must not be stored in stacks more than\nfour tiers high and rolls of textured geomembrane must not be stored in stacks\nmore than three tiers high. Extended outdoor storage of geomembrane materials\nmust not exceed manufacturer's recommendations or nine months, whichever is\nless. For storage periods longer than manufacturer's recommendations or nine\nmonths, geomembrane rolls must be stored off the ground under an additional\ncover or tarpaulin beyond the manufacturer's wrapping or placed in an enclosed\nstructure. (c) Certification requirements. (1)\n\nThe project\nengineer must certify that the results of the quality control testing for all\ngeomembranes meet the requirements of the approved engineering drawings, reports, and specifications before the installation of any geomembrane, including the following information: (i) origin and identification of the raw materials used to manufacture the\ngeosynthetic material; (ii)\ncopies\nof quality control certificates issued by the producer of the raw materials\nused to manufacture the geomembrane, which at a minimum must include the\nresults of tests conducted to verify material quality, specific gravity, melt\nflow index, percent carbon black, and carbon black dispersion using test\nmethods acceptable to the department; (iii)\nresults of tests conducted at the\nfactory to verify the quality of the geomembrane, including thickness, density, single-point stress crack resistance, tensile strength, tear and puncture\nresistance, elongation, carbon black content, carbon black dispersion, oxidation induction time, oven aging and UV resistance using test methods\nacceptable to the department; and\n(iv)\ndocumentation that the geomembrane was\nfully inspected for uniformity, damage, imperfections, holes, cracks, thin\nspots, foreign materials, tears, punctures, and blisters and that any\nimperfections were immediately repaired and reinspected. (2)\n\nThe project engineer must review the\nappropriate documentation to certify that the quality control testing of any\nfabricated factory seams of geomembrane sheets took place at the factory in\naccordance with the following requirements: (i) the geomembrane was fully inspected for\nuniformity, damage, imperfections, holes, cracks, thin spots, foreign\nmaterials, tears, punctures, and blisters. Any imperfections must be\nimmediately repaired and reinspected; (ii)\nnondestructive seam testing was\nperformed on all fabricated seams over their full length using a test method\nacceptable to the department; and\n(iii)\ndestructive seam testing was performed\non a minimum of two samples per factory fabricated geomembrane sheet. The\nsamples must be taken from extra material at the beginning or end of sheet\nseams, so that the geomembrane sheet is not damaged and the sheet geometry is\nnot altered. A laboratory acceptable to the department must have performed the\nrequired testing on the samples taken. If a sample fails a destructive test, the entire seam length must be reconstructed or repaired using a method\nacceptable to the department, and retested in accordance with subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph. (3)\n\nThe project engineer must certify that quality assurance testing was performed\nin the field during liner installation demonstrating that the liner conforms to\nthe approved engineering drawings, reports, and specifications and the\nfollowing requirements: (i) For each lot\nnumber of geomembrane material that arrives at the site, a sample must be\ncollected and archived. (ii)\n\nAll\ngeomembrane must be visually inspected for uniformity, damage, imperfections, holes, cracks, thin spots, foreign materials, tears, punctures, and blisters. Any imperfections must be immediately repaired and reinspected. (iii)\n\nThe project engineer must ensure that\ntrial seams are constructed and destructive seam tests are performed: (a) at the start of each shift for every\npiece of seaming equipment and for each seaming crew; (b) after every four hours of continuous\nseaming; (c) every time seaming\nequipment is changed; (d) whenever\nthe project engineer requires; and\n(e) as additionally required in the approved\nspecifications. (iv)\n\nThe\nentire length of all field seams must be nondestructively tested in accordance\nwith the procedures listed in this subparagraph using a test method acceptable\nto the department. The project engineer or designated representative must: (a) monitor all nondestructive\ntesting; (b) record the location, date, name of tester, and results of all testing; (c) inform the installer of any required\nrepairs; and\n(d) overlay all seams\nwhich cannot be nondestructively tested with the same geomembrane. The seaming\nand patching operation must be inspected by the project engineer for uniformity\nand quality. (v) Destructive testing must be performed on the geomembrane liner seams in\naccordance with the following requirements using test methods acceptable to the\ndepartment: (a) Seam samples must be taken at\na rate of one sample per 1,000 feet of seam length or one sample for each\nseaming machine operating on a given day, whichever is more frequent. All\nsample locations must be documented. (b) The project engineer must approve the\nsample size, which must be large enough to perform the required\ntesting. (c) An independent\nlaboratory acceptable to the department must perform the required testing, which must include testing for seam strength and adjacent geomembrane\nelongation, and peel adhesion (and separation in-plane for high density\npolyethylene) using testing procedures acceptable to the department. (d) If a sample fails destructive testing, the seam must be reconstructed in each direction between the location of the\nsample that failed and the location of the next acceptable sample; alternatively, the welding path may be retraced to intermediate locations at\nleast ten feet in each direction from the location of the sample which failed\nthe test, in which case a second sample must be taken for an additional field\ntest at each of those locations. If these second samples pass, the seam must be\npatched or reconstructed between the locations of the second samples. If a\nsecond sample fails, this process must be repeated. (e) All acceptable seams must lie between two\nlocations where samples passed the test procedures found in clause (d) of this\nsubparagraph. (vi)\n\nUpon\ncompletion of geomembrane seaming, patching, or reconstruction, post-construction care of the installed geomembrane must commence and, at a\nminimum, include timely covering and temporary weighting using sandbags, as\nnecessary, to prevent damage from wind uplift, construction, or other\nsources. (vii)\n\nAfter placement of\nthe soil drainage layer, an electrical resistivity leak location evaluation, and/or other geomembrane liner integrity evaluation approved by the department, must be conducted on areas of both the primary and secondary liners with slopes\nof ten percent or less by a person independent of the geomembrane installer. When conducting a leak location evaluation, the soil drainage layer above the\ngeomembrane being tested for defects must have adequate electrical isolation\nfrom the surrounding ground or adjacent material. The evaluation must not be\nperformed during or after periods of heavy rains that result in run-off that\ncould impact the isolation of the soil drainage layer. When the tie-in area\nconnecting a new cell with an existing cell is unable to be evaluated by\nelectrical leak location testing due to an inability to effectively isolate the\ntie-in area, the tie-in area may be evaluated for liner defects using an\nexposed geomembrane electrical testing method. All discovered liner defects\nmust be repaired, and a written report of the findings, which includes, at a\nminimum, a GPS-based electrical map of the survey area documenting the spatial\nresults of electrical testing throughout the survey area, a description of the\nnumber of defects and their cause, and verification of repairs must be\nsubmitted to the department with the construction certification report required\nin section\n363-6.19\nof this Subpart.
