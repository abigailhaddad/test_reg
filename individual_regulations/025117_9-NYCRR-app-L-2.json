Each of the forms of punishment prescribed in b are separate, that is, the\nadjudging of one form of punishment is not contingent upon any other punishment\nalso being adjuged. The forms in c, however, may be combined and modified so\nlong as the punishment adjudged is not forbidden by the code and does not\nexceed the maximum authorized by New York State Military Law, Sections\n130.18, 130.19\nand\n130.20\n(c) in the particular case being tried. In announcing a\nsentence consisting of combined punishments, the president or military judge\nmay, for example, state: \"To be dishonorably discharged from the service, to be confined\nfor one year, to forfeit all pay and allowances, and to be reduced to Private\nE-1;\" or\n\"To be discharged from the service with a bad-conduct\ndischarge, to be confined for six months, and to forfeit $35.00 pay per month\nfor six months;\" or\n\"To be dismissed from the service, to be confined for one year, and to forfeit all pay and allowances;\" or\n\"To perform hard labor without confinement for one month and to\nforfeit $25.00 pay per month for one month.\"\nb.

APPENDIX A12\nSAMPLE LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL\nSUBJECT: Letter of Transmittal\n\nCommander\n\nDivision\n\nStreet Address\n\nCity, State Zip Code\n1. Transmitted herewith is the Charge Sheet for Lieutenant John\n\nDoe, Social Security Number 000-00-0000, HHC, first Battalion, New York Army\n\nNational Guard involving alleged violations of the New York State Code. 2. After reviewing the Report of Investigation and Charge Sheet\n(copies of both are enclosed) it is my recommendation that the charges be\nreferred to General Court-Martial, so that proper punishment may be\nadministered. 3. Lieutenant Doe has been a substandard performer in this\n\nBattalion for the past two years. For every position he has held, he has\nrequired more than average supervision. 4. Lieutenant Doe has no military awards. 5. Lieutenant Doe has made complete restitution of the property\nin question, and has cooperated completely with the investigating authorities\nin this matter. Signature Block\n\nCommander\n\nInstructions for Transmittal of Charges\n\nLetter of Transmittal\nA letter of transmittal is used to forward the Charge Sheet and\nallied papers to a superior commander for disposition when the recommended\ndisposition is a General or Special Court-Martial. This letter is usually a\nlocal form which contains information about the accused and the commander's\nspecific recommendation for disposition of the charges. The commander makes a\npersonal recommendation as to the type of court-martial, keeping in mind the\npunishment authorized by the type of court-martial recommended. When making a\nrecommendation for the disposition of the charges, the commander should\nconsider and relate in the letter of transmittal information concerning the\naccused's background and character of military service, and a description of\nany unusual circumstances in the case. The commander should also include\nconsideration of the nature of the offenses, and whether the accused should be\neliminated from the service. When making a recommendation as to disposition, the commander must keep in mind that charges against an accused should be tried\nby the lowest court which has power to adjudge an appropriate and adequate\npunishment. The commander must personally sign the letter of transmittal and\nattach one copy to each set of the Charge Sheet and allied papers.

Notification\nCO: As your commander, I have disciplinary powers under Section\n130.15\nof the State Military Code. I have received a report that you violated\nthe State Military Code, and I am considering imposing non- judicial\npunishment. This is not a formal trial like a court-martial. As a record of\nthese proceedings I will use DMNA Form 1057. I now hand you this form. Read\nitems 1 and 2. Item 1 states the offense(s) you are reported to have committed\nand item 2 lists the rights you have in these proceedings. You are not required\nto make any statement or provide any information concerning the alleged\noffense(s). If you do, it may be used against you in these proceedings or in a\ntrial by court-martial. You have the right to consult with a lawyer as stated\nin item 2. 1. Note for CO: Wait for the member to read items 1 and 2 DMNA Form 1057. Allow\nhim or her to retain a copy of the form until the proceedings are finished and\nyou have either imposed punishment or decided not to impose it. CO: Do you understand item 1? Do you understand the offense(s)\nyou are reported to have committed?\nM (Member): (Yes) (No)\n2. Note for CO: If the member does not understand the offense(s), explain the\noffense(s) to him or her. CO: Do you understand item 2? Do you have any questions about\nyour rights in these proceedings?\nM: (Yes) (No)\n3. Note for CO: If the member does not understand his or her rights, explain\nthem in greater detail. If the member asks a question you cannot answer, recess\nthe proceedings. You probably can find the answer in one of the following\nsources: a) Article 15, UCMJ; b) Part V, N.Y. MCM. If you cannot find the answer in one of these sources, contact\nyour JA office. CO: There are some decisions you have to make: a. You must decide whether you want to present witnesses or\nsubmit other evidence in defense, extenuation, and/or mitigations. (1) Evidence in defense are facts showing that you did not\ncommit the offense(s) stated in item 1. Even if you cannot present any evidence\nin defense, you can still present evidence in extenuation or mitigation. (2) Evidence in extenuation are circumstances surrounding the\noffense, showing that the offense was not very serious. (3) Evidence in mitigation are facts about you, showing that\nyou are a good soldier and that you deserve light punishment. b. You can make a statement and request to have a spokesperson\nappear with you and speak on your behalf. I will interview any available\nwitness and consider any evidence you think I should examine. c. Finally, you must decide whether you wish to request that\nthe proceedings be open to the public. Do you understand the decisions you have\nto make?\nM: (Yes) (No)\nCO: If after you have presented your evidence, I am convinced\nthat you committed the offense, I could then punish you. The maximum punishment\nI could impose on you would be____________. 4. Note to CO: See Table 4-1, Part V, N.Y. MCM for maximum\npunishments.____________\nCO: As item 2 points out, you have a right to talk to an\nattorney before you make your decisions. A military lawyer whom you can talk to\nfree of charge is located at ________. Would you like to talk to an attorney\nbefore you make your decisions?\nM: (Yes) (No)\n5. Note to CO: If the member desires to talk to an attorney, arrange for the\nmember to consult an attorney. The member should be encouraged to consult the attorney\npromptly. Inform the member that consultation with an attorney may be by\ntelephone. The member should be advised that he or she is to notify you if any\ndifficulty is encountered in consulting an attorney. CO: You now have 48 hours to think about what you should do in\nthis case. You may advise me of your decision at any time within the 48-hour\nperiod. If you refuse to sign that part of DMNA Form 1057 indicating your\ndecision on these matters, I can proceed to impose punishment upon you without\nyour consent. You are dismissed. 6. Note to CO: At this point, the proceedings should be recessed unless the\nservice member affirmatively indicates that he or she has made a decision and\ndoes not want additional time or to consult with an attorney. In the event the\nmember does not make a decision within the specified time or refuses to\ncomplete or sign item 3 of DMNA Form 1057, see paragraph 3-6f. When you resume\nthe proceedings, begin at item 3, DMNA Form 1057. CO: An open proceeding means that the proceeding is open to the\npublic. If the hearing is closed, only you, I, designated members of the chain\nof command, available witnesses and a spokesperson if designated, will be\npresent. Do you request an open proceeding?\nM: (Yes) (No)\nCO: Initial block 3(a) and (b) indicating your decision. Do you\nwant to submit any evidence showing that you did not commit the offense(s), or\nexplaining why you committed the offense(s), or any other information about\nyourself that you would like me to know?

Note to CO: a. Wait until the member initials the blocks and signs and\ndates the form. If the answers to all the questions are no, you may proceed to\nimpose punishment. b. If the answer regarding witnesses and evidence is yes, and\nthe member is prepared to present his or her evidence immediately, proceed as\nfollows. Consider the evidence presented. If the evidence persuades you that\nyou should not punish the member, terminate the proceedings, inform the member, and destroy all copies of DMNA Form 1057. If you are convinced beyond a\nreasonable doubt that the member committed the offense(s) and deserves to be\npunished, proceed to impose punishment. c. If the member needs additional time to gather his or her\nevidence, give the member a reasonable period of time to gather the evidence. Tell the member when the proceedings will resume and recess the\nproceedings. d.
