  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 157.5 - Extension of time for payment of New York State personal income tax, City of New York tax and City of Yonkers tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Income tax payments. The department may, apart from any extension of time to file a New York State income tax return, grant a reasonable extension of time for payment of the New York State personal\nincome tax, City of New York tax, and City of Yonkers tax upon receipt of a\nletter from the taxpayer giving complete information as to the reasons for such\ntaxpayer's inability to make payment of the New York State personal income tax, City of New York tax, and City of Yonkers tax on or before the prescribed due\ndate. However, except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, where the\ntime for payment of any New York State personal income tax, City of New York\ntax, and City of Yonkers tax is extended, interest will be added at the rate\nprescribed by the commissioner (see Part 2393 of this Title) on any balance due\nfrom the original due date of the New York State income tax return (determined\nwithout regard to any extension of time) to the date of payment. (b) Estimated tax payments. (1)\n\nThe department may grant an extension of\ntime for paying any installment of estimated tax required to be paid, in order\nto avoid the addition to tax imposed under section\n685 (c)\nof the Tax Law (see\nsection\n185.3\nof this Title), without interest. Such extension, however, will only be granted\nbecause the taxpayer is seriously ill or for other compelling reasons. A\nrequest for an extension of time for paying any installment of estimated tax\nshould be made by letter and mailed to New York State Income Tax, W.A. Harriman\n\nCampus, Albany, NY 12227. (2)\n\nAn\nextension of time for paying any installment of estimated tax will normally be\nlimited to one month and, except in cases of a taxpayer who is outside the\n\nUnited States and Puerto Rico or a taxpayer who intends to claim nonresident\nstatus pursuant to section\n605 (b)(1)(A)(ii)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw, no extension will be granted for more than six months. (3)\n\nAn extension of time for paying any\ninstallment of estimated tax does not extend the time for paying any other\ninstallment. Further, an extension of time for paying any installment of\nestimated tax does not relieve a taxpayer from liability for any addition to\n\nNew York State personal income tax, City of New York tax or City of Yonkers tax\nfor an underpayment of an installment payment. For purposes of determining the\nperiod of underpayment, the due date of any installment is determined without\nregard to any extension of time. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n157.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
