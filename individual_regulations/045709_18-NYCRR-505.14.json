Such services must be medically necessary for maintaining an individual's\nhealth and safety in his or her own home, as determined by the social services\ndistrict or Medicaid managed care organization in accordance with this section; ordered by a qualified independent practitioner; based on an assessment of the\nindividual's needs and of the appropriateness and cost-effectiveness of\nservices specified in subparagraph (b)(2)(iii) of this section; provided by a\nqualified person in accordance with a plan of care; and supervised by a\nregistered professional nurse. (2)\n\nContinuous personal care services\nmeans the provision of\nuninterrupted care, by more than one personal care aide, for more than 16 hours\nin a calendar day for a patient who, because of the patient's medical\ncondition, needs assistance during such calendar day with toileting, walking, transferring, turning and positioning, or feeding and needs assistance with\nsuch frequency that a live-in 24-hour personal care aide would be unlikely to\nobtain, on a regular basis, five hours daily of uninterrupted sleep during the\naide's eight hour period of sleep. (3)\n\nPersonal care services, as defined in\nthis section, can be provided only if the individual meets applicable minimum\nneeds requirements described in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, and the\nsocial services district or Medicaid managed care organization reasonably\nexpects that the individual's health and safety in the home can be maintained\nby the provision of such services, as determined in accordance with this\nsection. (i) The patient's medical condition\nshall be\nstable, which shall be defined as follows: (a) the condition is not expected to exhibit\nsudden deterioration or improvement; and\n(b) the condition does not require frequent\nmedical or nursing judgment to determine changes in the patient's plan of care; and\n(c) (1)\nthe condition is such that a physically\ndisabled individual is in need of routine supportive assistance and does not\nneed skilled professional care in the home; or\n(2)\nthe condition is such that a physically\ndisabled or frail elderly individual does not need professional care but does\nrequire assistance in the home to prevent a health or safety crisis from\ndeveloping. (ii)\n\nThe patient shall be self-directing, which shall mean that he/she is capable of making choices about his/her\nactivities of daily living, understanding the impact of the choice and assuming\nresponsibility for the results of the choice. Patients who are\nnonself-directing, and who require continuous supervision and direction for\nmaking choices about activities of daily living shall not receive personal care\nservices, except under the following conditions: (a) supervision or direction is provided on\nan interim or part-time basis as part of a plan of care in which the\nresponsibility for making choices about activities of daily living is assumed\nby a self-directing individual living within the same household; or\n(b) supervision or direction is provided on\nan interim or part-time basis as part of a plan of care in which the\nresponsibility for making choices about activities of daily living is assumed\nby a self-directing individual not living within the same household; or\n(c) supervision or direction is\nprovided on an interim or part-time basis as part of a plan of care in which\nthe responsibility for making choices about activities of daily living is\nassumed by an outside agency or other formal organization.

(4)\n\nLive-in 24-hour personal care services\nmeans the provision of\ncare by one personal care aide for a patient who, because of the patient's\nmedical condition, needs assistance during a calendar day with toileting, walking, transferring, turning and positioning, or feeding and whose need for\nassistance is sufficiently infrequent that a live-in 24-hour personal care aide\nwould be likely to obtain, on a regular basis, five hours daily of\nuninterrupted sleep during the aide's eight hour period of sleep. (5)\n\nPersonal care services shall include the\nfollowing two levels of care, and be provided in accordance with the following\nstandards: (i) Level I shall be limited to\nthe performance of nutritional and environmental support functions.

Assistance may include supervision and cueing to help the recipient\nperform a nutritional and environmental support function or personal care\nfunction if the recipient could not perform the task without such assistance. Supervision and cueing are not standalone personal care services and may not be\nauthorized, paid for or reimbursed except for providing assistance with\nnutritional and environmental support functions or personal care\nfunctions. (6)\n\nShared aide\nmeans a method of providing personal care services\nunder which a social services district authorizes one or more nutritional and\nenvironmental support functions or personal care functions for each personal\ncare services recipient who resides with other personal care services\nrecipients in a designated geographic area, such as in the same apartment\nbuilding, and a personal care services provider completes the authorized\nfunctions by making short visits to each such recipient.

(1)\n\nThe\nassessment process includes an independent assessment, a medical examination\nand practitioner order, an evaluation of the need and cost effectiveness of\nservices, the development of the plan of care, and, when required under\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, a referral for an independent review. The\nindependent assessment, medical examination and independent review panel may\nutilize telehealth modalities for all or a portion of such assessments provided\nthat the individual is given an opportunity for an in-person assessment and\nreceives any necessary support during the telehealth assessment, which may\ninclude the participation of an on-site representative or\nsupport-staff. (2)\n\nThe initial\nassessment process shall include the following procedures: (i) Independent assessment. An assessment\nshall be completed by an independent assessor employed or contracted by an\nentity designated by the Department of Health to provide independent assessment\nservices on forms approved by the Department of Health in accordance with the\nfollowing: (a) The independent assessment\nmust be performed by a nurse with the following minimum qualifications: (1)\na license and current registration to\npractice as a registered professional nurse in New York State; and\n(2)\nat least two years of satisfactory recent\nexperience in home health care.

This provision shall not be construed to prevent or limit the\nuse of telehealth in the assessment of an individual. (ii)\n\nIndependent medical examination and\npractitioner order. (a) Each individual\nseeking personal care services must have an examination by a medical\nprofessional employed or contracted by an entity designated by the Department\nof Health to provide independent practitioner services. (b) The medical professional who examines the\nindividual must be a physician licensed in accordance with article 131 of the\n\nEducation Law, a physician assistant or a specialist assistant registered in\naccordance with article 131-B of the Education Law, or a nurse practitioner\ncertified in accordance with article 139 of the Education Law. (c) The medical professional must be\nindependent with respect to the individual, meaning that medical professional\nthat conducts the exam must not have established a provider-patient\nrelationship with the individual prior to the clinical encounter from which the\npractitioner order is completed. (d) The medical professional must examine the\nindividual and accurately describe the individual's medical condition and\nregimens, including any medication regimens and the individual's need for\nassistance with personal care services tasks. (e) The medical professional must review the\nindependent assessment and may review other medical records and consult with\nthe individual's providers and others involved with the individual's care if\navailable to and determined necessary by the medical professional.

(g) The medical\nprofessional must sign the practitioner order form, certify that the\ninformation provided in the form accurately describes the individual's medical\ncondition and regimens at the time of the medical examination, and indicate\nwhether the individual is self-directing and whether the individual is\nmedically stable. (h) The\npractitioner order form must be completed and made available by the medical\nprofessional to the social services district or any MMCOs as appropriate after\nthe medical examination and independent assessment. (i) The practitioner order is subject to the\nprovisions of Parts 515, 516, 517 and 518 of this title. These Parts permit the\n\nDepartment of Health or other agencies or organizations duly authorized or\ndelegated by the Department of Health, including but not limited to MMCOs or\nthe Office of the Medicaid Inspector General, to impose monetary penalties on, or sanction and recover overpayments from, providers or prescribers of medical\ncare, services, or supplies when medical care, services, or supplies that are\nunnecessary, improper or exceed individuals' documented medical needs are\nprovided or ordered. (iii)\n\nSocial services district or MMCO\nresponsibilities. (a) Before developing a\nplan of care or authorizing personal care services, a social services district\nor MMCO shall review the individual's most recent independent assessment and\npractitioner order, and may directly evaluate the individual, to determine the\nfollowing: (1)\nwhether personal care services\ncan be provided according to a plan of care, whether such services are\nmedically necessary and whether the social services district or MMCO reasonably\nexpects that such services can maintain the individual's health and safety in\nhis or her home, as determined in accordance with the regulations of the\n\nDepartment of Health; (2)\nthe\nfrequency with which nursing supervision would be required to support services\nif authorized; (3)\nthe individual's\npreferences and social and cultural considerations for the receipt of\ncare; (4)\nwhether the individual\ncan be served appropriately and more cost-effectively by personal care services\nprovided under a consumer directed personal assistance program authorized in\naccordance with section\n365-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law; (5)\nwhether the functional needs, living arrangements and working arrangements of\nan individual who receives personal care services solely for monitoring the\nindividual's medical condition and well-being can be monitored appropriately\nand more cost-effectively by personal emergency response services provided in\naccordance with section\n505.33\nof this Part; (6)\nwhether the functional needs, living\narrangements and working arrangements of the individual can be maintained\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by personal care services provided by\nshared aides in accordance with subdivision (k) of this section; (7)\nwhether an individual who requires, as a\npart of a routine plan of care, part-time or intermittent nursing or other\ntherapeutic services or nursing services provided to a medically stable\nindividual, can be served appropriately and more cost-effectively through the\nprovision of home health services in accordance with section\n505.23\nof this Part; (8)\nwhether the individual can be served\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by other long-term care services and\nsupports, including, but not limited to, the assisted living program or the\nenriched housing program; (9)\nwhether personal care services can be provided appropriately and more\ncost-effectively by the personal care services provider in cooperation with an\nadult day health or social adult day care program; (10)\nwhether the individual's needs can be\nmet through the use of telehealth services that can be demonstrated and\ndocumented to reduce the amount of services needed and where such services are\nreadily available and can be reliably accessed; (11)\nwhether the individual can be served\nappropriately and more cost-effectively by using adaptive or specialized\nmedical equipment or supplies covered by the MA program including, but not\nlimited to, bedside commodes, urinals, walkers, wheelchairs and insulin\npens; (12)\nwhether the individual's\nneeds can by met through the provision of formal services provided or funded by\nan entity, agency or program other than the medical assistance program; and\n(13)\nwhether the individual's\nneeds can be met through the voluntary assistance available from informal\ncaregivers including, but not limited to, the individual's family, friends or\nother responsible adult, and whether such assistance is available. (b) The social services district\nor MMCO must first determine whether the individual, because of the\nindividual's medical condition, would be otherwise eligible for personal care\nservices, including continuous personal care services or live-in 24-hour\npersonal care services. For individuals who would be otherwise eligible for\npersonal care services, the social services district must then determine\nwhether, and the extent to which, the individual can be served through the\nprovision of services described in clauses ( a)( 4) through ( a)( 13) of this\nsubparagraph. (1)\n\nIf a social services\ndistrict or MMCO determines that an individual can be served appropriately and\nmore cost-effectively through the provision of services described in clauses (\na)( 4) through ( a)( 10) of this subparagraph, and the social services district\nor MMCO determines that such services are available in the district, the social\nservices district or MMCO must consider the use of such services in accordance\nwith department guidance as well as the individual's identified preferences and\nsocial and cultural considerations described in clause ( a)( 3 ) of this\nsubparagraph in developing the individual's plan of care.. (2)\n\nIf a social services district or MMCO\ndetermines that other formal services are available or the individual's needs\ncan be met using available adaptive or specialized medical equipment or\nsupplies or voluntary assistance from informal caregivers, as described in\nclauses ( a)( 11) through (a)(13) of this subparagraph, the social services\ndistrict or MMCO must include these in the individual's plan of care. To ensure\navailability of voluntary informal supports, the social services district or\nMMCO must confirm the caregiver's willingness to meet the identified needs in\nthe plan of care for which they will provide assistance. (c) For cases involving live-in 24-hour\npersonal care services, the social services district or MMCO shall evaluate\nwhether the individual's home has sleeping accommodations for a personal care\naide. When the individual's home has no sleeping accommodations for a personal\ncare aide, continuous personal care services must be authorized for the\nindividual; however, should the individual's circumstances change and sleeping\naccommodations for a personal care aide become available in the individual's\nhome, the district or MMCO must promptly review the case. If a reduction of the\nindividual's continuous personal care services to live-in 24-hour personal care\nservices is appropriate, the district or MMCO must send the individual a timely\nand adequate notice of the proposed reduction. (d) For cases involving continuous personal\ncare services or live-in 24-hour personal care services, the social services\ndistrict or MMCO shall assess and document in the plan of care the following: (1)\nwhether the practitioner order indicated\na medical condition that causes the individual to need frequent assistance\nduring a calendar day with toileting, walking, transferring, turning and\npositioning, or feeding; (2)\nthe\nspecific personal care functions with which the individual needs frequent\nassistance during a calendar day; (3)\nthe frequency at which the individual\nneeds assistance with these personal care functions during a calendar\nday; (4)\nwhether the individual\nneeds similar assistance with these personal care functions during the\nindividual's waking and sleeping hours and, if not, why not; and\n(5)\nwhether, were live-in 24-hour personal\ncare services to be authorized, the personal care aide would be likely to\nobtain, on a regular basis, five hours daily of uninterrupted sleep during the\naide's eight hour period of sleep. (e) The social services district or MMCO is\nresponsible for developing a plan of care in collaboration with the individual\nor, if applicable, the individual's representative that reflects the\nassessments and practitioner order described in this paragraph. In the plan of\ncare, the social services district or MMCO must identify: (1)\nthe personal care service functions or\ntasks with which the individual needs assistance; (2)\nthe amount, frequency and duration of\nservices to be authorized to meet these needs; (3)\nhow needs are met, if not met through the\nauthorization of services; and\n(4)\nany other descriptions and documentation provided for in this\nsection. (f) Upon the\ndevelopment of a plan of care, the social services district or MMCO shall refer\nhigh needs cases described in subparagraph (v) of this paragraph to the\nindependent review panel; provided, however, that an MMCO should not refer a\ncase unless and until the individual is enrolled or scheduled for enrollment in\nthe MMCO. When a case is referred to the independent review panel: (1)\nthe social services district or MMCO\nshall provide the individual's plan of care and any clinical records or other\ndocumentation used to develop the plan of care, such as records from treating\nproviders and the results of any review or evaluation performed pursuant to\nthis paragraph to the panel; (2)\nthe social services district or MMCO shall cooperate with the panel as\nappropriate to ensure an expedient review of each high needs case; and\n(3)\nthe social services\ndistrict or MMCO shall consider the panel's recommendation in finalizing the\nplan of care and authorization. However, the social services district or MMCO\nis not required to adopt the recommendation, either in full or in part, and\nretains responsibility for determining the amount and type of services\nmedically necessary. (iv)\n\nCoordinating the independent assessment, practitioner order and LDSS or MMCO responsibilities. (a) The social services district or MMCO must\ncoordinate with the entity or entities providing independent assessment and\npractitioner services to minimize the disruption to the individual and in-home\nvisits. (b) The social services\ndistrict or MMCO must inform the entity or entities providing independent\nassessment and practitioner services when a new assessment or practitioner\norder is needed pursuant paragraphs (4)(xii) and (4)(xiii) of this subdivision, in accordance with department guidance, using forms as may be required by the\ndepartment. (1)\n\nWhen the social services\ndistrict or MMCO receives an initial or new request for services it shall refer\nthe individual to the entity providing independent assessment services and\nprovide assistance to the individual in making contact in accordance with\ndepartment guidance; provided however that the social services district or MMCO\nmay not pressure or induce the individual to request an assessment\nunwillingly. (2)\n\nIf needed, the\nMMCO shall also refer the individual to the social services district to\ndetermine the individual's eligibility for medical assistance, including\ncommunity based long term care services. (c) The entity or entities providing\nindependent assessment or practitioner services may request that the social\nservices district or MMCO confirm or update an individual's record in the\nassessment database designated by the Department. The social services district\nor MMCO shall respond within one business day and confirm or update the\nrelevant record within three business days after receipt of request. (d) Resolving mistakes and clinical\ndisagreements in the assessment process. (1)\n\nIf the social services district or MMCO identifies a material mistake in the\nindependent assessment that can be confirmed by the submission of evidence, the\nsocial services district or MMCO shall advise the independent assessor. A\nmistake is an error of fact or observation that occurred when the assessment\nwas performed that is not subject to the assessor's clinical judgment. A\nmistake is material when it would affect the amount, type, or duration of\nservices authorized. When identifying the mistake, the social services district\nor MMCO must provide evidence of the mistake to the independent assessor. The\nindependent assessor shall promptly issue a corrected assessment or schedule a\nnew assessment in accordance with subclause (3) of this clause as\nappropriate. (2)\n\nAfter reviewing\nthe independent assessment, practitioner order and the result of any social\nservice district or MMCO assessment or evaluation, if the social services\ndistrict or MMCO has a material disagreement regarding the outcome of the\nindependent assessment, the social services district or MMCO may advise the\nindependent assessor. A disagreement occurs when the social services district\nor MMCO disputes a finding or conclusion in the independent assessment that is\nsubject to the independent assessor's clinical judgment. A disagreement is\nmaterial when it would affect the amount, type, or duration of services\nauthorized. When submitting a disagreement to the independent assessor, the\nsocial services district or MMCO must provide the clinical rationale that forms\nthe basis for the disagreement. (3)\n\nUpon submission of a material disagreement, an independent assessor shall\nschedule and complete a new assessment within 10 days from the date it receives\nnotice from the social services district or MMCO. This shall not pend or\notherwise affect the timeframes within which the social services district or\nMMCO is required to make a determination, provide notice, or authorize\nservices. (e) Sanctions\nfor failure to cooperate and abuse of the resolution process. (1)\n\nThe Department of Health may impose\nmonetary penalties pursuant to Public Health Law section 12 for failure to\ncoordinate with the entity or entities providing independent assessment and\npractitioner services in accordance with the provisions of clauses (a) through\n(c) of this subparagraph or engaging in abusive behavior that affects the\ncoordination of the assessment process. In determining whether to impose a\nmonetary penalty and the amount imposed, the Department shall consider, where\napplicable, the following: (i) The frequency\nand numerosity of violations, both in absolute terms and relative to other\nMMCOs; (ii)\n\nThe responsiveness of\nthe MMCO to requests for coordination; (iii)\n\nThe history of coordination between the\nMMCO and the entity or entities; (iv)\n\nThe good faith demonstrated by the MMCO\nin attempting to coordinate; (v) Whether the MMCO provides a justification for the violation and whether it has\nmerit, as determined by the Department; (vi)\n\nWhether the violation resulted or could\nhave resulted in injury or other harm to the individual; and\n(vii)\n\nOther relevant facts or\ncircumstances. (2)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment of Health may revoke, or impose other restrictions on, a social\nservices district's or MMCO's privilege to request reassessments on the basis\nof a material disagreement where the Department determines that the social\nservices district has abused this privilege, including the use of mistake\nprocess for issues subject to clinical judgment or pressuring or inducing\nindividuals to request a new assessment. In determining whether a social\nservices district or MMCO has abused this privilege, the Department shall\nconsider, where applicable, the following: (i) The frequency and numerosity of\ndisagreements, mistakes, and reassessment requests submitted to the independent\nassessor, both in absolute terms and relative to other social services\ndistricts and MMCOs; (ii)\n\nWhether\nthe clinical rationale provided for the disagreement has merit, as determined\nby the Department; (iii)\n\nWhether\nthe disagreement, mistake, and reassessment requests are made as a matter of\ncourse, instead of upon review of the clinical record; (iv)\n\nThe outcome of the reassessment as\ncompared to the assessment it replaces; and\n(v) Other facts or circumstances that tend to\nprovide evidence for or against abuse. (3)\n\nNothing in this section shall be\nconstrued to limit the authority of the Department or other agencies to seek\nother remedies, sanctions or penalties, including other monetary\npenalties. (v) Independent medical review of high needs\ncases. An independent medical review of a proposed plan of care\nshall be obtained before a social services district or MMCO may authorize more\nthan 12 hours of personal care services or consumer directed personal\nassistance separately or in combination per day on average, except as otherwise\nprovided in paragraph (4) of this subdivision (\"high needs cases\"). The review\nshall result in a recommendation made to the social services district or MMCO, as described in this subparagraph. (a) The independent medical review must be performed by an independent panel of\nmedical professionals, or other clinicians, employed by or under contract with\nan entity designated by the Department of Health (the \"independent review\npanel\") and shall be coordinated by a physician (the \"lead physician\") who\nshall be selected from the independent review panel. The lead physician may not\nbe the same person who performed the initial medical examination an signed the\nindividual's practitioner order. (b) The lead physician must review the\nindependent assessment, the practitioner order, any other assessment or review\nconducted by the social services district or MMCO, including any plan of care\ncreated. (c) The lead physician may\nevaluate the individual, or review an evaluation performed by another medical\nprofessional on the independent review panel. The medical professional may not\nhave performed the initial medical examination or signed the individual's\npractitioner order. (d) The lead\nphysician and panel members may consult with or interview other members of the\nindependent review panel, the ordering practitioner, the individual's treating\nor primary care physician, and other individuals who the lead physician deems\nimportant and who are available to assist the panel's review and\nrecommendation. (e) The lead\nphysician and panel members may request additional information or\ndocumentation, including medical records, case notes, and any other material\nthe lead physician deems important to assist the panel's review and\nrecommendation. (f) After review, the independent review panel shall produce a report, signed by the lead\nphysician, providing a recommendation on the reasonableness and appropriateness\nof the proposed plan of care to maintain the individual's health and safety in\nhis or her own home, in accordance with the standards and scope of services set\nforth in this section. The report may suggest modifications to the plan of\ncare, including the level, frequency, and duration of services and whether\nadditional, alternative, or fewer services would facilitate the provision of\nmedically necessary care. The report may not, however, recommend a specific\namount or change in amount of services. (3)\n\nTimeframes for the assessment and\nauthorization of services\n(i) The independent\nassessment and practitioner order processes shall be completed at least\nannually and in sufficient time such that social services districts and MMCOs\nmay have an opportunity when needed to comply with all applicable federal and\nstate timeframes for notice and determination of services, including but not\nlimited to immediate needs. (ii)\nA\nsocial services district must make a determination and provide notice with\nreasonable promptness, not to exceed seven business days after receipt of both\nthe independent assessment and practitioner order, or the independent review\npanel recommendation if applicable, except in unusual circumstances including, but not limited to, the need to resolve any outstanding questions regarding the\namount or duration of services to be authorized, or as provided in paragraphs\n(6) and (7) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nAn MMCO must make a determination and\nprovide notice to current enrollees within the timeframes provided in the\ncontract between the Department of Health and the MMCO, or as otherwise\nrequired by Federal or state statute or regulation. (4)\n\nAuthorization and reauthorization\ncriteria. (i) An individual's eligibility\nfor medical assistance and services, including the individual's financial\neligibility and eligibility for personal care services provided for in this\nsection, shall be established prior to the authorization for services.

The evaluation shall include a review of the nursing\nsupervisory reports to assure that the individual's needs have been adequately\nmet during the initial authorization period. (b) Where an independent review panel\npreviously reviewed a high need case, reauthorization of services shall not\nrequire another panel review for as long as the case remains a high needs. If\nservice levels are reduced below the high needs threshold and subsequently\nincreased to become a high needs case again, another review by the independent\nreview panel is required. (c) Neither an independent assessment nor a practitioner order shall be required to\nreauthorize or continue an authorization of services, except: (1)\nprior to or in conjunction with a\ndischarge from an institutional or in-patient setting, provided that this\nprovision shall not be construed to prohibit a safe discharge from\noccurring; (2)\nas provided in\nsubparagraph (xii) of this paragraph; (3)\nthat an individual in receipt of services\nmay request a new independent assessment; and\n(4)\nan individual in receipt of services must\nreceive an independent assessment and practitioner order at least annually to\nmaintain authorization.

(b) A\ncomplete\n\nMedicaid application\nmeans a signed Medicaid application and all\ndocumentation necessary for the social services district to determine the\napplicant's Medicaid eligibility for Medicaid coverage of community-based long\nterm care services. For purposes of this paragraph, an applicant who would\notherwise be required to document accumulated resources may attest to the\ncurrent value of any real property and to the current dollar amount of any bank\naccounts. After the determination of Medicaid eligibility, if the commissioner\nor the district has information indicating an inconsistency between the value\nor dollar amount of such resources and the value or dollar amount to which the\napplicant had attested prior to being determined eligible for Medicaid, and the\ninconsistency is material to the individual's Medicaid eligibility, the\ndistrict must request documentation adequate to verify such resources. (ii)\n\nThe social\nservices district must determine whether the applicant has submitted a complete\n\nMedicaid application. If An applicant has not submitted a complete Medicaid\napplication, the district must notify the applicant of the additional\ndocumentation that the applicant must provide and the date by which the\napplicant must provide such documentation. (a) When An applicant submits an incomplete\n\nMedicaid application together with the physician's statement and the signed\nattestation of immediate need, the district must provide such notice as soon as\npossible and no later than four calendar days after receipt of these\ndocuments.

(iii)\n\nAs soon as possible after receipt of a\ncomplete Medicaid application from a Medicaid applicant with an immediate need\nfor personal care services, but no later than seven calendar days after receipt\nof a complete Medicaid application from such an applicant, the social services\ndistrict must determine whether the applicant is eligible for Medicaid, including Medicaid coverage of community-based long-term care services, and\nnotify the applicant of such determination. (iv)\n\nAs soon as possible after receipt of a\ncomplete Medicaid application from a Medicaid applicant with an immediate need\nfor personal care services, but no later than 12 calendar days after receipt of\na complete Medicaid application from such an applicant, the social services\ndistrict must: (a) refer the applicant for an\nindependent assessment and medical exam and evaluate his or her need for other\nservices pursuant to paragraphs (2)(i) through (2)(v) of this subdivision; and\n(b) determine whether the\napplicant, if determined eligible for Medicaid, would be eligible for personal\ncare services and, if so, the amount and duration of the personal care services\nthat would be authorized should the applicant be determined eligible for\n\nMedicaid, including Medicaid coverage of community-based longterm care\nservices; provided, however, that personal care services shall be authorized\nonly for applicants who are determined to be eligible for Medicaid, including\n\nMedicaid coverage of community based long-term care services. In no event shall\npersonal care services be authorized for a Medicaid applicant unless the\napplicant has been determined eligible for Medicaid, including Medicaid\ncoverage of community-based long-term care services. (v) Social services districts must provide\n\nMedicaid applicants with the required attestation of immediate need form and\nsuch other information regarding the expedited Medicaid eligibility\ndetermination and personal care services assessment procedures set forth in\nthis paragraph as the department may require.

(2)\n\nPayment for\npersonal care services shall not be made to a patient's spouse, parent, son, son-in-law, daughter or daughter-in-law, but may be made to another relative if\nthat other relative: (i) is not residing in\nthe patient's home; or\n(ii)\nis\nresiding in the patient's home because the amount of care required by the\npatient makes his presence necessary. (3)\n\nFor personal care services, payment shall\nbe made as follows: (i) If services are\nprovided directly by the staff of the local department of social services, payment shall be based upon the local department's salary schedule. The local\ndepartment is responsible for withholding all applicable income taxes and\npayment of the employer's share of FICA, Workers' Compensation, Unemployment\n\nInsurance and all other benefits covered under labor management\ncontracts. (ii)\n(a) When personal care services are provided\nby a voluntary, proprietary or public personal care services provider, payment\nis based upon the following: (1)\n\nFor\nproviders having contracts with social services districts for the provision of\npersonal care services during a rate year or years beginning prior to January\n1, 1994, payment will be made at the lower of the local prevailing rate or a\nrate that is negotiated between the district and the provider, unless a\ndifferent rate has been ordered by a court for any such rate year or years. The\nsocial services district must submit the rates to the department on forms the\ndepartment requires to be used and must not implement the rates until the\ndepartment and the Director of the Budget approve them. Such rates are also\nsubject to the provisions of paragraph (5) or (6), as applicable, of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nFor providers\nhaving contracts with social services districts for the provision of personal\ncare services during a rate year or years beginning on or after January 1, 1994, payment will be made in accordance with paragraph (7) of this\nsubdivision.

The social services district\nis responsible for establishing policies for the withholding of all applicable\nincome taxes and payment of the employer's share of FICA, workers'\ncompensation, unemployment insurance and any other benefits included in the\ncontract with the provider. (4)\n\nPayment for assessment and supervisory\nservices provided by a certified home health agency as part of a local social\nservices department's plan for delivery of personal care services shall be at\nrates established by the State Commissioner of Health and approved by the State\n\nDirector of the Budget. (5)\n(i) This paragraph applies to Medical\n\nAssistance (MA) payments to personal care services providers that had personal\ncare services payment rates in effect for the rate or contract year beginning\nprior to July 1, 1990, and seek approval of personal care services payment\nrates for the rate or contract year beginning on or after July 1, 1990. (ii)\n\nFor the rate or contract\nyear beginning on or after July 1, 1990, MA payments to a provider of personal\ncare services must be based on and, except as provided in subparagraph (iv) of\nthis paragraph, be at or below the provider's personal care services payment\nrate in effect for the rate or contract year beginning prior to July 1, 1990, as adjusted by a personal care services trend factor that the department\nestablishes with the approval of the Director of the Budget. (iii)\n\nThe department will establish the\npersonal care services trend factor by designating an external price indicator\nfor each of the three components that comprise the total costs of personal care\nservices, determining the average percentage of total personal care services\ncosts that each component represents, and weighing each component's average\npercentage of total personal care services costs by the external price\nindicator for that component. The three components of the costs of personal\ncare services are listed below: (a) an aide\nwage and benefit component; (b) an\nadministrative and operating component; and\n(c) a clinical component. (iv)\n\nAt the written request of a\nsocial services district and with the approval of the Director of the Budget, the department may grant an exception to the requirement that a personal care\nservices provider's payment rate must be based on, and be at or below, the\nprovider's personal care services payment rate in effect for the rate or\ncontract year beginning prior to July 1, 1990, as adjusted by the personal care\nservices trend factor. The personal care services provider must cooperate with\nthe social services district's exception request by providing such reports or\nother information that may be necessary to justify the exception request. The\ndepartment will grant a social services district's exception request only when\nthe social services district demonstrates to the department's and the Director\nof the Budget's satisfaction that: (a) the\nsocial services district will otherwise be unable to ensure that personal care\nservices recipients will receive the personal care services for which they are\nauthorized; (b) additional payment\nfor personal care services is necessary to maintain the quality of services\nprovided; or\n(c) additional payment\nfor personal care services is necessary due to extraordinary or other\ncircumstances, as specified in department guidelines. (v) A social services district must submit\neach proposed personal care services payment rate to the department in a format\nthat the department requires. The district must not implement any proposed\npersonal care services payment rate until the department and the Director of\nthe Budget approve the rate. (vi)\n\nWithin two months after the day on which the department and the Director of the\n\nBudget receive a proposed personal care services payment rate that is equal to\nor less than the provider's personal care services payment rate for the rate or\ncontract year beginning prior to July 1, 1990, as adjusted by the personal care\nservices trend factor, the department and the Director of the Budget will\napprove the rate. The department will send the social services district written\nnotice of the approval of the rate. (vii)\n\nWithin four months after the day on\nwhich the department and the Director of the Budget receive a proposed personal\ncare services payment rate that exceeds the provider's personal care services\npayment rate for the rate or contract year beginning prior to July 1, 1990, as\nadjusted by the personal care services trend factor, and for which the social\nservices district has requested an exception to the trend factor requirement, the department and the Director of the Budget will approve, disapprove, or\notherwise act upon the rate. The department will send the social services\ndistrict written notice of the approval or disapproval of the proposed personal\ncare services rate or the results of the department's and the Director of the\n\nBudget's other action regarding the proposed rate. If the department and the\n\nDirector of the Budget disapprove a proposed personal care services payment\nrate, the social services district may submit a revised rate for the\ndepartment's and the Director of the Budget's approval, disapproval, or other\naction. (viii)\n\nThe department and\nthe Director of the Budget, when determining whether to approve a proposed\npersonal care services payment rate, may consider various factors including, but not limited to, the following: (a) whether the proposed personal care services payment rate exceeds the provider's\npersonal care services payment rate for the rate or contract year beginning\nprior to July 1, 1990, as adjusted by the personal care services trend factor; and\n(b) if the proposed personal\ncare services payment rate exceeds the provider's personal care services\npayment rate for such rate or contract year, as adjusted by the personal care\nservices trend factor, whether the social services district has requested an\nexception to the trend factor requirement and demonstrated to the department's\nand the Director of the Budget's satisfaction that an exception should be\ngranted. (6)\n(i) This paragraph applies to MA payments to\nthe following personal care services providers: (a) a provider that did not have a personal\ncare services payment rate in effect for a rate or contract year beginning\nprior to July 1, 1990; and\n(b) a\nprovider that had a personal care services payment rate in effect for a rate or\ncontract year beginning prior to July 1, 1990, and seeks approval of a personal\ncare services payment rate for a rate or contract year beginning prior to July\n1, 1990. (ii)\n\nThe\ndepartment and the Director of the Budget, when determining whether to approve\na proposed personal care services payment rate under this paragraph, may\nconsider various factors including, but not limited to, the following: (a) the justification the social services\ndistrict provides, in a format the department requires, for the proposed\nrate; (b) any changes in the\nappropriate consumer price index for urban or rural consumers; (c) any changes in federal or State-mandated\nstandard payroll deductions; (d) the applicable minimum wage laws; (e) a comparison of the proposed personal\ncare services payment rate to other personal care services providers' payment\nrates in the social services district and to personal care services providers'\npayment rates in social services districts of similar size, geography and\ndemographics; and\n(f) a comparison\nof the proposed personal care services payment rate for the provider to the\nprovider's personal care services payment rate, if any, for the previous rate\nor contract year. (iii)\nA social services district must submit each proposed personal care services\npayment rate to the department in a format that the department requires. The\ndistrict must not implement any proposed personal care services payment rate\nuntil the department and the Director of the Budget approve the rate. The\ndepartment will send the social services district written notice of the\napproval or disapproval of the proposed rate. (7)\n\nThis paragraph sets forth the methodology\nby which the department will determine MA payment rates for personal care\nservices providers that have contracts with social services districts for any\nrate year that begins on or after January 1, 1994. (i) Providers' submission of required cost\nreports. (a) Providers with cost experience. (1)\n\nThis clause applies to providers with\ncost experience. A provider with cost experience is defined as any provider of\npersonal care services that can report its actual operating costs for the full\nrate year specified in the required cost report. (2)\n\nEach provider must complete and submit to\nthe department such cost report as the department may require. Each provider\nmust complete the cost report by reporting such of the provider's actual\noperating costs of providing personal care services as the cost report may\nrequire for the full rate year specified in the cost report. (3)\n\nThe department will furnish each provider\nwith the cost report form. The cost report form will specify the date by which\nthe provider must submit the completed report to the department; however, no\nprovider will have fewer than 90 calendar days to submit the report after its\nreceipt. The department may grant a provider an additional 30 calendar days to\nsubmit the cost report when the provider, prior to the date the report is due, submits a written request to the department for an extension and establishes to\nthe department's satisfaction that the provider cannot submit the report by the\ndate the report is due for reasons beyond the provider's control. (4)\n(i) If\nthe department determines that the cost report submitted by a provider is\ninaccurate or incomplete, the department will notify the provider in writing. The notice will advise the provider of the corrected or additional information\nthat the provider must submit. (ii)\n\nThe provider must submit the corrected or additional information within 30\ncalendar days from the date the provider receives the department's notice. The\ndepartment may grant the provider an additional 30 calendar days to submit the\ncorrected or additional information when the provider, prior to the date that\nthe corrected or additional information is due, submits a written request to\nthe department for an extension and establishes to the department's\nsatisfaction that the provider cannot submit the corrected or additional\ninformation by the date the information is due for reasons beyond the\nprovider's control. (5)\n\nIf the provider determines that the cost report that it has submitted to the\ndepartment is inaccurate or incomplete, the provider must submit corrected or\nadditional information. The provider must submit such corrected or additional\ninformation to the department within 45 calendar days from the date the\nprovider submitted the original cost report to the department. (6)\n(i) In\nthe event a provider fails to file the required cost report on or before the\ndue date, or as the same may be extended pursuant to subclause\n(\n3\n) of this clause, the State Commissioner of Health shall\nreduce the current rate paid by state governmental agencies by two percent for\na period beginning on the first day of the calendar month following the\noriginal due date of the required report and continuing until the last day of\nthe calendar month in which the required report is filed. (ii)\n\nFailure to timely file the corrected or\nadditional data as required pursuant to subclause (\n4\n) of this\nclause will result in application of item (\ni\n) of this\nsubclause. Lack of certification by the operator or by the accountant, as\nrequired pursuant to subclauses (\n8\n) and (\n9\n)\nof this clause, shall render a cost report incomplete. (7)\n\nThe provider must complete the cost\nreport in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied\nto the provider, unless the department specifies otherwise on the cost report\nform. (8)\n\nThe cost report must be\ncertified by the owner or administrator of a proprietary personal care services\nprovider, the chief executive officer or administrator of a voluntary personal\ncare services provider, or the public official responsible for the operation of\na publicly operated personal care services provider. The cost report form will\ninclude a certification form, which will specify who must certify the\nreport. (9)\n\nThe provider must\nsubmit an opinion of an independent certified public accountant that the\nprovider's cost report, or such portions of the cost report as the department\nmay specify, has been examined and determined to comply with generally accepted\naccounting principles and with the allowable costs and recoveries of expenses\nrequirements specified in subclauses (ii)(\na\n)(\n3\n) and (\n4\n), respectively, of this paragraph. The provider must submit such independent certified public\naccountant's opinion on a form as the department may require. (b) New providers. (1)\n\nThis clause applies to new providers of\npersonal care services. A new provider of personal care services is defined as\nany provider of personal care services that cannot report its actual operating\ncosts for the full rate year specified in the required cost report. (2)\n\nEach new provider must complete and\nsubmit to the department such cost reports as the department may require. Each\nnew provider must complete the cost report by reporting such of the provider's\nestimated operating costs of providing personal care services as the cost\nreport may require for the full rate year specified in the cost\nreport. (3)\n\nThe department will\nfurnish each new provider with the cost report form. The cost report form will\nspecify the date by which the provider must submit the completed report to the\ndepartment; however, no provider will have fewer than 90 calendar days to\nsubmit the report after its receipt. The department may grant a provider an\nadditional 30 calendar days to submit the cost report when the provider, prior\nto the date the report is due, submits a written request to the department for\nan extension and establishes to the department's satisfaction that the provider\ncannot submit the report by the date the report is due for reasons beyond the\nprovider's control. (4)\n(i) If the department determines that the\ncost report that a new provider has submitted is inaccurate or incomplete, the\ndepartment will notify the provider in writing. The notice will advise the\nprovider of the corrected or additional information that the provider must\nsubmit. (ii)\n\nThe new provider must\nsubmit the corrected or additional information within 30 calendar days from the\ndate the provider receives the department's notice. The department may grant\nthe provider an additional 30 calendar days to submit the corrected or\nadditional information when the provider, prior to the date that the corrected\nor additional information is due, submits a written request to the department\nfor an extension and establishes to the department's satisfaction that the\nprovider cannot submit the corrected or additional information by the date the\ninformation is due for reasons beyond the provider's control. (5)\n\nIf the new provider determines\nthat the cost report that it has submitted to the department is inaccurate or\nincomplete, the provider must submit corrected or additional information. The\nprovider must submit such corrected or additional information to the department\nwithin 45 calendar days from the date the provider submitted the original cost\nreport to the department. (6)\n\nIf a\nnew provider fails to submit the cost report or any corrected or additional\ninformation regarding the cost report by the original or extended date on which\nsuch report or such corrected or additional information is due, the provider's\nexisting approved payment rate, if any, will remain in effect until such time\nas the provider submits such cost report or such corrected or additional\ninformation and otherwise complies with the requirements of this clause, and\nthe department is able to determine a rate for the provider. The rate will be\neffective for the full rate year regardless of the date on which the provider\nsubmitted such cost report or such corrected or additional information and\notherwise complied with the requirements of this clause. (7)\n\nThe new provider must complete the cost\nreport in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as applied\nto the provider, unless the report specifies otherwise. (8)\n\nThe cost report must be certified by the\nowner or administrator of a proprietary personal care services provider, the\nchief executive officer or administrator of a voluntary personal care services\nprovider, or the public official responsible for the operation of a publicly\noperated personal care services provider. The cost report form will include a\ncertification form, which will specify who must certify the report. (9)\n\nWhen a new provider has contracted with a\nsocial services district for the provision of personal care services for one\nyear and can report its actual operating costs for such year, the provider must\nreport its actual operating costs for such year to the department by completing\na new cost report and submitting such report to the department in accordance\nwith the requirements for providers with cost experience as set forth in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nDetermination of payment rate. (a) Providers with cost experience. (1)\n\nMedical assistance payments to personal\ncare services providers for any rate year beginning on or after January 1, 1994, are made at the lower of the following rates: (i) the rate the provider charges the general\npublic for personal care services; or\n(ii)\nthe rate determined by the department in\naccordance with subclauses (2) through (7) of this clause. (2)\n\nThe department will determine a\nprovider's payment rate based on the cost report the provider submits. Each\nprovider must report its personnel and nonpersonnel operating costs as\nspecified in the cost report. The department will consider only the provider's\noperating costs that are allowable costs, as defined in subclause (3) of this\nclause and as adjusted by the provider in accordance with subclause (4) of this\nclause. The department will adjust the provider's allowable costs by trend\nfactors, as determined in accordance with subclause (5) of this clause. The\ndepartment will determine whether the provider's allowable costs exceed the\nceilings that the department has established for such costs in accordance with\nsubclause (6) of this clause and, if so, consider only such of the provider's\nallowable costs that do not exceed such ceilings. The department will calculate\nan amount for profit, for proprietary providers, or surplus, for voluntary\nproviders, as determined in accordance with subclause (7) of this clause. The\nresulting rate will be payment-in-full for all personal care services provided\nto MA recipients during the applicable rate year, subject to any revisions the\ndepartment may make in accordance with the rate revision or audit processes\nauthorized by subparagraphs (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nAllowable costs. (i) Allowable costs\nare\ndefined as a provider's documented costs that are necessary for the provider's\noperation, are directly or indirectly related to recipients' care, and are not\nexpressly declared nonallowable by Federal or State law or\nregulations. (ii)\n\nAllowable costs\nwill be determined in accordance with reimbursement principles developed for\ndetermining payments under title XVIII of the federal Social Security Act\n(Medicare). These reimbursement principles are set forth in the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement Manual, Part 1, entitled \"HCFA\nPub. 15-1 thru T. 365,\" which is published by the Health Care Financing\n\nAdministration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. The department has incorporated by reference Chapters 1-14, 21-23 and 26 of\nsuch manual, as revised effective January 1, 1992. A copy of such manual is\navailable for public use and inspection at the Department of Social Services, 40 North Pearl St., Albany, NY 12243. (iii)\n\nAllowable costs include the following: (A)\na monetary value assigned to services\nprovided by religious orders and for services rendered by an owner or operator\nof a provider; (B)\nonly that\nportion of the dues the provider pays to any professional association that has\nbeen demonstrated, to the department's satisfaction, to be allocable to\nexpenditures other than for public relations, advertising or political\ncontributions; (C)\ncosts allocated\nto the provider from a related organization when the costs are reasonably\nrelated to the efficient provision of personal care services and the bases of\nallocation of such costs are consistent with regulations applicable to the cost\nreporting of the related organization. An organization is related to the\nprovider when the provider, to a significant extent, is associated or\naffiliated with, or has control of, or is controlled by, the organization\nfurnishing the services, facilities or supplies. To a significant\nextent\nmeans that: (i) the provider\nor an officer, director or partner of such provider has an ownership interest, as defined in section\n505.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart, in such organization equal to five percent or more; has an indirect\nownership interest, as defined in section\n505.2\n(g) of this\n\nPart, in such organization equal to five percent or more; has a combination of\nan ownership interest and an indirect ownership interest in such organization\nequal to five percent or more; has an interest of five percent or more in any\nmortgage, deed of trust, note or other obligation secured by such organization\nif that interest equals at least five percent of the value of the\norganization's property or assets; or is an officer, director or partner of\nsuch organization or otherwise has the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the actions or policies of such\norganization; or\n(ii)\nthe\norganization furnishing the services, facilities or supplies to the provider, or an officer, director or partner of such organization has an ownership\ninterest, as defined in section\n505.2\n(i) of this\n\nPart, in the provider equal to five percent or more; has an indirect ownership\ninterest, as defined in section\n505.2\n(g) of this\n\nPart, in the provider equal to five percent or more; has a combination of an\nownership interest and an indirect ownership interest in the provider equal to\nfive percent or more; has an interest of five percent or more in any mortgage, deed of trust, note or other obligation secured by the provider if that\ninterest equals at least five percent of the value of the provider's property\nor assets; or is an officer, director or partner of the provider or otherwise\nhas the power, directly or indirectly, significantly to influence or direct the\nactions or policies of the provider; (D)\nreasonable compensation for owners or\noperators, their employees and their relatives for services actually performed\nand required to be performed. A\nrelative\nis defined in\naccordance with section 902.5 of the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement\n\nManual\nas follows: the spouse; natural parent, child and sibling; adopted child and adoptive parent; stepparent, stepchild, stepbrother, and\nstepsister; father-in-law, mother-in-law, son-in-law, daughter-in-law, brother-in-law and sister-in-law; and grandparent and grandchild of an owner or\noperator. The amount of allowable costs for reasonable compensation is equal to\nthe amount of compensation normally required to be paid for the same services\nprovided by a nonrelated employee, as determined by the department. Allowable\ncosts do not include compensation for any services which owners or operators\nand their employees and relatives are not authorized to perform under State law\nor regulation; (E)\ncosts of\nadvertising, public relations or promotion when such costs are specifically\nrelated to the provision of personal care services and are not for the purpose\nof attracting patients; and\n(F)\nsuch other costs as are determined allowable in accordance with reimbursement\nprinciples specified in the\n\nMedicare Provider Reimbursement\n\nManual. (iv)\n\nAllowable costs do not include the following: (A)\namounts in excess of reasonable or\nmaximum costs authorized under title XVIII of the federal Social Security Act\nor in excess of customary charges to the general public. This provision does\nnot apply to services furnished by public providers free of charge or at a\nnominal fee; (B)\nexpenses or\nportions of expenses reported by providers that the department determines are\nnot reasonably related to the efficient provision of personal care services\nbecause of either the nature or the amount of the particular item; (C)\ncosts that are not properly related to\npatient care and that principally afford diversion, entertainment or amusement\nto owners, operators, their employees or relatives; (D)\nany interest paid by the provider that is\nrelated to a rate determination or penalties imposed by governmental agencies\nor courts except tax penalties that are imposed through no fault of the\nprovider and the costs of insurance policies that the provider obtains solely\nto insure against the imposition of such penalties; (E)\ncosts of contributions or other payments\nto political parties, political candidates or political\norganizations; (F)\nany element of\ncost as determined by the department to have been created by the sale of a\nprovider; (G)\nthe amount of the\npersonal care services provider assessment required by section\n367-i\nof\nthe Social Services Law or section\n3614-b\nof\nthe Public Health Law; or\n(H)\nsuch\nother costs as are determined to be unallowable in accordance with\nreimbursement principles specified in the\n\nMedicare Provider\n\nReimbursement Manual. (4)\n\nRecoveries of expense. The provider must\nreduce its reported operating costs by the costs of services or activities that\nare not properly chargeable to patient care. When the department determines\nthat it is not practical to establish the costs of such services or activities, the provider will reduce its reported operating costs by the income that the\nprovider receives from such services or activities. Examples of such income\ninclude, but are not limited to, the following: (i) any amount the provider receives as a\ndiscount on purchases; (ii)\nany\namount the provider receives from tuition payments or from other payments made\nto the provider for educational services or other services not directly related\nto personal care services; (iii)\nany amount the provider receives from a lease of office or other space to\nconcessionaires that provide services not related to personal care services; and\n(iv)\nany amount the provider\ncharges for the use of telephone, telefax or telegraph services. (5)\n\nTrend factors. (i) The department will establish annual\ntrend factors to be applied to providers' reported allowable costs for the\nprovision of personal care services other than nursing supervision or nursing\nassessment. The department will also establish annual trend factors to be\napplied to providers' reported allowable costs for the provision of nursing\nsupervision and nursing assessment when providers have contracts with social\nservices districts for the provision of nursing supervision and nursing\nassessment. (ii)\n\nThe department has\ndesignated an external price indicator for the aide/nurse direct care\ncomponent, the administrative component and the training component of the costs\nof personal care services and the costs of nursing supervision and nursing\nassessment. (A)\n\nThe external price indicators\nthat the department has designated for the costs of personal care services are\nas follows: for the aide direct care component, the external price indicator is\nthe\n\nEmployment Cost Index for Compensation\nfor December of\neach year, as published by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of\n\nLabor Statistics; for the administrative component, the external price\nindicator is the\n\nConsumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, as published for December of each year by the United States Department of\n\nLabor, Bureau of Labor Statistics; and for the training component, the external\nprice indicator is the trend factor established by the Department of Health for\ncertified home health agencies in upstate urban areas. (B)\n\nThe external price indicators that the\ndepartment has designated for the costs of nursing supervision and nursing\nassessment are as follows: for the nurse direct care and the training\ncomponents, the external price indicator is the trend factor established by the\n\nDepartment of Health for certified home health agencies in upstate urban areas; and for the administrative component, the trend factor is the\n\nConsumer\n\nPrice Index for All Urban Consumers, as published for December of each\nyear by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\n\nStatistics. (iii)\n\nThe\ndepartment will determine the average percentage of all providers' total\nreported costs for personal care services and for nursing supervision and\nnursing assessment that each component represents as of June 30th of the year\nprior to the year for which the department is establishing a rate; and the\ndepartment will weigh each component's average percentage of total personal\ncare services costs and nursing supervision and nursing assessment costs by the\nexternal price indicator for that component. (iv)\n\nThe department will multiply each\nprovider's reported allowable costs for personal care services and, if\napplicable, for nursing supervision and nursing assessment, for the year\nspecified in the required cost report by two annual projected trend factors: a\nprojected trend factor that the department has estimated for the year that\nimmediately follows the year for which the provider has reported its costs and\na projected trend factor that the department has estimated for the year for\nwhich the department is determining a rate. (v) The department will revise trend factors\nas specified in this item. Such revisions, if they occur, will occur after the\ndepartment has determined providers' rates for a particular rate year and is\ndetermining providers' rates for the subsequent rate year. When the department\ndetermines, based upon the external price indicators, that the actual trend\nfactor for the previous rate year deviated by one-half of one percent or more\nfrom the department's projected trend factor for such rate year, the department\nwill revise the projected trend factor for the year immediately following such\nrate year by the amount of the deviation. (6)\n\nCeilings on payment for allowable costs. (i) The department will establish ceilings on\npayment for providers' allowable costs. The department will determine the\nceilings as set forth in this item: (A)\n\nThe\ndepartment will assign providers to one of the following five regional groups: (i) the Metropolitan Downstate Group, which\nincludes providers located in Nassau, Rockland, Suffolk or Westchester\n\nCounty; (ii)\nthe Metropolitan\n\nUpstate Group, which includes providers located in Albany, Broome, Dutchess, Erie, Monroe, Niagara, Oneida, Onondaga or Orange County; (iii)\nthe Suburban Group, which includes\nproviders located in Cayuga, Fulton, Genesee, Madison, Montgomery, Ontario, Oswego, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Schenectady or Wayne County; (iv)\nthe New York City Group, which includes\nproviders located in the five boroughs of New York City; and\n(v) the Rural County Group, which includes\nproviders located in any of the remaining 33 social services districts not\nincluded in the Metropolitan Downstate, Metropolitan Upstate, Suburban or New\n\nYork City group. (B)\n\nThe\ndepartment will use providers' reported allowable costs for the 1990 calendar\nyear as the base from which it will determine the ceilings for the rate year\nthat begins on or after January 1, 1994. The department will use providers'\nreported allowable costs for the 1992 calendar year as the base from which it\nwill determine the ceilings for each rate year that begins on or after January\n1, 1995. (C)\n\nFor each regional\ngroup of providers, the department will calculate the centered means of the\nappropriate base year costs, other than costs attributable to the\nadministrative component, that the providers in the regional group have\nreported on the cost reports required by the department. (D)\n\nThe department will apply an annual trend\nfactor, as determined in accordance with subclause (\n5\n) of this\nclause, to the centered means of the appropriate base year costs. The\ndepartment will apply such an annual trend factor for each of the following\nyears: the year that immediately follows the appropriate base year and each\nsubsequent year up to and including but not exceeding the year for which the\ndepartment will be determining providers' rates. (E)\n\nThe department will determine regional\nceilings for allowable costs within the combined aide/nurse direct care and the\ntraining components of the costs of personal care services and nursing\nsupervision and nursing assessment. The ceiling will be expressed as a\npercentage of the applicable centered mean, as adjusted by annual trend\nfactors, for each such allowable cost. (F)\n\nThe department will establish the\nfollowing ceilings: (I)\n\nWithin the combined\naide/nurse direct care and the training components, the ceiling for allowable\ncosts will be 115 percent of the applicable trended regional centered mean; however, any costs providers may incur under their contracts with social\nservices districts to determine whether prospective personal care aides or\nnurses have Federal or state criminal records or to fingerprint personal care\naides will not be subject to such ceiling; (II)\n(Effective January 1, 1994, to December\n31, 1994) Payment for a provider's administrative and general expenses, excluding capital costs, will not exceed 28 percent of the provider's total\nallowable costs, as reported by the provider in its cost report. The department\nwill reduce payment for a provider's administrative and general expenses in\naccordance with the following schedule: when a provider's reported\nadministrative and general expenses, expressed as a percentage of the\nprovider's total allowable costs, are greater than 26 percent, but do not\nexceed 31 percent, of the provider's total allowable costs, the department will\nreduce payment for the provider's administrative and general expenses by four\npercent; when a provider's reported administrative and general expenses, expressed as a percentage of the provider's total allowable costs, are greater\nthan 22 percent, but do not exceed 26 percent, of the provider's total\nallowable costs, the department will reduce payment for the provider's\nadministrative and general expenses by three percentage points; and when a\nprovider's reported administrative and general expenses, expressed as a\npercentage of the provider's total allowable costs, are greater than 20\npercent, but do not exceed 22 percent, of the provider's total allowable costs, the department will reduce payment for the provider's administrative and\ngeneral expenses by two percentage points; however, no provider's\nadministrative and general expenses will be reduced to less than 20 percent of\nthe provider's total allowable costs. (III)\n(Effective January 1, 1995) Payment for\na provider's administrative and general expenses, excluding capital costs, will\nnot exceed 28 percent of the provider's total allowable costs, as reported by\nthe provider in its cost report. (ii)\n\nThe department will apply the ceilings\nas follows: when a provider's reported allowable costs are equal to or less\nthan the ceiling that the department has established, the provider will receive\nfull payment for its reported allowable costs. When a provider's reported\nallowable costs exceed the ceiling that the department has established, the\nprovider will receive payment for such reported allowable costs in an amount\nnot to exceed the ceiling. (7)\n\nAdjustments for profit or surplus. (i) The department will include an adjustment\nfor profit, for proprietary providers, or surplus, for voluntary providers. The\ndepartment will determine the amount of the adjustment by calculating the ratio\nof the provider's allowable costs for aide wages and benefits to the provider's\ntotal allowable personal care services costs; multiplying such ratio by the 26\nweek United States Treasury Bill rate (\"treasury bill rate\"), as published by\nthe United States Department of the Treasury in the last week of September of\nthe year preceding the year for which the department is determining the rate; and multiplying the provider's rate, as determined in accordance with\nsubclauses (\n2\n)-(\n6\n) of this clause, by the\nproduct of such multiplication. The result is an amount which the department\nwill add to the provider's rate, subject to items (\nii\n) and\n(\niii\n) of this subclause. (ii)\n\nWhen the treasury bill rate used for\npurposes of this subclause has increased or decreased from the previous\napplicable treasury bill rate by more than two percent, the department will\nconsider only a two percent increase or decrease in the treasury bill rate when\ndetermining providers' adjustments for profit or surplus for a particular\nyear. (iii)\n\nThe amount that the\ndepartment will add to the provider's rate as an adjustment for profit or\nsurplus will in no event exceed an amount equal to five percent of the\nprovider's rate absent such adjustment for profit or surplus. (b) New providers. (1)\n\nMedical assistance payments to new\npersonal care services providers for any rate year beginning on or after\n\nJanuary 1, 1994, will be made at the lower of the following rates: (i) the rate the provider charges the general\npublic for personal care services; or\n(ii)\nthe rate determined by the department in\naccordance with subclause (\n2\n) of this clause. (2)\n(i) The department will determine a new\nprovider's payment rate based on the cost report the provider submits. Each\nprovider must report its estimated personnel and non-personnel operating costs\nas specified in the cost report. (ii)\n\nThe department will consider only the\nprovider's estimated operating costs that are allowable costs, as determined in\naccordance with subclause (\na\n)(\n3\n) of this\nsubparagraph and as adjusted by the provider in accordance with subclause\n(\na\n)(\n4\n) of this subparagraph. (iii)\n\nThe department will determine whether\nthe provider's estimated allowable costs exceed the ceilings that the\ndepartment will establish for such costs in accordance with subclause\n(\na\n)(\n6\n) of this subparagraph, except that the\nlimitation on providers' administrative and general expenses that is set forth\nin phrases\n(\na\n)(\n6\n)(\ni\n)(\nF\n)(\nII\n)\nand (\nIII\n) of this subparagraph will not apply to new providers\nin the first year of operation, and if the provider's estimated allowable costs\notherwise exceed such ceilings, the department will consider only such of the\nprovider's estimated allowable costs that do not exceed such\nceilings. (iv)\n\nThe department will\ncalculate an amount for profit, for proprietary providers, or surplus, for\nvoluntary providers, as determined in accordance with subclause\n(\na\n)(\n7\n) of this subparagraph. (v) The resulting rate will be\npayment-in-full for all personal care services provided to MA recipients during\nthe applicable rate year, subject to any revisions the department may make in\naccordance with the rate revision or audit processes authorized by subparagraph\n(iii) or (iv) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nRevisions to rates. (a) The department will notify each provider\nof its approved rates of payment at least 30 days prior to the beginning of an\nestablished rate period for which the rate is to become effective. In the case\nof payments to be made by State governmental agencies notification shall be\nmade only after approval of rate schedules by the State Director of the Budget. The advance notification of rates shall not apply to prospective or retroactive\nadjustments to rates that are based on rate appeals filed by the provider, audits, corrections of errors or omission of data or errors in the computation\nof such rates or the submission of cost report data from providers without an\nestimated cost basis. (b) (1)\n\nWithin 90 calendar days after the\nprovider receives the written notification of its rate, the provider must\nnotify the department of any errors in the rate resulting either from the\nprovider's submission of erroneous information in its cost report or the\ndepartment's erroneous computation of the rate and of the provider's request\nfor a revised rate. (2)\n\nThe\nprovider must submit its notice and request for a revised rate on forms as may\nbe required by the department. The request for a revised rate must specify the\nbasis for the revision, as specified in clause (\nc\n) of this\nsubparagraph, and contain documentation supporting the request. The department\nmay request such additional documentation as determined necessary. (c) The department will consider\nonly those requests for rate revisions that are based on one or more of the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe provider's claim that the\nrate contains mathematical, statistical, fiscal or clerical errors; (2)\nthe provider's claim that it has incurred\nnew or unanticipated costs for programs or services mandated or approved by the\ndepartment and that the cost report that the provider submitted to the\ndepartment does not reflect the provider's actual costs for reasons beyond the\nprovider's control; or\n(3)\nthe\nprovider's desire to obtain a rate that is lower than the rate promulgated by\nthe department. (d) When\nthe department determines that a provider's request for a revised rate does not\nmeet one or more requirements of clause (\nc\n) of this\nsubparagraph, the department will notify the provider in writing within 30\ncalendar days of such determination. (e) When the department determines that a\nprovider's request for a revised rate meets one or more requirements of clause\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph, the department will determine\nwhether the provider's rate should be revised. The department will notify the\nprovider in writing of the results of its determination and, if the department\ndetermines that the provider's rate should be revised, of the revised rate. Within six months after the date the department receives the provider's request\nfor a revised rate, the department will submit its determination regarding the\nrevised rate to the Division of the Budget for its review and\napproval. (f) Within 30 calendar\ndays after the provider receives the written notification of its revised rate, the provider must notify the department in writing of any errors in the revised\nrate. (iv)\n\nAudits, hearings and recoveries of overpayments. Parts 517, 518, and 519 of this Title, which concern provider audits, recoveries of overpayments and provider hearings\nrespectively, apply to audits of, recoveries of overpayments from, and hearings\ngranted to providers subject to the requirements of this paragraph. (v) Exemptions. (a) A social services district may request an\nexemption from the application of the methodology, as set forth in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, to providers with which the\ndistrict has contracts for the provision of personal care services. A social\nservices district that seeks an exemption must submit a written exemption\nrequest to the department. The exemption request must describe the alternative\nrate methodology that the district has developed and will use to determine\npayments to personal care services providers and such other information as the\ndepartment may require. (b) The\ndepartment may grant a social services district's exemption request when it\ndetermines that the alternative rate methodology that the district will use is\nbased on providers' costs of providing personal care services; includes an\nadjustment for inflationary increases in the providers' costs of doing\nbusiness; and contains provisions comparable, as determined by the department, to the rate methodology and other provisions set forth in this\nparagraph. (i) Reimbursement. State reimbursement shall be available pursuant to\nsection\n368-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law for expenditures for services provided in accordance\nwith the provisions of this section. (j) Annual plan. The local social services department shall submit\nannually to the New York State Department of Social Services a plan for\nprovision of personal care services on forms required by the department. (k) Shared aide\nplans. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, each social services district must implement\na shared aide plan approved by the department. (i) Prior to implementing a shared aide plan, a social services district must develop a proposed shared aide plan and submit\nthe proposed plan to the department for its review and approval or disapproval. The social services district must submit its proposed shared aide plan to the\ndepartment on forms the department requires and within 60 business days after\nthe department issues an administrative directive to all social services\ndistricts regarding the districts' development and implementation of shared\naide plans. (ii)\n\nIn its proposed\nshared aide plan, the social services district must document the following\ninformation to the department's satisfaction: (a) the number of shared aide sites the\nsocial services district plans to establish and the projected implementation\ndate at each site; (b) the number\nof nurse supervisors, case managers, provider agency coordinators, and other\npersonnel who will serve personal care services recipients under the district's\nshared aide plan; (c) the methods\nthe social services district will use to inform personal care services\nrecipients and providers regarding the district's shared aide plan; (d) the methods the social services district\nwill use to select the personal care services providers that will participate\nin the district's shared aide plan; (e) the differences, if any, between the\nprovision of nursing assessments, nursing supervision, and case management to\npersonal care services recipients under the district's shared aide plan and the\ndistrict's existing method of delivering personal care services; and\n(f) the methods the social services district\nwill use to monitor and evaluate the district's shared aide plan, including how\nthe district will evaluate personal care services recipients' satisfaction with\nthe district's shared aide plan. (iii)\n\nThe department will approve proposed\nshared aide plans that comply with the requirements set forth in this\nparagraph. The department will notify the social services district in writing\nof its approval or disapproval of the district's proposed plan within 45\nbusiness days after receipt of the plan. If the department disapproves the\nsocial services district's proposed plan, the district must submit a revised\nplan within 30 business days after receipt of the department's disapproval\nnotice. The department will notify the social services district in writing of\nits approval or disapproval of the district's revised plan within 45 business\ndays after receipt of the revised plan. (iv)\n\nEach social services district with an\napproved shared aide plan must submit to the department such reports or\ninformation relating to the plan's implementation as the department may\nrequire. Personal care services providers must furnish such reports or\ninformation relating to the social services district's implementation of its\nshared aide plan as the district or the department may require. (v) Except as otherwise provided in this\nsubdivision, personal care services provided under a shared aide plan must\nconform to the standards specified in this section. (vi)\nA social services district may delegate\nto another agency or entity the responsibility for developing and implementing\na shared aide plan provided that the department has approved the delegation, and the social services district and such other agency or entity have a written\nagreement or contract specifying each entity's responsibilities. (2)\nA social services district is\nnot required to develop and implement a shared aide plan if the district has\nrequested an exemption from the shared aide plan requirement and the department\nhas approved the district's exemption request. (i) A social services district that seeks an\nexemption from the shared aide plan requirement must submit an exemption\nrequest to the department for its review and approval or disapproval. The\nsocial services district must submit its exemption request to the department on\nforms the department requires and within 60 business days after the department\nissues an administrative directive to all social services districts regarding\nthe districts' development and implementation of shared aide plans. (ii)\n\nIn its exemption request, the social\nservices district must satisfactorily document that the district's existing\nmethod of delivering personal care services adequately meets, and can continue\nto meet, recipients' personal care services needs and that a sufficient supply\nof personal care services providers is available, and is reasonably expected to\ncontinue to be available, to provide personal care services to recipients in\nthe district. A social services district's exemption request must also\nsatisfactorily document that at least one of the following exemption criteria\nexists in the district: (a) the number of\npersonal care services recipients is either too few to support a shared aide\nplan or so geographically dispersed that the district cannot identify a group\nof recipients for which a shared aide plan would be appropriate; (b) the annual costs of delivering personal\ncare services under a shared aide plan would be equal to, or greater than, the\nannual costs of delivering personal care services under the district's existing\nmethod; or\n(c) the district has\nanother cost-effective method to improve the efficiency of the delivery of\npersonal care services. (iii)\n\nThe department will approve exemption\nrequests that comply with the requirements set forth in this paragraph. The\ndepartment will notify the social services district in writing of its approval\nor disapproval of the district's exemption request within 45 business days\nafter receipt of the exemption request. (a) If the department disapproves the district's exemption request, the district\nmust submit either a revised exemption request or a proposed shared aide plan\nwithin 30 business days after receipt of the disapproval notice. The department\nwill notify the social services district in writing of its approval or\ndisapproval of the district's revised exemption request or proposed shared aide\nplan within 45 business days after receipt of the revised exemption request or\nproposed shared aide plan. (1)\n\nIf the social\nservices district submits a revised exemption request and the department\ndisapproves the revised exemption request, the district must submit a proposed\nshared aide plan within 30 business days after receipt of the disapproval\nnotice. The social services district's proposed shared aide plan, and the\ndepartment's review and approval or disapproval of the proposed shared aide\nplan, must otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nIf the social\nservices district submits a proposed shared aide plan and the department\ndisapproves the proposed shared aide plan, the district must submit a revised\nshared aide plan within 30 business days after receipt of the disapproval\nnotice. The social services district's revised shared aide plan, and the\ndepartment's review and approval or disapproval of the revised shared aide plan\nmust otherwise meet the requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nAn approved exemption request is\neffective only for the year covered by the social services district's current\napproved annual plan for the provision of personal care services, as required\nby subdivision (j) of this section. A social services district that has been\nexempted from the shared aide plan requirement must submit a new exemption\nrequest or a proposed shared aide plan when the district submits a new annual\nplan for the provision of personal care services or before the day that the\ndistrict's approved exemption request expires.
