  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.9 - Investments in mortgages on real property located in possessions of the united states\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department was asked whether a mortgage on real property, otherwise qualifying as a permissible investment for savings banks and savings\nand loan associations under section\n235\n(6)\nand\n380\n(1)(b)(1)\nof the Banking Law, is rendered\nimpermissible by the fact that such real property is located in the Virgin\n\nIslands. The department replies that the investment is not permissible\nunder the sections cited, which allow investments secured by mortgages on real\nproperty located in New York, adjoining States and, subject to regulation, \"any\nother state of the United States, the District of Columbia or the Commonwealth\nof Puerto Rico ________\". In reaching this conclusion the department duly noted\nsection\n47\nof\nthe General Construction Law, which provides as follows (emphasis\nsupplied): \"The term State, when used generally to include every State\nof the United States, includes also every territory of the United States and\nthe District of Columbia.\"\nHowever, because the Legislature in enacting the Banking Law\nprovisions in question added to the word \"state\" specific references to the\n\nDistrict of Columbia and to one United States territory (Puerto Rico) but no\nothers, the department concluded that in this instance the term \"state\" was not\n\"used generally\" in the sense contemplated by the General Construction Law. That only Puerto Rico is a permissible territory for the purposes under review\nwas found to be further supported by the legislative history contained in 1966\n\nNew York State Legislative Annual 64, 73, pertaining to L. 1966 ch. 324, which\nadded the language in question to the Banking Law. In this, as in other legal-investment opinions rendered by\nthe department which do not specifically indicate the contrary, no question was\nasked nor answer given as to the legality of the investment under \"leeway\"\nprovisions such as sections\n235\n(29)\nand\n379\n(7)\nof the Banking Law. DATED: January 31, 1974\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 4.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
