  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.2 - Sale of utility and similar services\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(b)\n(a) Imposition. (1)\n\nSection\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law\nimposes a tax on the receipts from every sale, except a sale for resale or a\nsale specifically exempt under section\n1115 (b)(i) and (ii) (c) or (e)\nof the Tax Law, of\n(i) gas, electricity, refrigeration and\nsteam, and gas, electric, refrigeration and steam service of whatever nature; and\n(ii)\ntelephony and telegraphy\nand telephone and telegraph service of whatever nature, except interstate and\ninternational telephony and telegraphy and telephone and telegraph service. Cross reference: Exemptions, see Part 528 of this Title. (2)\n\nAlthough this tax is generally\nknown as the \"consumer's utility tax,\" the intention of the statute is to tax\nthe enumerated sales and services whether or not rendered by a company subject\nto regulation as a utility company. The words \"of whatever nature\" indicate\nthat a broad construction is to be given the terms describing the items taxed. The inclusion of the word \"service\" indicates an intent to tax, under this\nprovision, items that are furnished as a continuous supply while the\nvendor-vendee relationship exists. (3)\nA charge for installing equipment, such\nas transmission equipment, which a gas, electric, or telephone or telegraph\ncompany makes, according to a tariff, to a real property developer is deemed to\nbe a charge for gas, electric, telephone or telegraph service. The charge may\nbe for reimbursement of the company's cost of doing the work itself, or for the\ncost the company incurred in having a contractor perform the work. (b) Gas and gas\nservice. (1)\n\nAll types of gas service\nand gas sold through pipes or mains, or in containers with a capacity of 100\npounds of gas or more, for heating, cooking, refrigerating or lighting purposes\nby residential, commercial or industrial users are subject to the tax imposed\nunder subdivision (b) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law. (2)\n\nWhere gas service or gas is sold and\ndelivered, in a truck from which the gas is transferred to a container on the\npremises of the purchaser, such transaction is taxed as a sale in a bulk\ncontainer having a capacity of 100 or more pounds of gas subject to tax as in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nSales of gas in containers or cylinders\nhaving a capacity of less than 100 pounds of gas are considered to be sales of\ntangible personal property subject to tax under subdivision (a) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law and not the sale of gas\nservice or gas for the purposes of this section. Example 1: A resident of a city purchases 50 cubic feet of natural gas\nfrom a regulated company (public utility). The transaction is the purchase of a\ngas service. Example 2: A dealer in LP gas visits a residence on a monthly basis, and refills or replaces the cylinders. The charge that is made for the gas\nconsumed is for a gas service. Example 3: A dealer in LP gas sells 20 pound cylinders for use on\ntrailers, or by plumbers and also refills such cylinders. The receipts from all\nsuch sales are receipts from the sale of tangible personal property. Example 4: A person purchases two 100 pound tanks of LP gas from a\nnon-regulated company. The transaction is the purchase of gas. Example 5: A welding shop purchases a tank of oxygen and a tank of\nacetylene. The transaction is not the purchase of a gas service but is the\npurchase of tangible personal property. (c) Refrigeration and refrigeration\nservice. (1)\n\nThe sale of air\nconditioning is a sale of refrigeration service. Example: A lease provides that a landlord will furnish the tenant\nwith air conditioning service during normal business hours and further provides\nfor an additional charge, for air conditioning service during other hours at\n$10 an hour. This additional charge is for the sale of refrigeration\nservice. (2)\n\nThe sale of\nrefrigerated storage or refrigerated transportation is not the sale of\nrefrigeration or refrigeration service. The taxability of such services is\ngoverned by the provisions relating to storage and transportation. (3)\n\nRefrigeration or refrigeration service\nmay not be purchased for resale by a vendor of refrigerated storage. (d) Telephony and\ntelegraphy; telephone and telegraph service. (1)\n\nThe provisions of section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law\nwith respect to telephony and telegraphy and telephone and telegraph service\nimpose a tax on receipts from intrastate communication by means of devices\nemploying the principles of telephony and telegraphy. (2)\n\nThe term\ntelephony and\ntelegraphy\nincludes use or operation of any apparatus for transmission\nof sound, sound reproduction or coded or other signals. Example 1: Dispatch services, commonly used by taxicab companies, trucking firms and similar operations, which provide two-way voice\ncommunication between a base location and mobile units or between mobile units\nare considered telephony even though the base and mobile units are not\ninterconnected with a telephone system. Example 2: Paging service which is a one-way transmission of\ncommunication by signal or voice or both signal and voice from a base unit to a\nmobile unit is considered telephony. Example 3: Message switching services, transmitted to a computer over\nlines leased from a communication carrier are telegraph services subject to the\ntax imposed under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. Example 4: Facsimile transmission services are telegraph services\nsubject to the tax imposed under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. Example 5: The use of a teletypewriter is a telegraph service subject\nto tax imposed under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nThe term\ntelephony and telegraphy, as used in this Subchapter, does not\ninclude: (i) cable television service, which\nis the service of receiving and amplifying programs broadcast by television or\nradio stations or any other programs originated by a cable television company\nor by any other party, and distributing such programs by wire, cable, microwave\nor other similar means, whether such means are owned or leased, to persons who\nsubscribe to such service. See\n\nNew York State Cable Television\n\nAssociation v. State Tax Commission, 59 AD 2d 81; (ii)\nmusic service, which is the initiation\nof musical programs, and the distribution of such programs by wire, cable or\nother similar means, whether such means are owned or leased, to persons who\nsubscribe to such service. (4)\nA service is not considered telegraphy or\ntelephony if either of these services is merely an incidental element of a\ndifferent or other service purchased by the customer. Example 6: A company offers its customers a protective service using a\ncentral station alarm system, which transmits signals telegraphically. The\ncustomer is purchasing a protective service. (5)\n\nThe tax on utility services applies to\nevery charge for any telephone and telegraph service. Among these charges are\nmonthly message rate and intrastate toll charges and charges for special\nservices, such as installation, change of location, conference connections, tie-lines, WATS lines and the furnishing of equipment. Example 7: A telephone company installs station apparatus, owned by\nit, on the premises of a customer. The installation is a service taxable under\nsection\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (6)\n\nWhere a customer\nhas telephones at a single location connected to exchanges in different\nlocalities, and a tie-line to a locality in which he is not located, the tax\nrate applicable for each service is the tax rate in effect in the locality to\nwhich the exchange is assigned. Example 8: A business located in Nassau County has two telephone\nnumbers, one with a Nassau exchange and one with a Queens exchange. This\nenables his Queens customers to phone him toll free. Service on the Queens\nexchange is considered to be purchased in Queens County even though the\ntelephone is physically located in Nassau County. (e) Sales for resale. Purchases of utility services by a utility for resale as\nsuch may be made without payment of the sales tax. The purchaser must furnish\nthe supplier of the utility to be resold with a resale certificate (Form\nST-120). When the utility services are resold by the purchaser he must collect\nthe sales tax on the receipts from his sales as imposed under section\n1105 (b)\nof the Tax Law. A\npurchase of a utility service which is not resold is subject to tax as a\npurchase at retail. Example: A utility company purchases excess power from an industrial\norganization or through a power pool for resale to its customers. Such purchase\nmay be made without payment of tax upon the presentation of a properly\ncompleted resale certificate. (f) Computation of receipt. Where a utility company bills a customer and indicates on\nsuch bill the amount for the service and a late payment charge which may be\nimposed because of the failure of the customer to pay such bill within a\nspecified period of time, the sales tax is computed on the amount billed\nwithout consideration of the late payment charge. The late payment charge\nconstitutes a charge for interest and is not part of the sale price of the\nservice rendered. (See section\n526.5\n[h]\nof this Title.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
