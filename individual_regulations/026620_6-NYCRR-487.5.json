  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 487.5 - Determining presence of an environmental justice area\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After defining the impact study area\npursuant to section\n487.4\nof this Part, the applicant\nshall determine whether the impact study area contains one or more EJ\nareas. (b) The applicant, using\nreliable U.S. Census data or other generally accepted and reasonably available\ndemographic data, shall determine if a minority or low-income community, or\nboth, is within the impact study area. If a minority or low-income community is\npresent, then an EJ area is present in the impact study area. If the\ndemographic data are not sufficient or adequate for determining the presence of\na minority or low-income community within an impact study area, the applicant\nmust work with the department, the municipality, and residents of the impact\nstudy area to develop an accurate demographic profile of the impact study area\nusing reasonably available information. (c) If no area meeting the definition of\neither a minority or low-income community is present within the impact study\narea, an EJ area is present if: (1)\na census\nblock group or contiguous area with multiple census block groups has a minority\nor low-income population that is above 75 percent of the stated thresholds for\ndefining a minority or low-income community; and\n(2)\n(i) reasonably available air quality data; and\n(ii)\nhealth outcome data that have been made\navailable to the public statewide at the zip code level, reveals that the\nimpact study area may bear a disproportionate share of the negative\nenvironmental consequences resulting from industrial, municipal, and commercial\noperations or the execution of Federal, State, local, and tribal programs and\npolicies, when compared to the county as a whole, or if the impact study area\nis in the City of New York, when compared to the city as a whole. In the case\nof health outcome data, applicants shall consult with the Department of Health\nabout appropriate comparison areas for specific datasets. (d) If an EJ area is present\nwithin the impact study area, the applicant shall undertake a full EJ analysis\nin compliance with the requirements of section\n487.6\nof this Part. (e) If no EJ area is present within the\nimpact study area, the applicant shall not be required to undertake a full EJ\nanalysis or use the procedures set forth in this Part to evaluate whether the\nproposed facility may result in a significant and adverse disproportionate\nenvironmental impact in the impact study area; however, nothing in this Part\nshall preclude the applicant from using such procedures nevertheless as a means\nto assess the impacts on a community and to facilitate a discussion of\nreasonable measures to avoid or minimize significant adverse impacts identified\nfor that community. (f) The\napplicant shall similarly, pursuant to the requirements of this section, determine if an EJ area is present in the impact study area for any reasonable\nand available alternate locations to the proposed facility identified by the\napplicant. If an EJ area is present in the impact study area, the applicant\nshall undertake a full EJ analysis in compliance with the requirements of\nsection\n487.6\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n487.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
