(6)\n\nCosts that are\nascertainable must not be included in any plan, method or function of cost\nallocation if such inclusion would result in reimbursement greater than that\nwhich would be available if the cost had been charged directly to the activity\nfor which reimbursement is claimed, unless such inclusion is directed by the\ndepartment.

In the event\nthe Federal government imposes a fiscal penalty for incorrect issuance of\nbenefits or improper administration of any program subject to Federal financial\nparticipation, the department will divide and allocate the penalty between the\n\nState and social services districts in a manner calculated to apportion such\npenalty among subject governmental entities in relation to their responsibility\nfor the assessment of such penalty, and will attribute and assess any such\nproportion of such penalty to those governmental entities in accordance with\nsuch calculation. (6)\nclaims for reimbursement submitted by any social services district may result\nin related adjustments to subsequent claims submitted by such district if the\ndepartment determines that such adjustments are appropriate.
