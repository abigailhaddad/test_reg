Necessary charges are\nto be collected on a current basis; only upon termination of tenancy are\ndeductions to be applied against security deposits, with the balance, if any, being refunded to tenant. Security deposits are trust funds under New York\n\nState law, and must be handled in accordance with such law and the requirements\nof Subpart 1642-5 of the accounting manual (Subchapter D of this\n\nChapter).
