  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 §§ 154-2.5 - Routing restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To\nassist F6 Type 6 and 6A, and F2 Type 7 permittees in routing, the department\nwill provide a list of bridges not traversable. However, it is the\nresponsibility of the permittee not to use any \"R\" restricted bridge which may\nbe on the route the vehicle is travelling, respective of whether the bridge is\non the list provided by the department. The section of State highway upon which\na listed bridge is located will not be traversable between the two nearest\nintersecting State highways which encompass that section of highway. However, specific authorization for the use of a portion of any such excluded State\nhighway may be considered by the Department of Transportation. (b) If the excluded section of State highway\nis necessary for obtaining the permittee's destination, then on the permit\napplication, the permittee must state the anticipated route for which the\nauthorization is sought. This anticipated route, shall include, but is not\nlimited to, any detour route, when such detour is necessary, around the bridge\nwhich is not traversable. Reasonable allowance for a deviation on State\nhighways from the anticipated route is permitted, if the deviation is required\nto continue the necessary operation of that vehicle or to obtain that vehicle's\ndestination. Reasonable deviation shall not exceed 1,500 feet from the\nanticipated routing. (c) Local\nrouting. When the anticipated routing under the F6 Type 6 or Type 6A permit\nincludes specific highways not under the jurisdiction of the commissioner, then\nthe county, municipality, or municipalities having jurisdiction over the\nspecified highway must be notified by the applicant. The county, municipality, or municipalities will have at least 15 days to comment on the anticipated\nrouting to the applicant. (d) Bridge restrictions. If a permit holder operates a vehicle or combination of\nvehicles in violation of such routing restrictions, the Type 6, Type 6A or Type\n7 permit shall be void as of the next day. All permits issued to the vehicle in\nquestion shall not be reissued for a period of 12 months. (e) Sanivan vehicles. A sanivan vehicle for\nwhich a permit has been issued pursuant to this Subpart, is authorized to\noperate on public highways in accordance with weight and bridge limitations in\nsuch permit, and with posted temporary or permanent highway or bridge\nrestrictions. Such specific highway or bridge limitations preempt the\nappropriate permit authorizations. (f) Agricultural vehicle. A agricultural\nvehicle for which a permit has been issued pursuant to this Subpart, is\nauthorized to operate on state highways in accordance with any weight\nlimitations specified in such permit and in accordance with posted temporary or\npermanent highway or bridge restrictions. (Note: This permit is only available\nfor F1, F2 and F3 permits.) Such specific highway or bridge limitation preempt\nthe permit authorizations. This permit shall be valid for four continuous\nmonths from date of issuance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
