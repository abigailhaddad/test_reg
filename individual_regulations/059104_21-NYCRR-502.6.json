  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 502.6 - Materials incorporated by reference\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The term low-level radioactive waste is\ndefined in section\n502.2\nof this Part, in part, by\n\nFederal descriptions of Class A, B, or C radioactive waste as set forth in\nsections 61.55 and\n61.56\nof title 10, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect\non January 26, 1983 (\"Federal provisions\"). In summary, the Federal provisions\nare as follows. Of the three classes, Class A is the least and Class C the\ngreatest potential hazard to the public and the environment. Classification is\ndetermined by concentration of long- and short-lived radionuclides. All three\nclasses must meet minimum waste form and packaging characteristics to\nfacilitate handling and worker protection. Class B and C radioactive wastes\nmust also meet stability requirements intended to minimize water infiltration\nand leachability of radionuclides from the waste. Disposal of Class C\nradioactive waste requires measures to protect against inadvertent\nintrusion. (b) The Federal\nprovisions are set forth in subpart D, entitled \"Technical Requirements for\n\nLand Disposal Facilities,\" of Part 61, entitled \"Licensing Requirements for\n\nLand Disposal of Radioactive Waste,\" of the rules of the United States Nuclear\n\nRegulatory Commission, published in the first volume of title 10, entitled\n\"Energy,\" of the Code of Federal Regulations,containing parts 0 to 199, revised\nas of January 1, 1986, on pages 645-647 of such volume.
