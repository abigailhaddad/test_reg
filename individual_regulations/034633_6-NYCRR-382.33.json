  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.33 - Additional criteria for aboveground disposal only\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of sections 382.31 and\n382.32\nof this Part, aboveground\ndisposal methods must meet the requirements of this section. (a) The disposal units must be designed to\nresist inadvertent intrusion. Through a combination of design and a commitment\nto institutional control, waste disposal units intended to contain only Class A\nwastes must resist inadvertent intrusion for a period of 100 years. Disposal\nunits intend to contain Class B wastes (alone or with Class A wastes) must be\ndesigned to resist inadvertent intrusion for a period of 300 years. Disposal\nunits intended to contain any Class C waste must be designed to resist\ninadvertent intrusion for a period of 500 years. (b) The disposal units must maintain their\nstructural stability and containment of the waste under normal environmental\nconditions, such as exposure to solar radiation, wind, precipitation (rain, hail, snow and ice), humidity, temperature variations, freezethaw cycles, and\nthe chemical constituents in precipitation (e.g., acid rain). (c) The disposal units must facilitate any\nnecessary remedial action during the institutional control period. This\nprovision must not adversely affect the ability of the land disposal facility\nto meet the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n382.33\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
