  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 45-2.21 - Electrical safety requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General requirement. All electrical\nwiring, equipment and apparatus used for amusement devices or for lighting\nshall be installed, operated and maintained in compliance with this Part\n(rule), Industrial Code Rule 57 High-Voltage Proximity, and the National Fire\n\nProtection, National Electrical Code, NFPA 70-1999 (NEC-1999). Where there are\nconflicts between these regulations this Part (rule) shall take precident. The\nprovisions of Code Rule 57 shall take precedent over the NEC-1999. Note: The NEC-1999 shall not apply to amusement devices\nmanufactured prior to the effective date of this standard if compliance would\nrequire a major modification of the device. (b) Protection of employees. No employee\nshall be suffered or permitted to work in such proximity to any part of an\nelectric power circuit that he may contact the same in the course of his work\nunless he is protected against shock by de-energizing the circuit, grounding\nit, or guarding it by effective insulation. If protection is supplied by\nde-energizing the circuit, the switch controlling the circuit shall be locked\nout to prevent inadvertent closing. (c) High voltage lines. The outlets of\nelectric power lines carrying more than 120 volts shall be clearly marked to\nshow their voltage. (d) Transformers. All electrical transformer substations shall be properly enclosed\nand proper warning signs shall be posted. (e) Outdoor apparatus and wiring. Electrical\napparatus and wiring located outdoors shall be of such quality and so\nconstructed or protected that exposure to weather will not interfere with its\nnormal operation. (f) Elevated\nlines. Elevated power lines crossing access or other roads within the grounds\nof a carnival, fair or amusement park shall be so suspended as to provide\nminimum vertical clearance of 12 feet from the road surface and minimum\nhorizontal clearance of three feet on each side of the normal passage space of\nvehicles. (g) Suspended electric\nwiring. Temporary electric wiring, if suspended, shall be so supported that its\nprotective insulation will not be damaged. (h) Grounding. Temporary electric\ninstallations shall be properly grounded. (i) Exposed conductors. Bare wires and other\nuninsulated current-carrying parts shall be guarded against inadvertent contact\nby means of proper location or by a fence or other barrier. (j) Overcurrent protection. Conductors shall\nbe provided with overcurrent protective devices according to load. No such\ndevice shall be installed in neutral or grounding conductors. (k) Generator grounding. Where electrical\npower is supplied for an amusement device or a temporary structure by a\nprivately operated generating system, the generator and all equipment shall be\ngrounded as required by NEC-1999. (l) Receptacles and caps. All receptacles and\nattachment caps shall be of the grounding type. (m) Grounding of devices. Each electrically\npowered amusement device shall be effectively grounded. The grounding shall be\nmade effective as to all noncurrent-carrying metal parts which may become\nenergized and which are exposed to contact by any person. An effective ground\nshall be one having a resistance of 25 ohms or less. (n) Abrasion protection. Wiring laid on\nsurfaces traversed by vehicular or pedestrian traffic shall be adequately\nprotected against wear and abrasion. (o) Master switch. Each electrically operated\namusement device not designed to be controlled directly by the passenger shall\nbe provided with a disconnect power switch placed within easy reach of the\noperator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n45-2.21\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
