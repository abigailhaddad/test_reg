(b) Adjacent area means those areas of land\nor water that are outside a wetland and within 100 feet (approximately 30\nmeters), measured horizontally, of the boundary of the wetland. However, the\ndepartment may establish an adjacent area broader than 100 feet (approximately\n30 meters) where necessary to protect and preserve a wetland, as set forth in\nsubdivision 24-0701.2 of the act and pursuant to section\n664.7\nof this Title. A local\ngovernment may also extend a wetland adjacent area in its jurisdiction where\nnecessary to protect and preserve the wetland. Such an extension shall not\nbecome effective until the local government has provided the opportunity for\npublic notice and hearing. The local government shall provide a minimum of 30\ndays' notice to the public, affected landowners, easement owners and the\ndepartment of proposed extensions. (c) Agricultural activity means: (1)\nthe activity of an individual farmer or\nother landowner in: (i) grazing and watering\nlivestock; (ii)\nmaking reasonable\nuse of water resources for agricultural purposes; (iii)\nharvesting the natural products of\nwetlands; (iv)\nthe selective\ncutting of trees; (v) the\nclear-cutting of vegetation, other than trees, for growing agricultural\nproducts; (vi)\nconstructing winter\ntruck roads of less than five meters (approximately 16 feet) in width for\nremoving timber cut in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, where construction is limited to cutting vegetation and compacting ice and does\nnot alter water flows; (vii)\noperating motor vehicles for agricultural purposes; (viii)\ndraining for growing agricultural\nproducts; (ix)\nerecting structures, including fences, required to enhance or maintain the agricultural productivity\nof the land; (x) using chemicals\nand fertilizers according to normally accepted agricultural practices, in order\nto grow crops for human and animal consumption or use, in or adjacent to\nwetlands, where authorized by other State, Federal or local laws; including\napplication of stabilized sludge as fertilizer when applied at agronomic\nloading rates in accordance with a valid 6 NYCRR Part\n360\nor Part 364\nlandspreading permit; or\n(xi)\notherwide engaging in the use of wetlands for growing agricultural products\nsuch as crops, vegetables, fruits or flowers; but\n(2)\ndoes not mean: (i) clear-cutting trees; (ii)\nconstructing roads that require moving\nearth or other aggregate or that alters water flow or in any way deviates from\nsubparagraph (1)(vi) of this subdivision; (iii)\nfilling or deposition of spoil, even\nfor agricultural purposes; (iv)\nmining; or\n(v) erecting structures\nnot required to enhance or maintain the agricultural productivity of the\nland. (d) Applicant means a person who files an application for a permit under a local\nlaw or ordinance and who is either the owner of the land on which the proposed\nregulated activity would be located, a contract vendee, a lessee of the land, the person who would actually control and direct the proposed activity, or the\nauthorized agent of such person. (e) Aquiculture means cultivating and\nharvesting products, including fish and vegetation, that are produced naturally\nin freshwater wetlands, and installing cribs, racks and other in-water\nstructures for cultivating these products; but does not include filling, dredging, peat mining, or the construction of any buildings or any\nwater-regulating structures such as dams. (f) Boundary of a wetland means the outer\nlimit of the vegetation specified in paragraphs 24-0107.1 (a) and (b) of the\nact and of the lands and waters specified in paragraphs 24-0107.1(c) and (d) of\nthe act. (g) Classic kettlehole bog\nmeans a wetland that is at least 75 meters (approximately 246 feet) in diameter\nwithin a closed drainage basin, having a minimal or no surface inlet or outlet. It has complete or virtually complete concentric zones of differing vegetative\ncovertypes. The innermost zone of the bog is open water that is of pH 5.00 or\nlower and is typically anoxyous and dark brown. Surrounding this is a floating\nmat of sphagnum mosses, liverwort, and shrubby heath plants; this mat is\nsurrounded in turn by coniferous swamp above deep deposits primarily of partly\ndecayed sphagnum mosses. (h) Classification means the designation placed upon a mapped wetland by the\ndepartment pursuant to a classification system promulgated in Part 664 of this\n\nTitle. That system establishes four separate classes that rank wetlands\naccording to their ability to perform wetland functions and provide wetland\nbenefits, as required by section 24-0903 of the act. Upon the adoption of an\nofficial map, these classifications are the basis for freshwater wetlands\nregulation regardless of the governmental entity asserting jurisdiction\npursuant to the act. (i) Clear-cutting means any cutting of trees over six inches in diameter at breast\nheight over any 10-year cutting cycle where the average residual basal area of\nsuch trees after such cutting is less than 30 square feet per acre, measured\nwithin the area harvested; provided, however, that where regeneration is\nassured by stand conditions such that after such cutting, the average residual\nbasal area of trees at least one inch in diameter at breast height is at least\n30 square feet per acre, measured within the area harvested, a clearcut will\nnot be deemed to have taken place unless the average residual basal area of\ntrees over six inches in diameter at breast height is less than 10 square feet\nper acre, similarly measured. (j) Commercial use facility means any facility or building larger than 20 square\nmeters (approximately 215 square feet) used for retail, wholesale or rental\npurposes, including storage, sale of goods or services, tourist accommodations, or provisions of recreational facilities for a fee.

(n) Filling means depositing any soil, stones, sand, gravel, mud, rubbish or fill of any kind. (o) Freshwater wetlands or wetlands means\nlands and waters of the State that meet the definition provided in subdivision\n24-0107.1 of the act and have an area of at least 12.4 acres (approximately 5\nhectares) or, if smaller, have unusual local importance as determined by the\ncommissioner pursuant to subdivision 24-0301.1 of the act. (p) Industrial use facility means any\nbuilding or facility associated with the manufacturing, production, processing, or assembly of goods or materials or the production of power. (q) Letter of permission means a written\nnotification by a local government to a person, issued in response to a written\nrequest to conduct an activity in a wetland or its adjacent area, indicating\nthat the proposed activity meets the description and standards identified in\nthe minimum land-use regulations for that activity.

(r) Local government\nmeans a village, town, city or county. (s) Map means an official freshwater wetlands\nmap promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to subdivision 24-0301.5 of the\nact, or such a map that has been amended or adjusted pursuant to section\n664.7\nof this Title, on which are\nindicated the approximate location of the actual boundaries of regulated\nwetlands.

These activities\nare subject to regulation whether or not they occur upon the wetland itself, if\nthey impinge upon or otherwise substantially affect the wetland and are located\nwithin the adjacent area. (1)\n\nThe depositing\nor removal of the natural products of freshwater wetlands by recreational or\ncommercial fishing, shellfishing, aquiculture, hunting or trapping are not\nregulated under the act or this Part. (2)\n\nAgricultural activities, as defined in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, are not regulated under the act or this Part. However, land altered by an agricultural activity after its original\ndesignation as a wetland upon an official map is still protected under the act, this Part, and other appropriate Parts pursuant to the act, so thay any other\nactivities on that land subsequent to the original designation are subject to\nthe provisions of this Part. (3)\n\nPublic health activities, orders and regulations of the New York State\n\nDepartment of Health are not regulated under the act or this Part, provided\ncopies of all such orders or regulations affecting wetlands are filed with the\n\nDepartment of Environmental Conservation in advance. (y) Selective cutting of timber means any\ncutting of trees within the boundaries of a freshwater wetland which is not\n\"clear-cutting\" as defined in subdivision (i) of this section, or which results\nin a cut area less than three acres in size. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n665.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
