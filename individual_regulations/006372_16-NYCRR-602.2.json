  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 602.2 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs indicated by their wording, a number of regulations in\nthis Part prescribe the normal procedures and practices to be directed in good\nfaith by the service provider. However, the regulations in this Part are not\nintended to govern the implementation of such procedures in individual\ninstances. The execution or non-execution of such procedures and practices in\nindividual instances is not the sole indicator of whether the service provider\nhas provided adequate service to a particular consumer or group of\nconsumers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n602.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
