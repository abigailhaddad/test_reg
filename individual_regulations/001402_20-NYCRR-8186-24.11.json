  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-24.11 - Corrections to the survey data\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen an error specified in this section is discovered prior\nto the completion of the survey, it shall be corrected as provided\nherein. (a) Where a parcel, or part of\na parcel, that should have been excluded from the classified roll was\nerroneously included on the classified roll, the parcel, or part of a parcel, shall be removed from the interval to which it was assigned upon the written\napproval of ORPTS. In the event that the number of required sampled parcels for\nthe interval is greater than the number of remaining parcels in the interval, the number of sampled parcels shall be set equal to the number of parcels\nremaining in the interval. (b) If\ntwo contiguous parcels on the base year roll belonging to the same owner have\nboth been selected as sample parcels, and it appears from the property record\ncard, field book, or other final work product of the assessor that there has\nbeen a transposition of assessed values or roll identification for the two\nparcels, and the assessor confirms in writing that such transposition has\noccurred, the following procedure is to be followed: (1)\n\nIf neither parcel is a large unit, substitute appraisals shall be used. (2)\n\nIf either of the parcels is a large unit, the assessed values and inventory quantities on the base year roll shall be\ntransposed but the roll identification maintained. (c) Where, through a clerical error by ORPTS, a parcel is included on the classified roll with an incorrect total assessed\nvalue, incorrect major type code or incorrect survey unit code, the following\nprocedure is to be followed using the corrected parcel data: (1)\n\nIf the parcel is a sample parcel and has\nbeen appraised, the parcel shall be a designated sample parcel and placed in an\ninterval containing only itself and remain in the sample. In the event that the\nnumber of required sample parcels for the original interval is greater than the\nnumber of parcels remaining in the original interval, the number of sample\nparcels shall be set equal to the number of parcels remaining in the original\ninterval. (2)\n\nIf the parcel is not\na sample parcel, the parcel shall be a designated unsampled parcel and placed\nin an interval containing only itself and remain unsampled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n8186-24.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
