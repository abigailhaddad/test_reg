  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.181 - Distribution line valves\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nhigh pressure distribution system must have valves spaced so as to reduce the\ntime to shut down a section of main in an emergency. The valve spacing is\ndetermined by the operating pressure, the size of the mains, and the local\nphysical conditions as well as the number and type of consumers that might be\naffected by a shutdown. (b) Each\nregulator station controlling the flow or pressure of gas in a distribution\nsystem must have a valve installed on the inlet piping at a distance from the\nregulator station sufficient to permit the operation of the valve during an\nemergency. (1)\n\nSuch distance must be at least\n50 feet (15.2 meters) but no more than 1,000 feet (304.8 meters) from the\nregulator. (2)\n\nUnder unique\ncircumstances which make it impractical to locate the valve at least 50 feet\n(15.2 meters) from the regulator, a lesser, approved spacing may be\nused. (c) Except for\nsingle feed systems, regulator stations reducing the pressure from pounds to\npounds must also have an emergency valve installed on the station's outlet\npiping in compliance with paragraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section. (d) Each valve on a main installed for\noperating or emergency purposes must: (1)\nbe\nplaced in a readily accessible location so as to facilitate its operation in an\nemergency; (2)\nhave an operating\nstem or mechanism that is readily accessible; and\n(3)\nif the valve is installed in a buried box\nor enclosure, be installed so as to avoid transmitting external loads to the\nmain. (e) Each station\nbypass valve or valve that separates systems operating at different pressures\nmust be identified to prevent unauthorized or inadvertent operation, or be\nequipped with a device designed to prevent unauthorized operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.181\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
