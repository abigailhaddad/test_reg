  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 318.10 - Prescribed treatment of pork and products containing pork to destroy trichinae\n\nState Regulations\n\nAgriculture and Markets Law, § 96-z-34\n(a) All forms of fresh pork, including fresh\nunsmoked sausage containing pork muscle tissue, and pork such as bacon and\njowls, other than those covered by subdivision (b) of this section, are classed\nas products that are customarily well cooked in the home or elsewhere before\nbeing served to the consumer. Therefore, the treatment of such products for the\ndestruction of trichinae is not required. (b) Products named in this subdivision and\nproducts of the character thereof, containing pork muscle tissue (not including\nport hearts, pork stomachs, and pork livers), or the pork muscle tissue which\nforms an ingredient of such products, shall be effectively heated, refrigerated, or cured to destroy any possible live trichinae, as prescribed in\nthis section at the official establishment where such products are prepared: bologna, frankfurter, vienna, and other cooked sausage; smoked sausage; knoblauch sausage; mortadella; all forms of summer or dried sausage, including\nmettwurst; flavored pork sausages such as those containing wine or similar\nflavoring materials; cured pork sausage; sausage containing cured and/or smoked\npork; cooked loaves; roasted, baked, boiled, or cooked hams, pork shoulders, or\npork shoulder picnics; Italian-style hams; Westphalia-sytle hams; smoked\nboneles pork shoulder butts; cured meat rolls; capocollo (capicola, capacola); coppa; fresh or cured boneless pork shoulder butts, hams, loins, shoulders, shoulder picnics, and similar pork cuts, in casings or other containers in\nwhich ready-to-eat delicatessen articles are customarily enclosed (excepting\n\nScotch-style hams); breaded pork products; cured boneless pork loins; boneless\nback bacon; bacon used for wrapping around patties, steaks and similar\nproducts; and smoked pork cuts such as hams, shoulders, loins, and pork\nshoulder picnics (excepting smoked hams, and smoked pork shoulder picnics which\nare specially prepared for distribution in tropical climates or smoked hams\ndelivered to the Armed Services); ground meat mixtures containing pork and\nbeef, veal, lamb, mutton, or goat meat and other product consisting of mixtures\nof pork and other ingredients, which the commissioner determines at the time\nthe labeling for the product is submitted for approval in accordance with Part\n317 of this Article, or upon subsequent reevaluation of the product, would be\nprepared in such a manner that the product might be eaten rare or without\nthorough cooking because of the appearance of the finished product or\notherwise. Cured boneless pork loins shall be subjected to prescribed treatment\nfor destruction of trichinae prior to being shipped from the establishment\nwhere cured. (c) The treatment\nshall consist of heating, refrigerating, or curing, as follows: (1)\n\nHeating. (i) All parts of the pork muscle tissue shall\nbe heated to a temperature not lower than 137 degrees Fahrenheit, and the\nmethod used shall be one known to insure such a result. On account of\ndifferences in methods of heating and in weights of products undergoing\ntreatment it is impracticable to specify details of procedures for all\ncases. (ii)\n\nProcedures which insure\nthe proper heating of all parts of the product shall be adopted. It is\nimportant that each piece of sausage, each ham, and other product treated by\nheating in water be kept entirely submerged throughout the heating period; and\nthat the largest pieces in a lot, the innermost links of bunched sausage or\nother massed articles, and pieces placed in the coolest part of a heating\ncabinet or compartment or vat be included in the temperature tests. (2)\n\nRefrigerating. At any stage of preparation and after preparatory\nchilling to a temperature of not above 40 degrees Fahrenheit or preparatory\nfreezing, all parts of the muscle tissue of pork or product containing such\ntissue shall be subjected continuously to a temperature not higher than one of\nthose specified in Table 1, the duration of such refrigeration at the specified\ntemperature being dependent on the thickness of the meat or inside dimensions\nof the container. TABLE 1\nREQUIRED PERIOD OF FREEZING AT TEMPERATURE\nINDICATED\nTemperature\n\nGroup 1\n\nGroup 2\n°F\nDays\n\nDays\n5\n20\n30\n-10\n10\n20\n-20\n6\n12\n(i) Group 1\ncomprises product in separate pieces not exceeding six inches in thickness, or\narranged on separate racks with the layers not exceeding six inches in depth, or stored in crates or boxes not exceeding six inches in depth, or stored as\nsolidly frozen blocks not exceeding six inches in thickness. (ii)\n\nGroup 2 comprises product in pieces, layers, or within containers, the thickness of which exceeds six inches but not\n27 inches, and product in containers including tierces, barrels, kegs and\ncartons having a thickness not exceeding 27 inches. (iii)\n\nThe product undergoing such\nrefrigeration or the containers thereof shall be so spaced while in the freezer\nas will insure a free circulation of air between the pieces of meat, layers, blocks, boxes, barrels and tierces in order that the temperature of the meat\nthroughout will be promptly reduced to not higher than 5 degrees Fahrenheit, -10 degrees Fahrenheit, or -20 degrees Fahrenheit, as the case may\nbe. (iv)\n\nIn lieu of the methods\nprescribed in Table 1, the treatment may consist of refrigeration to a\ntemperature of -30 degrees Fahrenheit in the center of the pieces of meat or\ncommercial freeze drying. (v) During the period of refrigeration the product shall be kept separate from\nother products and in the custody of the department in rooms or compartments\nequipped and made secure with an official department lock or seal. The rooms or\ncompartments containing product undergoing freezing shall be equipped with\naccurate thermometers placed at or above the highest level at which the product\nundergoing treatment is stored and away from refrigerating coils. After\ncompletion of the prescribed freezing of pork to be used in the preparation of\nproduct covered by subdivision (b) of this section the pork shall be kept under\nclose supervision of an inspector until it is prepared in finished form as one\nof the products enumerated in subdivision (b) of this section, or until it is\ntransferred under department control to another official establishment for\npreparation in such finished form. (vi)\n\nPork which has been refrigerated as\nspecified in this paragraph may be transferred in sealed railroad cars, sealed\nmotor trucks, sealed trailers, or sealed closed containers to another official\nestablishment at the same or another location, for use in the preparation of\nproduct covered by subdivision (b) of this section. The sealing of closed\ncontainers, such as boxes and slack barrels, shall be effected by cording and\naffixing thereto official department seals, and such containers as tierces and\nkegs shall be held in department custody by sealing with wax impressed with an\nofficial department metal brand. Railroad cars, motortrucks, and trailers used\nto transport such pork shall be sealed with official department car seals\nexcept that sealed and marked closed containers may be shipped in unsealed\nrailroad cars, motortrucks, and trailers. Shipping containers such as boxes, barrels, and tierces, containing pork refrigerated in accordance with this\nsection, shall be plainly and conspicuously marked with a label or stencil\nfurnished by the establishment, as follows: \"Pork product __ degrees Fahrenheit\n__ days' refrigeration\", indicating the temperature at which the product was\nrefrigerated and the length of time so treated. For each consignment there\nshall be promptly issued and forwarded by the inspector to the officer in\ncharge at destination a report on the appropriate form showing the character of\nthe containers, and that the contents as \"Pork product __ degrees Fahrenheit\n__days' refrigeration\". A duplicate copy shall be retained in the circuit\nfile. (3)\n\nCuring. (i) Sausage. The sausage may\nbe stuffed in animal casings, hydrocellulose casings, or cloth bags. During any\nstage of treating the sausage for the destruction of live trichinae, except as\nprovided in method 5, these coverings shall not be coated with paraffin or like\nsubstance, nor shall any sausage be washed during any prescribed period of\ndrying. In the preparation of sausage, one of the following methods may be\nused: (a) Method no. 1. The\nmeat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an\ninch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than three and\none-third pounds of salt to each hundred-weight of the unstuffed sausage shall\nbe thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, sausage having a diameter not exceeding three and one-half inches, measured at\nthe time of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room not less than 20 days at a\ntemperature not lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit, except that in sausage of the\nvariety known as pepperoni, if in casings not exceeding one and three-eighths\ninches in diameter measured at the time of stuffing, the period of drying may\nbe reduced to 15 days. In no case, however, shall the sausage be released from\nthe drying room in less than 25 days from the time the curing materials are\nadded, except that sausage of the variety knowns as pepperoni, if in casings\nnot exceeding the size specified, may be released at the expiration of 20 days\nfrom the time the curing materials are added. Sausage in casings exceeding\nthree and one-half inches, but not exceeding four inches, in diameter at the\ntime of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room not less than 35 days at a\ntemperature not lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit, and in no case shall the\nsausage be released from the drying room in less than 40 days from the time the\ncuring materials are added to the meat. (b) Method no. 2. The meat\nshall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch\nin diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than three and one-third\npounds of salt to each hundred-weight of the unstuffed sausage shall be\nthoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, sausage\nhaving a diameter not exceeding three and one-half inches, measured at the time\nof stuffing, shall be smoked not less than 40 hours at a temperature not lower\nthan 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and finally held in a drying room not less than 10\ndays at a temperature not lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit. In no case, however, shall the sausage be released from the drying room in less than 18\ndays from the time the curing materials are added to the meat. Sausage\nexceeding three and one-half inches, but not exceeding four inches, in diameter\nat the time of stuffing, shall be held in a drying room, following smoking as\nabove indicated, not less than 25 days at a temperature not lower than 45\ndegrees Fahrenheit, but in no case shall the sausage be released from the\ndrying room in less than 33 days from the time the curing materials are added\nto the meat. (c) Method no. 3. The meat shall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding\nthree-fourths of an inch in diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less\nthan three and one-third pounds of salt to each hundred-weight of the unstuffed\nsausage shall be thoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After\nadmixture with salt and other curing materials and before stuffing, the ground\nor chopped meat shall be held at a temperature not lower than 34 degrees\n\nFahrenheit for not less than 36 hours. After being stuffed, the sausage shall\nbe held at a temperature not lower than 34 degrees Fahrenheit for an additional\nperiod of time sufficient to make a total of not less than 144 hours from the\ntime the curing materials are added to the meat, or the sausage shall be held\nfor the time specified in a pickle-curing medium of not less than 50 degrees\nstrength (salometer reading) at a temperature not lower than 44 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. Finally, sausage having a diameter not exceeding three and one-half\ninches, measured at the time of stuffing, shall be smoked for not less than 12\nhours. The temperature of the smokehouse during this period at no time shall be\nlower than 90 degrees Fahrenheit; and for four consecutive hours of this period\nthe smokehouse shall be maintained at a temperature not lower than 128 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. Sausage exceeding three and one-half inches, but not exceeding four\ninches, in diameter at the time of stuffing shall be smoked, following the\nprescribed curing, for not less than 15 hours. The temperature of the\nsmokehouse during the 15-hour period shall at no time be lower than 90 degrees\n\nFahrenheit, and for seven consecutive hours of this period the smokehouse shall\nbe maintained at a temperature not lower than 128 degrees Fahrenheit. In\nregulating the temperature of the smokehouse for the treatment of sausage under\nthis method, the temperature of 128 degrees Fahrenheit shall be attained\ngradually during a period of not less than four hours. (d) Method no. 4. The meat\nshall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding one-fourth of an inch in\ndiameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than two and one-half pounds\nof salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be thoroughly\nmixed with the ground or chopped meat. After admixture with the salt and other\ncuring materials and before stuffing, the ground or chopped sausage shall be\nheld as a compact mass, not more than six inches in depth, at a temperature not\nlower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit for not less than 10 days. At the termination\nof the holding period, the sausage shall be stuffed in casings or cloth bags\nnot exceeding three and one-third inches in diameter, measured at the time of\nstuffing. After being stuffed, the sausage shall be held in a drying room at a\ntemperature not lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit for the remainder of a 35-day\nperiod, measured from the time the curing materials are added to the meat. At\nany time after stuffing, if the establishment operator deems it desirable, the\nproduct may be heated in a water bath for a period not to exceed three hours at\na temperature not lower than 85 degrees Fahrenheit, or subjected to smoking at\na temperature not lower than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, or the product may be both\nheated and smoked as specified. The time consumed in heating and smoking, however, shall be in addition to the 35-day holding period. (e) Method no. 5. The meat\nshall be ground or chopped into pieces not exceeding three-fourths of an inch\nin diameter. A dry-curing mixture containing not less than three and one-third\npounds of salt to each hundredweight of the unstuffed sausage shall be\nthoroughly mixed with the ground or chopped meat. After being stuffed, the\nsausage shall be held for not less than 65 days at a temperature not lower than\n45 degrees Fahrenheit. The coverings for sausage prepared according to this\nmethod may be coated at any stage of the preparation before or during the\nholding period with paraffin or other substance approved by the\ncommissioner. (ii)\n\nCapocollo (capicola, capacola). Boneless pork butts for\ncapocollo shall be cured in a dry-curing mixture containing not less than four\nand one-half pounds of salt per hundredweight of meat for a period of not less\nthan 25 days at a temperature not lower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit. If the\ncuring materials are applied to the butts by the process known as churning, a\nsmall quantity of pickle may be added. During the curing period the butts may\nbe overhauled according to any of the usual processes of overhauling, including\nthe addition of pickle or dry salt if desired. The butts shall not be subjected\nduring or after curing to any treatment designed to remove salt from the meat, except that superficial washing may be allowed. After being stuffed, the\nproduct shall be smoked for a period of not less than 30 hours at a temperature\nnot lower than 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and shall finally be held in a drying\nroom not less than 20 days at a temperature not lower than 45 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. (iii)\n\nCoppa. Boneless pork butts for coppa shall be cured in a\ndry-curing mixture containing not less than four and one-half pounds of salt\nper hundredweight of meat for a period of not less than 18 days at a\ntemperature not lower than 36 degree Fahrenheit. If the curing mixture is\napplied to the butts by the process known as churning, a small quantity of\npickle may be added. During the curing period the butts may be overhauled\naccording to any of the usual processes of overhauling, including the addition\nof pickle or dry salt if desired. The butts shall not be subjected during or\nafter curing to any treatment designed to remove salt from the meat, except\nthat superficial washing may be allowed. After being stuffed, the product shall\nbe held in a drying room not less than 35 days at a temperature not lower than\n45 degrees Fahrenheit. (iv)\n\nHams and pork shoulder picnics. In the curing of hams and pork\nshoulder picnics either of the following methods may be used: (a) Method no. 1. The hams\nand pork shoulder picnics shall be cured by a dry-salt curing process not less\nthan 40 days at a temperature not lower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The\nproducts shall be laid down in salt, not less than four pounds to each\nhundredweight of product, the salt being applied in a thorough manner to the\nlean meat of each item. When placed in cure the products may be pumped with\npickle if desired. At least once during the curing process the products shall\nbe overhauled and additional salt applied, if necessary, so that the lean meat\nof each item is thoroughly covered. After removal from cure the products may be\nsoaked in water at a temperature not higher than 70 degrees Fahrenheit for not\nmore than 15 hours, during which time the water may be changed once; but they\nshall not be subjected to any other treatment designed to remove salt from the\nmeat, except that superficial washing may be allowed. The products shall\nfinally be dried or smoked not less than 10 days at a temperature not lower\nthan 95 degrees Fahrenheit. (b) Method no. 2. The products shall be cured by a dry-salt curing\nprocess at a temperature not lower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit for a period of\nnot less than three days for each pound of weight (green) of the individual\nitems. The time of cure of each lot of such products placed in cure shall be\ncalculated on a basis of the weight of the heaviest item of the lot. Products\ncured by this method, before they are placed in cure, shall be pumped with\npickle solution of not less than 100 degrees strength (salometer), about four\nounces of the solution being injected into the shank and a like quantity along\nthe flank side of the body bone (femur). The products shall be laid down in\nsalt, not less than four pounds of salt to each hundredweight of product, the\nsalt being applied in a thorough manner to the lean meat of each item. At least\nonce during the curing process the products shall be overhauled and additional\nsalt applied, if necessary, so that the lean meat of each item is thoroughly\ncovered. After removal from the cure the product may be soaked in water at a\ntemperature not higher than 70 degrees Fahrenheit for not more than four hours, but shall not be subjected to any other treatment designed to remove salt from\nthe meat, except that superficial washing may be allowed. The products shall\nthen be dried or smoked not less than 48 hours at a temperature not lower than\n80 degrees Fahrenheit, and finally shall be held in a drying room not less than\n20 days at a temperature not lower than 45 degrees Fahrenheit. (v) Boneless pork loins\nand loin ends. In lieu of heating or refrigerating to destroy possible\nlive trichinae in boneless loins, the loins may be cured for a period of not\nless than 25 days at a temperature not lower than 36 degrees Fahrenheit by the\nuse of one of the following methods: (a) Method no. 1. Application of a dry-salt curing mixture\ncontaining not less than five pounds of salt to each hundredweight of\nmeats. (b) Method no. 2. Application of a pickle solution of not less than 80 degrees\nstrength (salometer) on the basis of not less than 60 pounds of pickle to each\nhundredweight of meat. (c) Method no. 3. Application of a pickle solution added to the\ndry-salt cure prescribed as Method no. 1 in this subparagraph (v) provided the\npickle solution is not less than 80 degrees strength (salometer). After removal from cure, the loins may be soaked in water\nfor not more than one hour at a temperature not higher than 70 degrees\n\nFahrenheit or washed under a spray but shall not be subjected, during or after\nthe curing process, to any other treatment designed to remove salt. Following\ncuring, the loins shall be smoked for not less than 12 hours. The minimum\ntemperature of the smokehouse during this period at no time shall be lower than\n100 degrees Fahrenheit, and for four consecutive hours of this period the\nsmokehouse shall be maintained at a temperature not lower than 125 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. Finally, the product shall be held in a drying room for a period of\nnot less than 12 days at a temperature not lower than 45 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. (d) General instructions. When necessary to comply with the requirements of this\nsection, the smokehouses, drying rooms, and other compartments used in the\ntreatment of pork to destroy possible live trichinae shall be suitably\nequipped, by the operator of the official establishment, with accurate\nautomatic recording thermometers. Officers in charge are authorized to approve\nfor use in sausage smokehouses, drying rooms, and other compartments, such\nautomatic recording thermometers as are found to give satisfactory service and\nto disapprove and require discontinuance of use, for purposes of the\nregulations in this Article, any thermometers (including any automatic\nrecording thermometers) of the establishment that are found to be inaccurate or\nunreliable.
