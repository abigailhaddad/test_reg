(ii)\n\nApplicable freshwater stream quality\nobjectives for the protection of aquatic life are presented in Table 5 (section\n860.30\n(c)(11). (iii)\n\nApplicable freshwater stream quality\nobjectives for the protection of human health are presented in Tables 6 and 7\n(section\n860.30\n(c)(11). (d) Effluent quality\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAll discharges shall meet\nthe effluent quality requirements of this Part. (2)\nthe carbonaceous oxygen demand from all\noutfalls in the zone (exclusive of storm water bypass) shall not exceed that\nassigned by commission regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n860.29\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
