  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 318.11 - Canning with heat processing and hermetically sealed containers; cleaning containers; closure; code marking; heat processing; incubation\n\nState Regulations\n\nAgriculture and Markets Law, § 96-z-34\n(a) Containers which are intended to be\nhermetically sealed shall be cleaned thoroughly immediately before filling, and\nprecaution must be taken to avoid soiling the inner surfaces subsequently. However, cans in which lard is to be hermetically sealed may be examined\nimmediately before filling and if found to be acceptably clean by a department\nemployee need not be washed. (b) Containers of metal, glass, or other material shall be washed in an inverted\nposition with a water spray. The nozzle on the spray attachment shall be of\nsuch design and the water delivered with such pressure as will effectively\nrinse all of the inner surface of each container. Such containers shall not\ncontain an accumulation of water when received at the filling station. In lieu\nof cleaning with water, the use of efficient jet-vacuum type equipment for\ncleaning containers is permitted, immediately prior to filling. (c) Nothing less than perfect closure is\nacceptable for hermetically sealed containers. Heat processing shall follow\npromptly after closing. (d) Careful\ninspection shall be made of the containers by competent establishment employees\nimmediately after closing, and containers which are defectively filled or\ndefectively closed or show inadequate vacuum shall not be processed until the\ndefect has been corrected. The containers shall again be inspected by\nestablishment employees when they have cooled sufficiently for handling after\nprocessing by heating. The contents of defective containers shall be condemned\nunless correction of the defect is accomplished within six hours following the\nsealing of the containers or completion of the heat processing, as the case may\nbe, except that: (1)\nif the defective\ncondition is discovered during an afternoon run, the cans of product may be\nheld in coolers at a temperature not exceeding 38 degrees Fahrenheit under\nconditions that will promptly and effectively chill them until the following\nday when the defect may be corrected; (2)\nshort vacuum or overstuffed cans of\nproduct which have not been handled in accordance with paragraph (1) may be\nincubated under department supervision, after which the cans shall be opened\nand the sound product passed for food; and\n(3)\nshort vacuum or overstuffed cans of\nproduct of a class required to be labeled \"Perishable, Keep Under\n\nRefrigeration\" and which have been kept under adequate refrigeration since\nprocessing may be opened and the sound product passed for food. (e) Canned products shall not be\npassed unless after cooling to atmospheric temperature, they show the external\ncharacteristics of sound cans, that is, the cans shall not be overfilled; they\nshall have concave sides, excepting the seam side, and all ends shall be\nconcave; there shall be no bulging; the sides and ends shall conform to the\nproduct; and there shall be no slack or loose tin. (f) All canned products shall be plainly and\npermanently marked on the containers by code or otherwise with the identity of\nthe contents and date of canning. The code used and its meaning shall be on\nrecord in the office of the inspector in charge. If calendar dating is used, it\nmust be accompanied by an explanatory statement, as provided in section\n317.8\n(b)(32)(ii)\nof this Article. (g) Canned product\nmust be processed at such temperature and for such period of time as will\nassure keeping without refrigeration under usual conditions of storage and\ntransportation when heating is relied on for preservation, with the exception\nof those canned product which are processed without steam-pressure cooking by\npermission of the commissioner in specific cases and labeled \"Perishable, Keep\n\nUnder Refrigeration\". (h) Lots of\ncanned product shall be identified during their handling preparatory to heat\nprocessing by tagging the baskets, cages, or cans with a tag which will change\ncolor on going through the heat processing or by other effective means so as to\npositively preclude failure to heat process after closing. (i) Facilities shall be provided by the\noperator of the official establishment for incubation of representative samples\nof fully processed canned product. The incubation shall consist of holding the\ncanned product for the periods of time and at the temperatures prescribed in\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nIncubation test shall be made to the extent required by the officer in charge. The extent to which incubation tests shall be required depends on conditions\nsuch as the record of the official establishment in conducting canning\noperations, the extent to which the establishment furnishes competent\nsupervision and inspection in connection with the canning operations, the\ncharacter of the equipment used, and the degree to which such equipment is\nmaintained at maximum efficiency. Such factors shall be considered by the\nofficer in charge in determining the extent of incubation testing at a\nparticular establishment. (2)\n\nIn\nthe event of failure by an official establishment to provide suitable\nfacilities for incubation of test samples, the officer in charge may require\nholding of the entire lot under such conditions and for such period of time as\nmay, in his discretion, be necessary to establish the stability of the\nproduct. (3)\n\nThe officer in charge\nmay permit lots of canned product to be shipped from the official establishment\nprior to completion of sample incubation when he has no reason to suspect\nunsoundness in the particular lots, and under circumstances which will assure\nthe return of the product to the establishment for reinspection should such\naction be indicated by the incubation results. (4)\n\nIncubation shall consist of holding the\nsamples at 95 degrees (±2° F.) for no less than 10 days; except\n(i) Samples of firmly packed products such as\nluncheon meat, and products with high fat content, such as chorizos packed in\nlard, and products weighing three pounds or more shall be held at 95 degrees\n(±2° F.) for no less than 20 days. (ii)\n\nSamples of products composed of chunks\nor patties of meat in a medium or sauce wherein the pH of the meat component\nand the medium or sauce are significantly different shall be incubated at 95\ndegrees (±2° F.) for no less than 30 days.
