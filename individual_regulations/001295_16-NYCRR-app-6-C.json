Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 6-C\nState Regulations\nOPINION OF THE COMMISSION--DECLARATION OF POLICY\nRE\nEMPLOYEE PENSION COSTS\nEddy, Commissioner: The problem of the accounting treatment of pensions is one of\nincreasing importance. This Commission last passed directly on the problem in\n\nCase 11800 involving the Village of Lake Placid. The Utility Workers Union, CIO, requested this Commission to reconsider its previous attitude as expressed\nin that case, and for that reason this proceeding was brought dealing with all\nof the prescribed accounting systems for the various utilities under the\njurisdiction of the Commission. It was announced at the bearing that tentatively the\n\nCommission, after having taken the briefs of the parties, would prepare\nproposed changes in its accounting regulations. Such changes are in the course\nof preparation, and will be considered at a future hearing. There are presently before the State Legislature certain\nproposed amendments to the Public Service Law dealing with the problem. Since\nit does not presently seem possible to afford an adequate hearing on the\nproposed changes before the Legislature adjourns, the Commission feels that a\ngeneral statement of the principles by which this Commission will be guided\nshould presently be made. There has been throughout the last thirty years a very great\nchange in the social thinking of this country in respect to pensions. At one\ntime, as defined by the Court of Appeals (see 268 N.Y. 228), pensions were\nregarded as a \"gratuity of the sovereign\". Gradually that concept has changed\nuntil today pensions are regarded not as a favor or a gift but as part of the\ncompensation of the employee. We think there can be no better statement than\nthat quoted by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in the\n\nInland Steel case, 170 F.2d\n247: \"... we are convinced and find that the term 'wages' as used\nin Section 9(a) must be construed to include emoluments of value, like pension\nand insurance benefits, which may accrue to employees out of their employment\nrelationship.. Realistically viewed, this type of wage enhancement or\nincrease, no less than any other, becomes an integral part of the entire wage\nstructure, and the character of the employee representative's interest in it, and the terms of its grant, is no different than in any other case where a\nchange in the wage structure is effected.\"\nBy the same token, with the change in concept of the nature of\na pension there has likewise been a change in the accounting concept. In\n\nNovember of 1948 and subsequent to our decision in the Lake Placid case, the\n\nCommittee on Accounting Procedure of the American Institute of Accountants, dealing with accounting for annuity costs based on past services, said: \"\n1. When costs incurred under pension plan\nare based in part on services performed prior to the adoption of the plan, the\nproblem arises whether that portion of the costs which are attributable to such\nservices are applicable to the past or to the present and future periods and, accordingly, whether they should be charged to income. This bulletin deals with\nthe accounting treatment of such costs arising out of past services when\nincurred under pension plans involving payments to outside agencies such as\ninsurance companies and trustees. \"\n2. The committee has undertaken a statement\non this subject at this time because of the trend toward expansion of pension\nplans to cover a wider and much larger group of employees, often at\nsubstantially increased costs, and in order to narrow the area of difference in\nthe accounting treatment accorded in actual practice to annuity costs based on\npast services. Self-administered and informal plans which do not require\npayments to outside agencies are not specifically dealt with because of their\nspecial features and lack of uniformity. The principles set forth herein, however, are generally applicable to those plans as well. \"\n3. Charges with respect to pension costs\nbased on past services have often been made to surplus on the grounds that such\npayments are indirectly compensation for services and, since the services upon\nwhich the payments are computed were performed in the past, the compensation\nshould not be permitted to affect any period or periods other than those in\nwhich the services involved were performed. In other cases all annuity costs\nbased on past services have been charged to income in the period of the plan's\ninauguration as a current cost of originating the plan. In still other cases\nthe position has been taken that a pension plan cannot bring the anticipated\nbenefits in the future unless past as well as future services are given\nrecognition and, accordingly, annuity costs based on past services have been\nspread over a period of present and future years. The last method is the one\npermitted under provisions of the Internal Revenue Code. [FN*]\n\"\n4. The committee believes that, even though\nthe calculation is based on past services, costs of annuities based on such\nservices are generally incurred in contemplation of present and future\nservices, not necessarily of the individual affected but of the organization as\na whole and, therefore, should be charged to the present and future periods\nbenefited. This belief is based on the assumption that although the benefits\nflowing from pension plans are intangible, they are nevertheless real. The\nelement of past services is one of the important considerations of most pension\nplans and costs incurred on account of such services contribute to the benefits\ngained by the adoption of a plan. It is usually expected that such benefits\nwill include better employee morale, the removal of super-annuated employees\nfrom the payroll, and the attraction and retention of more desirable personnel, all of which should result in improved operations. \"\n5. The committee, accordingly, is of the\nopinion that: (a) Costs of annuities based on\npast services should be allocated to current and future period; provided, however, that if they are not sufficiently material in amount to distort the\nresults of operations in a single period, they may be absorbed in the current\nyear. (b) Costs of annuities based\non past services should not be charged to surplus.\"\n\"\n6. The committee does not intend that its\nrecommendations shall require (a) a change in policy calling for charges to\nincome rather than charges to reserves previously provided, or (b) that any\nrecognition be given in the accounts of current or future periods to pension\ncosts written off prior to the issuance of this bulletin.\"\nWe must, therefore, conclude not only as a matter of modern\neconomic thinking, but as required by law and accepted practice that pensions\nare wages and constitute a present benefit. Hence, we must expressly overrule\nthe decision in the Lake Placid case and hold that upon the establishment of a\npension plan, whether based on past or future services, or both, the entire\ncharge becomes an operating expense, not an income deduction or a charge to\nsurplus. We think certain fundamental principles should be\nstated: First: If we are to treat pensions as a part of wages, it is\nessential that the company claiming the deduction as an operating expense will\nhave irrevocably committed itself to the obligation. Title must have passed to\nthe beneficiaries. Second: The pension plan must be a reasonable one, carry with\nit the assurance that the obligations which it purports to create can and will\nbe fulfilled and meet the standards of this Commission. If pensions are wages, the matter of pensions is a matter of collective bargaining between the company\nand its men over which we have no control. However, in a rate proceeding where\npayments are excessive, while we cannot fix the compensation, we can disallow\nexcessive payments for the purpose of fixing rates. It follows then if pensions\nare part of compensation, unreasonable payments should likewise not be allowed\nas a part of operating expenses. Third: The inclusion in operating expenses should, of course, be made in the year when provisions should be made for it. The definition of\nthe proper year is one of the most vexing problems presented in this matter\nand, except to state the general principle, this question will be left for\nfurther consideration. As in the case of many other operating expenses, there\nwell may be instances in which the Commission should give its approval to\namortizing payments over a longer period than the current year in which payment\nis made. Fourth: We feel that where companies have undertaken to pay\npensions, even if the plan be styled a so-called voluntary plan under which the\ncompany may claim it has no legal liability, there exists a high moral\nresponsibility and, as a practical matter, a voluntary plan of long standing\ncannot be terminated without destroying good labor relations or by compensating\nthe employees in some other form. Where liabilities exist that should be made\nknown by footnotes to the balance or other appropriate entries. It has been argued that the present provisions in the Uniform\n\nSystem for electric and gas companies are adequate to take care of the problems\nbefore us provided we interpret them as they interpreted here in relation to\npast services. If there is any ambiguity in those provisions, they will in the\nfuture be interpreted in accordance with this memorandum until such time as the\nrevision is complete. With the exception of some portions of the bus industry the\nrelations between labor and managment in the utilities in this state are\nuniformly excellent. In general the workers in the utilities have a high\nstandard of morale. In the utility field above all others a breakdown in good\nlabor relations most seriously affects the public. As previously stated, we\nhave no control over the process of collective bargaining, nor should we\nattempt to exercise any such control. We must, however, make our determinations\nin the regulation of utilities so as to remove any obstructions from the path\nof collective bargaining and to adopt those policies which promote good labor\nrelations, and therefore, better service to the public. For this reason alone, even if we were not compelled to make the determination by the modern legal\nconcept of pensions, we should adopt the principles enunciated here. I am in accord with Commissioner Arkwright to the extent that\nany increase in operating expenses tends toward an increase in rates. However, if we are correct in our view that pensions are a form of wages, and if in the\ncourse of collective bargaining, the employees of a utility desire a pension\nrather than benefits in pay, the granting of pensions in any form, will produce\nno different rates than those that would be produced by an equivalent change in\nwage scales. March 9, 1950. Approved by the Commission March 9, 1950, Commissioner\n\nArkwright in the negative filing a memorandum dated March 9, 1950. ARKWRIGHT, Commissioner: I do not oppose retirement or pension plans. The members of this Commission, and of the prior Commission, wore and are in complete accord as to their desirability and the good that\nnecessarily flows from them. The only point of difference, and the only problem presented, relates to the accumulation of funds to provide for services rendered in the\npast, by employees to a company and to whether present and future consumers\nshould have to pay costs that previous consumers might have had to pay, if such\nplans were in effect. The matter has been before this Commission on several other\noccasions, and has been most carefully considered. In newly established pension\nplans, or in these already established where proper actuarial provisions are\nprovided for to take care of retroactive service, the cost thereof must be met. A determination has now been made that these costs should not be paid by the\nutility or by contributions of the employees, but should be passed on to the\npublic, present and future. This means that, throughout the state, where such\nplans may be set up, or are in being, these costs must be passed on in the form\nof increased rates, to the users of gas, electricity, water, and\ntransportation, whether railroad, bus, or freight. The previous holding of the Commission in no way passed these\ncosts on to the public. It in no way prevented the utility and its employees by\nagreement and by contributions among themselves from inaugurating and\nmaintaining any kind of retirement or pension plan, whether with accumulated\nback costs or not. Thus an accumulation of what amounts to past debt, or\nexpenses in connection therewith, was not passed on to current and prospective\ncustomers and riders, and their rates wore thereby not increased. In my opinion, the public interest is best served by not\npassing these particular costs on to the public. March 9, 1950. [FN*] SeeIRC Sec. 23 (p)(1)(A). Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
