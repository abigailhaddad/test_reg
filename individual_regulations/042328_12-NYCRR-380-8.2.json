  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 380-8.2 - Discrimination or retaliation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The date of the employer's response to a formal written request under section\n380-8.1\n(b) of\nthis Subpart, or the day after 30 days after the date of the employee's formal\nrequest if no such response has been provided, shall be the date as of which\nthe employee then has 2 years to file a complaint under section\n120\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. (b) An eligible employee who wishes to file a\ncomplaint under section\n120\nof the Workers' Compensation Law shall do so in the format prescribed by the\nchair. (1)\n\nAn employee complaint under this\nsection must be served on the employer at the time it is filed with the board, and must contain: (i) date upon which the\nformal request under section 380 8.1(b) of this Subpart was filed with the\nemployer and the board; (ii)\nproof\nof the employee's receipt of family leave benefits or claim for family leave\nbenefits, if family leave benefits were not received; (iii)\ninformation regarding the manner in\nwhich the employer has failed to comply with section 203-b of the Workers'\nCompensation Law; and\n(iv)\nany\nother information that the chair deems relevant in order to process such\ncomplaint. (2)\n\nThe board\nwill not consider a complaint under this section unless the formal request\nunder section\n380-8.1\n(b) of\nthis Subpart has been received, and unless either the time that the employer is\ngiven to respond under section\n380-8.1\n(d) of\nthis Subpart has passed, or an employer response has been received. (3)\nA complaint that does not include the\ninformation required under paragraph (b)(1) of this section may be rejected by\nthe board. (c) (1)\n\nAfter the board has determined that a\ncomplaint has been received that meets all of the requirements of subdivision\n(b) of this section, the board shall schedule hearings, including a preliminary\nconference. (2)\n\nThe employer shall\nfile an answer to the employee's complaint within 30 days receipt of notice\nfrom the board. Failure of an employer to file an answer may result in waiver\nof defenses to the complaint. (d) The fact that an employee was ineligible\nto receive family leave benefits at the time he or she made such claim may\nserve as a basis to disallow a discrimination or retaliation claim under\nsection\n120\nof the Workers' Compensation Law. (e) In evaluating a complaint brought under\nthis section, the board may consider whether the employer's actions are related\nto the taking of family leave or if the employer's actions would have affected\nthe employee if he or she was not on family leave. For example, if a shift has\nbeen eliminated, or overtime has been decreased, an employee would not be\nentitled to return to work that shift or the original overtime hours. If an\nemployee is laid off during the period of family leave, the employer must be\nable to demonstrate that the lay-off is not in retaliation for filing a claim\nfor family leave benefits. (f) The\nabsence of the eligible employee from the workplace shall not be considered a\nvalid or legitimate basis for an employer's failure to reinstate, or for any\nother action taken by the employer in violation of the provisions of section\n203-b of the Workers' Compensation Law. (g) An employee's claim for family leave\nbenefits that has been falsified may be considered a valid and legitimate basis\nfor an employer's failure to reinstate such employee, or for taking other\nassociated employer action.
