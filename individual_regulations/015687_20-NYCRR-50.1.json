  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 50.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) By section\n270\nof\nthe Tax Law, a tax is imposed upon transactions with reference to: (1)\nshares of stock; (2)\ncertificates of stock; (3)\ncertificates of rights to stock; (4)\ncertificates of interest in\nproperty or accumulations; (5)\ncertificates of interest in business conducted by a trustee or trustees; (6)\ncertificates of deposit\nrepresenting any of the foregoing. The tax applies to such shares or\ncertificates in any domestic or foreign corporation, company, association, or\nbusiness conducted by a trustee or trustees. (b) The tax is imposed on (1) sales, (2)\nagreements to sell, (3) memoranda of sales, (4) deliveries, and (5) transfers, of the shares and certificates described above, including transfers of record\nownership on the books of the corporation or other entity issuing the shares or\ncertificates involved. (c) Definitions. (1)\n\nAs used in this Subchapter, the terms shares and certificates mean and include: (i) shares of stock, whether or not\nrepresented by certificates, including shares subscribed for by an\naccommodation incorporator; (ii)\ntemporary or interim certificates; (iii)\ncertificates representing the interest\nof a subscriber for stock, although further payment must be made; (iv)\nvoting trust certificates; (v) certificates of stock in a dissolved\ncorporation. (2)\n\nAs used\nin this Subchapter, the term dealer in securities means any person, firm, company, association or corporation engaged in the making or negotiating of\nsales, agreements to sell, deliveries or transfers of shares or certificates\ntaxable under article 12 of the Tax Law, or conducting or transacting a stock\nbrokerage business. (3)\n\nUnless\notherwise indicated, the term commissioner means the Commissioner of Taxation\nand Finance. (4)\n\nUnless otherwise\nindicated, the term department means the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance. (d) Computation\nof tax. The tax imposed by article 12 of the Tax Law is to be computed at the\nstatutory rates (see sections 270[2] and\n270-e\nof the Tax Law) on the total\nnumber of shares involved in each transaction. The amount of tax so computed is\nto be rounded to the nearest one cent. (e) An agreement of the type known as a\n\"call\" constitutes an agreement to sell, and is subject to tax when given. It\nis immaterial whether the option thereby given is actually exercised, but, if\nexercised, no tax is payable on the sale, delivery or transfer made pursuant to\nthe \"call,\" provided that the tax has been paid on the \"call\" itself. In such a\ncase, the seller may submit to the transfer agent a certification signed by the\nseller stating the number of shares transferred, the name of the transferee, that the transfer was made pursuant to a \"call\" and that the applicable tax was\npaid upon such \"call,\" which remains in the seller's possession. The tax\npayable on a \"call,\" as described in this subdivision, is computed based on the\nprice for which the shares subject to the \" call\" will be transferred pursuant\nto such \"call,\" and not based on the price of the \"call\" itself. (f) It is not necessary that a transaction\ninvolve a sale to be taxable; a delivery or transfer of shares or certificates\nas a gift is taxable. (g) The tax\nimposed by article 12 of the Tax Law does not apply to the original issuance of\nstock. Thus, the transfer of shares pursuant to an agreement of the type known\nas a \"warrant\" is not taxable if the shares transferred represent an original\nissuance of stock by the corporation making the \"warrant.\" However, the\ntransfer of treasury stock by a corporation (whether or not transferred\npursuant to a \"warrant\") does not qualify as an original issuance of stock and\nis thus a taxable transfer. (h) Transfer of shares of stock in a cooperative housing corporation. At the time\nof the initial formation of a cooperative housing corporation, the transfer to\nthe initial unit purchasers of shares related to specific cooperative units, and the transfer to the sponsor of the cooperative conversion of the remaining\nshares, representing the unsold units in the cooperative, are exempt from tax, as these transfers represent an original issuance of stock by the cooperative\nhousing corporation. However, subsequent transfers by the initial unit\npurchasers of their cooperative shares and transfers by the cooperative sponsor\nto additional unit purchasers of the remaining unsold shares in the cooperative\nare not exempt from tax. (i) The\nfollowing are examples of taxable transactions: (1)\n\nThe transfer of stock by gift. (2)\n\nThe transfer of stock from a partnership\nto a member thereof or from a member to a partnership. (3)\n\nThe purchase, redemption or other\nreacquisition by a corporation of its own shares of stock (except where such\nshares are cancelled on reacquisition pursuant to the provisions of section\n515\nof the Business Corporation Law, or such\nshares are cancelled by an appropriate amendment to the corporation's\ncertificate of incorporation or by action by the board of directors of such\ncorporation within one year of the date of reacquisition) and transfers of its\nown stock by the corporation. (4)\n\nThe distribution of stock in one corporation owned by another to stockholders\nof the latter. (5)\n\nThe transfer of\nstock of a corporation to be merged, to the merging corporation, prior to the\nactual merger and as a condition precedent to the merger.

(11)\n\nThe transfer of\nstock held by joint tenants to either one or the other of the parties while\nboth are alive. (12)\n\nThe delivery\nof a certificate by the transferor, or his agent, to the transferee, or his\nagent. (13)\n\nThe transfer of stock\nby or to an ambassador or consul representing a foreign country. (j) The following are examples of\ntransactions not subject to tax: (1)\nA\ntransfer on the books of the corporation into a new name, made merely because\nthe stockholder has changed his or its name, where no actual change of\nownership occurs. (2)\n\nThe surrender\nof a single certificate for reissuance to the same stockholder of several\ncertificates representing, in the aggregate, the same number of\nshares. (3)\n\nThe surrender of a\nnumber of certificates of reissuance, to the same stockholder, of a single\ncertificate for the same number of shares. (4)\n\nThe transfer of a fraction of a share of\nstock or a certificate representing the right to receive less than one share of\nstock. (5)\n\nThe surrender of\npreferred stock certificates in exchange for common stock certificates issued\nto the same stockholder and vice versa, when made necessary by a change in\ncapital structure. (6)\n\nThe mere\nregistration in the State of New York, by a registrar, of a transfer already\nmade by the corporation or its transfer agent outside this State. (7)\n\nThe mere execution of an assignment\nwithin the State (whether by endorsing the certificate in blank or otherwise)\nwhere all other acts connected with the transfer are done outside the\n\nState. (8)\n\nThe transfer of stock\nfrom a trustee of a continuing trust to a successor trustee appointed under\npower reserved in the deed of trust. (9)\n\nThe transfer of stock by a trustee to a\nsuccessor trustee in a case where the first trustee, acting under a deed of\ntrust which empowers him to appoint a cotrustee, appoints such cotrustee and\nthen resigns, leaving the cotrustee as the sole trustee.

(13)\n\nThe transfer of\nstock in the names of two joint tenants with right of survivorship to the name\nof the survivor after the death of the other joint tenant. (k) (1)\n\nAny\ncertification required pursuant to this Subchapter relating to the delivery or\ntransfer of a certificate or certificates may be impressed by rubber stamp on\nsuch certificate or certificates or on the required memorandum of sale. As an\nalternative to the use of a rubber stamp, such certifications may be\npre-printed on or attached to such certificate or certificates or required\nmemorandum of sale. In the case of a transfer through a system for the central\nhandling of securities (see section\n53.2\nof this Title) certifications pursuant to this Subchapter may be stamped or\npreprinted on the depositor's instructions to such system or its nominee and on\nthe system's or its nominee's instructions to the transfer agent, issuing\ncorporation or trustee issuing certificates subject to tax under article 12 of\nthe Tax Law. (2)\n\nIf the\nregistration of the transfer with respect to which a certification relates was\neffected pursuant to instruction on magnetic or punched tape, discs, cards or\nother media, or by wire or wireless transmission, such certification may be\ninserted in such instruction as prescribed by section\n51.2\nof this Title.
