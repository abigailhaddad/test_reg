  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4820.54 - Seat reservations\n\nState Regulations\n\nLicensed authorized organizations shall, pursuant to\nsection\n4820.53\nof this Part, adopt a house\nrule either permitting or denying their members in charge the authority to\nreserve seats for players, and shall include that house rule in its bingo\nprogram. When seat reservations are permitted, each player shall be afforded an\nequal opportunity to reserve a seat. Seats may be reserved with \"Reserved Seat\"\nsigns but, under no circumstances, shall seats be reserved by placing bingo\nopportunities, daubers or other supplies on tables before unoccupied seats. Licensed authorized organizations opting not to permit seat reservations shall\nadopt a house rule prohibiting seat reservations entirely. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4820.54\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
