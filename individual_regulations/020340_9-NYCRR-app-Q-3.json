(a) A single free-standing sign not in excess\nof 40 square feet in sign area or more than 20 feet in height may be erected\nidentifying the center or facility as a whole, but shall not contain\nadvertising matter.

Nonconforming signs. If a regional project\nsubject to Adirondack Park Agency review is proposed for a parcel of real\nproperty upon which an existing sign is located, and the said existing sign is\nassociated with the principal activity which is the subject of the proposed\nproject but does not conform to these standards, the agency may require that\nthe said non-conforming sign be brought into compliance herewith within a\nreasonable period of time, not to exceedsix years. Such requirement that the\nnon-conforming sign be brought into compliance herewith may entail the\ncompulsory elimination of the sign upon the termination of a period calculated\nto be the remaining economic life thereof based upon actual depreciation\nschedules, but in any event not to exceed six years. 9. Residential and other nonbusiness uses. In\nthe case of residential uses and other nonbusiness-oriented uses, the agency\nwill apply these private sign standards, except that only one sign may be\nerected or maintained upon a parcel of real property, the sign area may not\nexceed eight square feet, and the overall height of the sign may not exceed six\nfeet.
