  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.4 - Handling and removal procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Glovebag procedures. Glovebags are\nallowed to be utilized for abatement of pipe or duct insulation within negative\npressurized regulated abatement work area enclosures. Glovebags may only be\nused on piping and ducts up to 150° F. The following procedures must be\nfollowed for glovebag use: (1)\n\nSize. When\nabating pipe or duct insulation, the pipe or duct insulation diameter worked\nshall not exceed one half the bag working length. (2)\n\nSealing. Duct tape shall be placed\nsecurely around the area of abatement to form a smooth seal. The glovebag shall\nthen be secured to the duct tape and sealed airtight. (3)\n\nSeal testing. After placement, each\nglovebag shall be subjected to and pass a smoke test as follows: (i) Smoke testing should not be completed\nusing a positive pressure test. The glovebag, once secured in place, should be\nplaced under negative pressure, utilizing the HEPA-vacuum, and a smoke tube\nshould be aspirated to direct smoke at all seals and seams from outside the\nglovebag. (ii)\n\nIf there are any\nleaks, they will be detected by the smoke entering the bag. All leaks shall be\nduct taped airtight. (4)\n\nSurface irregularities. If material adjacent to the work section is damaged, or\nif it terminates, is jointed or contains an irregularity adjacent to the work\nsection, the material shall be wrapped in at least six mil fire-retardant\nplastic sheeting and sealed airtight with duct tape. (5)\n\nPost-stripping wetting. After the\nasbestos material has been stripped, the surface from which it has been removed\nshall be wetted with amended water and scrubbed with a brush or abrasive pad to\nremove all visible asbestos material. The surfaces from which it has been\nremoved, the interior of the bag, the affected area and the tools shall then be\nthoroughly wetted with amended water. (6)\n\nSealing of pipe ends. When abating pipe\ninsulation, any pipe insulation ends created shall be sealed with wettable\ncloth or otherwise encapsulated with a non-asbestos product. (7)\n\nCollapsing of the glovebag. A HEPA-vacuum\nshall be used to collapse the glovebag. (8)\n\nTool segregation. With the glovebag\ncollapsed and the asbestos material in the bottom of the bag, twist the bag\nseveral times and duct tape the twist to seal that section. The tool pouch\nshall be separated from the bag by twisting it several times, taping the twist\nand thus sealing the pouch. Alternately, the tools may be segregated using one\nor both glove inserts and pulling the tools through, thus turning the glove\ninside out. The glove(s) shall then be twisted several times, duct taped and\nthus sealed. (9)\n\nSealing the\ncontaminated items. The glovebag shall be tied off to contain the asbestos\nmaterial prior to the glovebag being detached from the area where the asbestos\nwas removed within the bag. (10)\n\nContainerizing the glovebag. The sealed glovebag shall be placed into at least\na six mil plastic bag, sealed airtight and transferred from the regulated\nabatement work area as per section\n56-8.9\nof this Subpart, for\ndisposal as asbestos waste. (11)\n\nFailure. The requirements of section\n56-8.2\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart shall be complied with in the event of glovebag losing seal or\nintegrity. (b) Dry\nremoval or dry disturbance. No dry removal or dry disturbance of asbestos\nmaterial shall be permitted. (c) Wetting requirements. The asbestos material shall be adequately wetted with\namended water. Sufficient time shall be allowed for penetration to occur prior\nto abatement activities. All friable asbestos materials shall be thoroughly\nsaturated. All non-hygroscopic (material that resists wetting) asbestos\nmaterial shall be thoroughly wetted, prior to and during abatement. (d) Asbestos abatement. Only one type of\nasbestos containing material shall be abated at a time within an enclosure. Prior to the abatement of another type of asbestos containing material, the\narea shall be cleaned. (See section\n56-8.6\nof this Subpart -multiple\nabatement within a single regulated abatement work area.)\n(e) Handling. ACM, PACM and asbestos\nmaterial, on detachment from the substrate, shall be directly bagged or dropped\ninto a flexible catch basin and subsequently bagged or containerized. Materials\nremoved in negative pressure tent enclosure work areas shall be bagged or\ncontainerized immediately upon detachment. Additional amended water shall be\nadded as necessary to the waste bags/containers to ensure that all waste\nremains adequately wet within the bag/container. (f) Sealing of surfaces and edges. Where ACM, PACM or asbestos material was removed, any exposed edges of material that\nremain shall be sealed with wettable cloth or otherwise encapsulated with a\nsuitable non-asbestos material, prior to commencement of final cleaning and\ncollection of clearance air samples. (g) Exterior chutes. For asbestos material\nlowered or conveyed greater than 10 feet in height, dust tight, enclosed, inclined chutes shall be used as follows: (1)\n\nThe upper end of the chute shall be furnished with a hinged lid to be closed\nwhen a chute is not being used. (2)\n\nThe chute shall be dust tight along its lateral perimeter and at the terminal\nconnection to a dumpster or container with a hard wall and a hard\ntop. (h) Handling large\ncomponents. Large components, removed intact, shall be wrapped in two layers of\nat least six mil plastic sheeting secured and made air tight with duct\ntape. (i) Sharp-edge components. Asbestos waste material with sharp edged components that may tear or damage the\nplastic bags or sheeting shall be placed in a poly lined hard wall container or\na rip proof bag then double bagged or wrapped and sealed airtight. (j) Loss of integrity on asbestos projects. If a regulated abatement work area enclosure of any type, including a negative\npressure tent enclosure, fails or loses its integrity, the required procedures\nof section\n56-8.2\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart shall be followed.
