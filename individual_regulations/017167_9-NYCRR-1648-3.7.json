  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-3.7 - Subsidy Schedule, form DH-910\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Subsidy Schedule, form DH-910, is a\nprinted form, consisting of two sheets, supplied by the division and is shown\nas Exhibits 3 and 4 of Appendix S-13. The subsidy schedule is designed to apply\nthe statutory limitations with respect to the maximum amount of State subsidy\nand the matching local subsidy and to compute the amounts of State and local\nsubsidies payable for a given fiscal year. (b) The subsidy schedule has six main\nsections, as follows: (1)\n\nSection A (sheet\n1)--maximum State subsidy. In this section, the maximum amount of State subsidy\npayable for any one year is computed. (2)\n\nSection B (sheet 1)--value of tax\nexemption subsidy. In this section, the tax exemption subsidy which the\nmunicipality may use to match the State subsidy is computed. (3)\n\nSection C (sheet 2)--net loss for fiscal\nyear. In this section, the net loss for the fiscal year, is stated. The net\nloss, against which the State subsidy in being advanced, is reduced by the\namount of the minimum annual local cash subsidy, if any, stipulated in the\ncontract for State aid. (4)\n\nSection\nD (sheet 2)--computation of State subsidy. In this section, the amount of State\nsubsidy payable within the statutory limitations on maximum State subsidy and\nmatching local subsidy is computed. (5)\n\nSection E (sheet 2)--computation of local\n(city) subsidy. In this section, the amount of local cash subsidy, if any, and\nthe local subsidy including the value of tax exemption is computed. (6)\n\nSection F (sheet 2)--summary of subsidy\nrequirements. In this section, the requirements for State and local cash\nsubsidies, as computed in sections D and E, are adjusted for prepaid and\naccrued subsidies as of the end of the previous fiscal year, and for subsidies\npreviously advanced during the current fiscal year. The final amount with\nrespect to State subsidy will be in agreement with the State subsidy requested\non the housing subsidy voucher, where the subsidy requisition is being\nsubmitted for an advance of State subsidy to meet an operating\ndeficit. (c) Detailed\ninstructions, by items, for preparing the subsidy schedule follow: Item 1--project development cost. Enter in column (1)\nthe actual project development cost, per the books as of the end of the most\nrecent calendar quarter, inserting the closing date of the quarter in the space\nprovided. Item 2--one per cent of project development cost. Enter\nin column (3) one per cent of the amount entered as item I. Item 3--computation of largest annual interest\ncharge. Item 3a. Largest annual interest charge on funds\nborrowed to finance the project, before deduction for interest on working\ncapital. This item means the largest charge that has accrued or will accrue\n(based on the facts regarding the authority's indebtedness as of the end of the\nfiscal year for which the subsidy is applicable) during any consecutive 12\nmonth period, going back to the date of the loan and subsidy contract, if\nnecessary, and regardless of whether the 12 month period lies partly in the\ndevelopment period and partly in the operating period or wholly in either\nperiod or whether the 12 month period includes parts of two fiscal years. The\nlargest annual interest charge means the gross interest charge before any\ncredit for interest received on investments. Interest on temporary loan notes\nis taken into account, but interest on overlapping issues of temporary loan\nnotes and bonds is ruled out. The largest annual interest charge on a bond\nissue is most readily ascertained by inspection of the debt service schedule\nsupplied by the State Comptroller through the Division of Housing. This charge\nshould be converted into the largest annual interest rate by dividing the\nlargest annual interest charge by the total amount of the bond issue, for\nsubsequent use in computing item 3b and item 4. If there is more than one bond\nissue, the largest annual interest charge is the sum of the largest annual\ninterest charge for each bond issue. The largest annual interest charge, once\ndetermined, is carried forward from year to year unless subsequent financing\nintervenes. Item 3b. Interest charge on loan funds borrowed for\nworking capital. Working capital obtained from loan funds will be set up when\nthe project has been declared physically completed and ordinarily will absorb\nthe difference, if any, between the amount of the loan and the actual final\ndevelopment cost, subject to the statutory limitations on the maximum amount\nwhich may be loaned for working capital. Until the project is declared\nphysically completed, it will be presumed that all loan funds have been\nborrowed against the estimated final development cost and that none has been\nborrowed for working capital. If the project has not been declared physically\ncompleted, enter the word \"none\" for item 3b. If there is more than one bond\nissue and the project has been declared physically completed, the rate to be\napplied to the amount of loan funds borrowed for working capital is an\neffective composite interest rate as computed for item 4. Item 3c. Self-explanatory. Item 4--interest computed on development cost. The\ninterest on development cost is computed by applying the largest annual\ninterest rate to the development cost (item 1). If the indebtedness of the\nproject during the 12 month period in which the largest annual interest charge\noccurs (see item 3a) consists of a single bond issue, the interest rate to be\nused for item 4 will be the same as the interest rate for the 12 month period\nin which the largest annual interest charge occurs. If more than one bond issue\nis outstanding, it will be necessary to compute an effective composite interest\nrate as follows: Image\n\nImage\n\nItem 5--largest annual interest charge for subsidy\npurposes. Enter in column (3) the largest annual interest charge, after\ndeduction for interest on working capital (item 3c) or the interest computed on\ndevelopment cost (item 4), whichever is less. Item 6--maximum State subsidy. The maximum State\nsubsidy is the sum of one per cent of project development cost (item 2) and the\nlargest annual interest charge for subsidy purposes (item 5). Item 7--project development cost. Enter on this line, in the appropriate columns, the development cost entered in item 1. The\nmultiple columns are provided because in some localities where real estate, school and special district taxes are levied separately, there may be as many\nas three combined tax rates applicable to the fiscal year. Item 8--assessed valuation. Item 8a--present assessed valuation of project land and\nimprovements. The word project as used here, means the project proper, exclusive of land and improvements acquired for related programs, as tax\nexemption does not apply to these. The assessed valuations to be entered here\nshould be those which are, or will be, in effect during the tax year in which\nthe last day of the fiscal year for which subsidy is applicable falls and the\ndate to be entered in item 8a will, of course, be March 31 of the year in\nquestion. If in preparing a requisition for an advance of subsidy, the assessed\nvaluation as of the last day of the fiscal year for which the subsidy is\napplicable has not been established then the last available assessed valuation\nshall be used, and the appropriate dates entered. Item 8b--date tax year begins.Self-explanatory. Item 8c--date assessed valuations were established. Enter the date on which the public assessment records for the tax year in\nquestion first becomes available, officially, for inspection by the tax paying\npublic. Item 9, 10, 11. Self-explanatory. Item 12--assessed value of property not retained. Enter\nin appropriate columns, the assessed value, as of the date of the loan and\nsubsidy contract, of property ceded to a municipality for street-widening, parks, playgrounds, etc., or sold. The amount entered on this line should be\nchecked against the application for financial assistance and particularly\nagainst the preliminary rent summary forming a part thereof. Item 13--taxable assessment. Enter on this line, in the\nappropriate columns, the difference between item 11 and item 12. Item 14--assessed valuation of property exempt from\ntaxation. Enter on this line, in the appropriate columns, the difference\nbetween item 10 and item 13. Items 15, 16, 17. Self-explanatory. Item 18--net loss for fiscal year. Enter in columns\n[sic] (3) the net loss for the current fiscal year, before cash subsidies, as\nper form DH-621, Income and Expense--Budget Control Statement, attached. Form\nDH-621 should be adapted for this purpose as follows: If the subsidy requisition is being submitted prior to\nthe close of the fiscal year, the actual income and expense to the close of the\nmost recent calendar quarter (unless later figures are available) shall be\nlisted in column (1) of form DH-621, the estimated income and expense for the\nbalance of the fiscal year in column (2) and the total of columns (1) and (2)\nshall be listed in column (3). In column (4) of form DH-621 shall be listed the\nbudgeted income and expense for the period for which these items were estimated\nin column (2). The column headings on form DH-621 shall be modified\naccordingly. If the subsidy requisition is being submitted\nsubsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the actual income and expense for\nthe fiscal year shall be listed in column (4) of form DH-621.

Enter in the appropriate columns the difference between item 18 and\nitem 19. Item 22. Enter in columns (2) and (3) the maximum State\nsubsidy (item 6), the value of the tax exemption subsidy (item 17), or the net\nloss, after minimum local cash subsidy (item 20), whichever is least. In the\nevent a loan and subsidy contract calls for a minimum local cash subsidy, however, the local agency should first consult with the division as to the\ncredit for matching purposes. Item 23--balance of net loss. Enter in column (2), the\ndifference between item 21 and item 22. Item 24. Enter in column (3) 50 per cent of item\n23. Item 25--total.
