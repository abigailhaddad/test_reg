[*][DAGGER]\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the fair and effective implementation and\noperation of New York's Returnable Container Act (Title 10 of Article 27 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law) is of vital importance to the State because of\nits effect on the State's ability to achieve environmental objectives on which\nthe health and safety of the people depend; and\nWHEREAS, the Department of Environmental Conservation\n(Department) is charged with the administration and enforcement of the\n\nReturnable Container Act; and\nWHEREAS, there is substantial reason to believe that the\n\nReturnable Container Act is creating an unintended, unwarranted and unfair\nbenefit for deposit initiators who have retained unclaimed deposits; and\nWHEREAS, the Moreland Act Commission on the Returnable\n\nContainer Act established by Executive Order No. 129 reported in March 1990\nthat the beer and soda industry, through a concerted refusal to cooperate\nvoluntarily and a \"systematic attempt to obfuscate the facts,\" had prevented\nthat Commission from determining the actual amount of unclaimed deposits and\nthe net cost to the beer and soft drink industry of complying with the\n\nReturnable Container Act; and\nWHEREAS, the foregoing is within the management and affairs\nof the Department; NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to Section\nsix\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, I, MARIO M.
