  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6210.8 - Test deck procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach county board shall prepare a test deck to be used to\nverify that the voting system's election configuration and ballot configuration\nis correct and that the voting system will accurately cast and count votes\nwithin each individual ballot configuration. (a) The ballots shall be voted with a\npre-determined number of valid votes for each candidate, each write-in\nposition, and each voting option on every proposal that appears on the ballot\nas certified by the county board in order to verify that the vote system is\nprogrammed to correctly count the ballots. The deck includes one or more\nballots that are intended to fail, have been improperly voted, or which are\nvoted in excess of the number allowed by law, and one or more ballots on which\nno votes are cast, in order to test the ability of the system to recognize\nand/or notify of an under or over vote. If there is more than one ballot\nconfiguration for an election, a separate test deck is created for each ballot\nconfiguration. In election districts that will utilize a single voting system\nfor two or more ballot configurations, required testing shall consist of a\ndifferent test deck for each ballot configuration to be utilized on such voting\nsystem, to ensure that the addition of multiple ballot configurations has not\naffected the accurate casting and counting of votes within individual ballot\nconfigurations. (b) Test decks\nwhich include sub-decks are created once election configuration and ballot\nconfiguration tasks have been completed, and ballot configurations have been\nverified, utilizing detailed procedures for preparation of a test deck\nprescribed to the county board by the State Board. Using a tool or tools, (\nie\n\nExcel) make a test script for each specific ballot within\nthe test deck, such that when all test ballots within the test deck are\ncompletely cast it will accurately test all positions, undervotes, overvotes, write-in positions, propositions and ballots that are deliberately designed to\nfail. (1)\n\nTo create a test deck on an optical\nscan voting system, test ballots must be marked, following the pattern\ndetermined to sufficiently test the ballot programming, logic, and accuracy. (i) For optical scan voting systems, the test\ndeck includes one or more ballots on which two or more votes are cast for a\ncandidate whose name appears on the ballot more than once for the same office\nin order to test the ability of the system to count only the first of such\nvotes for the candidate. (2)\n\nTo create a test deck for DRE systems, the creation of a test script is required, so that the pattern of votes can be\nfollowed, to facilitate the manual casting of same. (i) For DRE systems, the test deck includes\none or more ballots in which an attempt is made to cast two or more votes for a\ncandidate whose name appears on the ballot more than once for the same office\nin order to test the ability of the system to accurately cast the voters\nchoice(s) for such office. (3)\n\nAssign each ballot in the script a unique\nballot number. (4)\n\nCalculate the\nnumber of ballots required to conduct each test. This calculation is the\nminimum number of ballots that must be cast on each voting machine or system\nwhere such ballot configuration is programmed, pursuant to section\n6210.2\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (c) Upon creation\nof a test deck and prior to use in pre-qualification testing, the test deck\nmust be validated by casting the ballots in the test deck on a voting machine\nor system, printing out the tabulation report and comparing same to the\npredetermined expected results for that test deck to ensure accuracy. Any\ncorrections to the test deck must be made prior to its use in pre-qualification\ntesting. (d) Once a test deck has\nbeen validated, test decks are run by a bi-partisan team on each voting system\nfor which that particular ballot configuration is valid. The team shall enter\nat least one ballot from each sub-deck using each feature intended for people\nwith disabilities, and enter at least one ballot from each sub-deck using each\nlanguage provided on the unit. While one team member casts 1 votes for the\ntest, the other member shall monitor that votes are cast correctly. (1)\n\nThe test shall be documented by the\nbi-partisan team, on a log to be prescribed by the State Board, and the team\nshall affix their signatures to the log. The log shall include but not be\nlimited to: (i) The date the test was\nexecuted. (ii)\n\nThe names of the\npersons who performed the test and recorded the results. (iii)\n\nThe serial number of the machine on\nwhich the test was executed. (iv)\n\nThe protective counter number of the machine on which the test was executed as\nit appeared both at the beginning and conclusion of testing. (v) The name or description of the test\nperformed. (vi)\n\nThe version number\nof the software under test. (vii)\n\nThe test result, either pass if the results match the expected results exactly, or fail if there is even one discrepancy. (e) The bi-partisan team shall compare the\naccuracy of the results reported by the voting system to the expected results\nand determine if the machine passed or failed. Any discrepancies indicate a\nfailure and must be investigated. (1)\n\nIf a\ntest deck is run on a DRE, and the pre-determined vote count does not compare\nto the results reported by the voting system, the bi-partisan team shall\ndocument the problem, and then compare the paper audit trail transactions to\nthe unique test ballot scripts, to be sure votes were cast correctly. Any\ncorrections to the test deck itself, or to the casting of the test deck shall\nbe made, and the test deck shall be re-run until two error-free test results\nare produced, pursuant to section\n6210.2\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (2)\n\nIf a test deck is\nrun on an optical scan voting system, and the pre-determined vote count does\nnot match the computer generated tabulation, then the bi-partisan team shall\ndocument the problem and compare the unique ballot script pattern with the test\ndeck pattern to ensure that the test deck was made correctly and that all\nballots were run. Any corrections to the test deck itself, or to the casting of\nthe test deck, shall be made and the test deck shall be re-run until two\nerror-free test results are produced, pursuant to section\n6210.2\n(c)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (3)\n\nIf the test deck and\nvoting system fail to produce two consecutive error-free results, the system\nshall not be used until such time as the problem is resolved in a manner\nconsistent with vendor documentation and State Board procedure. (f) For DRE systems, the paper\naudit trail records with the accumulation report shall be signed by the testing\nteam, then bound and placed in secure storage. For optical scan voting systems, the results report shall be signed by the bi-partisan team, and placed in\nsecure storage. After all voting systems upon which a particular ballot\nconfiguration is valid have been tested, the test deck shall be stored with all\ncorresponding reports, audit trails, log sheets and system logs required to be\nproduced and reviewed pursuant to paragraph (e)(3) of this section. (g) For central count paper-based systems, after entering all election ballot codes and creating header cards, if required\nby the software, the following verification procedures shall be performed: (1)\n\nPlace one ballot from the appropriate\nballot configuration behind each header card. (2)\n\nProcess the complete set of header cards\ncontaining the single ballots against the absentee counting system and ballot\ncounting program. (3)\n\nIf the\nsoftware rejects a header or ballot card, the cause of the error shall be\nascertained and corrected. (4)\n\nRe-process all cards which generated errors to verify correction. (5)\n\nAt the discretion of and mutual agreement\nof a county board's commissioners, a resolution may be adopted for a specific\nelection, which may provide that ballots be canvassed manually, rather than by\nusing the central count paper-based voting system. Such resolution shall be\nfiled with the county board's official minutes, and notice of the resolution\nand decision shall be provided in writing, to the State Board and to all party\nchairs and candidates, whose names appear on the ballots to be counted\nmanually. The county board shall give written notice, by first class mail, to\nthe State Board and to all party chairs and candidates who are lawfully\nentitled to have their names appear on the ballots, of such\nresolution.
