(c) No grant shall be paid\nfor any part of a loss for which compensation has been received under any other\nprogram or from insurance or any other source. However, should an applicant be\nentitled to compensation for such loss from another source, an applicant may\napply for and receive a grant, provided that the applicant has not received\ncompensation by the time of application and agrees to repay the State any\nduplicative compensation. (d) Applicants who are approved by SEMO for an award will receive an award letter\ndescribing the amount, which has been approved. Applicants who are not approved\nby SEMO for an award will also receive a letter that sets forth the reasons for\nsuch denial. Awards will be processed and mailed to applicants under separate\ncover by the Office of the State Comptroller. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
