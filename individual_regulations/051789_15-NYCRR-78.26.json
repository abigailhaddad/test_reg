  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 78.26 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A dealer must\ninclude either the dealer's name or facility identification number on\nadvertising of any kind concerning the sale, purchase or transfer of motor\nvehicles, motorcycles or trailers. When a dealer has an assumed name on file\nwith the commissioner, pursuant to section\n78.7\nof this Part, the advertising\nmay be in the assumed name. (b) Dealers are required to display signs and/or window lettering which are of a\npermanent nature on the front of the premises occupied by their places of\nbusiness. Such signs and/or window lettering must contain the actual name under\nwhich the business is conducted. The words and/or letters of the signs and/or\nwindow lettering must be of a size sufficiently large so that the public may\nquickly and easily discern said signs and/or window lettering and readily\nestablish the identity of the dealer. The sign and/or lettering must be\ndisplayed in a conspicuous place on the front of the premises. When a dealer\ndoes business under two or more names, a sign or window lettering in each name\nis required. (c) The maintenance or\nerection of signs which would tend to indicate that the premises occupied by a\ndealer's place of business are being used or occupied by a dealer franchised to\nsell new motor vehicles, when in fact the dealer is not so franchised, will be\nconsidered misleading advertising and the dealer must remove such signs when\nrequested to do so by the commissioner. (d) Official dealer sign. (1)\n\nEvery retail dealer shall display either\nan official dealer sign or a sign of a permanent nature, at least three feet by\ntwo feet in size, visible at all times from the nearest street or highway, which sign clearly and unequivocally indicates to the general public that the\nbusiness is one which sells motor vehicles. If it is impracticable for a retail\ndealer to display such sign so that it is visible from the nearest street or\nhighway, then the commissioner may grant approval for such sign to be posted in\nan alternate location, if the alternate location provides notice to the general\npublic in a manner that meets or exceeds the notice provided if such sign were\nvisible from the nearest street or highway. (2)\n\nAn official dealer sign must be three\nfeet wide and two feet high. It must be made of a durable material which will\nwithstand the outdoor elements. It may be either single or double faced. It\nmust be displayed so as to be visible to the public. (3)\n\nThe background of the sign shall be\nbright red and the lettering on the sign shall be white. (4)\n\nThe word \"REGISTERED\" shall appear near\nthe top in an arc which shall have a radius of two feet nine inches. Each\nletter shall be four inches high with a stroke of three-fourths of an\ninch. (5)\n\nThe facility number shall\nbe placed in a straight line on the official dealer sign in the area directly\nbelow \"REGISTERED\". Such numbers shall be two inch block numbers with a stroke\nof approximately one-half inch. (6)\n\nUnder the facility number shall appear \"STATE OF NEW YORK\" in letters two\ninches high with a stroke of one-half inch, in a straight line. (7)\n\nBelow \"STATE OF NEW YORK\" shall appear\n\"MOTOR VEHICLE RETAIL DEALER\" on two straight lines, in letters four inches\nhigh with a stroke of three-fourths of one inch. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
