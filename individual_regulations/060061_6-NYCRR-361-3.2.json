  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-3.2 - Composting facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Exempt\nfacilities. In addition to the exemptions listed in section\n360.14\nof this Title, the following\nfacilities are exempt from this Subpart when operated in a manner that does not\nproduce vectors, dust or odors that unreasonably impact neighbors of the\nfacility, as determined by the department, and when no waste accepted remains\non-site for more than 36 months. For geographically contiguous land owned or\noperated by the same person, if the land area exceeds 50 acres, one exempt\nfacility can be located for every 50 acres, provided the exempt facilities are\nat least 1000 feet apart. For facilities located on a farm where the product\nwill only be used on that farm as a soil amendment, multiple exempt facilities\nmay be located on that farm, provided the exempt facilities are at least 500\nfeet apart. Multiple exempt facility types can be commingled on the same site\nand still considered to be an exempt facility, such as a mixture of yard\ntrimmings and SSO. (1)\nA composting\nfacility located at a site controlled by the waste generator, in accordance\nwith paragraph 360.14(b)(1) of this Title. (2)\nA composting facility that accepts, measured on a monthly average, no more than 1,000 pounds or one cubic yard, whichever is greater, of SSO per week provided no more than 2,000 pounds are\naccepted in any one week. Sufficient bulking agent must be used to provide\nproper aeration and control leachate migration. (3)\nA composting facility that accepts no\nmore than 3,000 cubic yards of yard trimmings per year. This quantity does not\ninclude tree debris that is not intended for composting. For these facilities, precipitation, surface water, and groundwater that has come in contact with\nyard trimmings or the resultant product is not considered leachate; however, it\nmust be managed within the site and must not enter a surface waterbody or a\nconveyance to a surface waterbody or cause a violation of water quality\nstandards promulgated in Part 750 of this Title. (4)\nA composting facility located on a farm\nfor animal carcasses. If the composting facility is not covered by a CAFO\npermit, no more than five tons of carcasses per year can be from off-site\nsources and the animal carcasses must be placed within the compost pile on the\nday received. (5)\nA composting\nfacility on property controlled by a State agency or a municipal entity for\nanimal carcasses generated on properties under their control. (6)\nA composting facility for animal manure\nand bedding or crop residues. (7)\nA\ncomposting facility on a farm covered by a CAFO permit, provided the waste\naccepted is limited to manure, food processing waste, and/or SSO. The waste\ncannot contain sanitary content. (b) Registered facilities. Unless otherwise exempt, the following facilities are\nsubject to the registration provision of section\n360.15\nof this Title and must\nregister with the department.

The\nfacility is not required to comply with the separation requirement with respect\nto construction of nearby residences, places of business or public contact\nareas after the permit application is submitted to the department; and\n(d) the separation distance\nrequirement for a residence does not apply to the residence of the facility\nlandowner or operator. For a municipal permittee, land owned by any agency or\ndepartment of the municipality is considered to be owned by the\nmunicipality. (2)\n\nWaste acceptance and operations. (i) The operation of the facility must follow\nacceptable methods of composting that results in the decomposition of the\norganic material received. For yard trimmings composting, leaves in bags must\nbe debagged or otherwise incorporated into the process within 60 days of\nreceipt, unless stored in a manner that does not produce odors. Bags containing\nprimarily grass clippings must be debagged and mixed with a bulking agent\nwithin 24 hours of receipt. (ii)\n\nThe facility can only accept SSO from a generator that has a collection program\ndesigned to collect organic waste separate from other recyclables and waste\nmaterials. This does not prohibit the facility from accepting packaged\nproducts that will be processed prior to composting. The composting facility\nmust also have provisions for inspection and removal of nonprocessible\nmaterials received. (iii)\n\nThe\nfacility is prohibited from accepting wastes that do not positively contribute\nto the composting process or the quality of the product, as determined by the\ndepartment.

Physical\ncontaminants include human-made inert products including, but not limited to, glass metal, and plastic. (v) The\nproduct must be able to pass through a one-inch screen, except for wood\nparticles derived from the use of wood chips as a bulking agent or\namendment. (vi)\n\nThe compost product\nmust be mature and must be used in a legitimate manner as a soil amendment, for\nerosion control, etc. The process must have a minimum detention time (including\nactive composting and curing) of 50 days, unless an alternate means for\nachieving sufficient maturity is approved by the department. (vii)\n\nExcept for products derived solely from\nyard trimmings, an information label must be affixed to the product packaging\nor, for bulk, an information sheet, sign, brochure, or website page must be\nused, containing: (a) the name and address of\nthe generator of the product; (b) the type of waste from which the product was derived; and\n(c) recommended safe uses, application rates\nand storage practices. (viii)\n\nFor facilities that accept biosolids, septage, or other sludges, each waste source must not exceed the pollutant\nconcentrations found in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart, unless the\nwaste source is a minor (less than ten percent of the total dry weight of\nsludges accepted) component of the input to the facility and a program is\ndeveloped to identify and reduce the pollutant(s) that exceed the limits for\nthat waste source. This requirement does not apply to products used outside New\n\nYork State. (a) If a waste input, other than\na minor source, contains metals at concentrations greater than those set forth\nin Table 6 of section\n361-3.9, the waste cannot be\naccepted at the facility until the generator has implemented a pollutant\nidentification and abatement program and compliance has been demonstrated for\nwaste representing a period of at least six continuous months. At least six\nanalyses for total solids and the parameter of concern must be provided to\ndemonstrate compliance. This requirement does not apply to products used\noutside New York State. (b) Wastewater and partially treated biosolids that are generated at one wastewater\ntreatment facility and are further treated at another wastewater treatment\nfacility before composting are not considered separate waste sources subject to\nthe criteria in this paragraph. The resultant biosolids or sludge generated for\ncomposting are subject to this paragraph. (ix)\n\nAny material added to the process must\nnot contain pollutants in concentrations that exceed the levels found in Table\n6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (4)\n\nMonitoring requirements. (i) Analysis of the product, other than yard\ntrimmings compost, is required for the parameters in Table 1 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart.

With the exception of pH and total solids, all results must be\nreported on a dry weight basis. (a) Each\nsample must be a composite of at least five grab samples. (b) After the product has been monitored for\ntwo years at the frequency outlined in this paragraph, the department can\nreduce the annual number of analyses required if the product quality\nconsistently meets the product quality standards in Table 6 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (ii)\n\nSufficient monitoring data\nmust be obtained to demonstrate compliance with the pathogen and vector\nattraction reduction requirements, if applicable. The frequency and type of\nmonitoring necessary, based on the methods employed to achieve pathogen and\nvector attraction reduction, will be determined by the department. At a\nminimum, if temperature monitoring is required, it must occur daily in the\ncoldest part of the waste mass. (iii)\n\nThe department can require, on a\ncase-specific basis, testing of the compost for maturity before distribution. This can include, but is not limited to, potential for reheating, organic\nmatter reduction, plant growth impact, or oxygen consumption. (iv)\n\nEach biosolids, septage, and sludge\nsource must be analyzed each year in accordance with the following: (a) The required parameters for analysis are\nfound in Table 1 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (b) The minimum number of analyses required\ndepends on the quantity of waste composted, as outlined in Table 3 of section\n361-3.9\nof this Subpart. (c) With the exception of pH and total\nsolids, all results must be reported on a dry weight basis.
