  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-8.2 - Computation of the unabsorbed net operating loss (UNOL)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The \"unabsorbed net operating loss\"\n(UNOL) means the unabsorbed portion of net operating loss (NOL) as calculated\nunder section 208(9)(f) or section 1453(k-1) as such sections were in effect on\n\nDecember 31, 2014, that was not deductible in previous taxable years (including\nthe base year) and was eligible for carryover on the last day of the base year, including any NOL sustained by the corporation during the base year. The\ncomputation of such UNOL is subject to the rules in subdivisions (b) through\n(e) of this section. (b) To compute\nthe UNOL, the rules in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision must be\nfollowed. (1)\n\nFederal and New York State NOLs\navailable for carryover. A corporation must first compute its Federal and New\n\nYork State NOLs available for carryover, from taxable years beginning before\n\nJanuary 1, 2015, as of the last day of such corporation's base year (Federal\nand New York State NOLs available for carryover), by applying the following\nrules: (i) NOLs are carried back and carried\nforward to taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015, and included in the\ndetermination of deductible NOLs, as well as remaining NOLs available for\ncarryover, subject to NOL deduction limitations, as set forth in either section\n208(9)(f) and Subpart 3-8 of this Part or section 1453(k-1), whichever is\napplicable as such provisions were in effect and applicable on December 31, 2014. NOLs available for carryover do not include any NOLs that were deductible\nin a taxable year beginning prior to January 1, 2015, regardless of whether or\nnot the corporation actually deducted the NOL. However, if the amount of NOL\nactually deducted in any taxable year is greater than the amount deductible, the NOL available for carryover is reduced by the excess amount deducted. When\ncomputing the amount of NOLs available for carryover, New York State NOLs must\nbe applied against ENI to reduce ENI to zero or the greatest extent possible, regardless of the tax base on which the franchise tax was actually\npaid. (ii)\n\nIf the carryforward\nperiod for an NOL, as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, ends\nprior to, or on, the last day of the corporation's base year, no portion of\nsuch NOL is included in the NOLs available for carryover. (2)\n\nEligible NOL carryover amounts. After\ncomputing its Federal and New York State NOLs available for carryover, the\ncorporation must then compute its Federal and New York State carryover amounts\nas of the last day of the corporation's base year (its eligible NOL carryover\namounts), to be used in the computation of the UNOL, by applying the following\nrules and limitations in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph. (i) A corporation's Federal and New York\n\nState NOLs available for carryover are included in the eligible Federal and New\n\nYork State NOL carryover amount, respectively, only when there is both a\n\nFederal and New York State NOL sustained in the same taxable year and available\nfor carryover as of the last day of the corporation's base year. (ii)\nA corporation's Federal NOL sustained in\na separate return limitation year (SRLY) beginning before January 1, 2015, and\nany corresponding New York State NOL, that was not deductible in taxable years\nbeginning before January 1, 2015, and that was available for carryover as of\nthe last day of the corporation's base year, is included in its entirety in the\neligible Federal and New York State NOL carryover amount, respectively, subject\nto the rules in this section. (iii)\n\nIf, under IRC section 381, a corporation, in a taxable year beginning prior to\n\nJanuary 1, 2015, succeeded to the tax attributes, including Federal NOL\ncarryovers, of another corporation, and the acquiring or successor corporation\nalso succeeded to the New York State NOL carryovers of the acquired or\npredecessor corporation, then any such Federal and New York State NOLs that\nwere not deductible by the acquiring or successor corporation in taxable years\nbeginning before January 1, 2015, and that were available for carryover as of\nthe last day of the corporation's base year, are included in their entirety in\nthe eligible Federal and New York State NOL carryover amounts, respectively, subject to the rules in this section. (iv)\nA corporation's Federal NOLs subject to\nthe limitations imposed by IRC section 382 as a result of an ownership change\n(pre-change losses) that were not deductible in taxable years beginning before\n\nJanuary 1, 2015, and that were available for carryover as of the last day of\nthe corporation's base year, are included in the eligible Federal NOL carryover\namount, subject to the rules in this section, but only to the extent that such\npre-change losses, in the aggregate, that relate to such ownership change, do\nnot exceed the amount computed as follows: (a) the applicable annual IRC section 382\nlimitation for a post-change year for such ownership change, multiplied by 20; less\n(b) any such pre-change losses\nthat were deductible in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015. Such\namount shall be computed separately for each ownership change. (v) In the case of a corporation\noperating on a cooperative basis under IRC section 1381 that is taxable under\narticle 9-A or article 32 for its base year, the corporation's Federal\npatronage and non-patronage source NOLs, and the corporation's New York State\npatronage and non-patronage source NOLs, respectively, that were not deductible\nin taxable years beginning before January 1, 2015, and that were available for\ncarryover as of the last day of the corporation's base year, are combined and\nincluded in the eligible Federal and New York State NOL carryover amount, respectively, subject to the rules in this section. (c) (1)\n\nAfter applying all other rules and\nlimitations in this section to compute the eligible Federal and New York State\nNOL carryover amount, respectively, whichever of the two eligible NOL carryover\namounts (Federal or New York State) is the lesser amount is the corporation's\nUNOL. (2)\n\nWhen subparagraph (v) of\nparagraph (2) of subdivision (b) of this section applies, for purposes of\napplying the limitation under paragraph (1) of this subdivision to eligible\n\nFederal and New York State NOL carryover amounts to compute a corporation's\nUNOL, a corporation's eligible Federal NOL carryover amount arising from\n\nFederal NOLs subject to IRC section 382 limitations is used to apply such\nlimitation to any corresponding eligible New York State NOL carryover amount, and a corporation's eligible Federal NOL carryover amount arising from Federal\nNOLs not subject to IRC section 382 limitations is used to apply such\nlimitation to any corresponding eligible New York State NOL carryover amount. The corporation's UNOL is then the sum of the following amounts: (i) the lesser of the eligible Federal or New\n\nYork State NOL carryover amounts arising from Federal NOLs subject to IRC\nsection 382 limitations; and\n(ii)\nthe lesser of the eligible Federal or New York State NOL carryover amounts\narising from Federal NOLs not subject to IRC section 382 limitations. (d) In computing the\nUNOL of a corporation that was included in a combined report for the base year, the UNOL of the base year combined group first is computed in accordance with\nsubdivisions (a) through (c) of this section, substituting combined group for\ncorporation. Each corporation included in the base year combined group then\nmust compute its own UNOL for its base year, by multiplying the base year\ncombined group's UNOL by a percentage that represents that base year combined\ngroup member's contribution of losses to the base year combined group's UNOL. Such percentage is calculated by: (1)\ndividing\nthe total New York State NOLs of the corporation by the total New York State\nNOLs of all members of the combined group having such New York State NOLs (to\nthe extent such New York State NOLs are included in the eligible New York State\nNOL carryover amount of the base year combined group in accordance with this\nsection); and\n(2)\nmultiplying the\nresult by one hundred.
