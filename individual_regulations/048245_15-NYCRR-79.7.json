  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.7 - Official inspection station licenses\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Inspections will be made only by official inspection stations currently\nlicensed by the commissioner. Certificates of inspection and inspection\nrejection notices will be issued only by official inspection stations currently\nlicensed by the commissioner. Before issuing licenses to such stations, the\ncommissioner, after appropriate inquiry and investigation, must be satisfied\nthat the station is properly equipped and has in its employ at least one\nfull-time employee who is an appropriately certified motor vehicle inspector to\nconduct the type of inspections for which the station is licensed. Before being\nissued a license to inspect vehicles for the public, a station must be\nregistered with the commissioner as a repair shop. (b) Each application for a new license to\noperate an official inspection station must be made on a form prescribed by the\ncommissioner and must be accompanied by an application fee of $25, which is not\nrefundable. If the application is approved, a license will be issued upon\npayment of an additional fee of $5 for each month or fraction thereof from the\ndate of issuance to its expiration date, but in no event shall the fee for one\nyear exceed $50 or $100 for two years. In the event that an applicant desires\nto establish inspection facilities at locations which the commissioner\nconsiders as separate and different locations, a separate application must be\nmade and a separate fee paid for each location. (c) Inspection fees. (1)\n\nAn inspection station may charge a fee\nwhich may not exceed, but may be less than, the fee set by the following\nschedule: VEHICLE GROUPS\nINSPECTION FEES\nMaximum gross weight (MGW) is the weight of the\nvehicle, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate. Seating capacity\nis the number of passengers that may be transported in the vehicle, as\nindicated on the vehicle registration certificate. The MGW and the seating\ncapacity are used to determine the applicable motor vehicle safety inspection. If a motor vehicle that is not registered in this State is presented for\ninspection, it must be inspected as if it were or as it will be registered in\nthis State. GROUP 1\n(a) (1) Safety inspection of all motor vehicles that\nhave a seating capacity, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under 15 passengers, and all motor vehicles, except trailers and motorcycles, that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, under\n10,001 pounds. $10\n(2) Safety inspection of all motor vehicles, except\ntrailers and motorcycles, that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle\nregistration certificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, except\nwhen the registrant requests a heavy vehicle inspection. $15\n(b) Safety inspection of all trailers, except\nsemi-trailers, that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration\ncertificate, under 18,001 pounds, except those trailers that have a MGW, as\nindicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 10,000 pounds and under\n18,001 pounds, when the registrant requests a heavy vehicle inspection. $ 6\nGROUP 2\n(a) (1) Safety inspection of all motor vehicles that\nhave a seating capacity, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 14 passengers, all motor vehicles, except trailers, that have a MGW, as\nindicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 18,000 pounds, those\nmotor vehicles, except trailers, that have a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle\nregistration certificate, over 10,000 pounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the\nregistrant requests a heavy vehicle inspection. $20\n(2) All trailers that have a MGW, as indicated on the\nvehicle registration certificate, over 18,000 pounds, and those trailers that\nhave a MGW, as indicated on the vehicle registration certificate, over 10,000\npounds and under 18,001 pounds, when the registrant requests a heavy vehicle\ninspection. $12\n(b) All semi-trailers. $12\nGROUP 3\n\nMotorcycles\n$ 6\n\nEmissions inspection fees (includes low enhanced, OBD\nII and diesel)\nOBD II Emissions Inspection (performed at an\ninspection station located within the NYMA)\n$27\nOBD II Emissions Inspection (performed at an\ninspection station located outside the NYMA)\n$11\n\nLow enhanced emissions inspection\n$11\n\nDiesel emissions inspection (smoke opacity test)\n$25\n(2)\n-(3)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(4)\n\nInspection fees are not subject to State and local sales tax. All fees listed\ninclude the cost of the inspection certificate. (5)\n\nIf a licensed inspection station desires\nto inspect vehicles in groups other than those for which they are licensed, such station must first notify the commissioner who may approve such change\nafter appropriate inquiry and investigation to determine that the station\npossesses qualified personnel, proper equipment and sufficient building\narea. (6)\n\nIf a vehicle fails a\nsafety and/or emissions inspection, and is not removed from the station for\nrepair, there shall be no charge for reinspection of the vehicle. A test drive\nby station personnel for the purposes of diagnosis or verification of repair\ndoes not constitute removal from the station. (7)\n\nAn official emissions inspection station\nmust perform both the safety and low enhanced emission or OBD II emission\nportions of an inspection on all vehicles subject to emissions inspection\npresented to them (except for reinspections). (i) Vehicles that are subject to the OBD II\ninspection may receive the safety and OBD II inspection at an official\nemissions inspection station located outside of the NYMA and do not need a\ntemporary certificate of emissions waiver (form VS-1078). All diesel-powered\nvehicles subject to diesel emissions inspection (smoke opacity test) with\n\"DEMA\" printed on the registration document may receive the safety and diesel\nemissions inspection at a diesel emissions inspection station located outside\nof the NYMA (provided the station is licensed to perform the appropriate safety\ninspection) and do not need a temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form\nVS-1078). All diesel-powered vehicles subject to diesel emissions inspection\n(smoke opacity test) with \"DEMA\" printed on the registration document may\nreceive the safety inspection at an inspection station that is other than a\ndiesel emissions inspection station and geographically located outside of the\nNYMA (provided the station is licensed to perform the appropriate safety\ninspection), if a temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form VS-1078) is\npresented to the station. (8)\n\nAn official inspection station outside\nthe NYMA, which is not an official diesel inspection station, may only inspect\na vehicle subject to the diesel emissions inspection if the operator of the\nvehicle presents a valid temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form\nVS-1078). (d) Official\ninspection station licenses are not transferable. Where a change occurs in the\nownership of a station, except as set forth in subdivision (e) of this section, a new application accompanied by the prescribed fee must be made by the new\nowner. A change of location, without a change in ownership, where the\ncommissioner considers such a change as being to a separate, new and different\nlocation, requires an amendment setting forth the new location. This amendment\nmust be submitted at least 30 days prior to the facility changing location. The\ncommissioner may waive the 30-day requirement in the case of extreme\nemergencies, such as natural disasters or eviction, and may in such cases issue\na temporary permit to operate an official inspection station at the new\nlocation, pending final review of the amendment application. If the department\nhas not conducted an on-site investigation of the proposed new location within\n30 days of receipt of the amendment application, a temporary permit to operate\nat that new location may be granted until the investigation takes place. A\ntemporary permit issued pursuant to this subdivision shall remain in effect for\nno longer than 60 days. The commissioner must be notified in writing of a\nchange of name without a change of ownership or locations and in such event no\nfee is required. (e) The\ncommissioner must be notified immediately in writing if there is a change in\nthe members of a partnership. A license in the names of two or more persons as\npartners or otherwise shall not expire on change of ownership, as long as one\nperson named as a partner remains the owner or part owner. This policy applies\nwhere two or more partners increase the number of partners, but does not apply\nwhere an individual forms a partnership nor where a corporation is involved. Corporations must notify the commissioner immediately, in writing, of any\ncorporation officer changes. (f) Approval of applications for inspection station license. The commissioner reserves the right to determine the\nmaximum number of public official emissions inspection stations that may be\nlocated in any county. The factors used to make this determination include: the\ntotal number of motor vehicles that are registered in any given county of the\n\nState; the total number of public official emissions inspection stations that\nare located in any given county of the State; motorist waiting times for\ninspections; and any other factors that the commissioner finds are materially\nand substantially related to making such determination. Such determination\nshall be re-assessed on an annual basis. If the maximum number of public\nofficial emissions inspection stations is reached in any county, the\ncommissioner may refuse to approve an application for an original public\nofficial emissions inspection station license and may refuse to approve an\napplication for an amendment for a public official emissions inspection station\nchange of location, and shall place any such application on a waiting list. Any\napplication fees or inspection station license fees for applications that are\nnot approved pursuant this subdivision shall be returned to the applicant. If\nthe number of public official emissions inspection stations falls below the\nmaximum in any county, an application for an original public official emissions\ninspection station license or an application for an amendment for a change of\nlocation that has been on the waiting list for the greatest length of time\nshall be reviewed by commissioner. The department shall post on its public\nwebsite a summary of its findings regarding the number of public inspection\nstations that shall be permitted in each county. Notwithstanding the provisions\nof this subdivision, the commissioner shall accept an application for review\nif: (1)\nthe application is for the\nrenewal of a public official emissions inspection station license; or\n(2)\na registered new motor vehicle dealer, as\ndefined in Vehicle and Traffic Law section 415(1)(f), or a new motor vehicle\ndealer applicant, submits an application for an original public official\nemissions inspection station license or an amendment application for a change\nof location for one public official emissions inspection station license that\nis owned by and/or operated in conjunction with such dealer; or\n(3)\nan original application for a public\nofficial emissions inspection station license is received from a person who\npurchased a facility from another person, and such facility had a public\nofficial emissions inspection station license in good standing at the time of\nsale. For the purposes of this paragraph, in good standing\nmeans that, at the time of the sale: the facility's license is not suspended or\nrevoked; the facility does not owe any outstanding civil penalties; the\nfacility has no hearings or appeals pending before the department; and the\nfacility has no litigation pending in which the department is a named party; or\n(4)\na licensee submits an\namendment application for a change of location, and the change of location is\nwithin the same county, or within five miles of the current location. This\nparagraph shall not apply to licensees covered by paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision; or\n(5)\nthe\ncommissioner determines that there is a need for an inspection station in a\nspecific geographic region within a county due to consumer factors, including\nbut not limited to, distance and travel time between stations. If an\napplication is approved pursuant to this paragraph, no subsequent application\nfor change of location that is greater than five miles from the original\nlocation will be accepted for a period of five years. (g) A fleet or dealer inspection license will\nnot be issued or renewed for a facility owner who already possesses a public\ninspection license at that location. A holder of a fleet or dealer license who\nwishes to obtain a public inspection license must surrender the fleet or dealer\ninspection license upon issuance of the public inspection license. (h) In order to perform emissions\ninspections, a station must be licensed as an official emissions inspection\nstation and be staffed and equipped to conduct safety and emissions inspections\npursuant to these regulations. This subdivision does not apply to official\ninspection stations restricted to the inspection of trailers, motorcycles, or\nany vehicles exempt from the emission inspection requirement. (i) In order to perform diesel emissions\ninspections, a station must be licensed as an official diesel emissions\ninspection station and be staffed and equipped to conduct safety and diesel\nexhaust inspection pursuant to these regulations. This subdivision does not\napply to official inspection stations restricted to the inspection of trailers, motorcycles, or any vehicles exempt from the emission inspection\nrequirement. (j) A new motor\nvehicle dealer who is applying for a provisional dealer registration may\nconcurrently apply for an official inspection station provisional license\n(hereinafter referred to as provisional license). The application for a\nprovisional license shall be filed in such form and detail as the commissioner\nshall prescribe, and shall be filed concurrently with the original application\nfor an official inspection station license and new motor vehicle dealer and\nrepair shop registration. If an application for a provisional license is\ndenied, the applicant shall not be entitled to an appeal or hearing regarding\nthe denial. (1)\n\nThe holder of a provisional\nlicense shall be granted the same rights and privileges as are granted to the\nholder of an official inspection station license, except that the commissioner\nmay suspend a provisional license for the same reasons that an official\ninspection station license is subject to suspension for a violation or\nviolations of this Part or of sections\n303\nor\n306\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law. If the provisional license is suspended pursuant\nto the provisions of this paragraph, the commissioner shall provide the\nprovisional licensee with actual notice of the suspension at least seven\ncalendar days prior to the effective date. The holder of the provisional\nlicense shall not be entitled to an appeal or hearing if such provisional\nlicense is suspended. The holder of a provisional license shall be subject to\nthe same rules and regulations that apply to the holder of an official\ninspection station license, except if such rules and regulations are\ninconsistent with the provisions of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe holder of a provisional license who\nhas purchased or acquired, or who plans to purchase or acquire, the place of\nbusiness from a registered new motor vehicle dealer: (i) shall not conduct inspections in the name\nof the selling or transferring new motor vehicle dealer; (ii)\nshall not use any unused certificate of\ninspection that had been issued to the selling or transferring registered new\nmotor vehicle dealer by the department; (iii)\nshall display the provisional license\nin a conspicuous manner. (3)\n\nIf a new motor vehicle dealer with a\nprovisional license purchases or acquires a place of business from a registered\nnew motor vehicle dealer, then within 30 business days of the issuance of the\nprovisional license, the dealer must ensure that the official inspection\nstation license and all unused certificates of inspection that had been issued\nto the selling or transferring inspection station are surrendered to the\ndepartment or are accounted for. (4)\n\nIf the commissioner has suspended a\nprovisional license, or if a provisional license has expired, and the dealer\nthat held such provisional license has not obtained a valid official inspection\nstation license, then all official inspection station operations at that\nlocation shall immediately cease, and the dealer shall surrender the\nprovisional license, and all unused certificates of inspection to the\ndepartment. (5)\n\nThe holder of a\nprovisional license must meet all of the remaining requirements for the\nissuance of an official inspection station license within 30 days of the\nissuance of the provisional license. (6)\n\nThe provisional license shall expire 60\ndays from the date of issuance of such license or when the department completes\nits investigation related to the application for an inspection station license, whichever is later. (7)\n\nThe holder\nof a provisional license must notify the department immediately if the opening\nof the dealership is cancelled and such holder must return all supplies within\n10 days. Notes\nN.Y.
