  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 362-5.2 - Eligibility of claims paid for reimbursement from the stop loss funds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For each contract eligible for reimbursement from a given stop loss fund, health maintenance organizations and participating insurers shall record and aggregate claims paid on a per member basis. Reimbursement from the applicable stop loss fund shall be calculated based on such per member aggregates. (b) Health maintenance organizations and participating insurers shall be eligible for reimbursement of 90 percent of claims paid within the applicable claims corridor on behalf of each member covered under an individual enrollee direct payment contract, an individual enrollee out- of-plan direct payment contract, a qualifying group health insurance contract and a qualifying individual health insurance contract. (c) Health maintenance organizations and participating insurers shall not be entitled to any reimbursement on behalf of a covered member if the claims paid on behalf of that member in a given calendar year do not, in the aggregate, reach the applicable claims threshold. Additionally, claims paid on behalf of a covered member which exceed the claims corridor in a given calendar year shall not be eligible for reimbursement from the stop loss funds. (d) Claims paid within a calendar year shall be determined by the date of payment rather than the date of service or date the claim was incurred. No health maintenance organization or participating insurer shall delay or defer payment of a claim solely for the purpose of causing the date of payment to fall into a subsequent calendar year. (e) Claims paid shall not include interest paid out by a health maintenance organization or participating insurer pursuant to section\n3224-a (c)\nof the Insurance Law. (f) Claims paid which are not submitted for reimbursement prior to April first of the calendar year following the year in which they are paid shall not be eligible for reimbursement from the stop loss funds and shall not be credited as paid claims in any year for the purpose of determining whether the claims threshold has been reached. If the superintendent determines that the claims data submitted in conjunction with a reimbursement request is insufficient to make a reimbursement determination, the superintendent or the stop loss fund administrator shall make a request for clarification of the data or for the submission of additional data. Health maintenance organizations and participating insurers shall comply with all such requests within 15 business days. If a health maintenance organization or participating insurer fails to comply with such a request from the superintendent or the stop loss fund administrator within 15 business days, the superintendent may in his discretion deem any affected claims ineligible for reimbursement. (g) For individual enrollee direct payment contracts and individual enrollee out-of-plan direct payment contracts, claims paid shall not include claims paid prior to January 1, 2000. For qualifying group health insurance contracts and qualifying individual health insurance contracts, claims paid shall not include claims paid prior to January 1, 2001. (h) Claims paid shall include capitation payments which can be directly attributed to securing the services of a given provider or provider group on behalf of a member covered under an individual enrollee direct payment contract or an individual enrollee out-of-plan direct payment contract. (i) Claims paid may include regional covered lives assessments paid pursuant to section\n2807-t\nof the Public Health Law or percentage surcharges paid pursuant to section\n2807-j\nor section\n2807-s\nof the Public Health Law, but shall not include amounts paid in satisfaction of 24 percent surcharge requirement set forth in section\n2807-j (2)(b)(i)(B)\nof the Public Health Law. Health maintenance organizations and participating insurers which include the covered lives assessments shall convert the family covered lives assessment into a per member assessment component in order to be included with claims expenses attributable to any one member. (j) If a health maintenance organization writes the out-of-network portion of their individual enrollee out-of-plan direct payment contract through an affiliate insurer, then the claims paid by that insurer may be credited in determining whether the health maintenance organization is eligible for reimbursement from the stop loss fund on behalf of the covered member.
