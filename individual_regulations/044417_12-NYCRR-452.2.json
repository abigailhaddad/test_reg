  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 452.2 - Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nWithin two weeks after The State\n\nInsurance Fund has, in writing, made known to the insured or potential insured\nthe differential assigned to the insured's policy, or proposed to be assigned\nto a prospective policy, or within such additional time as The State Insurance\n\nFund may allow in writing, the insured may protest such differential assignment\nby delivering to the executive director of The State Insurance Fund a written\nprotest setting forth the basis for the insured's or prospective insured's\nchallenge. Such written protest shall be accompanied by any documentation and\nsworn statements the insured desires to have considered in support of his\nchallenge. (2)\n\nThe documents and\nstatements so submitted by the insured or proposed insured shall specifically\nset forth the specific reasons upon which his challenge is based, and shall\nfurther set forth that charge which he contends would be a fair and reasonable\ndifferential charge, giving due regard to the nature and hazards of his\nbusiness or operations, his prior loss experience, his prior and presently\nexisting safety practices, his prior premium payment history, the number of\npersons he employes in such business or operations and the specific type of\nwork they perform, his prior and current compliance with obligations imposed\nupon him by the Workers' Compensation Law and other laws which require premium\nor other payments by him on the basis of earnings and other remuneration earned\nby persons engaged in the furtherance of his enterprise or enterprises, statements of his prompt and complete reporting of accidents and claims, and\nsuch other factors as may be relevant to the appraisal of the insured or\nproposed insured as a risk in whole and in light of the accident and moral\nhazards involved. The failure to set forth any of such data shall go to the\nweight of the submission and, in an appropriate case, and in the exercise of\ndiscretion, such failure may be deemed a basis for rejection of the protest in\ntoto. (b) Upon receipt\nof such written protest and any accompanying documentation or statements, the\nexecutive director shall refer copies thereof to the chairman, to be designated\nby the executive director, of a three-member committee consisting of The State\n\nInsurance Fund's officers holding the following titles, or the immediate\nsubordinate or designee of any such officer: (1)\n\nThe General Attorney; (2)\n\nFirst Deputy Executive Director; and\n(3)\n\nDirector of Field\n\nServices. (c) The\nchairman of such committee shall refer one copy of the insured's or prospective\ninsured's protest and accompanying documents to the underwriting director of\n\nThe State Insurance Fund, who shall himself or through the assistant\nunderwriting director review the same in conjunction with pertinent State Fund\nfiles and documents and, within 10 business days, he shall advise the chairman\nin writing whether the differential as assigned should be continued, modified, or removed entirely, giving specific reasons for such recommendation. The\noriginal or copies of all documents upon which such recommendation is based\nshall be submitted to the chairman, who shall promptly make the same available\nfor review by members of the committee, along with copies of the insured's or\nprospective insured's initial written protest. (d) Within 10 business days after the\nsubmission, to the chairman, of the underwriting director's recommendations, the committee will meet, and on the basis of all papers and documents before\nthem, after due deliberation, take either one of the following actions: (1)\nin writing, confirm, modify, or entirely\nremove the differential originally assigned, or reject the submission as\ndefective for reasons which shall be clearly specified; or\n(2)\nin writing, request the insured or\nprospective insured either to furnish additional written information and/or to\nappear before the committee in person at a specified date, with such of the\ninsured's or prospective insured's employees or independent professional\nassistants as the insured or prospective insured desires, to give additional or\nother information to the committee as might be specified. Within 10 days after\nsuch appearance, or within 10 days after the submission of any additional\ninformation or documentation called for by the committee, or within 10 days\nafter the termination of any deadline specified by the committee for the\nsubmission of information, the committee shall in writing either confirm, modify, or entirely remove the differential originally assigned. (e) Determinations by the\ncommittee shall take into account the factors mentioned in paragraph (a)(2) of\nthis section and the candor and cooperation of the insured in disclosing to The\n\nState Insurance Fund all pertinent information relevant to the insured's\nbusiness or operations. (f) The\nconcurrence of two or more members of the committee in the determination as to\nany issue before it shall be deemed the determination of the committee. Such\ndetermination shall be effective three business days following the filing of\nthe written report thereof with the executive director and the underwriting\ndirector, provided that, within such three-day period, written notice thereof\nshall be given to the insured or prospective insured by regular mail. (g) Such determination by the committee as to\nany such issue shall be the final determination of The State Insurance Fund and\nthe rights of any insured or prospective insured to a further review of such\ndetermination shall be only by means of resort to judicial review, and to the\nextent permitted by article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. (h) (1)\n\nThe\nprocedures afforded insureds hereunder shall not be used as a device for\ndelaying or avoiding payment of either deposit premiums or earned premiums. As\na condition precedent to any insured seeking review of a differential assigned\nby the State Fund, such insured must have made full payment of any deposit and\nearned premiums billed, including payments for all periods of coverage prior to\nand subsequent to the period to which the protest relates. (2)\nA challenge by an insured to a\ndifferential by the means herein specified will not be entertained if the\ninsured is withholding payment to The State Insurance Fund of any deposit or\nearned premium billed or assessed. Nothing herein provided shall be deemed to\nprevent or stay the cancellation of a policy of insurance in case of a default\nin any payment required by an insured to be made to The State Insurance\n\nFund. (i) If any\ndifferential is either reduced or eliminated entirely by the committee, any\npremium payments which had been allocated to the differentials so reduced or\neliminated shall be credited against any unpaid premium due to the State Fund\nby the insured or, if there be no such unpaid premium, the appropriate premium\nrefund shall be made to the insured.
