  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 620.2 - General procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever the commissioner finds, after an investigation, that any person is\ncausing, engaging in or maintaining a condition or activity which, in the\njudgment of the commissioner: (1)\npresents an\nimminent danger to the health or welfare of the people of the State, or results\nin or is likely to result in irreversible or irreparable damage to natural\nresources; and\n(2)\nrelates to the\nprevention and abatement powers of the commissioner in that the condition or\nactivity pertains to or affects any of the objectives or goals of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, or relates to any of the permit, licensing, or\nregulatory programs of the Department; so that it appears to be prejudicial to\nthe interest of the people of the State to delay action until an opportunity\nfor hearing can be provided, the commissioner may, without prior hearing or\nnotice, order such person to discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or\nactivity. (b) Such order\nmay be oral, telephonic, in writing, or in such other form as will, in the\ncommissioner's judgment give reasonable notice to the person. Notice which is\nnot given in writing will be supplemented as soon as is practicable thereafter\nwith a written summary abatement order. A written summary abatement order shall\nstate the grounds upon which the order is based, and shall be accompanied by\nevidence documenting the material facts supporting the order. (c) Upon receipt of the commissioner's\nsummary abatement order, it shall thereafter be the duty of the respondent to\nimmediately discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition or activity pursuant\nto the terms of said order. Failure to do so shall constitute a violation of\nthe order and of these regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n620.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
