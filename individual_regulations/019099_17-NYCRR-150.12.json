  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 150.12 - Maintenance of nonconforming signs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The provisions of this section are intended to establish the criteria\nand requirements for the classification as a nonconforming sign for the\npurposes of the outdoor advertising control statutes and regulations\npromulgated thereunder. Four categories of nonconforming signs are affected by\nthis section: (1)\nnonconforming signs within\n660 feet of the right-of-way on the interstate or primary system; (2)\nnonconforming signs beyond 660 feet of\nthe right-of-way outside of urban areas on the interstate and primary\nsystem; (3)\nlandmark signs, as\nestablished in section\n150.11\nof this Part; and\n(4)\ngrandfathered signs, as defined in\nsection\n150.1\nof this Part. When maintenance ceases in any of these categories, there\nwill be a loss of nonconforming rights and removal will be required as a\nprohibited sign in accordance with subdivision 8 of section 88 of New York\n\nState Highway Law. (b) Requirements for maintenance and\ncontinuance of nonconforming signs. (1)\n\nThe\nsign must have been actually in existence at the time the outdoor advertising\ncontrol statutes or regulations promulgated thereunder became effective, as\ndistinguished from a contemplated use such as a lease or agreement with the\nproperty owner. (2)\n\nThe property\ninterest in the sign affected by the outdoor advertising control statutes or\nregulations promulgated thereunder must be substantial. Paper signs nailed to\ntrees, abandoned signs and similar type signs are not protected as\nnonconforming signs. (3)\n\nThe right\nto continue a nonconforming sign shall not be confined to a sign owner or any\none individual, firm, association or corporation so using the land. A\nnonconforming sign may be sold, leased, or the property interest therein\notherwise transferred without affecting its status. The location of a\nnonconforming sign shall not be changed without such sign losing its status as\na nonconforming sign. A nonconforming sign removed as a result of a\nright-of-way acquisition or for any other reason must be relocated in a\nconforming area, as a nonconforming use will not be permitted to be\nreestablished at a new location. (4)\n\nThe sign must have been lawfully erected\non the effective date of the outdoor advertising control statutes or the\nregulations promulgated thereunder, and must continue to be lawfully maintained\nif such sign became nonconforming due to the provisions of the outdoor\nadvertising control statutes. A sign which became nonconforming because of\nchanged conditions must have been lawfully erected under State law as of the\ndate of the changed conditions, and must continue to be lawfully\nmaintained. (5)\nA nonconforming\nsign may continue to exist as long as it is not changed. The nonconforming sign\nmust remain substantially the same as it was in existence on the effective date\nof the outdoor advertising control statutes, or on the date that it became\nnonconforming due to changed conditions. Except for maintaining under these\nrules and regulations, any extension or enlargement of a sign is a change in\nexisting use. Replacement, rebuilding or reerecting is a change in existing\nuse, except that a sign may be rebuilt or reerected if it has been vandalized, or subjected to other criminal or tortious acts, providing such rebuilding or\nreerecting does not exceed 60 percent of the current fair market value, considering any accrued depreciation of such sign. If the replacement costs of\nsuch a sign exceed 60 percent of current fair market value, considering any\naccrued depreciation, such sign shall be considered to be the establishment of\na new sign. The reasonable maintenance of a sign is not a change in existing\nuse. This includes the change of advertising message and normal upkeep and\nrepair of a sign structure. If the costs of customary maintenance and repairs\nexceed 15 percent of current fair market value, considering any accrued\ndepreciation, of a sign, such activity will no longer be considered to be\ncustomary maintenance and repair and such sign will be considered to have been\nthe establishment of a new sign and required to meet all applicable laws and\nregulations. (6)\n\nNo abandoned, destroyed or discontinued nonconforming sign that does not meet the\nrequirements set forth in paragraphs (1)-(5) of this subdivision shall be\npermitted to continue to exist, and such sign shall be classified as an illegal\nsign and prohibited. (i) An abandoned or\ndiscontinued sign is one: (a) which has\nobsolete message content; (b) which\nhas been blank for a period of nine consecutive months, except if a sign was\nblank as of September 1, 1978, it shall not be considered abandoned or\ndiscontinued until June 1, 1979; (c) where destruction of the sign has\noccurred and replacement costs exceed 60 percent of current fair market value, considering any accrued depreciation; or\n(d) for which the permit has not been renewed\nin accordance with section\n150.15\nof this Part. (7)\nA sign, even if\nblank, which is surrendered up to the State by the owner thereof for the\npurpose of acquisition by the State, and the State has accepted the offer of\nsurrendering-up in writing to the owner thereof, shall not be considered\nabandoned or discontinued. (8)\n\nReasonable maintenance, repair and restoration of a nonconforming sign is\npermitted to enable such sign to remain in good condition. Good condition means\na sign cannot be decayed, insecure, and must be in an upright position not in\ndanger of falling or in otherwise safe condition. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
