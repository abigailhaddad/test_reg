  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.14 - Returns\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1409, 1410, 1415(c), 1419(c)\n(a) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the grantor and\ngrantee must file a joint return for each conveyance whether or not tax is due. The return must be made on a form prescribed by the department. (2)\n\nThe filing of a joint return by the\ngrantor and grantee as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision is not\nrequired for a conveyance of an easement, or license to a public utility as\ndefined in subdivision 2 of section\n186-a\nof the Tax Law, if each of the\nfollowing conditions are met: (i) the\nconsideration for the easement or license is $2 or less; and\n(ii)\nsuch consideration is clearly stated in\nthe instrument of conveyance. (b) Except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of\nthis section, if a conveyance is to be recorded, the return must be filed with\nthe recording officer of the county where the conveyance is recorded. A\nrecording officer cannot record a conveyance unless the transfer tax return has\nbeen filed and any tax due has been paid. Recording officers are authorized to\ncollect the tax and accept returns only in those cases where an instrument\neffecting a conveyance of real property is presented for recording. The\nrecording officer must indicate the amount of tax paid on the return and on the\ninstrument presented for recording. If a conveyance is not recorded, or if the\nconveyance will be recorded after the time has expired for paying the tax, the\ntax return, together with any tax due, must be filed with the department at the\ntime indicated in subdivision (c) of this section. Upon receiving the return\nand any tax due, the department will issue upon request, a receipt to the\nperson filing the return evidencing the filing of the return and the payment of\ntax. For purposes of recording the instrument effecting the conveyance the\nrecording officer shall handle such receipt in the same manner as a return\nfiled with the recording officer. (c) The return is due and the tax must be\npaid no later than the 15th day after the date on which the instrument\neffecting the conveyance is delivered by the grantor to the grantee. For\npurposes of this Part, the date of the instrument is presumed to be the date of\ndelivery of the instrument. This presumption may be rebutted by the person\nliable for payment of the tax. (d) Where the conveyance is of real property situated in more than one county and\nthe instrument effecting the conveyance is to be recorded in more than one\ncounty, the return must be filed with, and the tax due paid to the recording\nofficer of the county where the instrument effecting the conveyance is first\nrecorded. At the request of the person presenting the instrument effecting the\nconveyance for recording, the recording officer must sign a copy of the\ninstrument and indicate on the copy that the required return has been filed and\nthe amount of tax paid. The endorsed copy of the instrument effecting the\nconveyance of real property may then be recorded by the recording officer of\nanother county. (e) Both the\ngrantor and grantee are required by statute to sign the return. If the\nconveyance has more than one grantor or grantee, all grantors and all grantees\nshall sign the return. Nonetheless, if any one of the grantors or grantees sign\nthe return, it will be accepted as a valid return by the recording officer and\nby the department. However, those grantors or grantees not signing the return\nare not relieved of any liability for the tax due and the period of limitations\nfor determination of tax due provided for in section\n575.15\n(b) of this Part does not apply to anyone who does not sign the return. (f) For good cause shown, the Commissioner\nmay grant an extension of time not exceeding three months within which to file\na return. An application for such extension must be made in writing prior to\nthe due date of the return. Where an extension of time is granted, the taxpayer\nis nevertheless required to file a tentative return on or before the due date\nof the return. The tentative return must show the estimated tax due and such\ntax must be paid at the time of filing of the tentative return. A final return\nmust be filed on or before the expiration date of the additional period of time\ngranted. The balance of the tax due plus interest thereon at the underpayment\nrate of interest prescribed by section\n575.20\nof this Part must be paid at the time of the filing of the final\nreturn. (g) Any tax return filed\nwith the department pursuant to subdivision (b) of this section should be\nmailed to the Department of Taxation and Finance, Transaction and Transfer Tax\n\nBureau, Real Estate Transfer Tax Section, Building 9, W. A. Harriman Campus, Albany, New York 12227. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n575.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
