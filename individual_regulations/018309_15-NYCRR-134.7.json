  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 134.7 - Criteria for issuance of a conditional license\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The issuance of a conditional license shall be denied to any person who enrolls\nin a program if a review of such person's driving record, or additional\ninformation secured by the department, indicates that any of the following\nconditions apply. (1)\n\nThe person has been\nconvicted of homicide, assault, criminal negligence or criminally negligent\nhomicide arising out of operation of a motor vehicle. (2)\n\nThe conviction, adjudication or finding\nupon which eligibility for a rehabilitation program is based involved a fatal\naccident. (3)\n\nThe person does not\nhave a currently valid New York State driver's license. This paragraph shall\nnot apply to a person whose New York State driver's license has expired, but is\nstill renewable, nor to a person who would have a currently valid New York\n\nState driver's license except for the revocation or suspension which resulted\nfrom the conviction, adjudication or finding upon which his eligibility for the\nrehabilitation program is based, nor to a person who would have a currently\nvalid New York State driver's license except for a suspension or revocation\nwhich resulted from a chemical test refusal arising out of the same incident as\nsuch conviction, adjudication or finding of a violation of section\n1192-a\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law\nsection. (4)\n\nThe person has been\nconvicted of an offense arising from the same event which resulted in the\ncurrent alcohol-related conviction, adjudication or finding which conviction\nwould, aside from the alcohol-related conviction, adjudication or finding\nresult in mandatory revocation or suspension of the person's driver's\nlicense. (5)\n\nThe person has had two\nor more revocations and/or suspensions of his driver's license, other than the\nrevocation or suspension upon which his eligibility for the rehabilitation\nprogram is based within the last three years. This subdivision shall not apply\nto suspensions which have been terminated by performance of an act by the\nperson, nor to a suspension or revocation resulting from a chemical test\nrefusal, if the person had been convicted of a violation of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law or found to be in violation of section 1192-a of\nsuch law arising out of the same incident. (6)\n\nThe person has been convicted more than\nonce of reckless driving within the last three years. (7)\n\nThe person has had a series of\nconvictions, incidents and/or accidents or has a medical or mental condition, which in the judgment of the commissioner or his designated agent tends to\nestablish that the person would be an unusual and immediate risk upon the\nhighway. (8)\n\nThe person has been\npenalized under section\n1193\n(1)(d)\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law for any\nviolation of subdivision 2, 2-a, 3, 4, or 4-a of section 1192 of such\nlaw. (9)\n\nThe person is reentering\nthe rehabilitation program, as provided in section\n134.10\n(c) of this\n\nPart, for a second or subsequent time. (10)\n\nRepealed\n(11)\n(i) The person has three or more alcohol- or drug-related driving convictions or\nincidents within the last 25 years. For the purposes of this paragraph, a\nconviction for a violation of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, and/or a finding of a violation of section\n1192-a of such law and/or a finding of refusal to submit to a chemical test\nunder section 1194 of such law arising out of the same incident shall only be\ncounted as one conviction or incident. The date of the violation or incident\nresulting in a conviction or a finding as described herein shall be used to\ndetermine whether three or more convictions or incidents occurred within a\n25-year period. (ii)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this paragraph, when determining eligibility for a conditional\nlicense issued pending prosecution pursuant to section\n134.18\nof this Part, the term\nincident shall include the arrest that resulted in the issuance of the\nsuspension pending prosecution. (12)\n\nThe person was the holder of a limited\nDJ or limited MJ license at the time of the violation which resulted in the\nsuspension or revocation. (13)\n\nThe\nperson, during the five years preceding the commission of the alcohol or drug-\nrelated offense or a finding of a violation of section\n1192-a\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law, participated in the alcohol and drug rehabilitation program or has been\nconvicted of a violation of any subdivision of section 1192 of such\nlaw. (b) If after a\nperson is enrolled in a rehabilitation program and has been issued a\nconditional license, but, prior to the reissuance of an unconditional license, information is received by the department which indicates that such person was\nnot eligible for a conditional license his conditional license will be\nrevoked.
