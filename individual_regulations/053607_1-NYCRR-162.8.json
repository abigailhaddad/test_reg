  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.8 - Topped carrot standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality carrots shall be carrots of similar\nvarietal characteristics which are well trimmed, firm, clean, fairly well\ncolored, fairly smooth, fairly well formed, provided 50 percent of the lot is\nwell formed; which are free from secondary new top growth and soft rot, and\nfree from damage caused by freezing, growth cracks, sunburn, pithiness, woodiness, internal discoloration, oil spray, dry rot, other disease, insects\nor other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nSimilar varietal characteristics means\nthat the carrots in any lot are of the same general type. For example, carrots\nwith a short, but blunt growth like the Oxheart variety, shall not be mixed\nwith long or half-long carrots like the Imperator or Danvers\nvarieties. (2)\n\nWell trimmed means\nthat the tops are cut back to not more than 3/4 inch in length, except that new\nleaves developing within the original central cluster of leaf stems, or\noccasional uncut leaves or leaf stems, exceeding this length which do not\nmaterially affect the appearance of the individual carrot shall be permitted. Carrots may have tips of roots cut or broken off: provided, that these cuts or\nbreaks are small and fairly smooth and do not materially affect the appearance\nof the individual carrot. (3)\n\nFairly uniform means not more than 20 percent of the carrots in individual\nsamples vary in length more than two inches, or in diameter more than 3/4\ninches. (4)\n\nFirm means that the\ncarrot is not soft, flabby or shriveled. (5)\n\nClean means that the individual carrot is\npractically free from dirt and other foreign matter. (6)\n\nFairly well colored means that the carrot\nhas an orange, orange red, or orange scarlet color, but not a pale orange or\ndistinct yellow color. (7)\n\nFairly\nsmooth means that the individual carrot is not rough, ridged, or covered with\nsecondary rootlets to the extent that the appearance is materially\naffected. (8)\n\nWell formed means\nthat the individual carrot is not forked, or misshapen to the extent that the\nappearance is more than slightly affected. (9)\n\nSecondary new top growth means the leaves\nor clusters of leaves which have developed outside the original central cluster\nof leaf stems. (10)\n\nDamage means\nany specific defect described in this section; or an equally objectionable\nvariation of any one of these defects, any other defect, or any combination of\ndefects, which materially detracts from the appearance, or the edible or\nshipping quality of the individual carrot or the appearance of the sample as a\nwhole, or which cannot be removed without a loss of more than five percent, by\nweight, in the ordinary preparation for use. The following specific defects\nshall be considered as damage: (i) growth\ncracks which are not shallow or smooth, or which materially detract from the\nappearance of the individual carrot; and\n(ii)\nsunburn which causes a loss of more than\nfive percent, by weight, in the ordinary preparation for use, except that\nsuperficial light green color at the stem end which does not materially detract\nfrom the appearance of the carrot shall be permitted. (11)\n\nDiameter means the greatest dimension of\nthe carrot measure at right angles to the longitudinal axis. (12)\n\nFairly well formed means that the\nindividual carrot is not forked, or misshapen to the extent that the appearance\nis materially affected. (13)\n\nExcessively rough means that the individual carrot is rough or ridged to the\nextent that the appearance is seriously affected. (14)\n\nSeriously misshapen means that the\nindividual carrot is forked or misshapen to the extent that the appearance is\nseriously affected. (15)\n\nSerious\ndamage means any defect, or any combination of defects, which seriously\ndetracts from the appearance, or the edible or shipping quality of the\nindividual carrot or the appearance of the sample as a whole, or which cannot\nbe removed without a loss of more than 20 percent, by weight, in the ordinary\npreparation for use. (c) Size. (1)\n\nThe diameter of each carrot is not\nless that 3/4 inches or more than 1 1/2inches. (2)\n\nThe length is not less than five inches, unless specified as \"mini or baby\", whereas the maximum length will be five\ninches and the maximum diameter will be 3/4 inches. (3)\n\nIndividual samples shall be fairly\nuniform. (d) Tolerances. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and handling, the\nfollowing tolerances, by count, are provided as specified: (1)\n\nFor defects. Ten percent for carrots in\nany lot which fail to meet the requirements: provided, that not more than\none-half of this amount, or five percent, shall be allowed for defects causing\nserious damage, including therein not more than one percent for carrots\naffected by soft rot. (2)\n\nFor\noff-size. Five percent for carrots in any lot which are larger than the\nspecified maximum diameter, 10 percent for carrots in any lot which are smaller\nthan the specified minimum diameter or shorter than the specified minimum\nlength and 10 percent of the samples may fail to meet fairly uniform\nrequirement. (e) Application of tolerances. Individual samples shall not have more than double\nthe tolerance specified: provided, that not more than one carrot which is\nfrozen or affected by soft rot may be permitted in any package weighing\napproximately three pounds or less: and provided further, that the averages for\nthe entire lot are within the tolerances specified for the grade. Individual\nsamples may not contain less than 40 percent well formed. (f) Sample for grade determination. Each\nsample shall consist of 50 carrots. When individual packages contain at least\n50 carrots, the sample is drawn from one package; when individual packages\ncontain less than 50 carrots, a sufficient number of adjoining packages are\nopened to form a 50 carrot sample. (g) Packing. Carrots must be packed in new 50\nor 25 pound film or mesh sacks, or master containers containing 48-one pound, 24-two pound or 10-five pound bags, or any other new standard packaging that is\nsubject to approval by the Department of Agriculture and Markets. Package\napproval shall be based upon the ability of the package to maintain the quality\nstandards and integrity of the product. (h) Markings. Each package of carrots\npackaged and offered for sale under the Seal of Quality shall have affixed the\nofficial seal designation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
