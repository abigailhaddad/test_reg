  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.197 - Control of the pressure of gas delivered from high pressure distribution systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the\nmaximum actual operating pressure of the distribution system is 60 psig (414\nkPa) or less and a service regulator having the following characteristics is\nused, no other pressure limiting device is required. (1)\n\nThe regulator is capable of reducing\ndistribution line pressure to pressures recommended for household\nappliances. (2)\n\nIt has a single\nport valve with proper orifice for the maximum gas pressure at the regulator\ninlet. (3)\n\nThe valve seat is made\nof resilient material designed to withstand abrasion by the gas, impurities in\ngas, cutting by the valve, and also to resist permanent deformation when it is\npressed against the valve port. (4)\n\nThe pipe connections to the regulator do not exceed two inches (51 millimeters)\nin diameter. (5)\n\nThe regulator, under normal operating conditions, is able to regulate the downstream pressure\nwithin the necessary limits of accuracy and to limit the build-up of pressure\nunder no- flow conditions to prevent a pressure that would cause the unsafe\noperation of any connected and properly adjusted gas utilization\nequipment. (6)\n\nThe regulator is\nself-contained with no external static or control lines. (7)\n\nThe regulator is of a type including a\nrelief valve which is vented to the atmosphere with the relief valve set to\nopen so that the pressure of the gas going to the customer does not exceed the\nmaximum safe pressure as established by this Part. (b) If the maximum actual operating pressure\nof the distribution system is 60 psig (414 kPa) or less, and a service\nregulator is used that does not have all of the characteristics listed in\nsubdivision (a) of this section or if the gas contains materials that seriously\ninterfere with the operation of service regulators, there must be suitable\nprotective devices to prevent unsafe overpressuring of the customer's\nappliances if the service regulator fails. (c) If the maximum actual operating pressure\nof the distribution system exceeds 60 psig (414 kPa), unless higher pressure is\nneeded by the customer or it is impractical or unsafe to regulate the pressure\noutside, one of the following methods must be used to regulate and limit the\npressure of gas delivered to the customer. (1)\nA service regulator having the characteristics listed in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, and another regulator located upstream from the service\nregulator. The upstream regulator may not be set to maintain a pressure higher\nthan 60 psig (414 kPa). A device must be installed between the upstream\nregulator and the service regulator to limit the pressure on the inlet of the\nservice regulator to 60 psig (414 kPa) or less in case the upstream regulator\nfails to function properly. This device may be either a relief valve or an\nautomatic shut-off that closes if the pressure on the inlet of the service\nregulator exceeds the set pressure (60 psig [414 kPa] or less), and remains\nclosed until manually reset. (2)\nA\nservice regulator and a monitoring regulator set to limit, to a maximum safe\nvalue, the pressure of the gas delivered to the customer. (3)\nA service regulator with a relief valve\nset to open so that the pressure of gas going to the customer does not exceed a\nmaximum safe value. The relief valve may either be built into the service\nregulator or it may be a separate unit installed downstream from the service\nregulator. Either of these combinations may be used alone only in those cases\nwhere the inlet pressure on the service regulator does not exceed the\nmanufacturer's safe working pressure rating of the service regulator, and may\nnot be used where the inlet pressure on the service regulator exceeds 125 psig\n(862 kPa). For higher inlet pressure, the methods in paragraph (1) or (2) of\nthis subdivision must be used. (4)\nA service regulator and an automatic shut-off device that closes upon a rise in\npressure downstream from the regulator and remains closed until manually\nreset. (5)\n\nAny service line\noperating at 125 psig (862 kPa) or more serving customers requiring regulation\nof the line pressure is to be equipped with either an excess flow valve or must\nhave the first stage regulator located at least 50 feet (15.2 meters) from the\nbuilding or, if 50 feet (15.2 meters) cannot be attained without entering the\nroadway, located at the property line.
