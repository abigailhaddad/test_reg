  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-1.1 - Segregation of funds\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe segregation of funds, by project and by purpose, as\nrequired by the provisions of the various contracts for State aid and the\nregulations of the commissioner, is achieved by setting up separate bank\naccounts as follows: (a) Development\nfund. This is the general designation of the bank account or accounts set up to\nreceive the proceeds of loan funds and any other funds received by the local\nagency in connection with the development of a project. Typical sources of such\nfunds are loan funds advanced by the State, loan funds borrowed from private\ninvestors, deposits on plans and specifications, sales of salvage, rents from\nthe operation of the site prior to demolition and construction, sales of excess\nland, rents and other revenues received in connection with the related\nprograms, interest on development fund investments, etc. A separate development\nfund bank account shall be set up for each project. The division may further\nrequire, depending on the circumstances, the segregation in separate bank\naccounts of the development funds for the various sites included in a multiple\ndevelopment project and of the development funds for the related programs of a\nproject, in which case the local agency will be so advised. A separate general\nledger account shall be set up for each bank account. Where the development\nfund of a project consists of more than one bank account, each such bank\naccount shall be assigned account numbers in sequence, as account 1111.1, 1111.2, etc. Payments shall be made from the development fund only for such\npurposes as shall have been previously specified in a signed certificate of\npurposes (see Part 1646) filed with and approved by the commissioner. Steps\nshould be taken to open a development fund bank account (see §\n1642-1.2\n) prior to the initial\nfinancing of the project. (b) Administration fund. This is the general designation for the bank account or\naccounts set up to receive all income, cash subsidies, and other funds received\nby the local agency in connection with the operation of the project proper. Typical sources are rents from the operation of the project proper beginning\nwith the first rents derived from the completed buildings, cash subsidies, penalty charges, sales and services to tenants, telephone commissions, washing\nmachine concessions, interest on administration fund investments, etc. The\nadministration fund bank account is opened at the beginning of the initial\noperating period of the project proper. All rents received from the operation\nof the project proper are deposited therein beginning with the first such rents\nreceived and all expenses of managing the project proper shall be paid\ntherefrom. The net income or deficit during the initial operating period\nresults in a corresponding credit or charge to development costs and will be\nreflected in a transfer of funds between the development and administration\nfunds. For details of the procedure during the initial operating period see\n\nPart 1646, Development Period Accounting. A separate administration fund bank\naccount or accounts shall be set up for each project, a separate general ledger\nsheet being maintained for each bank account as described under development\nfund above. The division may further require, depending on the circumstances, the segregation in separate bank accounts of the administration funds of the\nvarious sites included in a multiple development project, in which case the\nlocal agency will be so advised. Payments shall be made from the administration\nfund only for such charges as are eligible to be made to project\nrevenues. (c) Security deposits\nfund. This is the general designation of the bank account or accounts set up to\nreceive security deposits from tenants. A separate security deposits fund bank\naccount shall be set up for each project. The division will not require that\nseparate security deposits fund bank accounts be opened for each of the various\nsites included in a multiple development project. (d) Reserve fund. This is the general\ndesignation of the bank account or accounts set up to receive funds set aside\nfrom project revenues for the following reserves: (1)\n\nReplacement reserve\n(2)\n\nPainting and decorating reserve\n(3)\n\nVacancy and collection loss\nreserve\n(4)\n\nAny other authorized\nand approved reserve\nA separate reserve fund bank account shall be set up\nfor each project. The division will not require that separate reserve fund bank\naccounts be opened for each of the various sites included in a multiple\ndevelopment project. For details as to setting up the various reserves and the\ntransfers to be made between the administration and reserve funds, see Part\n1647, Operating Period Accounting. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
