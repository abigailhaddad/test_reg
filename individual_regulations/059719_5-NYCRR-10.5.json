Tit. 5 § 10.5 - Nearby or contiguous lands\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Lands nearby or contiguous to areas described in section\n10.4\n(b) and (h)\nof\nthis Part may be eligible to be included within an empire zone if, upon the\nrequest of the applicant for such designation, the commissioner finds that such\nadditional lands have significant potential for business development and job\ncreation which will enhance economic revitalization of the zone and benefit\nzone residents. This request shall be included in the original application for\ndesignation of an area as an empire zone; for an existing zone or in a request\nfor a boundary revision. (b) Factors to be considered by the commissioner in determining whether such\nadditional lands have significant potential for business development and job\ncreation are: (1)\nexisting infrastructure, such as water, sewers and roadways; (2)\nlands and/or buildings immediately\navailable for development; (3)\naccess to public transportation; (4)\nlabor force available in the immediate\narea; (5)\nnearby training\nfacilities; and\n(6)\nexisting\nbusiness base capable of expansion. (c) Notwithstanding subdivision (b) of this\nsection, lands nearby may only be included if applicant demonstrates that: (1)\nsuch lands and/or buildings are vacant, abandoned, or otherwise available for commercial or industrial purposes, except\nwhen it can be demonstrated that inclusion in the zone of certain occupied\nbuildings will result in a significant business investment and/or increase in\nemployment; (2)\nother available\nlands do not have the potential for timely development at a reasonable\ncost; (3)\nthese lands are necessary\nto meet the 25 percent minimum for developable lands within a zone; and\n(4)\nthat new jobs likely to be\ncreated are accessible to residents of the zone.
