  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-4.3 - Schedule of replacement reserve requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe schedule of replacement reserve requirements\n(§\n1647-4.2, subd. [a], par. [1])\nprepared by the local agency for division review and approval upon substantial\ncompletion of the project consists of three tables, as follows: Table I Computation of Estimated Requirements for\n\nReplacements\n\nTable II Annual Provisions for Replacements\n\nTable III Replacement Reserve Balances\n\nThese tables will be described in the subdivisions\nwhich follow. (a) Table\nI-computation of estimated requirements for replacements. (1)\n\nStarting with a list of classes of assets\nwhich, it is intended, will be replaced over the life of the project, this\ntable states the estimated replacement cost of each class of assets (giving\neffect to anticipated changes in the level of prices), the estimated percentage\nof each class which will require replacement, and the estimated useful life of\neach class. The classes of assets to be included in Table I and their estimated\nuseful lives will depend on what went into the construction of the project and\nthe classes of assets included may be revised, some being dropped and others\nbeing added, as a result of the periodical review of the schedule of\nreplacement reserve requirements by the division and the local agency in\nsubsequent years. A typical list, to be considered only as an indication of the\nclasses of assets that might be included in Table I and of their useful lives, follows: Structures\n\nPer cent estimated to be\nreplaced\n\nEstimated years of useful\nlife\n\nGas Ranges\n100\n8\n\nRefrigerators\n100\n15\n\nPlumbing-Interior Piping\n100\n25\n\nPlumbing Fixtures\n25\n25\n\nWarm Air Furnaces\n100\n25\n\nAutomatic Hot Water Heaters\n100\n12\n\nAsphalt Shingle Roofing\n100\n15\n\nFlashing\n100\n15\n\nLinoleum\n100\n12\n\nElectric Fixtures\n25\n25\n\nScreens and Combination Storm Doors\n100\n15\n\nOperating Equipment\n100\n12\n\nSite utilities\n\nPer cent estimated to be\nreplaced\n\nEstimated years of useful\nlife\n\nGas Distribution System\n100\n25\n\nElectric Distribution System\n50\n25\n(2)\n\nBy extending the estimated requirements\nfor replacement of each class of assets into appropriate columns, Table I makes\nit possible to determine the periodic requirements at the end of the estimated\nlives of assets having the same estimated useful lives. In the table above, for\nexample, a certain sum will be required every eight years over the life of the\nproject for replacement of gas ranges, another sum every 12 years for\nreplacement of hot water heaters and linoleum, etc. (b) Table II-annual provisions for\nreplacements. This table shows the amount to be set aside out of\nproject revenues for replacements for each year over the life of the project, beginning with the year the project was declared substantially completed. The\nconstruction of this table will depend on which method of making the provision\nthe local agency is authorized by the division to use (see §\n1647-4.5\n). If the interest savings\nmethod is used, Table II will show the annual interest saving resulting from\namortization of the loan from the State as the provision for replacements. If\nthe sinking fund method is used, the annual provision is arrived at by\nspreading the periodical requirements determined by Table I over each year of\nthe project's life. The annual provision arrived at by this method is generally\nalso stated in terms of the provision to be made per construction room. Regardless of which method is used, the annual provision may be augmented in\nsome years and reduced in other years by a sinking fund factor reflecting the\ninterest anticipated to be earned on investments of the reserve. For accounting\npurposes, however, the project accountant need only concern himself with the\nfollowing: (1)\n\nAmount of annual\nprovision. The amount of the annual provision, as adjusted for\nsinking fund factor, if any, for the respective years will be found in the\nappropriate column of Table II. One quarter of the annual contribution is made\nat the end of each calendar quarter by the following journal entry: Debit: Account 4891, Provision for Replacement... $XXX.............................................. Credit: Account 2510, Replacement Reserve... $XXX.............................................. The provision is made regardless of the charges\nincurred for replacements in the calendar quarter and the amount set aside is\ntransferred from the administration fund to the reserve fund at the end of the\nquarter in the prescribed manner (see Subpart 1647-5). (2)\n\nInterest on reserve fund investments. While the interest on investments of the reserve is\nconsidered to be a part of the replacement reserve, it is recorded separately, as earned, as follows: Debit: Account 1144, Accrued Interest Receivable on\n\nInvestments... $XXX....................... Credit: Account 2511, Interest Earned on Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments... $XXX.................... The credit to account 2511 will include the interest on\ninvestments of vacancy and collection loss and painting and decorating\nreserves, as well as of replacement reserves, the interest earned on all\ninvestments of reserves being considered available solely for replacements. Such availability will be reflected by transfers from time to time, with prior\ndivision authorization and approval, of balances in account 2511 to account\n2510. No charges for replacements shall be made to account 2511, all such\ncharges being made as a matter of procedure to account 2510. Note: For gain or loss on disposition of reserve fund\ninvestments, see section\n1645-2.4. (c) Table III-replacement reserve\nbalances. This table relates the annual provisions or\ncontributions to the reserve (account 2510), as per Table II, and the interest\nanticipated to be earned on investments of the reserve (the sinking fund\nfactor) to the requirements for replacements, as per Table I and is intended to\nshow that the reserve funds will be accumulated at a rate adequate to meet the\nestimated requirements for replacements as and when they occur. The table\naccordingly shows, for each year of the project's life, credits from the annual\ncontributions and the interest anticipated to be earned, the charges for\nreplacements, and the balance of the reserve (accounts 2510 and 2511 being here\nconsidered as a unit) at the end of the fiscal year after all charges and\ncredits. Table III is of less immediate interest to the project accountant than\n\nTables I and II. The annual provision for replacements is based on Table II and\nnot on the maintenance of the balances shown in Table III. The division may, however, as a result of its review of the adequacy of the reserve, authorize or\ndirect the local agency, in a given year, to adjust the annual provision to\nmaintain the reserve balance as shown in Table III.
