  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 563.10 - Additions and retirements of water plant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue\nrefinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of\nwater plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of: (1)\nretirement units; and\n(2)\nminor items of property. Each utility shall use such list of retirement units as\nis in use by it at the effective date hereof, or as may be prescribed by the\ncommission. Not later than December 31st of the year in which a utility first\nbecomes subject to this system of accounts, it shall file with the commission a\nlist of the items of property it proposes to account for as retirement units of\nproperty. Revisions of such list may be made at any time by appropriate filing\nthereof with the commission. (b) The addition and retirement of retirement\nunits shall be accounted for as follows: (1)\n\nWhen a retirement unit is added to the water plant, the cost thereof shall be\nadded to the appropriate water plant account, except that when units are\nacquired in the acquisition of any water plant constituting an operating\nsystem, they shall be accounted for as provided in water plant instruction, section\n563.5\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWhen property ceases to be used and\nuseful in water service, it shall be retired immediately from the water plant\naccounts. When a retirement unit is retired from water plant with or without\nreplacement, the book cost thereof shall be credited to the water plant account\nin which it is included, determined in the manner set forth in subdivision (d)\nof this section. If the retirement unit is of a depreciable class, the book\ncost of the unit retired and credited to water plant shall be charged to the\naccumulated provision for depreciation applicable to such property. The cost of\nremoval and the salvage shall be charged or credited, as appropriate, to such\ndepreciation account. (See also account 108 and water plant instruction, section\n563.11\nof this Part.)\n(c) The addition and retirement of\nminor items of property shall be accounted for as follows: (1)\n\nWhen a minor item of property which does\nnot replace a similar item and which is a part of or associated with a\nretirement unit and will be accounted for and retired together with such unit, and which by itself or together with other similar items makes a substantial\naddition, is added to the plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the\nappropriate water plant account; otherwise the cost of any minor item of\nproperty shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account. The amount\nadded to water plant accounts for such minor items shall not, however, exceed\nthe additional cost computed at current prices that would have been incurred if\nthe minor items had been installed together with the retirement units to which\nthey are related. (2)\n\nWhen a minor\nitem of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be\ncredited to the water plant account in which it is included; and, in the event\nthe minor item is a part of depreciable plant, the account for accumulated\nprovision for depreciation shall be charged with the book cost and cost of\nremoval and credited with the salvage. If, however, the book cost of the minor\nitem retired and not replaced has been or will be accounted for by its\ninclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part when such unit is\nretired, no separate credit to the property account is required when such minor\nitem is retired. (3)\n\nWhen a minor\nitem of depreciable property is replaced independently of the retirement unit\nof which it is a part, the cost of replacement shall be charged to the\nmaintenance account appropriate for the item, except that if the replacement\neffects a substantial betterment (the primary aim of which is to make the\nproperty affected more useful, more efficient, or of greater durability, or of\ngreater capacity), the excess cost of the replacement over the estimated cost\nat current prices of replacing without betterment shall be charged to the\nappropriate water plant account. (d) The book cost of water plant retired\nshall be the amount at which such property is included in the water plant\naccounts, including all components of construction costs. The book cost shall\nbe determined from the utility's records, and if this cannot be done it shall\nbe estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each unit, due to the relatively large number or small cost thereof, an appropriate\naverage book cost of the units, with due allowance for any differences in size\nand character, shall be used as the book cost of the units retired. (e) The book cost of land retired shall be\ncredited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference\nbetween the book cost (less any accumulated provision for depreciation, or\namortization therefor which has been authorized and provided) and the sale\nprice of the land (less commissions and other expenses of making the sale)\nshall be recorded in account 117, Accumulated Gains and Losses from Disposition\nof Utility Land and Land Rights, when the property has been used in utility\nservice, or recorded in account 105, Water Plant Held for Future Use; otherwise\nsuch difference shall be included in accounts 421.1, Gain on Disposition of\n\nProperty, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate. If land is\nnot used in utility service but is retained by the utility, such property shall\nbe charged to account 105, Water Plant Held for Future Use, or account 121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate, in accordance with instructions contained\nin section\n563.12, Transfers of\n\nProperty. (f) The book cost less\nnet salvage of depreciable water plant retired shall be charged in its entirety\nto account 108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Water Plant in\n\nService. Any amounts which, by approval or order of the commission, are charged\nto account 182, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account\n108, Accumulated Provision for Depreciation of Water Plant in\n\nService. (g) The accounting for the\nretirement of amounts, included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, and\naccount 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Plant, and the items of limited-term\ninterest in land included in the accounts for land and land rights, shall be as\nprovided for in the text of account 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization\nof Water Plant in Service, account 404, Amortization of Limited-term Water\n\nPlant, and account 405, Amortization of Other Water Plant. (h) The ledgers containing the primary water\nplant accounts and subdivisions thereof shall be kept so as to show on their\nface (1) additions, (2) retirements, and (3) transfers and adjustments. Corrections of errors and adjustments to additions or retirements in the\ncurrent or preceding year shall be classified as additions or\nretirements. (i) The cost of paving\ndisturbed, including replacing pavement, pavement base and sidewalks, shall be\nincluded in the water plant accounts only when incurred in connection with the\naddition of one or more retirement units of property; and the cost associated\nwith a particular retirement unit shall be retired when that retirement unit is\nretired, irrespective of whether the paving itself has a shorter or longer\nlife. No addition (except charges to land for public improvements) shall be\nmade to any water plant account for cost of paving installed in public streets\nwhich is not directly occasioned by the installation of property constituting\none or more retirement units with which the paving cost is associated as an\nelement of cost.
