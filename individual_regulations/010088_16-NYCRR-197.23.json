  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.23 - Operating property retired\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2) of subdivision (b), and\nsubdivision (c) hereunder, the book cost of depreciable operating property\nretired (see §\n196.1, subd. [a][35]) shall be\ncharged in its entirety to account 261, Depreciation Reserves, together with\nthe cost of removal. To that account shall be credited salvage value and\namounts recovered as insurance or otherwise, including amounts provided in\naccount 264, Insurance Reserve. (b) For the purpose of avoiding undue refinement in accounting for the replacement\nof small items of property, depreciable Operating Property-- Electric and\n\nOperating Property--General shall be grouped into (1) units of property, and\n(2) minor items, and the accounting for retirements and replacements of each\ngroup shall be as follows: (1)\n\nUnits of\nproperty. Not later than six months following the date when it becomes subject\nto this system of accounts, each utility shall file with the commission a\nstatement subscribed by the responsible municipal official or other duly\nauthorized representative showing for each account or subdivision thereof in\n\nOperating Property--Electric (and Operating Property--General) a list of the\ntypes and quantities of property which are accounted for as units of property. Any revision thereof shall be filed in like manner. The book cost of any unit\nof property retired shall be credited to the appropriate operating property\naccount and charged to account 261, Depreciation Reserves, whether or not\nreplaced. The cost of property installed in place of property retired shall be\ncharged to the appropriate operating property account. (2)\n\nMinor items. (i) This group includes any part or element\nwhich is not designated as a unit of property. The book cost of any minor item\nof property retired and not replaced shall be credited to the operating\nproperty account wherein included and charged to account 261, Depreciation\n\nReserves, except that, if the book cost of a minor item of property has been or\nwill be accounted for by its inclusion in the unit of property of which it is a\npart when such unit is retired, no separate credit to the operating property\naccount is required when such minor item is retired. (ii)\n\nIf minor items of property are retired\nand replaced (apart from the unit of property of which they form a part or with\nwhich they are associated), no entry shall be made in the operating property\naccount or in account 261, Depreciation Reserves. The cost of the replacement\nshall be charged to the account appropriate for the cost of repairs to the\nproperty, except that, if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the\nprimary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more\nefficient, or of greater capacity), there shall be charged to the appropriate\noperating property account the access cost of the replacement over the\nestimated cost at current prices of replacing without betterment the minor\nitems retired. (c) Determination of book cost. The book cost\nof operating property retired shall be the amount at which such property is\nincluded in the operating property accounts including all items set forth in\nparagraphs (1) to (10) of subdivision (e) of section\n197.21. Such costs shall be\ndetermined from the utility's records when this can be done, as in the case of\nland, structures, boilers, engines, generating station and substation\nequipment, transportation, office, and other equipment, and other items of\noperating property for which individual cost records are available. When the\nactual book cost can not be determined from the records, it shall be estimated. When it is impracticable to determine the book cost of each item due to the\nrelatively large number or small cost thereof, the average book cost of the\nitems, with due allowance for differences in size, character or year of\ninstallation, shall be used as the book cost of the items retired, except that\nutilities in Classes C and D need not take account of year of installation. The\ncontinuing property record, when completed, shall be used in accounting for\nretirements. (d) The accounting for\nthe retirement of items included in account 302, Franchises and Consents, account 303, Miscellaneous Intangible Property, and intangible elements with\nlimited terms included in account 311, Land, shall be as provided in the texts\nof account 262, Amortization Reserves, and account 790, Amortization of\n\nIntangible Property. (e) When\noperating property constituting an operating unit or system is sold, the book\ncost of the property shall be credited to the appropriate operating property\naccounts. The amounts (estimated if not known) carried with respect thereto in\nthe depreciation and amortization reserve accounts and account 263, Contributions for Extensions, shall be cleared for such reserves. Unless\notherwise ordered by the commission, the difference, if any, between (1) the\nnet amount of such debit and credit items, and (2) the consideration received\nfor the property, shall be included, if a debit, in account 514, Miscellaneous\n\nDebits to Surplus, or, if a credit, in account 502, Miscellaneous Credits to\n\nSurplus. (f) If the cause of\nretirement of depreciable Operating Property--Electric or Operating\n\nProperty--General is one for which provision has not been made in the\ndepreciation reserves and the loss is not covered by insurance, or if the\nretirement could not reasonably have been foreseen and provided for, the\nutility, upon order of the commission, may credit account 261, Depreciation\n\nReserves, and charge account 143, Suspense to be Amortized, with the unprovided\nfor loss in service value and distribute it through charges to account 789, Deferred Retirement Losses, over such period as the commission may\norder.
