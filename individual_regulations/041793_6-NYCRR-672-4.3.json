The agency shall make water releases from Toronto reservoir as are\nnecessary and sufficient to maintain a constant minimum flow of 10 cfs in Black\n\nLake Creek during all times of the year, as measured for the purposes of\ncompliance with this Part at the release works of the Toronto reservoir. This\nprovision shall not be applicable when water is spilling from the Cliff Lake\nreservoir or when the water elevation in the Toronto reservoir is below 1170\nfeet mean sea level. (b) Cliff\n\nLake. This Subpart does not establish any required releases from Cliff Lake at\nthis time. The department reservoir releases manager, in cooperation with the\nagency reservoir releases manager, shall investigate Black Lake Creek\ndownstream from Cliff Lake and determine the need for and practicability of\nwater releases. Pertinent factors to be considered in the investigation shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, leakage through the existing outlet works, volume of storage in Cliff Lake, present and potential future stream fishery\nand availability of access. (c) Swinging Bridge and Rio reservoirs. Owing to the lack of release works at the\n\nSwinging Bridge and Rio reservoirs that are adequate and appropriate to fulfill\nthe purposes of this Part, this Subpart does not establish any required\nreleases from said reservoirs. Required releases from such reservoirs may be\nestablished at some future date, following completion of the department's\nstudies pursuant to section\n672-1.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart. While said reservoirs are not subject to any release requirements at this\ntime, they are subject to all other applicable provisions of this\n\nPart. (d) Rio reservoir. The\ndepartment reservoir releases manager, in cooperation with the agency reservoir\nreleases manager, shall investigate the feasibility of modifying operation of\n\nRio reservoir to accomplish the purposes of this Part.

(f) The agency shall comply with the request\nby the department reservoir releases manager pursuant to subdivision (g) of\nsection\n672-1.3\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
