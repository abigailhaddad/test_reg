  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 702.8 - Procedures for deriving standards and guidance values for protection of human health from consumption of fish\n\nState Regulations\n\nStandards and guidance values for the protection of the\nbest usage of fishing shall protect the health of human consumers of fish and, for Class SA waters, human consumers of shellfish from chemicals that may\nbioaccumulate and are referred to as Health (Fish Consumption) values. (a) Standards and guidance values based on\nbioaccumulation and human consumption of fish shall be equal to the acceptable\ndaily intake from fish consumption divided by a fish consumption rate of 0.033\nkilograms per day and by a bioaccumulation factor. (b) The acceptable daily intake, in\nmicrograms per day, from fish consumption shall be the more stringent of: (1)\n20 percent of the reference dose (for\nnononcogenic effects) as determined from section 702.5 or\n702.7\nof this Part; or\n(2)\nthe human dose at the standard or\nguidance value (for oncogenic effects) as determined from section 702.4 or\n702.7\nof this Part. (c) The bioaccumulation factor is\nthe ratio of the concentration of a substance in fish flesh, in micrograms per\nkilogram, to the concentration in water, in micrograms per liter. Bioaccumulation factors will generally be based on measured values which may be\nsupported by bioaccumulation factors derived from octanol/water partition\ncoefficients. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n702.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
