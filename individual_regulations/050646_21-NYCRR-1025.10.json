Tit. 21 § 1025.10 - Compressed gases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No vehicle\nshall enter the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or the\n\nVerrazano-Narrows Bridge Lower Level if its load includes any flammable\ncompressed gas or nonflammable compressed gas listed in section\n1025.27\nof this Part and\nreferenced to this subdivision, unless such compressed gas is in a tube or\ncylinder two inches or less in outside diameter and four fluid ounces or less\nin capacity. Empty containers which last contained--a compressed gas referenced\nto this subdivision are not allowed passage when the quantity and/or container\nsize limitations exceed those described above. No empty tank vehicle is allowed\npassage if the vehicle is used for the transportation of any compressed gas\nreferenced to this subdivision. (b) Except as set forth in subdivision (h) of this section, compressed gases listed\nin section\n1025.27\nof this Part and\nreferenced to this subdivision are restricted to a maximum quantity per vehicle\nof 100 pounds gross weight; provided, however, that the gross weight of each\ncylinder or tube is 10 pounds or less, and except that cyclopropane or ethylene\nfor hospital use is restricted to a maximum quantity per vehicle of 20 tubes or\ncylinders measuring 20 inches or less in length, and 4 1/2 inches or less in\noutside diameter. Empty containers which last contained a compressed gas\nreferenced to this subdivision are not allowed passage when the quantity and/or\ncontainer size limitations exceed those described above. No empty tank vehicle\nis allowed passage if the vehicle is used for the transportation of any\ncompressed gas referenced to this subdivision. (c) Pressurized vessels (aerosol or similar\ntype containers) containing a flammable liquid mixture (flash point at or below\n100° F) or a combustible liquid mixture (flash point at or above 100° F and at\nor below 200° F), or a liquefied flammable compressed propellant gas, are\nprohibited from entering the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn Battery Tunnel\nor the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge Lower Level, unless such vessel or container be\nof metal, of 19.3 fluid ounces capacity or less, and have an absolute pressure\nof 75 pounds or less; and, when so packed in an outside container, the quantity\nof the total load shall not exceed 4,000 pounds gross weight per vehicle. Vessels containing nondangerous materials that are propelled by nonflammable\ncompressed gases are not restricted, regardless of quantity or size of\ncontainers. (d) Compressed gases\nlisted in section\n1025.27\nof this Part and\nreferenced to this subdivision are not restricted, regardless of quantity or\nsize of containers. No tank vehicle, loaded or empty, is allowed passage if the\nvehicle is used for the transportation of any compressed gas referenced to this\nsubdivision. (e) Liquefied argon, liquefied helium or liquefied nitrogen, when transported in specially\nconstructed tank vehicles under self-refrigeration with less than 40 psi\nabsolute pressure, are not restricted. (f) Compressed gases listed in section\n1025.27\nof this Part and\nreferenced to this subdivision are not restricted, regardless of quantity or\nsize of container, or when transported in tank vehicles. (g) Any article listed in section\n1025.27\nof this Part and\nreferenced to this subdivision may or may not be a compressed gas. When it is\nnot identified by the prescribed U.S.D.O.T. caution label for hazardous\nmaterials--and is known not to meet the description of a hazardous\nmaterial--the article is allowed passage, provided the shipping order, bill of\nlading or other shipping paper shows the following certification: This shipment conforms to Triborough Bridge and Tunnel\n\nAuthority rules for the transportation of explosives and other hazardous\nmaterials via the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the\n\nVerrazano-Narrows Bridge Lower Level. (h) Compressed natural gas carried by a motor\nvehicle for the sole purpose of providing fuel for the vehicle in which it is\ncarried shall not be subject to the limitations of subdivision (b) of this\nsection, provided: (1)\nsuch compressed natural\ngas is stored and carried only in a tank or tanks connected to and forming a\npart of the fuel system for such vehicle, or in other components of the fuel\nsystem of such vehicle; and\n(2)\nsuch vehicle, and each of its component parts, has been designed, fabricated, assembled, maintained, and marked in accordance with all applicable\nrequirements of Federal, State and local laws, rules, regulations, and\ndirectives, and industry standards.
