  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.5 - Construction of sewers and connections\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permits. No person shall uncover, make\nany connections with or opening into, use, alter, or disturb any public sewer\nor appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written permit from the City\nof Buffalo, Division of Engineering, with the approval of B.S.A. endorsed\nthereon, for such connection and, if required, pay either a permit fee or\nconnection charge. (b) Permit\ncharges. A permit and inspection fee for residential or commercial building\nsewer permits and for industrial building sewer permits shall be paid to the\nB.S.A. at the time the application for the permit is filed. These charges are\nintended to cover the administrative costs of processing the application. These\ncharges and fees are outlined in the latest edition of B.S.A.'s Schedule of\n\nSewer Rents and Other Charges (see Appendix 52 of this Title). (c) Notification of completion. The applicant\nfor the building sewer permit shall notify the B.S.A. principal engineer when\nthe building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Buffalo Sewer\n\nAuthority. (d) Joints. Every joint\nin the connection to a sanitary sewer or storm sewer shall conform to the\nN.Y.S.D.E.C. requirements and be made water tight so that no leakage into or\nout of such connections shall occur. (e) Inspection. No sewer facility, other than\nbuilding service sewers, shall be constructed in the City of Buffalo except by\nthe Buffalo Sewer Authority, or by others in accordance with plans and\nspecifications approved by the Buffalo Sewer Authority, and subject to\ninspection during construction by engineers and employees of the Buffalo Sewer\n\nAuthority. No sanitary or storm sewer shall be considered to be a part of the\npublic sewer system of the Buffalo Sewer Authority or City of Buffalo unless\nthe board of the Buffalo Sewer Authority duly adopts a resolution of completion\nand acceptance thereof. (f) Expiration of plans. An approval of plans for construction of sewer facilities\nshall expire one year after the date of approval unless construction has been\ninitiated and completed within a reasonable time thereafter. (g) Special drains. Drains receiving acid\nwaste shall be constructed of acid-resisting material. Such drains located\noutside of a building shall be constructed of vitrified clay or earthware pipe\nor other approved acid-resisting material. Joints shall be constructed by\ncaulking with asbestos rope wicking and by pouring a heated sulphur and carbon\ncompound or a heated bituminous compound in such a manner as to secure tight\njoints. (h) Classes of connection\npermits. There shall be two classes of connection permits: (1)\nfor service to domestic users; and\n(2)\nfor service to commercial and\nindustrial users. In either case, the owner or his agent shall make application\non a special form furnished by the Buffalo Sewer Authority. The permit\napplication shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications, or other\ninformation considered pertinent in the judgment of the general\nmanager. (i) Connection\ncosts. All costs and expenses incident to the installation and connection of\nthe building service sewer shall be borne by the owner. The owner shall\nindemnify and hold harmless the City of Buffalo and the Buffalo Sewer Authority\nfrom any loss or damage that may directly or indirectly be occasioned by the\ninstallation of the building service sewer or any connection to the public\nsewer. (j) Separate connections. A\nseparate and independent building service sewer shall be provided for every\nbuilding in residential and commercial areas, except that where one building\nstands at the rear of another on an interior lot, and no private sewer is\navailable, or can be constructed to the rear building through an adjoining\nalley, court, yard, or driveway, the building service sewer from the front\nbuilding may be extended to the rear building and the whole considered as one\nbuilding service sewer. (k) Use of\nexisting sewers. Old or existing building service sewers may be used in\nconnection with new buildings only when they are found, on examination by the\nB.S.A. to meet all requirements of these regulations and the Code of the City\nof Buffalo for property located in the City of Buffalo. (l) Specifications. The size, slope, alignment, materials of construction of a building service sewer, and the\nmethods to be used in excavating, placing of the pipe, jointing, testing and\nbackfilling the trench, shall all conform to the requirements of the building\nand plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the City of\n\nBuffalo. In the absence of code provisions or in amplifications thereof, the\nmaterials and procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the\nA.S.T.M. and W.P.C.F. Manual of Practice No. 9 (Design and Construction of\n\nSanitary and Storm Sewers) or other comparable manual or organization\ndesignated by the general manager shall apply. (m) Elevation of sewers. Whenever possible, the building service sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation\nbelow the basement floor. In all buildings in which below floor building drains\nare too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried\nby such building drains shall be lifted by means established in standard\nengineering practice to a suitable level and then discharged to the building\nservice sewer, or the building drain may be hung on the cellar wall and shall\nnot be less than four inches in diameter. (n) Connection of roof and foundation drains. No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, exterior foundation drains, areaway drains, or any other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a\nbuilding service sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or\nindirectly to a public sanitary sewer. (o) Public safety. All excavations for\nbuilding service sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades\nand lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be\nrestored by the permittee in a manner satisfactory to the City of\n\nBuffalo. (p) Prohibition of illicit\nconnections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of\nillicit connections to the MS4 is prohibited. This prohibition expressly\nincludes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the part, regardless\nof whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or\nprevailing at the time of connection. A person is considered to be in violation\nof this regulation if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the\nmunicipality's MS4, or allows a connection to continue. (q) Stormwater pollution prevention plans. Except with the approval of the general manager, or as otherwise provided in\nthese regulations, no application for a BPDES permit, or for connection to the\npublic sewer system shall be reviewed or approved by the B.S.A., until the\nB.S.A. has received a Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) prepared in\naccordance with the specifications in this regulation. (1)\n\nAll stormwater pollution prevention plans\nshall provide the following information and erosion and sediment controls: (i) background information about the scope of\nthe project, including location, type and size of project; (ii)\nsite map/construction drawing(s) for the\nproject, including a general location map.
