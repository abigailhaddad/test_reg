(2)\n\nThe notice of hearing must state that a\nhearing date will be set by the Office of Hearings and Mediation Services upon\nthe filing of a statement of readiness for adjudicatory hearing as set forth in\nsection\n622.9\nof this Part. The notice of hearing must also contain a statement that any\naffirmative defenses, including exemptions to permit requirements, will be\nwaived unless raised in the answer and may set forth the date, time and place\nof a pre-hearing conference. The notice must contain a statement that the\nfailure to answer, failure to attend a pre-hearing conference, or failure to\nattend the hearing will result in a default and a waiver of respondent's right\nto a hearing. (3)\n\nService of the\nnotice of hearing and complaint must be by personal service consistent with the\nCPLR or by certified mail. Where service is by certified mail, service is\ncomplete when the notice of hearing and complaint is received. If personal\nservice and service by certified mail is impracticable, upon application by\ndepartment staff, the ALJ may provide for an alternative method of service\nconsistent with CPLR 308(5).
