(2)\nA\nsecurity deposit and/or brokers' or finders' fees shall be provided only when\nan applicant or recipient is unable to obtain a suitable vacancy without\npayment of such allowances. (3)\n\nDocumentation of the need for a security deposit, moving expenses and/or\nbrokers' or finders' fees shall be fully recorded in the case record. (b) Avoidance of abuses in\nconnection with rent security deposits. (1)\n\nWhenever a landlord requires that he be secured against nonpayment of rent or\nfor damages as a condition to renting a housing accommodation to a recipient of\npublic assistance, a local social services official may secure the landlord by\neither of the following means: (i) by means\nof an appropriate agreement between the landlord and the social services\nofficial; or\n(ii)\nby depositing\nmoney in an escrow account, not under the control of the landlord or landlord's\nagent, subject to the terms and conditions of an agreement between the landlord\nand the social services official in such form as the department may require or\napprove; provided, however, that the provisions of this subparagraph do not\napply where a public assistance recipient resides in public housing. (2)\nA social services official may\nnot pay money to a landlord to be held as a security deposit against the\npayment of rent or for damages by a public assistance recipient, or issue a\ngrant to a recipient of public assistance therefor, except as provided in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nWhen, in the judgment of a social\nservices official, housing accommodations available in a particular area are\ninsufficient to accommodate properly recipients of public assistance in need of\nhousing, and in order to secure such housing, it is essential that the official\npay money to landlords to be held as security deposits against the nonpayment\nof rent or for damages by public assistance recipients or to issue grants to\nrecipients of public assistance therefor, such social services official may pay\nor furnish funds for such security deposits until sufficient housing\naccommodations are available in the particular area to accommodate properly\nrecipients of public assistance in need of housing. Social services officials\nmust not pay or furnish such funds where recipients of public assistance reside\nin public housing. In no case will temporary residence in a shelter, including\nthose defined in Part 900 or 1000 of this Title, a hotel/motel or any other\nsuch emergency or transitional residential facility be considered sufficient\nhousing accommodations for purposes of this paragraph. Landlords receiving such\nsecurity deposits must comply with the provisions of article seven of the\n\nGeneral Obligations Law. The recipient is required to assign to the social\nservices official any right the recipient may have to the return of the\nsecurity deposit and interest accrued thereon. Any social services official\npaying or furnishing funds for a security deposit in accordance with this\nparagraph must make diligent efforts to recover such payments or funds from the\nlandlord as allowed by law. Such efforts must not delay recoupment or recovery\nfrom a recipient if recovery or recoupment from the recipient is required by\nthis section. (c) Recovery of rent security payments. (1)\n\nIf as\na result of nonpayment of the shelter allowance, the security deposit or\nsecurity agreement for nonpayment of rent is required to be paid to the\nlandlord, such payment must be considered to be an overpayment made to the\nrecipient and as such, must be recovered according to the provisions of section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart. If rent has not been paid due to a legitimate landlord/tenant dispute, a\nrent strike or as a result of the application of section\n143-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law, such payment is not an overpayment and cannot be\nrecouped or recovered. (2)\n\nWhen a\nsecurity deposit or monies under a security agreement are paid to a landlord\nfor damages caused by a recipient, such payment must be considered an\noverpayment and must be recovered from a recipient pursuant to the provisions\nof section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart provided that a social services official has conducted (or arranged for) a\npre-tenancy and post-tenancy inspection or survey of the premises, or verified\nby some other means that the damages were caused by the recipient. The\ncondition of the premises when the recipient moves in and when the recipient\nmoves out must be documented and agreed to by signature of the landlord and the\nrecipient. If the verification does not confirm that there are damages caused\nby the recipient, then cash must not be issued under a security agreement or, if a cash security deposit had been issued and the landlord retains it for\nalleged damages, the social services official must attempt to recover the\ndeposit from the landlord. When the verification confirms that the recipient\ncaused the damages, the district must recover the deposit amount from the\nrecipient. (d) When\nnonpayment of the shelter allowance or client-caused damages as confirmed by a\npre-tenancy inspection and post-tenancy inspection or survey conducted (or\narranged for) by the social services district or by some other means of\nverifying that the damages were caused by the recipient pursuant to paragraph\n(c)(2) of this section necessitates the authorization of finders' or brokers'\nfees, or household moving expenses, such payments must be considered to be\noverpayment made to the recipient and as such, must be recovered according to\nthe provisions of section\n352.31\n(d) of this\n\nPart. If rent has not been paid due to a legitimate landlord/tenant dispute, a\nrent strike or as a result of the application of section\n143-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law, such payments are not overpayments and cannot be\nrecouped or recovered. (e) Unless\nprohibited by State or Federal law or regulation, an allowance for expenses, not otherwise authorized under this Title, for the repair, maintenance or\nretention of housing occupied by, but not owned by, a recipient of public\nassistance must be paid when necessary for the health and safety of the\nrecipient and his or her family, when other appropriate housing is not\navailable and when the payment is necessary to permit the recipient and his or\nher family to remain in the housing. An allowance for expenses for repair and\nmaintenance shall be paid only when the owner of the housing is not obligated\nto provide the repair or maintenance. An allowance under this subdivision does\nnot include payments for utility deposits for gas and electricity, payments\ncovered under subdivision (b) of this section, payments for rent, property\ntaxes or mortgage arrears and payments for litigation costs of any kind, including attorney's fees.
