  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 432.13 - Family assessment response\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nDescription of family assessment\nresponse. Pursuant to Social Services Law section 427-a, the local commissioner\nof a social services district may establish, with OCFS approval, a differential\nresponse program, family assessment response, as an alternative means of\nresponding to certain child protective service reports that allege abuse and\nmaltreatment. In family assessment response, there is an ongoing assessment of\nthe safety of children without a determination of whether the report of alleged\nabuse or maltreatment should be indicated or unfounded. Reports are addressed\nby engaging the family in a comprehensive assessment of child safety, risk of\nsubsequent harm, and family strengths and needs. The family assessment response\napproach seeks to minimize future risk of abuse or maltreatment of a child or\nchildren by engaging the family in the development and implementation of\nsolution-focused plans to address identified needs in order to support the\nfamily's ability to care for its children. (2)\nA family assessment response program\nestablished by a social services district shall be part of that district's\nchild protective service. (3)\n\nResponsibilities for a family assessment response. When a report alleging\nmaltreatment of a child is assigned to the family assessment response track, the child protective service must fulfill the following responsibilities: (i) first establish that children in the\nfamily named in the report are safe; and\n(ii)\nprovide ongoing assessment of safety and\nrisk, including completion of an initial safety assessment; and\n(iii)\nengage the family in an assessment of: the concerns reported to the State Central Register, any family-identified\nneeds and concerns that may impact the safety or risk of children, and the\nfamily's strengths and resources that could be engaged to address the\nidentified concerns; and\n(iv)\nwhen\nappropriate, partner with the family to assist the family in obtaining goods\nand services that will help the family meet its identified needs regarding care\nof the children, thereby reducing future risk of abuse or maltreatment of a\nchild or children. (4)\n\nReports assigned to the family assessment response track are not subject to the\nrequirements of child protective services specified in Title 6 of the Social\n\nServices Law and in sections\n409-e\nand\n409-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law, except as specified in Social Services Law sections\n422, 426 and 427-a. (b) Authorization and application to implement family assessment\nresponse. (1)\n\nApplication and OCFS\napproval. The commissioner of a social services district that seeks to\nimplement a family assessment response program must submit an application to\nOCFS that describes, in a manner prescribed by OCFS, its plans for family\nassessment response. The application must be approved by OCFS before the social\nservices district can implement family assessment response. (i) Each social services district that has\nreceived OCFS approval to implement a family assessment response program must\ncomply with any requirements for family assessment response that may be\nestablished by statute, these regulations, or by OCFS. (ii)\nOCFS may revoke its approval for family\nassessment response for any social services district that does not comply with\nfamily assessment response requirements established by statute, these\nregulations, or by OCFS, but only after having first consulted with the\ndistrict in an effort to assist them to resolve the compliance\nissues. (iii)\n\nIf OCFS revokes its\napproval for a social services district to provide family assessment response, the district may at any time, after having resolved the issues that resulted in\nits previous revocation, submit a new application to OCFS requesting to\nimplement family assessment response. (2)\n\nFamily assessment response is optional. The decision by a social services district to apply to establish and implement\na family assessment response program is voluntary and optional. The\ncommissioner of a social services district that has established a family\nassessment response program may terminate that program at any time. The\ncommissioner must immediately notify OCFS of a decision to terminate family\nassessment response. A social services district that has terminated its family\nassessment response program may, at any time, submit a new application to OCFS\nto implement family assessment response. (3)\n\nApplicability. The provisions of this\nsection apply only to those social services districts that have received\napproval from OCFS to implement family assessment response. (4)\n\nDetermination of the size and scope of a\nfamily assessment response program. A social services district applying to\nimplement family assessment response must determine the projected size and\nscope of its family assessment response program, including targeted goals for\nthe number of child protective service reports that it will assign to the\nfamily assessment response track, the number of staff members who will work in\nits family assessment response program, and the criteria it will use to\nclassify and assign reports to the family assessment response track. After\nimplementing a family assessment response program, a district may reassess and\nrevise these determinations. (i) A social\nservices district's plans for the size and scope of its family assessment\nresponse program that are submitted in its family assessment response\napplication, as well as subsequent changes to those plans, are subject to the\napproval of OCFS. (ii)\n\nCriteria for\nscreening reports. Districts must establish criteria, which are subject to the\napproval of OCFS, for the categories of allegations in child protective service\nreports that the district will or will not accept for potential assignment to\nthe family assessment response track. The criteria must comply with the\nprovisions of subdivision 3 of section\n427-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, as well as with any additional standards that may be\nestablished by OCFS. Changes in a district's criteria are subject to the\napproval of OCFS. (a) In order to establish a\nrobust family assessment response program, a district should develop screening\ncriteria for the family assessment response track that include a broad spectrum\nof cases representing a significant percentage of its child protective service\nreports. (b) Child protective\nservice reports regarding a child fatality must be investigated pursuant to\nsection\n20\n(5)\nof the Social Services Law and sections\n422-b, 423\n(6)\nand\n424\n(5)(a)\nof the Social Services Law, and must\nnot be assigned to the family assessment response track. (iii)\n\nWritten protocol. The social services\ndistrict must develop and adhere to a written screening protocol for\ndetermining initial track assignments. The protocol must protect the safety of\nchildren while effectively matching the child protective service to the\nfamily's needs. The initial screening protocol must include: (a) the designation of the types of reports\nthat, upon receipt, the social services district will and will not consider for\npotential assignment to the family assessment response track; (b) the designation of the staff responsible\nfor determining the initial track assignments for new child protective service\nreports; and\n(c) a description of\nwhether and how the social services district will screen reports that are\nreceived during on-call hours for potential assignment to the family assessment\nresponse track. (c) Determining the appropriate child\nprotective service track. (1)\n\nIntake\nprocedures. The intake procedures for child protective service reports\ndescribed in section\n432.2\n(b)(2)\nof\nthis Part apply to family assessment response cases. (2)\n\nInitial track assignment. When it\nreceives a child protective service report from the State Central Register, a\nsocial services district with a family assessment response program, using its\nwritten protocol, must identify whether the report is eligible to be assigned\nto the family assessment response track, make an initial determination about\nwhether to assign the report to the investigative track or the family\nassessment response track, and enter the initial track assignment into\nCONNECTIONS. (3)\n\nInform the family\nof family assessment response option. Following the preliminary assignment of a\nchild protective service report to the family assessment response track, child\nprotective service staff must, pursuant to subparagraph (e)(1)(ii) of this\nsection, provide each parent, guardian or other person legally responsible for\nthe child or children who will be participating in the family assessment\nresponse with information that describes and compares the family assessment\nresponse track to the investigative track in order to enable the family to make\nan informed decision about whether to accept participation in the family\nassessment response track. (4)\n\nFinal determination of track assignment. Not later than seven days after\nreceipt of a report alleging abuse or maltreatment that has been assigned to\nthe family assessment response track, the child protective service must\ndetermine whether the case should continue as a family assessment response. The\ninitial track assignment of a report may be changed until it becomes permanent, but no later than seven days following receipt of the report, at the same time\nthat the initial safety assessment must be completed pursuant to subdivision\n(d) of this section. (i) The child protective\nservice must document in the initial safety assessment the reasons for its\nchoice of track assignment for any report that is permanently assigned to\nfamily assessment response or that is initially assigned to family assessment\nresponse, but subsequently assigned to the investigative track within seven\ndays of receipt of the report. (ii)\n\nAll information entered into the record before the track assignment becomes\npermanent remains in the record, irrespective of whether the track assignment\nis changed. (iii)\n\nThe decision\nabout track assignment supports the safety of children while effectively\nmatching the child protective service to the family's needs. The determination\nof the appropriate track assignment must be based on the following factors: (a) Finding that children are safe. In order\nfor a child protective service report to be assigned to the family assessment\nresponse track, the initial (seven day) safety assessment, conducted pursuant\nto subdivision (d) of this section, must include a determination that each\nchild named in the child protective service report or known to be living in the\nhousehold is safe in the home. (b) Compliance with State- and locally-designated screening criteria. If a child\nprotective service report is initially assigned to the family assessment\nresponse track, and the child protective service determines during its initial\nsafety assessment that conditions in the family's circumstances that were not\nincluded in allegations in the report place the case outside of state-mandated\nor locally determined screening criteria for family assessment response, the\nchild protective service must re-assign the report to the investigative\ntrack. (c) Record review. During\nthe initial safety assessment, the child protective service must review State\n\nCentral Register records as well as its own child protective records pertaining\nto all prior reports involving members of the family, as specified in section\n432.2\n(b)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Part, and assess whether information in those case records indicates that\nthe family assessment response approach would not be an appropriate response to\nthe current child protective service report. (d) Agreement by parents, guardians, and\nother legally responsible persons. (1)\n\nParticipation in family assessment response is voluntary on the part of the\nfamily named in the child protective service report. Their agreement to\nparticipate in a family assessment response and to cooperate in assessment\nactivities with child protective service staff is necessary in order for the\nchild protective service to confirm the assignment of a report to the family\nassessment response track. Child protective service workers must provide\ninformation about family assessment response to parents, guardians, or other\npersons legally responsible, pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision and\nsubparagraphs (e)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section, to inform their decisions\nabout whether to choose to participate in a family assessment\nresponse. (2)\n\nIf a parent declines\nassignment of the report to the family assessment response track, the report\nmust be addressed through the investigation track; except that, if one or more\npersons who are subjects of the report wish to participate in a family\nassessment response, and the child protective service believes that the family\ncan benefit from a family assessment response despite the refusal to cooperate\nby a parent, the child protective service may assign the report to the family\nassessment response track. (5)\n\nChanging the track assignment after seven\ndays. (i) Seven days after a child protective\nservices receives a report, the assignment of the report in CONNECTIONS to the\nfamily assessment response track or the investigation track cannot be\nchanged. (ii)\n\nIf more than seven\ndays have passed since the assignment of a report to the family assessment\nresponse track, in the following instances the open family assessment response\ncase must be closed and a new case opened, to be assigned to the investigative\ntrack: (a) If while conducting a family\nassessment response, the child protective service has reasonable cause to\nsuspect child abuse, or the family is not cooperating with the family\nassessment response assessment and there is reasonable cause to suspect\nmaltreatment of a child, the case is no longer eligible for inclusion in the\nfamily assessment response track. The child protective service must make a new\nreport to the State Central Register, which must be assigned to the\ninvestigation track, and the open case that was assigned to the family\nassessment response track must be closed. (b) If a child protective service that is\nconducting a family assessment response receives a new report alleging child\nabuse or maltreatment from the State Central Register that contains allegations\nthat do not meet the State's or local district's criteria for inclusion in\nfamily assessment response, the child protective service must assign the new\nreport to the investigative track and close the open case that was assigned to\nthe family assessment response track. Allegations from the family assessment\nresponse report should be added to the new investigative track report, as\nappropriate. (iii)\n\nInformation in the case record for a family assessment response case that is\nrelevant to a subsequent investigation case may be included in the case record\nfor the investigation track case, pursuant to Social Services Law section\n427-a\n(5)(e)(iii). (d) Initial safety assessment. Whenever a child protective service receives a report of\nchild abuse and maltreatment that it assigns preliminarily to the family\nassessment response track, the child protective service must commence an\ninitial safety assessment within 24 hours of receipt of the report to determine\nwhether children named in the child protective service report are safe in their\nhomes. The initial safety assessment must be completed no later than seven days\nfollowing receipt of the report, at which time the assignment of the report to\nthe family assessment response track or the investigative track becomes\npermanent. In order to confirm the assignment of a child protective service\nreport to the family assessment response track, the initial safety assessment\nmust contain a finding that no child in the home is in immediate or impending\ndanger of serious harm. (1)\n\nInitiation\nwithin 24 hours. The child protective service must initiate a safety assessment\nno more than 24 hours after receiving a report, by conducting a face-to-face\ninterview or making a telephone contact with one or more of the following\npersons who are in a position to provide information on the safety of the child\nor children: (i) Source. Whenever possible, child protective service staff should contact the source of the report prior to\nthe first meeting with the family. The source can confirm and possibly expand\nupon the details of the report or provide impressions of family functioning, strengths, and resources. (ii)\n\nSubject(s) and members of the family. Whenever possible, initial contact with\nthe subject(s) of the report should be by telephone. Child protective services\nstaff should inform the subject(s) about the existence of concerns, initiate\nthe safety assessment and begin engaging the family in the family assessment\nresponse process. During the initial contact, the family assessment response\nworker and the family schedule the first face-to-face meeting. (iii)\n\nOther persons. Child protective workers\nshould interview any other persons who are in a position to provide information\nabout whether any child is in immediate danger of serious harm. (2)\n\nCompleting the initial (seven\nday) safety assessment. The initial safety assessment should be completed using\nthe following guidelines: (i) The child\nprotective service conducts the initial safety assessment by assessing, with\nthe family, the physical health and well-being of all of the children in the\nfamily, the safety of the children's living conditions and the existence of any\nother safety factors in the home. All children named in the report or living in\nthe home must be seen and all children who are developmentally capable should\nbe engaged in the assessment process. The child protective service worker\napplies the safety criteria designated by OCFS to determine if one or more\nsafety factors place a child in immediate or impending danger, and makes a\ndecision regarding the child's safety status. (ii)\n\nThe child protective service may obtain\ninformation from collateral contacts including, but not limited to, hospitals, family medical providers, schools, police, social services agencies and other\nagencies providing services to the family, relatives, extended family members, neighbors and other persons who may provide information on the status of the\nchild's safety should that information be needed to determine the presence of\nsafety factors within the family. Family assessment response staff should ask\nthe parents/caretaker for their recommendations regarding collaterals that can\nsupply this information and should not routinely make collateral contacts\nwithout first asking the family. (3)\n\nDocumenting the safety assessment. Whenever a report alleging maltreatment of a child is initially assigned to the\nfamily assessment response track during the seven days following receipt of the\nreport, the child protective service must enter the initial safety assessment\ninto CONNECTIONS no later than seven days after receipt of the report, in a\nmanner specified by OCFS. The initial safety assessment must specify the track\nto which the report is assigned following completion of the safety assessment\nand document the reasons for assigning the report to the family assessment\nresponse track or the investigation track, as specified in paragraph (c)(4) of\nthis section. (4)\n\nOngoing\nassessment of safety. After completing the initial safety assessment, the child\nprotective service remains responsible for continually monitoring the presence\nor emergence of safety threats throughout their work with the family, until the\nfamily assessment response case is closed. (e) Conducting the family assessment\nresponse. (1)\n\nUse of the family\nassessment response approach. Immediately upon preliminary assignment of a\nreport to the family assessment response track, the child protective service\nshould apply family assessment response principles in its work with the family\nand continue to do so until the case is either reassigned to the investigative\ntrack, within seven days of receipt of the report, or the case is\nclosed. (2)\n\nActivities implementing\nthe family assessment response. The child protective service's activities in\nconducting family assessment response must, at a minimum, include the\nfollowing: (i) Provide written notification\nto parents. No later than seven days after receipt of a child protective report\nthat the has been assigned to the family assessment response track, the child\nprotective service must provide written notification to every parent, guardian\nor other person legally responsible for the child or children named in the\nreport. Written notice is not provided to any other persons. (a) The child protective service may\ndetermine the form of the written notification it provides, but it should be\nwritten in plain language. (b) The\nnotification must inform the person that a report was made to the State Central\n\nRegister and explain that it is the intent of the social services district to\nmeet the needs of the family without engaging in an investigation by assigning\nthe report to the family assessment response track, and that the child\nprotective service workers who will be assisting the family are mandated\nreporters and are required to report suspected abuse or maltreatment. (c) The child protective service must\nverbally inform the parent, guardian or other person legally responsible about\nthe areas of concern that triggered the report and explain that they must\nexplore those concerns and assess the safety of any child named in the report\nor living in the household. (d) If, while a case assigned to family assessment response is open, a subsequent\nreport is received that is consolidated with the open case, the requirement to\nprovide written notification is waived; the child protective service must\nprovide verbal notification of the new report to every parent, guardian or\nother person legally responsible for the child or children named in the\nreport. (ii)\n\nProvide\ninformation about family assessment response. The child protective service must\nprovide the family with information about family assessment response to aid\nthem in making an informed decision about whether to accept assignment of the\nreport to the family assessment response track. Such information should include\nbut is not limited to: (a) a description of\nfamily assessment response that explains how it differs from an investigative\nresponse, including that there is no determination made in family assessment\nresponse cases. This information must be given to the family verbally; families\nmust also be given written information about family assessment response, such\nas a brochure; (b) an explanation\nof the importance of partnership and cooperation in the family assessment\nresponse, including the essential role of meetings between child protective\nservice workers and the family, so that CPS workers and the family are able to\njointly assess the children's safety and well-being as well as the family's\nstrengths, risks, and needs; (c) information regarding the confidentiality of records in family assessment\nresponse; and\n(d) an explanation\nthat the choice to accept assignment of the report to the family assessment\ntrack is voluntary and that the family may choose either family assessment\nresponse or assignment to the investigative track. (iii)\n\nEngage the family. Family assessment\nresponse workers must work in partnership with the families participating in a\nfamily assessment response. Workers should be transparent with families\nregarding all actions that they take regarding the case. To the extent\nfeasible, child protective service workers should include all family members in\ndiscussions, including children who are old enough to express opinions, as well\nas any other persons who the family would like to include, such as members of\nthe extended family. (iv)\n\nComplete\nthe family led assessment guide (FLAG). Family assessment response staff must\nengage the family in an examination of the issues of concern to the child\nprotective service as well as the family's strengths, concerns, and needs. The\nassessment must be conducted using a Family Led Assessment Guide (FLAG), as\nspecified by OCFS. The family-led assessment should be initiated as soon as\npossible after receipt of the child protective service report, but no more than\n30 days following receipt of the report. The assessment should be conducted in\naccordance with the principles and practices of family assessment response. Child protective workers must document at least one completed FLAG in\nCONNECTIONS, as well as any revised versions of the FLAG. (v) Provide on-going risk assessment. Family\nassessment response workers must engage with the family in on-going joint\nevaluation and assessment of the family's progress including periodic\nassessments of risk to the child or children. (vi)\n\nFocus on solutions. When the FLAG\nidentifies challenges to the family's ability to support the well-being or meet\nthe needs of their child or children, family assessment response workers must\noffer to work jointly with the family to develop and implement solutions to\naddress their needs. (vii)\n\nOffer\nneeded services. Where appropriate, family assessment response workers must\noffer assistance to the family in implementing solutions to their identified\nneeds that will be supportive of family functioning, meet the children's needs\nand reduce risk to children in the family. Assistance may include providing\ninformation on services and supports available in their community, building\nsupportive networks with extended family and community resources, advocating\nfor the family with schools, landlords and others, referring the family to\ngovernment and privately funded programs, contacting service providers, and\npaying for goods or services. (a) No\n\"application for services\" or signatures, as required in section\n404.1\n(c)(8)\nof\nthis Title, are necessary in order to provide services in cases assigned to the\nfamily assessment response track. (b) Districts may use child protective, wraparound, or other funding sources to pay for goods and services provided\nthrough family assessment response. (c) The acceptance of services or goods by\nfamilies who are receiving family assessment response is voluntary. (viii)\n\nNotifying the family of\ncase closing. No more than seven days after closing a family assessment\nresponse case record, the child protective service must notify the family, including all subject(s) of the report, that the case has been closed. The\nnotification may be in a form determined by the child protective service, but\nmust be provided in writing and, if feasible, also verbally. The notice must\ninform the family and subject(s) that the family assessment response report is\nsealed and that the records will be maintained for 10 years after the report\nwas received at the State Central Register. Notices must also inform the\nsubject(s) of the report about the applicable confidentiality provisions and of\ntheir right to access the records for the family assessment response. (3)\n\nClosing cases. Family\nassessment response is a short term child protective service. (i) The case should be closed if the family\nis assessed as providing adequate care for their children, the children are\nsafe, and the family has no requests for services or supports. (ii)\n\nThe decision to close a family\nassessment response case must be made in conjunction with the family, whenever\npossible. (iii)\n\nWhen needs have\nbeen identified, the family should be given information about available\ncommunity resources to meet those needs. To the extent possible, a family\nassessment response caseworker should be present with identified service\nproviders and appropriate family members at their first meeting to introduce\nthem to facilitate a \"warm handoff.\"\n(iv)\n\nIf the family assessment response\ncaseworker believes the family has unmet needs but the family declines\nadditional services, and there is no current maltreatment or immediate danger\nof serious harm, the case must be closed. (v) Timeframes. The following timeframes\napply to closing a family assessment response case: (a) a family assessment response case should\nusually be closed within 60 days; (b) addressing family needs may necessitate\nkeeping a family assessment response case open for up to 90 days. A case that\nremains open for more than 60 days should be kept open only for the specific\npurpose of assisting a family to meet specific needs; (c) if a family requires more assistance in\nmeeting its needs than can be provided within 90 days, the child protective\nservice will assess the family's eligibility for preventive services in\naccordance with section\n430.9\nof this Title and, if the\nfamily is eligible and consents, open a preventive services case; (d) in extraordinary circumstances, a family\nassessment response case may be kept open for more than 90 days. When such an\ninstance occurs: (1)\na family assessment\nresponse worker and supervisor must document in progress notes the reason for\nkeeping the case open, including specific goals and steps to achieve those\ngoals; and\n(2)\na family assessment\nresponse worker must make contact with the family no less than once every two\nweeks during the period past 90 days, and must document each contact. (4)\n\nCase\nwork contacts. The number of casework contacts must be commensurate with the\nrequirements for completing the family assessment response assessments and for\nmeeting the needs of the family. There are no specific contact requirements for\nfamily assessment response except when the family assessment response case is\nopen for more than 90 days, as specified in clause (3)(v)(\nd\n)\nof this subdivision. (5)\n\nDocumentation. Activities conducted as part of a family assessment response\ncase must be documented in CONNECTIONS, in the form and manner prescribed by\nOCFS. Family assessment response workers must document, at a minimum, the\nfollowing information in the family assessment response case record: (i) essential data relating to the\nidentification of each child and family member; (ii)\nactivities undertaken to initiate a\nsafety assessment within 24 hours; (iii)\nfindings of the initial safety\nassessment, including the reasons for assigning the report to the family\nassessment response track; (iv)\ninformation from at least one Family Led Assessment Guide (FLAG), based on\ndiscussions with the family, as well as any revisions of the FLAG; (v) services that were offered to the family\nand services that were accepted and provided, directly and through contract or\nother means; (vi)\nfindings of\nperiodic risk assessments; (vii)\nevaluations and assessments of progress; (viii)\nongoing plans for supportive services\nafter the case is closed, if applicable; and\n(ix)\nfactors allowing for the closing of the\ncase. (6)\n\nChanging the\ncase status from family assessment response track to investigative track. (i) Reporting suspected abuse. If a family\nassessment response worker has reasonable cause to suspect that there is child\nabuse occurring in a family that is part of a family assessment response, the\nworker must make a report to the State Central Register. The new child\nprotective service report containing allegations of child abuse must be\nassigned to the investigative track and the family assessment response case\nmust be closed. (ii)\n\nClosing a case\ndue to lack of cooperation. If a report has been assigned to the family\nassessment response track following an initial safety assessment and the family\nlater refuses to cooperate with the family assessment response workers in\ncompleting the full assessment of strengths and needs and/or in developing or\nimplementing a plan to address family problems or issues and the family\nassessment response worker has reasonable cause to suspect maltreatment of a\nchild, the child protective service must make a report of suspected\nmaltreatment to the State Central Register. The resulting child protective\nservice report must be assigned to the investigative track and the family\nassessment response case must be closed. (f) Administration and\norganization. (1)\n\nStaffing. (i) Sufficient staff. Each family assessment\nresponse unit must designate sufficient qualified staff, whose primary function\nis to address child protective service reports using the family assessment\nresponse approach, to fulfill the purposes of section 427-a of the Social\n\nServices Law. (ii)\n\nEducation and\ntraining requirements. (a) Every family\nassessment response worker, including supervisors, must meet the minimum\neducation and training requirements for a child protective service worker\nspecified in section\n432.2\n(e)(5)\nof\nthis Part. (b) Every family\nassessment response worker must complete training in family assessment\nresponse, in the form and manner specified by OCFS. (iii)\n\nOther employment requirements for\nfamily assessment response. All family assessment response staff are subject to\nthe requirements (employment history, employment and personal references, criminal background attestation, State Central Register database check) for\napplicants for child protective service staff, pursuant to section\n432.2\n(e)(6)\nof\nthis Part. (iv)\n\nSupervision of\nfamily assessment response. (a) A child\nprotective service supervisor must review assessments and decisions made by a\nfamily assessment response caseworker, including, at a minimum, a review of the\nprogress notes, the initial safety assessment, the complete Family Led\n\nAssessment Guide, and the information related to the decision to close the\ncase. (b) A child protective\nservice supervisor must approve the assignment of a child protective service\nreport to the family assessment response track and the decision to close a case\nassigned to the family assessment response track. (v) Case assignment. (a) Local districts applying to implement\nfamily assessment response and those requesting to expand or change their\napproved family assessment response program shall develop a plan that describes\ntheir program organization, staffing plan, and case assignment process, including how they will support effective practices in providing family\nassessment response. The plan shall include: (1)\na description of the policy and process\nfor assigning reports to the family assessment response track, including\nwhether family assessment response cases are assigned to child protective\nservices staff who are dedicated exclusively to family assessment response or\nto staff who provide both family assessment response and\ninvestigations; (2)\nthe number of\nstaff and supervisors that will be assigned to family assessment response cases\nexclusively, including staff of any community-based agency that will perform\nfamily assessment response activities pursuant to paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision; (3)\nthe number of\nstaff and supervisors that may be assigned to cases in both the family\nassessment response track and the investigative track; and\n(4)\nif the local district has determined that\nany child protective service worker may be assigned to cases in both tracks, a\ndescription of the measures that will be taken to maintain the integrity of\nboth approaches, including a description of the measures that will be taken to\nsupport such staff. (b) If a local district currently providing family assessment response assigns\nstaff to cases in both the family assessment response track and the\ninvestigative track, that district shall, upon the request of OCFS, provide\nOCFS with a written description of its plans to support both approaches, as\ndescribed in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph. (2)\n\nQuality assurance. (i) The social services district shall be\nresponsible for assessing and evaluating the implementation of its family\nassessment response program, including the provision of services to families\nserved by family assessment response, in order to assure the quality of its\nservice.
