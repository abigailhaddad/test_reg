(f) Control\nmeans, as appropriate, eradicating, suppressing, reducing, or managing invasive species populations, preventing spread of\ninvasive species from areas where they are present, and taking steps such as\nrestoration of native species and habitats to reduce the effects of invasive\nspecies and prevent further invasions. (g) Cultivar\nmeans a plant, or group of plants, of any species selected for desirable characteristics under\ncultivation, and may also be referred to as variety. (h) Department\nmeans the New\n\nYork State Department of Environmental Conservation.

(j) Ecosystem\nmeans the complex of a community of organisms and\nits environment functioning as an interactive unit. (k) Education\nmeans for the\npurpose of instruction or training. (l) Environmental Notice Bulletin\n(ENB)\nmeans the publication of the department published pursuant to\nsection\n3-0306\nof the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw, accessible on the departments internet website at\nhttp://www.dec.ny.gov. (m) Free-living State\nmeans\nunconfined and outside the control of a person, and in the case of animals\nother than fish, includes the ability to fly, walk, or swim outside of human\ncontrol. (1)\n\nInvasive species found or placed\nin the following locations shall be considered to be a free-living state: (i) lands identified as public\nlands; (ii)\nlands that are\ncontinually or intermittently connected to public lands; (iii)\nnatural areas; (iv)\nwaters identified as public\nwaters; (v) waters that are\ncontinually or intermittently connected to public waters; or\n(vi)\nwater-using facilities, such as fish\nhatcheries, aquatic farms, zoos, and minnow retail or wholesale operations, with outflows that provide direct access for species to enter public\nwaters. (2)\n\nIn the case\nof a fish or aquatic plant, the following locations are not considered a\nfree-living state: (i) artificial ponds such\nas water gardens that have no outlet to public waters; (ii)\nwaters whose shorelines are entirely\nwithin the land owned by a person, not continually or intermittently connected\nto public waters, and not identified by the department as public waters; or\n(iii)\nwater-using facilities, such as fish hatcheries, aquatic farms, zoos, aquaria, and minnow retail or\nwholesale operations, with outflows that do not provide direct access for\nspecies to enter public waters. (n) Fungi\nmeans organisms\nsuch as yeast, molds, smuts, mildews, rusts, mushrooms and toadstools that\nreproduce by spores and lack chlorophyll, leaves, true stems, and\nroots. (o) Import\nmeans to bring into New York State or to arrange for another person to bring\ninto New York State. (p) Incidental\nmeans an inadvertent act when performing an\notherwise legal activity. (q) Introduce\nmeans the intentional or unintentional escape, release, dissemination, or placement of a species into an ecosystem as a result\nof human activity. (r) Invasiveness rank\nmeans a rank assigned to a nonnative species\nto signify its level of invasiveness based on the relative maximum score\n(0-100); points are accrued as a percent of the maximum possible points for\nfour categories: ecological impacts, biological characteristics and dispersal\nability, ecological amplitude and distribution, and difficulty of control. Based on points, species are ranked very high, high, medium, low or\ninsignificant. (s) Invasive\nspecies\nmeans a species that is nonnative to the ecosystem under\nconsideration, and whose introduction causes or is likely to cause economic or\nenvironmental harm or harm to human health. For the purposes of this Part, the\nharm must significantly outweigh any benefits. (t) Limited permit\nmeans a\nvalid form authorizing the restricted movement of regulated invasive species\nfor specified processing, handling, or utilization. (u) Native species\nmeans\nwith respect to a particular ecosystem, a species that, other than as a result\nof an introduction, historically occurred or currently occurs in that\necosystem, or in New York State.

(ab)\n\nPropagate\nmeans to\ncause to continue to increase by sexual or asexual reproduction. (ac)\n\nPropagule\nmeans parts\nof a plant that are capable of producing additional plants through either\nsexual or asexual reproduction, including but not limited to seeds, roots, stems, rhizomes, tubers and spores. (ad)\n\nPublic lands\nmeans land\nin the public domain owned by a Federal, State, county, city, town or local\ngovernment entity.

(ai)\n\nResearch\nmeans to\nconduct systematic search for facts or scientific investigation for which its\nintended purpose is the discovery of new facts and their correct\ninterpretation, the revision of accepted conclusions, or the practical\napplication of such new or revised conclusions. (aj)\n\nSell\nmeans to offer for\nsale, make or attempt to make sales, or to give up to another for money or\nother valuable consideration. (ak)\n\nSpecies\nmeans a group of organisms all of which have a high\ndegree of physical and genetic similarity, generally interbreed only among\nthemselves, and show persistent differences from members of allied groups of\norganisms. (al)\n\nTransport\nmeans to cause, or attempt to cause, an invasive\nspecies to be imported or carried or moved within the state, and includes\naccepting or receiving a specimen for the purpose of transportation or\nshipment.
