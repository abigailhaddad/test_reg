  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-4.7 - Air sampling equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sampling equipment. Area air sampling shall be performed using GFCI protected\npumps with associated tubing, supports and airflow measuring, metering or\nrecording devices. (b) Duration, flow rate and calibration. Area air samples, except for background and\nclearance air samples, shall be collected and air samplers run for each entire\nwork shift. Area air samples must be collected with a minimum flow rate\ncapacity of two liters per minute and a maximum flow rate consistent with the\napplicable accepted air sampling and analysis methodology. The flow rate for\neach air sample shall be pre-calibrated and post-calibrated at the beginning\nand end of each air sample collection. The calibrations shall be recorded. Primary and secondary calibration devices shall be calibrated as per NYS DOH\nELAP requirements. The air sampling technician shall be on-site to observe and\nmaintain air sampling equipment for the duration of air sample\ncollection. (c) Placement of air\nsampling equipment. Air sampling equipment shall be in place and operational as\nfollows: (1)\n\nPlacement of regulated abatement\nwork area indoor air sampling equipment. Air sampling equipment shall not be\nplaced in corners of rooms or near obstructions. Samplers shall be placed\nrandomly around the regulated abatement work area. If the regulated abatement\nwork area contains a number of rooms equivalent to the number of required\nsamples based on floor area, a sampler shall be placed in each room. When the\nnumber of rooms is greater than the required number of samples, a\nrepresentative number of rooms shall be selected, but in no case shall fewer\nsamples be collected than the required number of samples based upon floor area. (See section\n56-4.12, Table 2 of this\n\nSubpart.)\n(2)\n\nPlacement of outdoor\nair sampling equipment. Outdoor air sampling equipment shall be placed four to\nsix feet above grade level and at least 10 feet away from obstructions that may\ninfluence wind patterns. If access to electricity and security concerns\ndictates a rooftop site, locations within 10 feet of vents or other structures\non the roof shall be avoided. (3)\n\nSamplers outside of the regulated abatement work area. Air sampling equipment\nshall be placed outside the regulated abatement work area within 10 feet of the\ncritical barriers, decontamination enclosure entrances/exits and negative air\nducts and exhausts, as applicable. (See section\n56-4.12, Table 2 of this\n\nSubpart.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-4.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
