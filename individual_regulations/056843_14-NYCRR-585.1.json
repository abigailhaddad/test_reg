  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 585.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) family care\nhomes provide 24-hour residential services in small family settings that match\nresident needs and provider skills offering an individually-tailored living\nenvironment. (b) The Office of\n\nMental Health issues an operating certificate to qualified individuals in the\ncommunity who agree to provide specified residential services in their own\nhomes to no more than six persons with mental illness. These family care\nproviders are reimbursed for expenses occurred in providing care (i.e., room\nand board and mileage) and may receive additional funds to meet the personal\nneeds of residents. (c) Each family\ncare provider must have a program sponsor, which is either a State-operated\npsychiatric center or a community-based mental health program. The program\nsponsor is responsible for ensuring that the family care provider is an\nintegral part of the family care resident's treatment team. In addition, the\nprogram sponsor is responsible for training the provider, securing emergency\nsupport services, and monitoring the home for compliance with regulations, policies, and procedures of the Office of Mental Health. (d) Family care providers are trained to\nmanage a variety of placements, including: (1)\nthose who have reached their maximum\nlevel of independence and are in need of long-term care; (2)\nthose who require consistent care for\nextended periods of time to increase their level of functioning; (3)\nthose who are geriatric, physically\ndisabled, or who are young adults in need of small group settings; and/or\n(4)\nthose who are young\nadults (18 years or older). (e) These regulations repeal former\n\nDepartment of Mental Hygiene regulations at 14 NYCRR Part\n87. Any references to\nsuch former Part, or sections thereof, shall be deemed to refer to, and to have\nbeen replaced by, this Part and corresponding sections thereof. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n585.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
