An applicant or licensee may provide reasonable\nassurance of the availability of funds for decommissioning based on obtaining a\nparent company guarantee that funds will be available for decommissioning costs\nand on a demonstration that the parent company passes a financial test. This\nappendix establishes criteria for passing the financial test and for obtaining\nthe parent company guarantee. C.2 Financial test. (a) To pass the financial test, the parent company must meet\nthe criteria of either paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision: The parent company must have: Two of the following three ratios: A ratio of total liabilities\nto net worth less than 2.0; a ratio of the sum of net income plus depreciation, depletion, and amortization to total liabilities greater than 0.1; and a ratio\nof current assets to current liabilities greater than 1.5; and\n\nNet working capital and tangible net worth each at least six\ntimes the current decommissioning cost estimates (or prescribed amount if a\ncertification is used); and\n\nTangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n\nAssets located in the United States amounting to at least 90\npercent of total assets or at least six times the current decommissioning cost\nestimates (or prescribed amount if a certification is used). The parent company must have: A current rating for its most recent bond issuance of AAA, AA, A, or BBB as issued by Standard and Poor's or Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa as issued by\n\nMoody's; and\n\nTangible net worth at least six times the current\ndecommissioning cost estimate (or prescribed amount if a certification is\nused); and\n\nTangible net worth of at least $10 million; and\n\nAssets located in the United States amounting to at least 90\npercent of total assets or at least six times the current decommissioning cost\nestimates (or prescribed amount if certification is used). The parent company's independent certified public accountant\nmust have compared the data used by the parent company in the financial test, which is derived from the independently audited, year end financial statements\nfor the latest fiscal year, with the amounts in such financial statement. In\nconnection with that procedure the licensee shall inform the commissioner\nwithin 90 days of any matters coming to the auditor's attention which cause the\nauditor to believe that the data specified in the financial test should be\nadjusted and that the company no longer passes the test. (1) After the initial financial test, the parent company must\nrepeat the passage of the test within 90 days after the close of each\nsucceeding fiscal year. If the parent company no longer meets the requirements of\nsubdivision (a) of this section, the licensee must send notice to the\ncommissioner of intent to establish alternate financial assurance as specified\nin section\n38.7\nof this Part (rule). The\nnotice must be sent by certified mail within 90 days after the end of the\nfiscal year for which the year end financial data show that the parent company\nno longer meets the financial test requirements. The licensee must provide\nalternate financial assurance within 120 days after the end of such fiscal\nyear. C.3 Parent company guarantee. The terms of a parent company\nguarantee which an applicant or licensee obtains must provide that: The parent company guarantee will remain in force unless the\nguarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the licensee and\nthe commissioner. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the 120 days\nbeginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation by both the\nlicensee and the commissioner, as evidenced by the return receipts; If the licensee fails to provide alternate financial assurance\nas specified in the section\n38.7\nof this Part (rule) within 90\ndays after receipt by the licensee and commissioner of a notice of cancellation\nof the parent company guarantee from the guarantor, the guarantor will provide\nsuch alternative financial assurance in the name of the licensee; The parent company guarantee and financial test provisions must\nremain in effect until the commissioner has terminated the license. If a trust is established for decommissioning costs, the\ntrustee and trust must be acceptable to the commissioner. An acceptable trustee\nincludes an entity which has the authority to act as a trustee and whose trust\noperations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State agency. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
