  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 980.11 - Counties within the jurisdiction of a public transportation authority\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the event a public transportation authority encompasses\none or more rural counties, each rural county may make application for aid\nunder this Part. Any such aid may be given to such authority provided such aid\nis used within the rural county to carry out the purposes of this Part. Because\nof a public transportation authority's special lead responsibility for public\ntransportation service within its jurisdiction established by State law, and to\navoid potentially duplicative services or conflicting responsibilities, a rural\ncounty may, either by letter from its chief elected official or by resolution, designate its public transportation authority to do any or all of the\nfollowing: apply for program funds, manage its grant, serve as its Services\n\nCoordinator, develop and implement a coordinated public transportation service\non the county's behalf, or serve as the county's coordinated service operator. Such a designation may be made at any time, either as part of a county's\napplication or after the county has been notified of a grant. Should a rural\ncounty grant recipient, within the jurisdiction of a public transportation\nauthority, desire to designate an entity other than its public transportation\nauthority as its coordinated service operator, the county shall first obtain\nwritten comments from its authority on the county's plan and said designation. The authority's comments shall address all elements of the proposed coordinated\nservice in relation to the authority's public transportation service in the\ncounty, including the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of establishing\nanother public transportation service within the county, and the prospects for\navoiding service duplication. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n980.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
