  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.10 - Declaration of Delinquency\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ndeclaration of delinquency may be issued by a Board member or by a designated\nofficer holding the title of supervising parole officer or higher after\nreceiving the report of violation charges, and after either: (1)\na waiver by the releasee of the\npreliminary hearing; (2)\na finding\nof a preponderance of the evidence at a preliminary hearing; (3)\na conclusion by a Board member or a\ndesignated officer holding the title of supervising parole officer or higher\nthat there is probable cause to believe the releasee has absconded from\nsupervision; or\n(4)\na finding that\nthe releasee has been convicted of a new crime while under their present\nparole, conditional release or period of post-release supervision. (b) The date of delinquency is the\nearliest date that a violation of parole is alleged to have occurred. (c) Where the releasee is alleged to have\nabsconded from supervision, the declaration of delinquency, when issued, shall\ninterrupt the releasee's sentence(s) as of the date of the\ndelinquency. (d) If at the\nconclusion of a final parole revocation hearing a presiding officer dismisses\nall violation charges, any delinquency corresponding to such revocation case\nshall be deemed thereby cancelled. If at the conclusion of such hearing the\npresiding officer sustains any violation charge or charges, the official\ndelinquency date for such matter shall be the earliest date that a violation of\nparole is found to have occurred. (e) A declaration of delinquency shall not be\na necessary part of or prerequisite to the formal parole revocation process or\nany proceeding or decision therein, and the lack of any such declaration shall\nnot be a basis for the vacating of a notice of violation or warrant, or for any\nother form of cancellation or dismissal of the case. (f) Final declaration of delinquency and\nrevocation by new felony conviction and sentence. Whenever a releasee has been: (1)\nconvicted of a new felony committed while\nunder their present parole, conditional release or period of post release\nsupervision, and\n(2)\nsentenced to\nan indeterminate or determinate term upon such conviction, the Board may issue\na final declaration of delinquency, in lieu of directing that a final\nrevocation hearing be held, which will have the effect of revoking such\nperson's parole, conditional release or period of post release supervision. Any\nfinal declaration of delinquency that may be issued shall be so issued upon\nsuch person's reception at an institution under the jurisdiction of the\n\nDepartment of Corrections and Community Supervision pursuant to said new\nindeterminate or determinate sentence. The date of delinquency for the final\ndeclaration of delinquency by the Board may be either the date of the\ncommission of the new felony offense or the date of sentencing for such\noffense. Subsequent to the issuance of the final declaration of delinquency, the incarcerated individual's next appearance before the Board, if any, will be\ngoverned by the calculation of the minimum sentence, or the calculation of the\naggregate minimum sentences, in accordance with applicable law.
