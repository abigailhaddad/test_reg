  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 848.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adopted\nfrom that used by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation\nin its biological survey series of reports on the watersheds of the State. The\nprimary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually\nreferred to by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are\nconsecutively numbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are\nnumbered consecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by\nthe letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation in its biological survey of the Lake Ontario watershed in 1939 and\nhas been closely followed in connection with the identification of the waters\nwith the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run\nconsecutively due to the omission of streams originally shown on older maps\nemployed by the Department of Environmental Conservation at the time of its\n1939 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams and ponds not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps\nare designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lake Ontario drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index no. Name of waters\n\nExplanation\n\nOnt. Lake Ontario\n\nPrimary waters. Ont. 154\n\nSixmile Creek\n\nThe 154th tributary entering Lake Ontario numbering\nclockwise from the mouth at Tibbetts Point. Ont. 154-P 191\n\nUnnamed pond\n\nIndicates that this pond is within or adjacent to\n\nSixmile Creek sub-basin and the 191st pond, lake or reservoir encountered\nwithin the system. (c) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name by which the specifically designated waters are\ngenerally known and which name may appear on the reference maps. In cases of\nspecifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which\nthe unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as possible. (d) Description\nas appearing\nin table I shall mean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically\ndesignated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of\nwaters to which a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful information pertinent to the classification\nand standards. (e) Map ref. no. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced completely, or in part, in section\n848.7, infra. Map ref. no. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\nG-3se\n\nFort Niagara\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\nG-4sw\n\nSixmile Creek\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1949\nG-4se\n\nWilson\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1949\nG-5sw\n\nNewfane\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\nH-3ne\n\nLewiston\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\nH-4nw\n\nRansomville\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\nH-4ne\n\nCambria\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1949\nH-5nw\n\nLockport\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\nH-5ne\n\nGasport\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1950\n(f) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I, and denoted by the letters A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean class A, B or C as the case may be, as set forth\nin Part 701\nsupra. (g) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I, and denoted by the letters A, B or C opposite each specifically\ndesignated waters, shall mean the standards of quality and purity established\nfor class A, B or C as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any class designation\nshall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved\noxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. (h) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib., and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries shall mean any stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are\nmentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water designated by such waters index\nnumber; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters\nindex number, the specifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water designated by such waters index\nnumber and all tributaries and subtributaries, thereof, which are shown on the\nreference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (i) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the same\nclasses and standards of quality and purity as the specifically designated\nwaters to which they are directly tributary. (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein, shall be assigned to class D\nas set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (k) The\ndesignated waters are located in the area within the topographical limits of\nthe drainage basins of Eighteenmile Creek, and other tributaries of Lake\n\nOntario lying westerly between Niagara River and Eighteenmile Creek. Said area\nincludes all land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from\nwhich is directly or indirectly tributary to Lake Ontario above the mouths of\n\nEighteenmile Creek and other Lake Ontario tributaries located between Niagara\n\nRiver and Eighteenmile Creek, and including New York State Barge Canal within\nthe topographical limits of Eighteenmile Creek drainage basin.
