  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-2.1 - Full-time and part-time study and remedial workload\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For programs at degree-granting\ninstitutions which measure study in terms of credit hours or a comparable\nmeasure, the following definitions shall apply: (1)\n(i) For\n\nState student financial aid programs, except the supplemental tuition\nassistance program (STAP), full-time study, where required by law, shall mean\nenrollment in credit-bearing courses applicable to the students' program of\nstudy, for at least 12 semester hours for a semester of not less than 15 weeks\nor 100 calendar days, inclusive of examination periods; or eight semester hours\na quarter; or, in programs not organized on a semester or quarter basis, 24\nsemester hours for an academic year of not more than 12 months or the\nequivalent, as determined by the commissioner. Provided, however, that for the\n2020-2021 academic year, a student shall meet the definition of full-time study\nin accordance with this subparagraph where a student is unable to enroll in\ncredit-bearing courses applicable to the student's program of study for at\nleast 15 weeks for a semester due to the COVID-19 crisis, provided that the\nstudent is enrolled in such credit-bearing courses for a minimum of 12 weeks\nfor a semester and otherwise meets the semester hour requirements prescribed in\nthis subparagraph. (ii)\nA student\nshall be considered full-time for a program organized on an academic-year basis\nonly if the student has filed a plan of study with the institution for the\nentire academic year. Except as otherwise defined in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision, part-time study, for general awards, other than tuition awards for\nveterans and tuition awards for part-time undergraduate students, and for\nacademic performance awards, shall mean enrollment in credit-bearing courses\napplicable to the students' program, for at least 6, but less than 12, semester\nhours or the equivalent for a semester of not less than 15 weeks or 100\ncalendar days, inclusive of examination periods; or at least four, but less\nthan eight, semester hours a quarter. Provided, however, that for the 2020-2021\nacademic year, a student shall meet the definition of part-time in accordance\nwith this subparagraph where a student is unable to enroll in credit-bearing\ncourses applicable to the student's program for at least 15 weeks for a\nsemester due to the COVID-19 crisis, provided that the student is enrolled in\nsuch credit-bearing courses for a minimum of 12 weeks for a semester and meets\nthe semester hour requirements prescribed in this subparagraph. (iii)\n\nThe definition of the term semester\nhour shall be that provided in section\n50.1\n(o) of this\n\nTitle. Independent or individualized study, practice teaching, graduate\nassistantships, thesis or dissertation research, preparation for language or\nqualifying examinations, and noncredit or remedial courses, may all be\nconsidered as contributing toward full-time or part-time study on an\nhour-for-hour equivalent basis, if the student effort required is the same as\nwould be required for a credit-bearing course in conformity with section\n50.1\n(o) of this\n\nTitle, and if required or approved by the school, in a plan of study prefiled\nby the student with the school, as an integral part of the student's program. Credit for independent or individualized study shall be computed in accordance\nwith full-time or part-time requirements. Effective for academic terms\nbeginning after January 1, 1978, a student carrying a full-time program that\nincludes noncredit remedial courses shall carry at least six semester hours a\nsemester, except that in the first semester of study such a student need carry\nonly three semester hours. Effective for academic terms beginning on or after\n\nJuly 1, 1984, a student carrying a part-time program that includes noncredit\nremedial courses shall carry at least three semester hours a semester. A\ncombination of such credit and remedial work shall equal the minimum student\neffort requirement for full- time study or part-time study, respectively, in\nnonremedial programs. However, courses taken solely to meet teacher\ncertification, licensing, or other external requirements, and not recommended\nor required by the school as an integral part of the student's program, shall\nnot contribute to full-time or part-time study. (iv)\n\nExcept as otherwise provided in\nsubdivision (e) of this section and subparagraph (v) of this paragraph, when\ndetermining full-time or part-time status, credit-bearing courses must be\napplicable to the student's program of study as a general education\nrequirement, major requirement, or specified or free elective. Credit-bearing\ncourses not applicable to the student's program of study cannot be included as\npart of the minimum full-time or part-time study requirement. (v) (a) An\ninstitution may grant a waiver of the requirements of subparagraph (iv) of this\nparagraph for purposes of determining full-time status, where the institution\ncertifies, and maintains documentation, that such waiver is in the best\ninterest of the student, and where the student submits an application for such\nwaiver that: (1)\ndemonstrates that their\ninability to meet such requirements is due to circumstances beyond the\nstudent's control, such as the student having earned advanced placement or\nother college credits earned in high school, having transferred into the\ninstitution, encountering obstacles posed by course sequence requirements, or\nchanging majors; (2)\nincludes an\nindividual academic graduation plan, developed with the student's advisor at\nsuch institution, that prescribes how the student will fulfill degree\ncoursework if granted the waiver. Such plan must document a detailed path\ntoward degree completion while maintaining the minimum number of credit hours\nrequired for full-time study status toward the approved program of\nstudy. (b) Institutions\nshall develop criteria and procedures to consider and grant waivers, consistent\nwith the provisions of this subparagraph. Prior approval by the commissioner of\nsuch criteria and procedures shall not be required; however, the institution\nshall make such criteria and procedures available to students and the public, either in writing or on its website. The commissioner may review such criteria\nand procedures and require an institution to revise those found to be not\naligned with the provisions of this subparagraph. (2)\n\nFor the supplemental tuition assistance\nprogram (STAP), full-time study shall mean, in programs organized on a semester\nbasis, enrollment for at least 12 remedial hours of noncredit study in a\nsession of summer remediation immediately preceding and/or immediately\nfollowing the initial year of matriculated study; or in programs organized on a\nquarter basis, enrollment for at least eight remedial hours of noncredit study\nin a session of summer remediation immediately preceding and/or immediately\nfollowing the initial year of matriculated study. The student effort required\nfor a remedial hour shall be the same as would be required for a semester hour\nin conformity with subdivision (o) of section\n50.1\nof this Chapter. (3)\n\nFor the supplemental tuition assistance\nprogram (STAP), an approved program of noncredit-bearing remediation shall mean\nthe student's entire noncredit course load taken in the summer immediately\npreceding and/or immediately following the initial year of matriculated study, subject to the following conditions: (i) such\ncourse load shall have been approved as educationally sound by an institutional\nofficial familiar with the student's academic deficiencies; and\n(ii)\nsuch course load shall consist of\nnoncredit remedial work designed to remedy academic deficiencies which, if not\naddressed, might prevent the student from successfully completing a degree or\ncertificate program at the institution. (4)\n\nFor purposes of section\n661\n(d)(4)\nof the Education Law, for a student\nwith a disability, as defined in\n42 USC\n12102(2)\n(United States\n\nCode, 1994 edition, volume 23; Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government\n\nPrinting Office, Washington, DC 20402; 1995-available at the Office of Higher\n\nEducation, Education Building Annex, Room 979, Albany, NY 12234), part-time\nstudy or attendance shall mean enrollment in credit-bearing courses applicable\nto the students' program, for at least three but less than 12 semester hours\nper semester or the equivalent, or at least two but less than eight semester\nhours per quarter. (b) In\nnoncollegiate programs which measure study solely in terms of instructional\nhours as defined in subdivision (j) of section\n126.1\nof this Chapter, such as\nnondegree two-year business programs and nondegree nursing programs, the\nequivalent of a semester or quarter of full-time study shall require at least\n24 instructional hours a week and part-time study shall require at last 12\ninstructional hours a week. (c) In\nschools not organized on a semester or quarter basis, four months of full-time\nattendance shall be considered the equivalent of a semester. (d) Full-time or part-time status, respectively, must be established independently for each separate semester or\nterm of attendance, except where the measure of full-time is 24 semester hours\nfor an academic year of not more than 12 months as provided for in subdivision\n(a) of this section. (e) A student\nwill be deemed to meet the full-time [or part-time study] requirement in their\nlast semester of eligibility in their program of study if the student takes at\nleast one course needed to meet their graduation requirements and the student\nenrolls in at least 12 semester hours or its equivalent. A student shall be\ndeemed to meet the full-time study requirement in the semester prior to their\nlast semester of eligibility in their program of study if the student takes at\nleast six semester hours needed to meet their graduation requirements and the\nstudent enrolls in at least 12 semester hours or its equivalent. (f) Upon presentation of satisfactory medical\nevidence to substantiate that serious illness or mental or physical disability\nprecludes attendance on a full-time basis, work performed during two or more\nterms of study may be approved as equivalent to a regular term for scholarship, tuition assistance program or other benefits. (g) Upon presentation of satisfactory\nevidence that the commissioner has granted approval for the institution to\nmaintain a statement of academic standards that defines the considerations\nwhich establish equivalency of instruction of study and such statement has been\nadopted by the institution as a result of a disaster as defined in section\n50.1\n(w) of this\n\nTitle, a semester hour of credit may be granted by an institution for fewer\nhours of instruction and study for purposes of a scholarship, tuition\nassistance program or other benefits.
