  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.35 - Water supply-item 7p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Water for\nmilk plant purposes shall be adequate for the operations intended and from an\nadequate supply, properly located, protected and operated. Any water that\ncontacts food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials shall be\neasily accessible and of a safe and sanitary quality, and shall not cause\nallergen cross-contact or increase the level of contamination of the food. Running water at a suitable temperature, and under pressure as needed, shall be\nprovided in all areas where required for the processing of food, for the\ncleaning of equipment, utensils, and food-packaging materials, or for employee\nsanitary facilities. (1)\n\nWhen ice is used in\ncontact with food, it must be made from water that is safe and of adequate\nsanitary quality and shall be used only if it has been manufactured in\naccordance with current good manufacturing practice as set forth in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nPlumbing must be of\nadequate size and design, and shall be adequately installed and maintained, to\ncarry adequate quantities of water to required locations throughout the milk\nplant. (b) The water\nsupply shall be approved as safe by the commissioner, and in the case of\nindividual water systems, it shall contain a MPN (most probable number of\n\nColiform organisms) of less than 1.1 per 100 ml by the multiple tube\nfermentation technique or less than 1.1 per 100 ml by the membrane filter\ntechnique or absent (less than 1 per 100 ml) by the chromogenic substrate\n(MMO-MUG) presence-absence method. (c) There shall be no cross-connection\nbetween the safe water supply and any unsafe or questionable water supply, or\nany source of pollution through which the safe water supply might become\ncontaminated. A connection between the water supply piping and a make-up tank\n(such as for cooling or condensing), unless protected by an air gap or\neffective back-flow preventor, constitutes a violation of this\nrequirement. (d) Condensing water\nfor milk evaporators, and water used to produce vacuum and/or to condense\nvapors in vacuum heat processing equipment, shall be from a source complying\nwith subdivision (b) of this section; provided that, when approved by the\ncommissioner, water from sources not complying with subdivision (b) may be used\nwhen the evaporator or vacuum heat equipment is constructed and operated to\npreclude contamination of such equipment or its contents by condensing water or\nby water used to produce vacuum. Means of preventing such contamination\ninclude: (1)\nuse of a surface-type condenser\nin which the condensing water is physically separated from the vapors and\ncondensate; or\n(2)\nuse of reliable\nsafeguards to prevent the overflow of condensing water from the condenser into\nthe evaporator. Such safeguards include a barometric leg extending at least 35\nfeet vertically from the invert of the outgoing condensing water line to the\nfree level at which the leg discharges, or a safety shutoff valve, located on\nthe water feed line to the condenser, automatically actuated by a control which\nwill shut off the inflowing water when the water level rises above a\npredetermined point in the condenser. This valve may be actuated by water, air\nor electricity, and shall be designed so that failure of the primary motivating\npower will automatically stop the flow of water into the condenser. (e) Condensing water for all milk\nevaporators, complying with subdivision (b) of this section, and water\nreclaimed from milk or milk products may be reused when all necessary means of\nprotection are afforded and such condensing water or reclaimed water has been\ninspected and approved by the commissioner. (f) New individual water supplies and water\nsupply systems, which have been repaired or otherwise become contaminated, shall be disinfected before being placed in use. The supply shall be made free\nof the disinfectant by pumping to waste before any sample for bacteriological\ntesting shall be collected. (g) Water supplies which are otherwise found satisfactory but which are unable to\nmeet the bacteriological standards set forth in this section shall be subjected\nto continuous disinfection by a method and with equipment acceptable to the\ncommissioner. (h) Samples for\nbacteriological testing of individual water supplies shall be taken upon the\ninitial approval of the physical structure, each six months thereafter, and\nwhen any repair or alteration of the water supply system has been made. Bacteriological examinations shall be conducted in an officially designated\nlaboratory. (i) Current records of\nwater tests shall be kept on file by the permittee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
