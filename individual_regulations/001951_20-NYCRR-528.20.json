  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.20 - Cartons, containers, and wrapping and packaging materials and supplies\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1115(a)(19)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nThe sale of cartons, containers, and\nwrapping and packaging materials and supplies, and components thereof for use\nand consumption by a vendor in packaging or packing tangible personal property\nfor sale, and actually transferred by the vendor to the purchaser, is exempt\nfrom sales and use tax. Example 1: A manufacturer sells goods in bulk and ships them in\ncorrugated cardboard cartons to a retailer. The retailer after using the\ncartons as temporary storage and containers removes the goods and discards the\ncartons. The cartons are not subject to tax. Example 2: Wax tissue paper is sold to a bakery which uses it to pick\ncookies from a tray. The cookies and paper are then placed in bags or boxes. The wax paper is taxable; but the bags and boxes are exempt from\ntax. (2)\n\nCartons, containers, and other packaging materials actually transferred to a customer in\nconjunction with the performance of a service subject to tax under paragraphs\n(1), (2), (3) and (5) of subdivision (c) of section\n1105\nof the Tax Law are excluded from sales\ntax as purchased for resale. (See section\n526.6\n[c]\nof this Title.)\n\nExample 3: A watch repairman packs a watch in a box, with cushioning\nmaterial to return it to his customer. The box and packing material is not\ntaxable. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nPackaging material\nincludes, but is not limited to: bags, barrels, baskets, binding, bottles, boxes, cans, carboys, cartons, cellophane, coating and preservative materials, cores, crates, cylinders, drums, excelsior, glue, gummed labels, gummed tape, kegs, lumber used for blocking, pails, pallets, reels, sacks, spools, staples, strapping, string, tape, twine, wax\npaper and wrapping paper actually transferred with the product to the\npurchaser. (2)\n\nThe term\nvendor\nin this section refers to any person who sells tangible\npersonal property whether manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer, processor or\nassembler. (3)\n\nThe term\npurchaser\nin this section refers to any person purchasing\ntangible personal property from a vendor, whether or not he is the ultimate\nconsumer. (4)\n\nActually\ntransferred\nmeans that the packaging material is physically\ntransferred to the purchaser, for whatever disposition the purchaser wishes. Example 1: A returnable soda bottle may be returned for a refund of\ndeposit or disposed of otherwise. Such a bottle is actually transferred to the\npurchaser and may be purchased without payment of tax. Example 2: A keg of beer is required to be returned to the vendor\nafter its contents is used. This keg is not actually transferred to the\npurchaser of the beer, and may not be purchased by the vendor without payment\nof tax. (c) Taxable cartons, containers, and wrapping and packaging materials and\nsupplies. (1)\n\nReturnable containers, such as drums, barrels, or acid carboys, when purchased at retail by a person\nwho does not transfer ownership of the container, are subject to tax. Title to\nthe container remains in the seller when possession of the container is\ntransferred to one who purchases commodities contained therein and then returns\nthe container to the seller for refilling. Example 1: A chemical firm produces acid for use in various processes. The acid is placed in carboys which are purchased by the firm for moving the\nacid between plants. The carboys are taxable. (2)\n\nCartons or other packaging materials\npurchased by a vendor for his own use or consumption are subject to\ntax. (3)\n\nRacks, trays or similar\ndevices used to facilitate delivery of the vendor's product if such devices are\nnot transferred with the product to the purchaser are subject to tax. Example 2: A baking company delivers bread to a grocer in wire trays. After unloading, the delivery man takes the trays with him. The trays are\ntaxable to the baking company. (4)\n\nPackaging materials used in connection\nwith rendition of exempt services are subject to tax. Example 3: A dry cleaner purchases rolls of plastic bags to package\nclean garments. Such purchases are subject to tax. Example 44: Protective coverings used by carriers or movers are subject\nto tax. (d) Cups, plates and other containers, purchased by restaurants and other\neating establishments for resale as containers. (1)\n\nCups, plates and containers for hot and\ncold drinks purchased for resale as a container of food or drink of any nature\ntaxed under section\n1105 (d)\nof the Tax Law, and actually transferred to the purchaser of such food or drink, are purchased\nfor resale and thus not subject to sales or use taxes. (i) The following is a list, which is not\nintended to be all-inclusive, of packaging materials which may be purchased\nunder the resale exclusion of the Tax Law: (a) sandwich wrappers; (b) cups and lids; (c) food sleeves; (d) disposable plates; and\n(e) paper bags. (2)\n\nNapkins, straws, stirrers, plastic knives, forks, spoons and other similar items are not purchased for\nresale as such, nor are they packaging materials or supplies or components\nthereof. Purchases of these items by restaurants and similar establishments are\nnot purchases for resale nor exempted from tax by paragraph (19) of section\n1115 (a)\nof the Tax Law, and are subject to tax. Example 1: A restaurant purchases napkins, straws and stirrers which\nare made available to its customers. The purchase of these supply items is\nsubject to tax whether purchased for on- or off-premises consumption. Example 2: A food vending machine operator purchases stirrers and\nnapkins. Since these supplies do not become part of the products sold nor are\nthey used to package the product, they are subject to tax. (e) Exemption\ncertificates. (1)\nA purchaser of\npackaging material which qualifies for exemption or for the resale exclusion\nmay purchase the material without payment of tax by issuing an exempt use\ncertificate (ST-121) or a resale certificate to the vendor. (2)\nA person who produces tangible personal\nproperty for sale by farming may purchase packaging material without payment of\ntax by issuing a farmer's exemption certificate (ST-125) to the\nvendor. (3)\n\nAn exemption\ncertificate shall be given only by the original purchaser of cartons or other\npackaging material. Example: A manufacturer purchases cartons and other packaging\nmaterials from a supplier. The manufacturer's products are sold to a\ndistributor who resells them to a retailer. When the manufacturer purchases the\ncartons and other packaging materials, which are transferred to the distributor\nwith the product, an exempt use certificate should be issued to the supplier\nfor the packaging materials. Subsequent sale and transfer of such packaging\nmaterials to the distributor and retailer do not require any certificate with\nrespect to the packaging. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
