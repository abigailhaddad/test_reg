  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 473.9 - Application for consignment permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Eligible carriers who need emergency\npermits in a volume amounting to 200 permits or more per year may apply for\nconsignment permits. Consignment permits may only be used for vehicles owned by\nthe carrier or under long-term lease where the carrier has complete control\nover the leased vehicle. Consignment permits may be requested in units of not\nless than 20 permits nor more than 200 permits. The permit fees must be paid in\nfull with the filing of the application, and permit fees paid are not\nrefundable except in the case where a replacement series has been required and\nin such event unused permits may be converted to the current series permits. The number of permits requested and the number to be issued at any one time may\nnot exceed 10 percent of the vehicles then registered to the applicant under\narticle 21 of the Tax Law. Successive applications will not be accepted until\n75 percent of the previous order of consignment permits have been registered\nwith the department to a particular vehicle. (b) Permits issued by the department to\napplicants on a request for consignment permits may not be used by the\napplicant for trucks or trailers which transport automotive fuel, nor may they\nbe used for omnibuses nor may they be used as a replacement for a lost or\nstolen sticker. Consignment permits may be used only by the carrier to whom\nthey were issued and may not be transferred. (c) A carrier is not eligible to apply for\nconsignment permits unless the carrier has filed timely returns for the return\nperiods in the 12 months preceding the date of application and paid with such\nreturns all taxes due and provides the evidence of financial responsibility\nrequested. Permission to use or to continue to use consignment permits may be\nwithdrawn at any time if the carrier fails to file a highway use permit report\nwhen a motor vehicle (other than an omnibus, or a truck or trailer required to\ndisplay an \"AFC\" sticker) of the carrier is employed on a public highway of\nthis State with a consignment sticker, if such a permit report is not timely\nfiled or if the truck mileage or fuel use tax returns of the taxpayer are not\ntimely filed or the tax is not timely paid. (d) Immediately after a consignment permit\nand sticker is assigned to a motor vehicle, the carrier must complete form\nTMT-1.11, Consignment Highway Use Permit Report, and forward such form to the\n\nTax Department. (e) Any change\nrelating to the information contained in the application must be reported\nimmediately to the Tax Department. Thus, any change in the carrier's business\nor other address, or in the name of ownership of its business must be so\nreported. (f) In addition, if a\nmotor vehicle for which a permit has been issued is transferred or junked or if\nthe business of a permit holder is sold or if the lease of a motor vehicle for\nwhich a permit has been issued has expired, the Tax Department must be notified\nwithin five days. In such cases the sticker must be destroyed and the permit\nmust be returned to the department for cancellation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
