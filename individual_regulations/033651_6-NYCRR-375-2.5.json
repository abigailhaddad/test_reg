The department shall provide written notice no less than 30 days prior to\ncommencing a lawsuit seeking indemnification. (b) State assistance contracts for\nmunicipalities. (1)\n\nUpon approval by the\ndepartment of an application for assistance under section\n375-2.3\nof this Subpart, the\nmunicipality must enter into a State assistance contract with the department. The State assistance contract will be subject to approval by the State\n\nComptroller and, as to form, by the Attorney General, and: (i) in addition to such further terms and\nconditions as the department may require in the State assistance contract, the\n\nState assistance contract shall be deemed to include, and the municipality\nshall comply with, all of the provisions set forth in sections\n375-1.5\n(b)(1) and\n(4)\nand\n375-4.5\n(b)(9)\nof\nthis Part; (ii)\ninclude the terms\nand conditions set forth in paragraphs (2) through (6) of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nshall be binding upon the\nmunicipality.

If the municipality fails to make such repayment\nwithin 60 days of notification, the department may take measures provided by\nstatute relating to the recovery of State assistance. The municipality will\nimmediately notify the department in writing of its receipt of reimbursement\nfrom other sources for any expenditure for which State assistance may be\nprovided under the State assistance contract. (4)\n\nThe department will suspend payments\nunder the State assistance contract until the municipality has cured the\nfailure, if the commissioner determines that the municipality: (i) has failed to comply with any of the\nrequirements of applicable State or Federal laws and regulations; (ii)\nhas failed to comply with any of the\nrequirements of the State assistance contract; (iiii)\nwithout good cause, as determined by\nthe department, the municipality has failed to initiate, proceed with, or\ncomplete the department-approved project in accordance with its schedule; or\n(iv)\nhas changed the\ndepartment approved project or any portion thereof without the department's\nprior written approval.
