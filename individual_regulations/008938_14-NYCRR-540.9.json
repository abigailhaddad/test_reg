  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 540.9 - Hospital forensic committee procedures; clinical director\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A patient who\nwishes to be discharged or conditionally released, converted to civil status, transferred to a less secure facility or granted escorted or unescorted\nfurlough privileges or his or her legal representative may request his\ntreatment team to make an appropriate application to the hospital forensic\ncommittee. (b) When the treatment\nteam serving a patient is of the opinion that such patient is appropriate for\nescorted furlough, unescorted furlough, transfer, discharge, conditional\nrelease or conversion to civil status, it shall recommend to the unit chief\nthat an application be made to the hospital forensic committee and the clinical\ndirector. When the treatment team serving a patient is of the opinion that such\npatient is appropriate for return to the custody of the criminal court, it\nshall recommend to the unit chief that an application be made to the hospital\nforensic committee or to the clinical director, if he or she has designated a\npsychiatric examiner in accordance with procedures described in section\n540.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The treatment team may act on its own initiative or at the patient's\nrequest. (c) If the unit chief, after review of the case, agrees with the opinion of the treatment team, he or\nshe and the team psychiatrist shall execute an application. Upon completion of\nthe application, the unit chief shall forward it to the hospital forensic\ncommittee or to the clinical director, if he or she has designated a\npsychiatric examiner in accordance with the procedures described in section\n540.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (d) The committee shall meet\nto discuss the application within seven days of its receipt of the application\nfrom the unit chief. The committee shall notify the patient, the patient's\nattorney, and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service of its meeting at least three\ndays prior to the meeting. Proof of service of such notice shall be placed in\nthe patient's record. The patient, the Mental Hygiene Legal Service or an\nattorney or representative of his or her choice may attend the\nmeeting. (e) The committee shall\nreview all information pertaining to the patient and, if necessary, conduct a\njoint examination of the patient. Within seven days of its meeting to discuss\nthe application, the committee shall make a written recommendation to the\nclinical director regarding the merits of the application. Such recommendation\nneed not be unanimous. If one member of the committee disagrees, he or she\nshall so notify the clinical director, in writing. (f) If the application on behalf of the\npatient is for conversion of the patient to civil status, the committee shall\nconsider whether the patient is mentally ill, in need of care and treatment in\na hospital, lacks the judgment necessary to understand such need, and would\neither be unable to live outside the hospital with the help of family or\nfriends or would pose a danger to himself or herself or others. If the patient\nmeets such criteria, the committee shall recommend to the clinical director\nthat the patient be involuntarily civilly committed. If the patient does not\nmeet those criteria but is suitable for continued hospitalization, the\ncommittee shall recommend to the clinical director that the patient be\nconverted to voluntary civil status. If the patient should not be hospitalized, the committee shall so recommend to the clinical director. (g) If an application is made seeking the\ndischarge or conditional release of a patient against whom criminal charges are\nnot pending, the committee shall consider whether the patient suffers a mental\nillness and requires inpatient care and treatment in a hospital, lacks the\njudgment to understand his or her need for such treatment and would either be\nunable to live outside the hospital with the help of family or friends or would\npose a danger to himself or herself or other persons if released. If the\npatient meets each of the above criteria, the committee shall recommend that\nthe patient continue in the custody of the commissioner as an involuntary civil\npatient. If the committee believes that the patient does not meet such\ncriteria, it shall recommend that the patient be released. (h) If an application is made to the\ncommittee in accordance with the procedures described in section\n540.8\n(b) of this\n\nPart, for a determination of fitness to stand trial and return to court of a\npatient against whom criminal changes remain pending, the committee shall\nconsider whether the patient suffers a mental illness which renders him or her\nincapable of understanding the charges against him and assisting in his or her\nown defense. (i) If an application\nis made for the granting of escorted or unescorted furlough, the committee may\nrecommend that such furlough privileges be granted if it finds that they would\nbe clinically beneficial to the patient and that, in its opinion, the patient\nmay be granted furlough privileges without endangering another person or\npersons outside the facility. If the committee recommends that escorted or\nunescorted furlough be granted, it shall also recommend the duration of each\nexercise of those furlough privileges and the period of time for which the\ngranting of furlough privileges should remain outstanding. If an application is\nmade to grant a patient escorted or unescorted furlough privileges and the\ncommittee is of the opinion that the patient would pose an immediate danger to\nanother person or persons if allowed outside the facility, or that the patient\nis otherwise not suited for such furlough, it shall recommend that the furlough\nbe denied. (j) If an application is\nmade to transfer the patient to a less secure facility, the committee shall\nconsider whether such transfer would be in the best interest of the patient and\nwhether the patient's behavior is such that the transfer would jeopardize the\nsafety of the patient, other patients or staff at a less secure facility. If\nthe committee is of the opinion that such transfer could jeopardize the safety\nof the patient or any other person, or would render an escape attempt likely, it shall recommend against transfer. (k) (1)\n\nThe\nclinical director shall have responsibility for deciding whether to grant an\napplication for the conversion to civil status, granting of furlough, discharge, or conditional release of a patient. In exercising such\nresponsibility, he or shall review the recommendations of the hospital forensic\ncommittee. The clinical director need not follow such recommendations, but\nshall not take action contrary to the recommendation of a majority of the\ncommittee without first consulting with a clinician who is not employed at the\nfacility. (2)\n\nThe clinical director\nshall have responsibility for deciding whether to grant an application for a\nreturn to court of a patient who is no longer an incapacitated person but\nagainst whom criminal charges remain pending. In exercising such\nresponsibility, he or she shall: (i) review\nthe recommendation of the hospital forensic committee if consultation is\nrequested in accordance with section\n540.8\n(b) of this\n\nPart. The clinical director is not required to follow such recommendations, but\nshall not take action contrary to the recommendation of a majority of the\ncommittee without first consulting with a clinician who is not employed at the\nfacility; or\n(ii)\nreview the report\nand recommendations of the psychiatric examiner that he or she has designated\nin accordance with the procedures described in section\n540.8\n(c) of this\n\nPart. The clinical director is not required to follow such\nrecommendations. (l) If the clinical director decides to grant\na patient escorted or unescorted furlough, he or she shall specify the\nallowable duration of each exercise of those furlough privileges and the period\nof time for which furlough privileges may be granted. (m) In the event the patient's treatment team\nbecomes aware of a change in the patient's condition that would warrant\ndiscontinuation of escorted or unescorted furlough, the treatment team leader\nshall so notify the unit chief, who shall notify the clinical director, who may\nrevoke the grant of such furlough privileges to the patient. The unit chief or\nthe physician treating the patient may immediately suspend a patient's furlough\nprivileges in the event of an emergency. (n) If the clinical director decides to grant\nthe patient's application, he or she shall follow the notice requirements\ndescribed in section\n540.10\nof this Part, if\napplicable. (o) The clinical\ndirector need not comply with the notice requirements and procedures described\nin section\n540.10\nof this Part if a hearing\nis held at the time a patient is converted to civil status or at any other time\nafter commitment and a court issues an order authorizing transfer, discharge, conditional release, or the granting of escorted or unescorted privileges at\nthe discretion of the facility.
