Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.12 - Blowdown adjustment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Safety valves shall be designed and constructed to operate without chattering\nand to attain full lift at a pressure no greater than 3 percent above their set\npressure. After blowing down, all valves shall close at a pressure not lower\nthan 96 percent of their set pressure, except that all drum valves installed on\na single boiler may be set to reseat at a pressure not lower than 96 percent of\nthe set pressure of the lowest set drum valve. The minimum blowdown for\nspring-loaded safety or safety relief valves shall be 2 percent of the set\npressure. Safety valves used on forced-flow steam generators with no fixed\nsteam and waterline, and safety relief valves used on high-temperature water\nboilers, may be set and adjusted to close after blowing down not more than 10\npercent of the set pressure. The valves for these special uses must be so\nadjusted and marked by the manufacturer. (b) The blowdown adjustment shall be made and\nsealed by the manufacturer. (c) The\npopping point tolerance plus or minus shall not exceed the following: two\npounds for pressures up to and including 70 pounds, three percent for pressures\nfrom 71 to 300 pounds and 10 pounds for pressures from 301 to 1000 pounds, and\none percent for pressures over 1000 pounds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
