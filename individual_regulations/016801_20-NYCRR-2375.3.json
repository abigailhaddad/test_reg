  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.3 - Declaratory rulings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nOn the petition of any person, the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance may promulgate a declaratory ruling\nwith respect to: (i) the applicability to any\nperson, property or state of facts of any rule or regulation or statute\nenforceable by the Division of Taxation; (ii)\nwhether any action by the division\nshould be taken pursuant to a rule or regulation; or\n(iii)\nwhether compliance with a requirement\nimposed by the Federal government will be accepted as compliance with a\ndivision requirement of a similar nature. All duly submitted petitions\nregarding whether any action by the division should be taken pursuant to a rule\nor regulation will be reviewed by the commissioner and, within 60 days from the\nreceipt of the petition, a ruling will be promulgated by the commissioner, or\nthe petitioner will be notified that no ruling will be promulgated. All other\nduly submitted petitions for declaratory rulings will be reviewed by the\ncommissioner and, within 30 days from the receipt of the petition, a ruling\nwill be promulgated by the commissioner, or the petitioner will be notified\nthat no ruling will be promulgated. Declaratory rulings will ordinarily be\npromulgated for prospective planning purposes concerning issues of wide\napplication. These rulings are usually reserved for those broad issues that\ndirectly affect an entire industry or a large group of similarly situated\ntaxpayers. Any person who is seeking a ruling that is binding upon both the\ndivision and the commissioner and that has a narrow application may petition\nfor an advisory opinion (see Part 2376 of this Title). (2)\n(i) A\ndeclaratory ruling is personally signed by the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance and is made available to the public upon request. However, except as\nprovided in section 206 of the State Administrative Procedure Act regarding the\nacceptance of compliance with a Federal requirement as compliance with a\ndivision requirement, the promulgation of a declaratory ruling is discretionary\nwith the commissioner. Provided, further, declaratory rulings will not be\npromulgated where a petition for a declaratory ruling covers a pending issue or\nset of facts raised by the petitioner in: (a) a petition for a decision or determination by the Division of Tax Appeals of\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance pursuant to Part 3000 of this Title or\nany appeal therefrom; (b) a request\nfor a conciliation conference and issuance of a conciliation order by the\ndivision's Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services pursuant to Part 4000\nof this Title; or\n(c) a petition\nfor an advisory opinion by the commissioner pursuant to Part 2376 of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\nA person\nshall not be precluded from withdrawing a given request or petition and timely\nutilizing an alternative procedure. (3)\n\nDeclaratory rulings are authorized by\nsections 204 and 206 of the State Administrative Procedure Act. (b) Submission of petition. Petitions for declaratory rulings must be forwarded to the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227, on forms provided\nby the division. The petition shall set forth in sufficient detail the matter\nwith respect to which a ruling is sought. The petition shall also state the\nlaws, rules or regulations and sections thereof which the petitioner deems\nappropriate, and such other details necessary to identify the specific rule, regulation or statute. (c) Force\nand effect. Declaratory rulings do not have the force and effect of law or\nregulation, but may be cited as precedent in establishing the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance's official position with respect to any matter involving\nthe division, if not changed, altered or set aside as provided herein. The\ndivision and the commissioner will be bound by the conclusions stated in any\ndeclaratory ruling (including declaratory rulings promulgated prior to\n\nSeptember 1, 1987 by the State Tax Commission), unless the ruling is changed\nprospectively by either the promulgation of an amendment to such declaratory\nruling or the adoption of a division regulation, or unless the ruling is\naltered or set aside by the Tax Appeals Tribunal (see, however, section\n2375.1\n[a][2]\nof this Part), a court of competent jurisdiction or duly enacted legislation. A\ndeclaratory ruling is subject to direct review as provided in section 204 of\nthe State Administrative Procedure Act. A taxpayer or other person will not be\nbound by a declaratory ruling nor may the division retroactively change a valid\ndeclaratory ruling or the conclusions stated in such ruling. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
