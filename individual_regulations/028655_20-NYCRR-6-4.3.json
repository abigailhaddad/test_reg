Tit. 20 §§ 6-4.3 - Extension of time for filing reports\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 211(1))\n(a) An automatic six-month extension of time\nfor filing an annual report will be granted if an application for automatic\nextension is filed and a properly estimated tax is paid on or before the due\ndate of the report for the taxable period for which the extension is requested. Failure to meet any of the requirements in this section makes the application\ninvalid and any report filed after the due date will be treated as a late filed\nreport. (b) An automatic six-month\nextension of time for filing a combined report will be granted to a group of\ncorporations filing a combined report provided an application for automatic\nextension is filed and properly estimated tax is paid on or before the due date\nof the report for the taxable period for which the extension is requested. Failure to meet any of the requirements in this section makes the application\ninvalid and any report filed after the due date will be treated as a late filed\nreport. To obtain an automatic extension, an application must be filed by the\ndesignated agent for the combined group. However, each taxpayer member\ncorporation of a new combined group also must file a separate application to\nextend the time to file for the first period for which the new combined group\nactually files a combined report. In addition, each taxpayer member corporation\nbeing newly added to an existing combined group must also file a separate\napplication to extend the time to file the report for the first period for\nwhich they are actually included in the combined group's report. Corporations\nincluded in the combined report that are not subject to tax are not required to\nfile a separate application to extend the time to file. Each applicant must\nsubmit the following information: (1)\n\nThe name\nof each corporation included in the combined group. (2)\n\nThe employer identification number of\neach corporation in the combined group. (3)\n\nFor any appropriate corporation, the\nbeginning and ending dates of any taxable year of less than 12\nmonths. (4)\n\nThe estimated fixed\ndollar minimum tax for each member of the combined group that is taxable in New\n\nYork State. (5)\n\nFrom the report\nfiled for the taxable year immediately preceding the taxable year for which the\nextension is being requested, the sum of any overpayment requested to be\ncredited to the next period, plus any tax credits to be applied to the next\nperiod. (6)\n\nIf a corporation made\nany separate estimated tax installment payments for the taxable year for which\nthe extension is being requested, the total amount for that\ncorporation. (7)\n\nIf a payment was\nmade on an extension filed for the taxable year for which the extension is\nbeing requested, the corporation that filed the form and the amount of payments\nit made, if any. (8)\n\nAny\nprepayments made by the designated agent, as applicable. The designated agent\nfor the combined group must pay with its application the properly estimated\ncombined tax, including the tax measured by the fixed dollar minimum for each\nof the other taxpayers included in the combined group. (c) On or before the expiration of the\nautomatic six-month extension of time for filing a report, the commissioner may\ngrant additional three-month extensions of time for filing reports when good\ncause exists. No more than two additional three-month extensions of time for\nfiling a report for any taxable year may be granted. An application for each\nadditional three-month extension must be made in writing before the expiration\nof the previous extension. Additional extensions of time for filing a New York\nS Corporation franchise tax return will not be granted. Additional extensions\nof time for filing by a combined group must be requested in one application by\nthe designated agent for the combined group. The applicant must submit the\nfollowing information: (1)\nits complete\ncorporate name; (2)\nits employer\nidentification number; (3)\nthe\nreason for requesting the additional extension; and\n(4)\nin the case of an application by a\ncombined group, a list showing the corporate name, employer identification\nnumber, and taxable period of each of the other corporations properly included\nas part of the combined group. (d) Any extension of time for filing a report\ngranted under this Subpart will not extend the time for the payment of any tax\ndue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
