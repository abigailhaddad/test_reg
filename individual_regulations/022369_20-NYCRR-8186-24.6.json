Tit. 20 §§ 8186-24.6 - Stratification of ordinary classes and large units\n\nState Regulations\n\nUpon completion of the classified roll, each ordinary class\nshall be stratified by performing the following operations according to the\nmethodology which is set forth in section\n8186-24.12\nof this Subpart. However, where the 1989 survey classified roll is the\nclassified roll originally prepared for the 1986 survey, all determinations\nmade pursuant to former 9 NYCRR Subpart\n186-22, as repealed in 1996 are\napplicable for the 1989 survey. (a) Determine the sample size for the municipality and, if the municipality\ncontains more than one survey unit, the sample size of each survey\nunit. (b) Determine the number of\nsample parcels for each class within the survey unit. (c) Determine the number of value intervals\nfor each such class.

(f) Randomly\nselect the sample parcels and alternates for each such interval. (g) Designate the intervals from which\nsamples are drawn as \"S\" intervals. (h) Designate the intervals from which\nsamples are not drawn as \"U\" intervals. (i) Assign to each large unit exactly one \"T\"\ninterval and select the large unit as the sample parcel for that\ninterval. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
