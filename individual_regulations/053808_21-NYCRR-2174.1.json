Tit. 21 § 2174.1 - Reduction or termination of grant\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen the corporation determines that a grantee has failed\nto meet one or more of the requirements of the grant agreement, the corporation\nmay reduce or recapture the grant, including amounts already obligated, or take\nother appropriate action. For purposes of this section, other appropriate\naction means any remedial action legally available, including, without\nlimitation, demanding in writing that the grantee reimburse (and the grantee\nwill reimburse) the corporation in the amount of the ineligible costs, and\nbringing affirmative litigation, such as suits for declaratory judgment, specific performance, temporary or permanent injunctions and any other\navailable remedies. In the event that the corporation makes such a\ndetermination, then the grantee will deliver to the corporation all original\ndocuments relevant to the project(s) or program, including but not limited to\nany construction agreements, loan documents and any other related documents\nthat the corporation may require. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n2174.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
