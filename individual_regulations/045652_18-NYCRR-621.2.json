Tit. 18 § 621.2 - Conditions for reimbursement for home relief\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any claims for reimbursement which do not\nreflect claims for home relief expenditures, including claims for reimbursement\nunder the emergency assistance for adults program, must not be claimed pursuant\nto this Part. (b) Any claims for\nreimbursement for assistance provided under a program or activity other than\nthe home relief program, or an activity authorized by the home relief program, which were not reimbursed and which were properly made at the time\nreimbursement was originally claimed, may be claimed as home relief if they\ncould have been so claimed at the time the claims were originally submitted, provided that the claim is still timely and that an adjustment to reduce the\noriginal claim is simultaneously submitted. (c) Any claims for reimbursement for home\nrelief which are subsequently determined by the department to be reimbursable\nfrom, or for which reimbursement is actually received or credited from, another\nprogram or activity or other source, must be reduced in an amount equivalent to\nthe amount determined by the department to be due from such other program, activity or source. (d) Claims for\nreimbursement for home relief shall not be submitted for reimbursement if such\nclaims seek reimbursement at rates or amounts that are greater than rates or\namounts permitted by law. (e) Any\nadjustments of claims for reimbursement shall be made in accordance with\nprocedures, instructions or directions of the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
