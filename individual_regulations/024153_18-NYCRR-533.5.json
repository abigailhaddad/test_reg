  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 533.5 - Anesthesia and surgery\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll fees billed must be in accordance with the provisions\nof Part 505 of this Subchapter. (a) Anesthesia. (1)\n\nThe conversion\nfactor for the anesthesia services and procedures listed in this section shall\nbe $5. (2)\n\nAnesthesia values. (i) The total values for anesthesia services\ninclude pre- and post-operative visits, the administration of the anesthesia\nand the administration of fluids and/or blood incident to the anesthesia or\nsurgery. (ii)\n\nCalculated values for\nanesthesia services shall be used only when the anesthesia is personally\nadministered by a licensed physician who remains in constant attendance during\nthe procedure for the sole purpose of rendering such anesthesia\nservices. (iii)\n\nFor anesthesia\nprocedures, the same item number as the related surgical procedure shall be\nused with the suffix \"a\" added. (iv)\n\nWhen hypothermia and/or pump oxygenator\nare employed in conjunction with an anesthesia, the anesthesia \"basic\" value\nshall be 20 units instead of the \"basic\" value presently listed and the suffix\n\"y\" shall be substituted for \"a\". (v) If the general or regional anesthetic is\nadministered by the attending surgeon, the value shall be 50 percent of the\ncalculated value and the suffix \"p\" shall be substituted for \"a\". (vi)\n\nIn procedures where no value is listed, the basic portion of the calculated value shall be the same as listed for a\ncomparable procedure. (vii)\n\nNecessary drugs and materials provided by the physician anesthetist may be\ncharged for separately. (viii)\n\nWhere unusual detention with the patient is essential for the safety and\nwelfare of such patient, the necessary time shall be valued on the same basis\nas indicated below for anesthesia time. (ix)\n\nNo fee shall be allowed for local\ninfiltration or digital block anesthesia administered by the operating\nsurgeon. (3)\n\nCalculation\nof total anesthesia values. Calculation of total anesthesia value shall be determined\nby adding the listed basic value and time units. The time units shall be\ncomputed by allowing one unit for each 15 minutes of anesthesia time. Anesthesia time shall start with the beginning of the administration of the\nanesthetic agents and shall end when the physician anesthetist is no longer in\npersonal attendance. (b) Surgery. (1)\n\nThe conversion factor for the surgical\nservices and procedures listed in this section shall be $4. (2)\n\nThe values hereinafter listed for\nsurgical procedures include the surgery and follow-up care for the period\nindicated. In cases in which follow-up care beyond the required period is\nnecessary, reimbursement shall be available for additional payments made by the\nsocial services district to the physician on a fee-for-service basis. (3)\n\nWhere an asterisk (*) precedes a\nprocedure number and its listed value, reimbursement shall be determined on the\nbasis of the following factors: (i) the listed\nvalue is for the surgical procedure only; (ii)\nreimbursement for all post-operative\ncare shall be available for payments made to the physician on a fee-for-service\nbasis; (iii)\nwhen such procedure\nrequires admission to a hospital, an additional two units shall be added to its\nlisted value in lieu of any hospital visit fee; (iv)\nwhen such procedure is carired out at\nthe time of the initial visit, one additional unit shall be added to the value\nof the procedure in lieu of any office visit fee. (4)\n\nWhen the notation \"Sv\" follows a listed\nsurgical procedure, the maximum reimbursable allowance therefor shall be the\nsum of the values of the various respective services rendered, such as for a\nhospital visit, application of cast or splint, detention with the patient, or\noffice visit, multiplied by the respective appropriate conversion\nfactor. (5)\n\nIn the event of\ncomplications or other circumstances requiring additional and unusual services\nconcurrent with the procedure or during the established period of follow-up\ncare, reimbursement shall be available for payment to a physician on a\nfee-for-service basis in addition to the reimbursement for the\nprocedure. (6)\n(i) When multiple or bilateral surgical\nprocedures are performed at the same operative session, the total value shall\nbe the value of the major procedure plus 50 percent of the value of the lesser\nprocedure(s) after the conversion factor ($4) has been applied to all fee\nitems, unless otherwise specified. (ii)\n\nWhen an incidental procedure, such as an\nincidental appendectomy, lysis of adhesions, excision of a previous scar, or\npuncture of an ovary cyst, is performed through the same incision, the value of\nsuch procedure shall be that of the major procedure only, unless otherwise\nspecified. (7)\n\nWhen the\nskills of two surgeons are required in the management of a specific surgical\nprocedure, by prior agreement, the total value may be apportioned in relation\nto the responsibility and work done, provided the patient is made aware of the\nfee distribution according to medical ethics. The value of such procedure may\nbe increased by 25 percent. (8)\n\nWhen an additional surgical procedure is carried out within the established\nperiod of follow-up care for a previous surgery, the follow-up periods for each\nshall be deemed to run concurrently. (9)\n\nWhen the value of a surgical procedure is\nto be determined \"by report\", the social services district shall require the\nphysician to submit the following information: (i) postoperative diagnosis; (ii)\nsize, location and number of lesions on\nprocedures where appropriate; (iii)\nmajor surgical procedure and supplementary procedures; (iv)\nwhere possible, a list of similar\nprocedures, by item number, as set forth in this section; (v) an estimate of the follow-up\nperiod; (vi)\noperative\ntime; (vii)\nsuch other information\nas may be required. (10)\n\nIn the case of a kidney transplant, procedure item 3850, if the recipient of a\nkidney transplant is eligible for medical assistance, all costs attributable to\nmedical services provided to a live donor of a kidney shall be reimbursable. If, however, the recipient of a kidney transplant is not eligible for medical\nassistance, payments for neither the transplant nor the costs incured for the\nlive donor shall be reimbursable even though the live donor may be eligible for\nmedical assistance. (11)\n\nSurgical\nfees. The maximum reimbursable allowance for the numbered and\ndescribed items of surgical procedures listed in this section shall be computed\non the basis of the respective listed value multiplied by the conversion factor\nof $4. (12)\n\nThe maximum\nreimbursable allowance to an individual physician for a single operation shall\nbe $800.
