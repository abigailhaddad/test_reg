Each provider that wishes\nto accept court-referred participants must be certified by the Office of Court\n\nAdministration. In order to receive certification, potential providers must\nsubmit a certification application and any requested materials to the program\ndirector and be in compliance prior to being eligible to receive court-referred\nparticipants. A provider is under a continuing duty to advise the program\ndirector of changes in its education and awareness program or administration, including changes in staff, contact information, presenters/facilitators, locations, and class schedules. (b) Certification application\n(application). To receive certification, a provider must submit information and\ndocumentation that demonstrates that it is in compliance with the guidelines. Each provider must submit three copies of the application and appended\nmaterials for each program, which must address all of the elements. If a\nprovider expects that it will not be able to comply with a requirement, an\nexplanation must be provided. A provider may also be required to submit\nadditional information and materials for continued certification or\nre-certification, or in the event a complaint or other information is received\nby the program director indicating that the program may not be in compliance\nwith the guidelines. (c) Waiver or modification of\nrequirements. A waiver or modification of one or more of the requirements for\ncertification or re-certification may be requested by a provider and must be\nincluded in the provider's application as well as in the cover letter to the\napplication. Requests must be made by letter to the program director sent via\nfirst class mail. Such request may be granted in the discretion of the program\ndirector in consultation with the Chief Administrator of the Courts or his or\nher designee after review and consideration of the impact of the deviation upon\nthe underlying intent and purpose of the guidelines. (d) Review process. Certification applications shall be reviewed by the program director in a\ntimely manner. After a satisfactory initial review of the application, an\non-site review of the program shall be conducted by the program director or his\nor her designee. During the on-site review, the program director shall observe\nthe presentation of a full program cycle and may interview the program\nadministrator. To promote consistency in the review process, the program\ndirector shall use a uniform written instrument to evaluate the programs. The\ndetermination of the program director shall be communicated to the provider by\nletter sent via first class mail. The opportunity for a provider to seek a\nreview of any denial of certification or re-certification or suspension or\nrevocation of certification shall be in accordance with the provisions set\nforth in the guidelines. (e) Approved providers. Approved\nproviders will be compiled in a list that will be updated and distributed\nregularly to the courts, Supreme and County and Family Court Chief Clerks, and\nothers, as appropriate, and posted on the program website. A provider is\nrequired to keep the program director apprised of its current information. Approved providers may indicate in advertisements and other uses that their\nprogram is certified by the Office of Court Administration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
