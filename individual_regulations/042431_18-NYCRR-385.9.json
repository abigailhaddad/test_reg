The maximum number of hours a recipient or applicant may be required\nto engage in this activity is limited to the number which equals the amount of\nassistance payable with respect to the public assistance household of such\nindividual (inclusive of the value of SNAP received by the public assistance\nhousehold of such individual, if any) divided by the higher of (i) the Federal\nminimum wage, or (ii) the State minimum wage. The limitation of the number of\nhours of work experience to which a participant may be assigned is a\ncalculation of allowable hours in a work activity and does not mean that such\nparticipant is receiving a wage for the performance of such activities. The\nparticipant is not working off the grant, but is engaged in work activities as\nan element of his/her plan to become self-sufficient; (5)\non-the-job training; (6)\njob search and job readiness assistance, as time limited by Federal law, provided that job search is an active and\ncontinuing effort to secure employment, configured by the social services\nofficial, provided further, such activities shall include activities with the\ngoal of seeking or obtaining employment, or preparation to seek or obtain\nemployment, including life-skills training, which shall include, but not be\nlimited to, home visiting services to the recipient and their family; (7)\ncommunity service programs provided, however, the number of hours a participant in community service activities\nauthorized pursuant to this section may be required to work in such assignment\nshall not exceed a number which equals the amount of assistance payable with\nrespect to the public assistance household of such individual (inclusive of the\nvalue of SNAP received by the public assistance household of such individual, if any) divided by the higher of (i) the Federal minimum wage, or (ii) the\n\nState minimum wage. No participant shall be assigned to a community service\nactivity that conflicts with his/her bona fide religious beliefs.

The limitation of the number of hours of\ncommunity service to which a participant may be assigned is a calculation of\nallowable hours in a work activity and does not mean that such participant is\nreceiving a wage for the performance of such activities. The participant is not\nworking off the grant, but is engaged in work activities as an element of his\nor her plan to become self-sufficient. For purposes of calculating the\nparticipation rate, recipients who are acting as foster parents for children\nare deemed engaged in community service to the extent they are actually\nproviding care for such children; (8)\nvocational educational training as time\nlimited by Federal law and pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection; (9)\njob search and job\nreadiness assistance once the individual has exceeded the six-week limit set in\n\nFederal law in accordance with paragraph (6) of this subdivision; (10)\neducation directly related to\nemployment, in the case of a recipient who has not yet received a high school\ndiploma or a certificate of high school equivalency; (11)\nsatisfactory attendance at secondary\nschool or a course of study leading to a certificate of general equivalency in\nthe case of a recipient who has not completed secondary school or received such\ncertificate; (12)\nprovision of\nchild care services to an individual who is participating in community\nservice; (13)\njob search and job\nreadiness assistance once the individual has exceeded the six week limit set in\n\nFederal law; (14)\neducational\nactivities pursuant to subdivision (c) of this section; (15)\nother activities set forth in a local\ndistrict plan.
