  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.3 - Purchaser's, transferee's or assignee's rights and obligations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA purchaser, transferee or assignee of\nbusiness assets in a bulk sale must give timely notice to the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance concerning the bulk sale as provided for in paragraph (c)\nof section\n1141\nof the Tax Law, and section\n537.2\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe purchaser, transferee or assignee is not relieved of his obligation to give notice of the\nbulk sale by reason of any representation or information from the seller or by\nreason of any knowledge or belief on the part of the purchaser, transferee or\nassignee that no taxes are owed by the seller, transferrer or assignor, or for\nany other reason. (3)\n\nThe\npurchaser, transferee or assignee shall file with the Department of Taxation\nand Finance a certificate of registration if required by section\n1134\nof\nthe Tax Law and section\n533.1\nof\nthis Title. (b) The\npurchaser, transferee or assignee is required to withhold the lessor of: (1)\nall sums of money, notes, property or\nchoses in action or other consideration (referred to in this Part as funds\nwhich he is required to turn over to the seller, transferrer or assignor; or\n(2)\nthe total tax due from the\nseller, transferrer or assignor as contained in the notice of total tax due the\n\nState which is sent to the purchaser by the Department of Taxation and Finance\nwithin 90 days from the date or deemed date of receipt (whichever is\napplicable) of the notice of bulk sale. The purchaser is forbidden to turn over\nsuch funds to the seller, until relieved of such obligation as provided for in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. It should be noted that since it is unlikely\nthat the Department of Taxation and Finance will issue such a notice of total\ntax due prior to the sale closing, a purchaser, transferee or assignee wishing\nto avoid derivative liability for the seller's, transferrer's or assignor's\nsales and use taxes should withhold the entire consideration to be paid the\nseller, transferrer or assignor until such consideration is released by the\ndepartment or any such liability is satisfied. A purchaser's, transferee's or\nassignee's failure to notify the department of a bulk sale of business assets\nwill not relieve him of his obligation to withhold and pay over the sale\nproceeds or fair market value of the assets acquired. A purchaser, transferee\nor assignee who fails to withhold such consideration will become personally\nliable for any sales and use taxes owed by the seller, transferrer or assignor\nat the time of the sale up to the greater of the selling price or fair market\nvalue of the business assets transferred. (c) The purchaser, transferee or assignee is\nrelieved of his obligation to withhold such funds and is relieved from\nliability for taxes due from the seller (except the sales and use taxes due on\nthe sale of tangible personal property between the seller and purchaser) if\nnotice to the Department of Taxation and Finance has been given pursuant to\nsection\n537.2\nof this Part; and\n(1)\nthe Division of\n\nTaxation, within five business days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal\nholidays) from the date of actual receipt, or if applicable the date of deemed\nreceipt, whichever date is later, of a proper and timely notice given by the\npurchaser, transferee or assignee, fails to inform such purchaser, transferee\nor assignee by mailing to him within such time a notice that a possible claim\nfor taxes exists against the seller, transferrer or assignor under the terms\nand conditions set forth in section\n537.6\nof this Part; (2)\nthe Division of\n\nTaxation, after receipt of a proper notice both as to service or contents\n(whether or not such notice was timely in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision [c] of section\n537.2\nof this Part), fails to give notice of the total amount of any taxes due from\nthe seller under the terms and conditions set forth in section\n537.6\nof this Part within 90 days after receipt of the notice; (3)\nthe purchaser, transferee or assignee has\nreceived from the Division of Taxation a notice that the funds being withheld\nmay be released; or\n(4)\nthe\npurchaser, transferee or assignee has received, from the seller, transferrer or\nassignor, a bulk sales tax certificate issued by the Division of Taxation to\nsuch seller, transferrer or assignor stating that all taxes due up to the date\nof sale have been paid. (See section\n537.5\n[f]\nof this Part for detailed information on the pre-sale audit program.)\n(d) Such funds required to be\nwithheld are subject to a first priority right and lien for any taxes\ntheretofore or thereafter determined to be due from the seller, transferrer or\nassignor. (e) The purchaser may pay\nany taxes due on the purchase of any tangible personal property directly to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance as provided in section\n531.6\nor\n533.3\nof this\n\nTitle.
