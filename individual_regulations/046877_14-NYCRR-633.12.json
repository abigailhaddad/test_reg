  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.12 - Objection to services process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nEvery agency/facility (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) and\nsponsoring agency (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) providing\nfacilities (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) or home and\ncommunity based (HCBS) waiver services (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) shall develop\npolicies and procedures which establish mechanisms to resolve objections to\nservices, in conformance with this section. (2)\n\nObjections, related to facilities or HCBS\nwaiver services, may be initiated regarding: (i) any plan of services, (including an\nindividualized service plan [ISP] [see section\n633.99\nof this Part]), or part\nthereof and proposed changes thereto; (ii)\nplans for placement (see section\n633.99\nof this Part); (iii)\na proposal initiated by the\nagency/facility to discharge (see section\n633.99\nof this Part); and\n(iv)\na proposal to reduce, suspend or discontinue HCBS waiver service(s). (3)\n\nObjections to major medical treatment, for which informed consent is necessary, are not governed by the objection\nprocesses of this section. Rather, refer to section\n633.11\nof this Part. (4)\n\nThe following parties may initiate an\nobjection: adult persons receiving services; parents, guardians, correspondents, and advocates (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) of persons\nreceiving services; and the Mental Hygiene Legal Service. Upon such objection, the person or party shall herein be referred to as the objecting\nparty. (5)\n\nThe person receiving\nservices, and his or her parent, guardian, correspondent and advocate, as\napplicable, shall be advised of the mechanism to resolve an objection: upon\nadmission to a facility or enrollment in HCBS waiver services, as changes\noccur, and upon any substantive amendment to this section. In addition, when an\nagency proposes to reduce, suspend, or discontinue a person's HCBS waiver\nservice(s), the agency shall, in a form and format approved by the\ncommissioner, advise the person, and his or her advocate and service\ncoordinator (see section\n633.99\nof this Part) as\napplicable, of the proposed changes and of the mechanism for resolving an\nobjection to the proposed changes. (6)\nA capable adult person receiving services\nmay refuse the initiation of an objection or subsequent appeal on his or her\nbehalf. (7)\nA person, with his or\nher parent, guardian, correspondent and advocate as applicable, may select a\nrepresentative of his or her choice to provide assistance and/or\nrepresentation, including legal counsel. (8)\n\nThe following processes shall be\navailable to resolve an objection: (i) In\nfacilities and HCBS waiver services, unless the objection concerns a proposal\nto reduce, suspend or discontinue HCBS waiver service(s): (a) There shall be a mechanism available at\nthe agency/facility or the sponsoring agency for informal resolution between\nthe objecting party and relevant staff of the agency, including the chief\nexecutive officer or his or her designee. Such process shall include the\nperson's service coordinator and advocate, as applicable. (b) Written confirmation of resolution or\ninability to reach a resolution shall be sent to the objecting party by the\nchief executive officer. (c) If, through this informal mechanism, a resolution cannot be reached, the objecting\nparty shall be given the opportunity to submit a formal written objection\nrequesting a hearing to the appropriate DDSO director. Within five days (see\nsection\n633.99\nof this Part) of receipt of\na formal written objection, a hearing shall be scheduled, to take place before\na hearing officer appointed by the DDSO Director, with no less than 10 days\nnotice to the involved parties. A written decision by the hearing officer shall\nbe sent to the involved parties within 14 days of that hearing. (d) If any party to the proceeding is not\nsatisfied with the decision, it may be appealed within 10 days to the\ncommissioner, who will issue a final written decision to all parties within 14\ndays of receipt of the appeal. The commissioner may, at his or her discretion, send the matter back to the hearing officer for further review. (e) During the period that an objection is\nundergoing administrative review: (1)\na\nperson shall participate in programming mutually agreeable to the objecting\nparty, the agency, the person, and his or her parent, guardian, correspondent\nor advocate; (2)\nevery effort\nfeasible shall be made to maintain the person in at least his or her current\nlevel of programming; and\n(3)\nin\norder to protect a person's health, safety, or welfare or the health, safety, or welfare of others, nothing herein shall preclude a change in programming\nfor, or the relocation or discharge of a person. However, while an objection to\nplacement or discharge is undergoing administrative review, relocation or\ndischarge shall only take place with the commissioner's approval. (ii)\n\nRelated to the\nreduction, suspension or discontinuance of HCBS waiver services: (a) The agency shall have a process available\nfor informal resolution between the objecting party and relevant staff of the\nagency, including the chief executive officer or his or her designee. Such\nprocess shall include the person's service coordinator and advocate, as\napplicable. The agency shall include documentation of the result of the process\nin the person's record. (b) Written\nnotice of the parties' inability to resolve the objection shall be sent to the\nobjecting party by the chief executive officer. Such notice shall be in a form\nand format approved by the commissioner, and shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested, or such other means so that the time of receipt of\nthe information can be documented. The objecting party may submit a written\nobjection to the DDSO director requesting administrative review of the\nreduction, suspension or discontinuance, within 14 days after the receipt of\nthe notice. The agency shall not reduce, suspend or discontinue the HCBS waiver\nservice(s) at issue during such 14 day period, unless otherwise agreed to by\nthe parties. (c) Upon receipt of a\nwritten objection requesting an administrative review, the DDSO director or his\nor her designee shall contact the objecting party and the agency providing the\nservice(s) to mediate resolution of the objection. If there is no resolution\nwithin 14 days of receipt of the objection, a hearing shall be scheduled, with\nno less than 10 days notice to the involved parties. The hearing shall be\nconducted by a hearing officer appointed by the DDSO director. The objecting\nparty and the agency may mutually agree to extend the time periods noted in\nthis clause. (d) The hearing\nofficer shall issue a written decision to the objecting party and the agency\nwithin 14 days after the conclusion of the hearing. Either party may appeal the\ndecision to the commissioner and submit a written reply to the decision within\n14 days of its receipt. The commissioner will issue a final written decision to\nall parties within 14 days of the last date to appeal. The commissioner may, in\nhis or her discretion, send the matter back to the hearing officer for further\nreview. (e) During the period that\nan objection is undergoing administrative review (including an expedited\nreview), the agency shall not reduce, suspend or discontinue the HCBS waiver\nservice(s) at issue, unless otherwise agreed to by both parties. (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of clauses\n(\nb\n), (\nc\n) and (\nd\n) of this\nsubparagraph, when an agency proposes to reduce, suspend or discontinue the\nprovision of a HCBS waiver service(s) to prevent immediate risk to the health\nor safety of the person or others: the agency shall make reasonable efforts to\nalleviate the health and safety risks at issue, and the agency or the objecting\nparty may request an expedited hearing by the following process: (1)\nA written request for the hearing shall\nbe sent by the agency or objecting party to the commissioner. An agency shall\nalso immediately notify the person, parent, guardian, correspondent and\nadvocate, as applicable, of such request. (2)\n\nIf the commissioner determines that an\nexpedited hearing is warranted, the appropriate DDSO director will schedule a\nhearing within seven days of the commissioner's determination. The hearing will\nbe held before a hearing officer appointed by the DDSO director. Absent good\ncause, the parties involved in the objection will receive at least three days\nnotice of the hearing. (3)\n\nThe\nhearing officer's recommendation shall be sent to the parties and sent to the\ncommissioner within five days of the conclusion of the hearing. The hearing\nofficer shall advise the parties of their opportunity to send a written reply\nto the recommendation directly to the commissioner. The commissioner will issue\na final written decision as soon as practicable thereafter. (9)\n\nNo\nperson or objecting party or a representative of either, shall be denied the\nopportunity to participate in any hearings pursuant to this section. The person\nor objecting party or a representative may offer information and ask relevant\nquestions of any parties participating in any such hearing. (10)\n\nDuring the period that the objection is\nundergoing administrative review, there shall be no communication between\neither the agency or the objecting party and either the hearing officer or the\ncommissioner, concerning the objection, except on notice and opportunity for\nall involved parties to participate. (11)\n\nThe commissioner's decision is the final\nadministrative remedy available and may be appealed in accordance with the\nprovisions of article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. (12)\n\nTreatment may be given, other than\ntreatment for which informed consent is required by applicable regulation, to a\nperson, despite objection, in a situation where the treatment is deemed\nnecessary to avoid serious harm to life or limb of that person or others, at\nthe discretion of the chief executive officer and in accordance with\nagency/facility or the sponsoring agency policies/procedures. (b) Standards of\ncertification. (1)\nOPWDD shall verify\nthat the agency/facility or the sponsoring agency has advised a person and his\nor her parent, guardian, correspondent and advocate, as applicable, of relevant\nobjection processes. (2)\n\nFor\npersons admitted to a facility or enrolled in HCBS waiver services since the\nlast survey, OPWDD shall verify that each person and his or her parent, guardian, correspondent and advocate, as applicable, have been advised on\nadmission, enrollment, or as changes occurred of relevant objection\nprocesses.
