Tit. 8 § 2004.3 - Effect on prior participation\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn action under this Part resulting in the limitation, suspension or termination of an institution or lender shall not affect any of\nits responsibilities arising from participation in programs under this Part\nprior to the date of such action. Nor shall such action impair any benefits or\nclaims to which an institution or lender may be entitled based on its\nparticipation prior to such action, except that if such action results in a\nrequirement that such institutions or lenders make payments to the corporation, then such payments may be used as offsets against such benefits or\nclaims.
