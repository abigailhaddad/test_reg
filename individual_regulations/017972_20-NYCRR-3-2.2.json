  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-2.2 - Adjusting tax bases to period covered by report\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, sections 208(9)(h), 210(2))\n(a) Entire net income (ENI). (1)\n\nExcept in the case of a New York S\ntermination year, if the ENI required to be reported under article 9-A is for a\nperiod different from the period covered by the taxpayer's Federal income tax\nreturn, the taxpayer's ENI must be prorated to correspond with the period\ncovered by the report under article 9-A. The prorated ENI is computed as\nfollows: (i) adjust Federal taxable income to\narrive at ENI in the manner set forth in section\n3-3.1\nof this Part; (ii)\nmultiply ENI by the number of calendar\nmonths, or major parts thereof, covered by the report under article 9-A; and\n(iii)\ndivide the result by the\nnumber of calendar months, or major parts thereof, covered by the return for\n\nFederal income tax purposes. Other exempt income and investment income must be\nsimilarly prorated. (2)\n\nExamples. Example 1: A calendar year taxpayer was organized in 2017\nunder the laws of another state where it carried on its business. It began\ndoing business in New York State on March 14, 2022. It files its return for\n\nFederal income tax purposes for the calendar year 2022 and its Federal taxable\nincome was $70,000. In computing its ENI for the period March 14, 2022, to\n\nDecember 31, 2022, its Federal taxable income of $70,000 for the calendar year\n2022 is first adjusted as required by section\n3-3.1\nof this Part. The taxpayer's\nENI after those adjustments was $78,000. That ENI must be multiplied by 10 (the\nnumber of months from March to December) and the product divided by 12, resulting in a prorated ENI of $65,000. Example 2: Same facts as in Example 1, except that the\ntaxpayer began doing business in New York State on March 20, 2022. The ENI of\n$78,000 must be multiplied by 9 and the product divided by 12, resulting in a\nprorated ENI of $58,500. (3)\n\nThe method of computing ENI set forth in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision applies to taxpayers reporting on either a\ncalendar year or a fiscal year basis for Federal income tax purposes. (b) Business and investment\ncapital. If a period covered by a report under article 9-A is other than 12\ncalendar months, the amount of business capital and the amount of investment\ncapital are each determined by multiplying its average value, by the number of\ncalendar months, or major parts thereof, included in that period, and dividing\nthe product by 12. (1)\n\nExample. A foreign corporation began to do business in New York\n\nState on June 10, 2022, and reports on a calendar year basis. The average value\nof its total investment capital for that year was $60,000, and the average\nvalue of its total business capital was $240,000. The amount of each class of\ncapital, for purposes of computing the tax for taxable year 2022, is determined\nby multiplying each of the above amounts by seven (the number of months from\n\nJune to December) and dividing the product by 12, resulting in investment\ncapital of $35,000 and business capital of $140,000. (c) Fixed dollar minimum tax. If\nthe taxable period covered by a report under article 9-A is less than 12\nmonths, the amount of New York receipts used to determine the amount of the\nfixed dollar minimum tax is determined by dividing the amount of the receipts\nfor the period covered by the report by the number of months, or major parts\nthereof, in that period and multiplying the result by 12. In addition, the\namount of fixed dollar minimum tax determined under section 210(1)(d)(1) shall\nbe reduced by: (1)\n25% if the period for\nwhich the taxpayer is subject to tax is more than six months but not more than\nnine months, or\n(2)\n50% if the\nperiod for which the taxpayer is subject to tax is not more than six\nmonths. (3)\n\nExample. A foreign corporation began to business in New York State\non May 10, 2022, and reports on a calendar year basis. During the period from\n\nMay 10, 2022, through December 31, 2022, its New York receipts is $2,500,000. The amount of the receipts used to determine its fixed dollar minimum is\n$3,750,000, which is determined by dividing 2,500,000 by 8 and multiplying the\nresult by 12. The fixed dollar minimum tax when New York receipts are\n$3,750,000 is $1,500. Because the period covered by the report is more than 6\nmonths but less than 9 months, the amount of the fixed dollar minimum tax is\nreduced by 25% to 1,125. (d) Whenever the tax base is prorated for a\ntax period of less than 12 months, the business apportionment fraction must be\ndetermined pursuant to section 210-A and this Subchapter, using only those\nreceipts, net income, net gain and other items for the period for which it is\nsubject to tax in New York State. This short period BAF must be applied to\nbusiness income and business capital that have been prorated to represent\nbusiness income and business capital for the period for which the corporation\nis subject to tax in New York State as required by this section. With such\nshort period report, a corporation must submit complete details showing how it\ncomputed amounts using the rules for this section for the period it is subject\nto tax in New York State, if for less than a full year. If, in the opinion of\nthe commissioner, the prorated business income or prorated business capital for\nthe period for which the corporation is subject to tax in New York State does\nnot properly reflect the business income or business capital for such period, the commissioner may determine business income or business capital solely on\nthe basis of the corporation's business income or business capital during such\nperiod.
