  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 201.8 - Investigation and election\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Initial review and processing. (1)\n\nInvestigation. After the filing of a\npetition, the director shall direct an investigation of all questions\nconcerning representation, including, if applicable, whether the showing of\ninterest requirement, as set forth in sections 201.3 and\n201.4\nof this Part, has been\nsatisfied; whether more than one employee organization seeks to represent some\nor all of the employees in the allegedly appropriate unit; and whether there is\nagreement among the parties as to the appropriateness of the proposed\nunit. (2)\n\nPre-hearing conference. The director may direct all parties to attend a pre-hearing conference pursuant\nto the procedures specified in Part 212 of this Title. (3)\n\nHearing. The director may direct that a\nhearing be conducted by an administrative law judge, in which event a notice of\nhearing specifying the time and place of the hearing shall be served upon the\nparties. The conduct of the hearing shall be in accordance with the procedures\nspecified in Part 212 of this Title. (b) Determination of representatives on\nconsent. Subject to the director's approval, the parties in a\nrepresentation case may agree on a method by which the director may determine\nthe question of representation. (c) Action by director. After completing the investigation or hearing, as the case\nmay be, or upon the consent of the parties, the director shall dispose of the\nquestions concerning representation. (1)\n\nCertification without an election. If the\nchoice available to the employees in a negotiating unit is limited to selecting\nor rejecting a single employee organization, that choice may be ascertained by\nthe director on the basis of dues deduction authorizations and other evidence\ninstead of by an election. In such case, the employee organization involved\nwill be certified without an election if a majority of the employees within the\nunit have executed a showing of interest pursuant to section\n201.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart which remains current as defined in that section. Any new or additional\nevidence of majority support shall be accompanied by a declaration of\nauthenticity, as defined in section\n201.4\n(d) of this\n\nPart. The determination by the director that the indications of employee\nsupport are not sufficient for certification without an election is a\nministerial act and will not be reviewed by the board. The director shall\ninform all parties in writing if the director determines that the indications\nof employee support are sufficient for certification without an election. The\ndirector's determination in this respect is reviewable by the board pursuant to\na written objection to certification filed with the board by a party within\nfive working days after its receipt of the director's notification. An\nobjection to certification shall set forth all grounds for the objection with\nsupporting facts and shall be served on all parties to the proceeding. A\nresponse to the objection may be filed within five working days after a party's\nreceipt of the objection. A copy of any response shall be served on all other\nparties. (2)\n\nDirection of an\nelection. An election will be held whenever the choice available to the\nemployees within a negotiating unit includes more than one employee\norganization, or when the only employee organization seeking certification does\nnot produce indications of employee support sufficient for certification\nwithout an election. If the director determines that an election shall be held, such election shall be conducted by an agent of the board at such time and\nplace and upon such terms and conditions as the board, the director or the\nagent may specify. (d) Election procedure. (1)\n\nUnless\notherwise directed by the board, the director shall conduct and supervise all\nelections. All elections shall be by secret ballot. Absentee ballots will not\nbe permitted. A motion to intervene in any such election may be filed pursuant\nto section\n212.1\nof this Title, as long as\nnotification of such desire is given to the director within what the director\ndeems to be a reasonable time prior to the scheduled date of the election. Whenever two or more employee organizations are included as choices in an\nelection, any participant may, upon prompt request to and approval by the\ndirector, have its name removed from the ballot; provided, however, that with\nrespect to a petition for decertification, the employee organization certified\nor currently recognized may not have its name removed from the ballot without\ngiving due notice in writing to all parties and the director, disclaiming any\nrepresentation interest among the public employees in the unit. Any party may\nbe represented by observers of its own selection, subject to such limitations\nas the director may prescribe. Any party or the board's agent may challenge, for good cause, the eligibility of any person to participate in the election. The ballots of such challenged persons shall be impounded. Upon the conclusion\nof the election, the tally of ballots shall be provided to the\nparties. (2)\n\nAny party may file\nwith the director an original and four copies of objections to the conduct of\nthe election or conduct affecting the results of the election within five\nworking days after its receipt of a final tally of ballots. Such objections\nshall contain a clear and concise statement of the facts constituting the bases\nfor the objection, including the names of the individuals involved and the time\nand place of occurrence of each particular act alleged. The objections shall be\nin writing and be signed and sworn to before any person authorized to\nadminister oaths. Copies of such objections shall simultaneously be served upon\neach of the other parties by the party filing them, and proof of service shall\nbe filed with the director. Should the chairperson authorize electronic filing\nof objections, the filing of a paper original consistent with this section and\nelectronic filing and service of a copy shall constitute compliance with the\nfiling and service requirements herein contained. (3)\n\nAn original and four copies of an answer\nshall be filed with the director within five working days after receipt from\nthe director of notice of processing of the objections, with proof of service\non all other parties. The answer shall contain a specific admission, denial or\nexplanation of each allegation of the objection and a clear and concise\nstatement of any other relevant facts. The original shall be signed and sworn\nto before any person authorized to administer oaths. Should the chairperson\nauthorize electronic filing of objections, the filing of a paper original\nconsistent with this section and electronic filing and service of a copy shall\nconstitute compliance with the filing and service requirements herein\ncontained. If a party fails or refuses to file an answer, such failure or\nrefusal may be deemed to constitute that party's admission of the material\nfacts in the objections and a waiver by that party of a hearing. (4)\n\nIf objections are filed to the conduct of\nthe election or conduct affecting the results of the election, or if challenged\nballots are sufficient in number to affect the results of the election, the\ndirector shall investigate such objections or challenges, or both, and shall\ntake the appropriate action which may include the direction of a hearing in\naccordance with the provisions of Part 212 of this Title and the issuance of a\ndecision. (e) Runoff election. (1)\n\nThe director\nmay conduct a runoff election without further order of the board when an\nelection in which the ballot provides for not less than three choices\n(\ni.e., at least two employee organizations and \"neither\")\nresults in no choice receiving a majority of the valid ballots cast. Only one\nrunoff shall be held pursuant to this section, unless the board directs\notherwise. (2)\n\nThe ballot in the\nrunoff election shall provide for a selection among the two or more choices\nreceiving the largest number of votes, the sum of whose votes aggregate at\nleast one more than half of the total votes cast. Upon the conclusion of the\nrunoff election, the provisions of subdivision (d) of this section shall govern\ninsofar as applicable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
