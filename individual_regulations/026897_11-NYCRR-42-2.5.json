  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 42-2.5 - Joint life mortality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Minimum nonforfeiture values are based on the exact joint life mortality using mortality tables that would be required for each single life and assuming that the mortality of the joint lives are independent. (b) Minimum nonforfeiture values and policy disclosures may be based on the use of joint life mortality throughout the lifetime of the policy. Minimum nonforfeiture values and policy disclosures on each possible status of the lives under the terms of the policy is also acceptable if the disclosures and minimum value requirements of the Insurance Law are met for each possible status. For example, if the status of a second to die policy is based on a single life status after the first death, then the required disclosures under section\n4221 (a)(5)\nof the Insurance Law must be shown in the policy for each possible status of joint or single life. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n42-2.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
