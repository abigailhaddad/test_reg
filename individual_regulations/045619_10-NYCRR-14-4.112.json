(a) The following are acceptable methods of sanitizing in a mobile food service establishment: (1)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine and a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C); (2)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 12.5 parts per million of available iodine and having pH not higher than 5.0 and at a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C); (3)\nimmersion in a clean solution containing any other chemical sanitizing agent acceptable to the State Commissioner of Health that will provide the equivalent bactericidal effect of a solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine as hypochlorite at a temperature of at least 75° F (23.9° C) for one minute; or\n(4)\nswabbing with a solution of at least twice the strength required for that sanitizing solution when used for immersion. (b) Chemicals used for sanitizing are not to have concentrations which will leave toxic residues on surfaces treated. A test kit or other device is to be provided and used that accurately measures the parts per million concentration and pH when required of the solution used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
