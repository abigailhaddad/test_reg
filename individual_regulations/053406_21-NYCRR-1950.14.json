  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1950.14 - Use of fire hydrants\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nperson shall open, carry from or tamper in any manner with a fire hydrant\nconnected to water board mains, unless a written permit is obtained from the\ndirector. However, this does not apply to employees of the city's fire\ndepartment engaged in the pursuit of regular duties. (b) The director shall be notified within 24\nhours of the use of any hydrant by the city fire department. (c) Wrenches, other than hydrant wrenches\nacceptable to the director, must not be used for the operation of fire\nhydrants. The use of any other type of wrench shall be considered sufficient\ncause for cancellation of any permit issued and for the imposition of a fine\nequal to the real cost to cover repairs or replacement. (d) The general use of hydrants for\nconstruction purposes will be restricted when a service line to a building or\nstructure will eventually be required. All hydrant use other than fire fighting\npurposes requires a valid hydrant permit and the use of a water board certified\nmeter-backflow hydrant assembly. When a hydrant is being used under permit, regular reducing couplings attached to the nozzle of the hydrant and equipped\nwith an independent valve for regulating flow shall be used. The main valve of\nsuch hydrant must be opened fully at the beginning of each workday and remain\nopen until the finish of work on that day, when it shall be completely\nclosed. (e) A hydrant flow test\nservice charge as identified in the board schedule of rates, payable in advance\nto the water board, shall be assessed for hydrant flow tests performed by the\nwater board. (f) In obtaining water\nfrom a fire hydrant in conformity with the foregoing subdivisions, no leakage\nwill be tolerated. The hydrant permit shall be rescinded for any violation and\nappropriate fees for damage will be assessed. (g) No person shall obstruct access to any\nfire hydrant in any manner whatsoever, without the written approval of the\ndirector. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1950.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
