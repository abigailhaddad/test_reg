  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 4000.3 - Assignment of arbitration requests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The determination of whether a case is to\nbe assigned to a staff mediator or to a panel from which the parties shall make\ntheir designation is within the discretion of the board or its designated\nrepresentative, notwithstanding any contractual provision or stipulation that\nthe issue will be heard by a staff mediator. Arbitration requests will be\nassigned to panel where the parties so contract or stipulate. (b) In those cases where the collective\nbargaining agreement provides for panel arbitration, or the board determines\nthat the issue shall be referred to a panel arbitrator, a list of five panel\nmembers is submitted to each of the parties. On request, the board will furnish\na biographical sketch of each panel arbitrator. Within the time set forth in\nthat list, each party is to delete two names from the list and number the\nremaining list in order of preference. The arbitrator as thus selected will be\nformally designated by the board. If either party does not return the list\nwithin the time limit, it will be assumed by the board that all arbitrators on\nthe list are acceptable and the board may designate any arbitrator named on the\nlist. (c) In the event one party\nrejects all the names on the list, a second list of five arbitrators will be\nsubmitted to both parties and each party is permitted to make a new selection. In no event, however, will there be more than three lists of arbitrators\nfurnished to the parties under this procedure. If the demand for arbitration\nwas initiated by the service of the notice required by section 7503 of article\n75 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York, and proof of\nservice has been filed with the board, and if no agreement or selection is made\nby the parties from the final list, the board will designate the arbitrator. It\ncan be seen by this procedure that the parties themselves make the selection of\nan arbitrator to resolve the dispute-- not the board. Only when there is no\nagreement on the selection does the board make a selection. (d) It is the policy of the board to assign\ncases involving payment of dues and/or initiation cases to panel arbitration. Arbitration of cases in the New York City area involving contributions to\npension, welfare or employee benefit plans will be assigned to special pension\nand welfare arbitrators or panel arbitrators. The determination as to whether\nany cases are to be assigned to special pension and welfare arbitrators or to\npanel arbitrators is a determination made at the sole discretion of the board, or its designated representative.
