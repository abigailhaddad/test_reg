  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-4.7 - Attribution of interest deductions\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(6) and (6-a))\n(a) Unless the safe harbor reduction election\nhas been made as required by section\n3-4.8, gross investment income and\ngross other exempt income must be reduced by any interest deductions allowed in\ncomputing ENI that are directly or indirectly attributable to investment\ncapital, gross investment income, or gross other exempt income as follows: (1)\n\nDetermine the total amount of interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution. The total amount of\ninterest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution is: (i) the amount of interest deductions\nincluded in Federal taxable income after the IRC section 163(j) limitation; less\n(ii)\nthose Federal interest\ndeductions required to be added back to Federal taxable income in computing\nENI; plus\n(iii)\ninterest deductions\nattributable to interest income not includable in Federal taxable income but\nrequired to be included in ENI, to the extent such expenses are not deducted\nfor Federal tax purposes; plus\n(iv)\nin the case of a corporation organized outside the United States that is not\ntreated as a domestic corporation for Federal purposes, interest deductions\nattributable to treaty income not included in Federal taxable income that would\nbe treated as effectively connected if not for the treaty, to the extent such\nexpenses are not deducted for Federal tax purposes; plus\n(v) in the case of a corporation organized\noutside the United States that is not treated as a domestic corporation for\n\nFederal purposes, interest deductions attributable to income from any state or\nlocal bond that would be treated as effectively connected income if it was not\nexcluded from gross income by IRC section 103(a), to the extent such expenses\nare not deducted for Federal tax purposes. (2)\n\nDetermine the total amount of interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution before the IRC section\n163(j) limitation. If the interest deductions are not limited by IRC section\n163(j) in the current year, this paragraph does not apply; proceed to paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision. Otherwise, determine the total amount of interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution before the IRC section\n163(j) limitation by performing the same computation as required by paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, except that in subparagraph (i) of paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision use the amount of interest deductions included in Federal\ntaxable income prior to the IRC section 163(j) limitation. (3)\n\nDetermine the amount of interest\ndeductions that can be directly traced. (i) The corporation or combined group must determine the portion of total interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution that are directly\ntraceable, whether in whole or in part, to gross investment income or\ninvestment capital, gross exempt CFC income, gross exempt cross-article\ndividends, gross exempt other unitary corporation dividends, and business\ncapital or business income. (ii)\n\nIf\nthe corporation or combined group determines that a particular interest\ndeduction is directly attributable to more than one type of income or capital, the corporation or combined group may apportion that interest expense between\nor among the types of capital and income, using any method that reasonably\ndetermines the appropriate amount. (iii)\n\nExamples of interest deductions that\nare traceable in whole or in part to gross exempt other unitary corporation\ndividends, gross exempt CFC income, gross exempt cross-article dividends, gross\ninvestment income or investment capital, or business income or business capital\ninclude: (a) interest incurred to purchase or\ncarry stock of corporations that generates such income or capital; (b) interest incurred to purchase or carry\ninvestment capital (investment capital); (c) interest incurred to purchase or build a\nmanufacturing plant (business capital); (d) interest incurred to purchase or carry\nthe stock of a combined affiliate (business capital); (e) interest incurred by a partnership to\npurchase or carry investment capital that is included in a corporate partner's\ndistributive share of income or loss from that partnership (investment\ncapital); (f) an interest deduction\nthe reimbursement of which, received in the form of a management fee paid by an\nentity not included in the combined group of the taxpayer, is included in ENI\n(business capital); or\n(g) interest\nincurred to purchase or carry reverse repurchase agreements and securities\nborrowing agreements (business capital). The amount of such interest deductions\nthat is subject to direct tracing is the interest expense associated with the\nsum of the average fair market value (FMV) of the repurchase agreements plus\nthe average FMV of the securities lending agreements. However, this sum is\nlimited to the sum of the average FMV of the reverse repurchase agreements plus\nthe average FMV of the securities borrowing agreements. Note: If the sum of the\naverage FMV of reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing\nagreements exceed the sum of the average FMV of repurchase agreements and\nsecurities lending agreements, then all such interest deductions are directly\ntraceable to business capital. Otherwise, use the methodology in the example in\nclause\n(h) of this section to compute the amount of such\ninterest deductions directly traceable to business capital. (h) Example. Average FMV of repurchase agreements and\nsecurity lending agreements\n$105\n\nAverage FMV of reverse repurchase agreements\nand security borrowing agreements\n$100\n\nInterest deductions for repurchase agreements\nand security lending agreements for the year\n$2\n\nAverage cost of funds ($2/$105)\n1.904%\nAmount of $2 interest deduction directly\ntraceable to reverse repurchase agreements and security borrowing agreements\n(business capital) ($100 x 1.904%)\n$1.90\n(iv)\n\nSpecial rules for corporations utilizing\na carryforward of interest deductions previously limited by IRC section 163(j). For all tax years in which a carryforward of interest deductions limited by IRC\nsection 163(j) is subsequently deductible for Federal tax purposes, the\ncarryforward amount deducted in subsequent taxable years cannot be included in\ndirectly traced amounts. Instead, these amounts must be indirectly traced as\nrequired in paragraph (4) of this section. (v) Special rules for corporations impacted\nby the IRC section 163(j) limitation in the current year. Corporations limited\nby IRC section 163(j) in the current year must directly trace the total amount\nof interest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution prior to the\nIRC section 163(j) limitation. If such amount is greater than the corporation's\nor combined group's total amount of interest deductions subject to direct and\nindirect attribution after the IRC section 163(j) limitation as determined in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, then the amount of interest deductions\ndirectly traced to a specific category of income or capital is computed by\nmultiplying the total interest deductions subject to direct and indirect\nattribution after the IRC section 163(j) limitation as determined in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision by a fraction, the numerator of which is the portion of\ninterest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution prior to the IRC\nsection 163(j) limitation that can be directly traced to a specific category of\nincome or capital and the denominator of which is the interest deductions\nsubject to direct and indirect attribution prior to the IRC section 163(j) that\ncan be directly traced to all categories of income and capital. If the amount\nof interest deductions prior to the IRC section 163(j) limitation that can be\ndirectly traced is less than or equal to the total amount of interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution after such limitation, such directly traced amounts prior to the IRC section 163(j) limitation shall\nbe the amount of interest deductions directly traced for purposes of this\nparagraph. (4)\n\nDetermine the amount of interest deductions to be indirectly traced. The amount\nof interest deductions subject to indirect attribution is the total amount of\ninterest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution after the IRC\nsection 163(j) limitation minus the total amount of interest deductions\ndirectly traced pursuant to paragraph three of this subdivision. (5)\n\nPerform indirect tracing. (i) To determine the amount of interest\ndeductions indirectly attributable to gross exempt cross-article dividends, the\ncorporation or combined group must multiply the total amount of interest\ndeductions subject to indirect attribution by a fraction, the numerator of\nwhich is the average value of the cross-article stock and the denominator of\nwhich is the total average value of all the assets. If, during the taxable\nyear, the investment in cross-article stock generates both taxable net capital\ngains (capital gains in excess of capital losses) and gross exempt\ncross-article dividends, the numerator of the fraction above must be multiplied\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is gross exempt cross-article dividends\nand the denominator of which is total gross income from cross-article\nstock. (ii)\n\nTo determine the amount\nof interest deductions indirectly attributable to gross exempt other unitary\ncorporation dividends, the corporation or combined group must multiply the\ntotal amount of interest deductions subject to indirect attribution by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is the average value of the other unitary\ncorporation stock and the denominator of which is the total average value of\nall of the assets. If, during the taxable year, the investment in other unitary\ncorporation stock generates both taxable income from business capital (e.g., net capital gains from business capital or 5% of global intangible low-taxed\nincome) and gross exempt other unitary corporation dividends, the numerator of\nthe fraction above must be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is\ngross exempt other unitary corporation dividends and the denominator of which\nis total gross income from other unitary corporation stock. (iii)\n\nTo determine the amount of interest\ndeductions indirectly attributable to gross exempt CFC income, the corporation\nor combined group must multiply the total amount of interest deductions subject\nto indirect attribution by a fraction, the numerator of which is the average\nvalue of the CFC stock and the denominator of which is the total average value\nof all assets. If, during the taxable year, the investment in CFC stock\ngenerates both taxable income from business capital (e.g., net capital gains\nfrom business capital or 5% of global intangible low-taxed income) and gross\nexempt CFC income, the numerator of the fraction above must be multiplied by a\nfraction, the numerator of which is gross exempt CFC income and the denominator\nof which is total gross income from CFC stock. (iv)\n\nTo determine the amount of interest\ndeductions indirectly attributable to investment capital or gross investment\nincome, the corporation or combined group must multiply the total amount of\ninterest deductions subject to indirect attribution by a fraction, the\nnumerator of which is the average value of the investment capital and the\ndenominator of which is the total average value of all assets. (v) The amount of interest deductions\ndirectly or indirectly attributable to gross investment income and investment\ncapital, gross exempt CFC income, gross exempt cross-article dividends, and\ngross exempt other unitary corporation dividends is the sum of the amounts\ncomputed in subparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph. (vi)\n\nFor purposes of indirect attribution, it\nis possible that an asset may generate more than one type of income that\nrequires the use of the indirect attribution formulas in this section. In the\nevent that investment capital assets generate other exempt income, such assets\nare included only in the indirect attribution formula for investment capital or\ngross investment income. If an asset generates both exempt CFC income and\nexempt cross-article dividends, such asset shall be included in one indirect\nattribution formula, which shall be determined based on the majority of the\nincome that such asset generates. (b) In the case of a combined report, all\ncomputations must be done as if the combined group were a single corporation, after the elimination of all intercompany transactions and activity. (c) A corporate partner using the aggregate\nmethod to determine its tax with respect to its interest in a partnership must\ninclude its distributive share of each partnership item of receipts, income, gain, loss and deduction and the corporation's proportionate part of each asset\nand liability from that partnership, after the elimination of all inter-entity\ntransactions and activity, when computing income amounts and the attribution of\ninterest deductions. (d) For\npurposes of this section, only those assets and liabilities required to be\nincluded in the valuation of business and investment capital for purposes of\ncomputing the capital base tax are included. (e) If the numerator of a fraction measured\nby income is zero and the denominator of a fraction measured by income is an\namount greater than zero, the respective income fraction is zero. (f) Examples. For purposes of these examples, assume the corporation does not have to make any adjustments to its Federal\ninterest deductions as provided for in paragraph (1) of subdivision (a) of this\nsection. As a result, the total amount of interest deductions subject to direct\nand indirect attribution is the amount of interest deductions included in\n\nFederal taxable income. (1)\n\nExamples. Example 1: Corporation A has $120,000 in interest expense\nfor 2018 prior to applying the IRC section 163(j) limitation, of which $100,000\nis directly traced as follows: $ 20,000 directly attributable to gross exempt unitary\ncorporation dividends\n$ 30,000 directly attributable to gross exempt CFC\nincome\n$ 10,000 directly attributable to gross investment income\nor investment capital\n$ 40,000 directly attributable to business income or\nbusiness capital\n\nDue to the IRC section 163(j) limitation, $50,000 of\ninterest expense is deducted at the Federal level and is, therefore, the total\namount of interest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution. The\nremaining $70,000 of interest expense is carried forward to subsequent\nyears. Since the $100,000 of total interest deductions prior to\nthe IRC section 163(j) limitation that is directly traceable is greater than\nthe $50,000 of total interest deductions subject to direct and indirect\nattribution, the amount of interest deductions directly attributed to each\nspecific category of income or capital is determined as follows: $50,000 x $20,000/$100,000 = $10,000 directly\nattributable to gross exempt unitary corporation dividends\n$50,000 x $30,000/$100,000 = $15,000 directly\nattributable to gross exempt CFC income\n$50,000 x $10,000/$100,000 = $ 5,000 directly\nattributable to gross investment income or investment capital\n$50,000 x $40,000/$100,000 = $20,000 directly\nattributable to business income or business capital\n\nThere are no interest deductions subject to indirect\nattribution for 2018. The $70,000 of interest expense that is limited by IRC\nsection 163(j) in 2018 and carried forward to subsequent years is subject to\nindirect attribution in the subsequent tax year(s) in which the interest\nexpense becomes deductible for Federal tax purposes. Example 2: Corporation B has $120,000 in interest\nexpense for 2018 prior to applying the IRC section 163(j) limitation, of which\n$40,000 is directly traced as follows: $ 8,000 directly attributable to gross exempt unitary\ncorporation dividends\n$ 17,000 directly attributable to gross exempt CFC\nincome\n$ 5,000 directly attributable to gross investment income\nor investment capital\n$ 10,000 directly attributable to business income or\nbusiness capital\n\nDue to the IRC section 163(j) limitation, $50,000 of\ninterest expense is deducted at the Federal level and is therefore the total\namount of interest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution. The\nremaining $70,000 of interest expense is carried forward to subsequent years. Since the $40,000 of total interest deductions prior to the IRC section 163(j)\nlimitation that are directly traceable are less than the $50,000 of total\ninterest deductions subject to direct and indirect attribution, the amount of\ninterest deductions directly attributed to each specific category of income or\ncapital is determined as follows: $ 8,000 directly attributable to gross exempt unitary\ncorporation dividends\n$ 17,000 directly attributable to gross exempt CFC\nincome\n$ 5,000 directly attributable to gross investment income\nor investment capital\n$ 10,000 directly attributable to business income or\nbusiness capital\n\nTo determine the amount of interest deductions subject to\nindirect attribution, Corporation B must reduce the $50,000 of total interest\ndeductions subject to direct and indirect attribution by the $40,000 of\ninterest deductions directly traced above. The resulting $10,000 of interest\ndeductions must be indirectly attributed. The $70,000 of interest expense that\nis limited by IRC section 163(j) in 2018 and carried forward to subsequent\nyears must be indirectly attributed in the subsequent tax year(s) in which the\ninterest expense becomes deductible for Federal tax purposes unless the 40%\nsafe harbor election in section\n3-4.8\nof this Subpart is made and\nthe taxpayer does not own exempt cross-article stock.
