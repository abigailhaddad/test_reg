  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.927 - Internal corrosion direct assessment (icda)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definition. Internal corrosion direct\nassessment (ICDA) is a process an operator uses to identify areas along the\npipeline where fluid or other electrolyte introduced during normal operation or\nby an upset condition may reside, and then focuses direct examination on the\nlocations in covered segments where internal corrosion is most likely to exist. The process identifies the potential for internal corrosion caused by\nmicroorganisms, or fluid with C02, 02, hydrogen sulfide or other contaminants\npresent in the gas. (b) General\nrequirements. An operator using direct assessment as an assessment method to\naddress internal corrosion in a covered pipeline segment must follow the\nrequirements in this section and in ASME/ANSI B31.8S (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), section 6.4\nand Appendix B2. The ICDA process described in this section applies only for a\nsegment of pipe transporting nominally dry natural gas, and not for a segment\nwith electrolyte nominally present in the gas stream. If an operator uses ICDA\nto assess a covered segment operating with electrolyte present in the gas\nstream, the operator must develop a plan that demonstrates how it will conduct\nICDA in the segment to effectively address internal corrosion, and must provide\nnotification in accordance with section\n255.921\n(a)(4)\nor\n255.937\n(c)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (c) The ICDA plan. An\noperator must develop and follow an ICDA plan that provides for preassessment, identification of ICDA regions and excavation locations, detailed examination\nof pipe at excavation locations, and post-assessment evaluation and monitoring. (1)\n\nPreassessment. In the preassessment\nstage, an operator must gather and integrate data and information needed to\nevaluate the feasibility of ICDA for the covered segment, and to support use of\na model to identify the locations along the pipe segment where electrolyte may\naccumulate, to identify ICDA regions, and to identify areas within the covered\nsegment where liquids may potentially be entrained. This data and information\nincludes, but is not limited to: (i) all data\nelements listed in Appendix A2 of ASME/ANSI B31.8S; (ii)\ninformation needed to support use of a\nmodel that an operator must use to identify areas along the pipeline where\ninternal corrosion is most likely to occur. (See subdivision [a] of this\nsection.) This information, includes, but is not limited to, location of all\ngas input and withdrawal points on the line; location of all low points on\ncovered segments such as sags, drips, inclines, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, and traps; the elevation profile of the pipeline in sufficient detail that\nangles of inclination can be calculated for all pipe segments; and the diameter\nof the pipeline, and the range of expected gas velocities in the\npipeline; (iii)\noperating\nexperience data that would indicate historic upsets in gas conditions, locations where these upsets have occurred, and potential damage resulting from\nthese upset conditions; and\n(iv)\ninformation on covered segments where cleaning pigs may not have been used or\nwhere cleaning pigs may deposit electrolytes. (2)\nICDA region identification. An operator's\nplan must identify where all ICDA regions are located in the transmission\nsystem, in which covered segments are located. An ICDA region extends from the\nlocation where liquid may first enter the pipeline and encompasses the entire\narea along the pipeline where internal corrosion may occur and where further\nevaluation is needed. An ICDA region may encompass one or more covered\nsegments. In the identification process, an operator must use the model in GRI\n02-0057, Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment of Gas Transmission\n\nPipelines--Methodology, (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title). An operator\nmay use another model if the operator demonstrates it is equivalent to the one\nshown in GRI 02-0057. A model must consider changes in pipe diameter, locations\nwhere gas enters a line (potential to introduce liquid) and locations\ndownstream of gas draw-offs (where gas velocity is reduced) to define the\ncritical pipe angle of inclination above which water film cannot be transported\nby the gas. (3)\n\nIdentification or\nlocations for excavation and direct examination. An operator's plan must\nidentify the locations where internal corrosion is most likely in each ICDA\nregion. In the location identification process, an operator must identify a\nminimum of two locations for excavation within each ICDA region within a\ncovered segment and must perform a direct examination for internal corrosion at\neach location, using ultrasonic thickness measurements, radiography, or other\ngenerally accepted measurement technique. One location must be the low point\n(e.g., sags, drips, valves, manifolds, dead-legs, traps) within the covered\nsegment nearest to the beginning of the ICDA region. The second location must\nbe further downstream, within a covered segment, near the end of the ICDA\nregion. If corrosion exists at either location, the operator must: (i) evaluate the severity of the defect\n(remaining strength) and remediate the defect in accordance with section\n255.933\nof this Part; (ii)\nas part of the operator's current\nintegrity assessment either perform additional excavations in each covered\nsegment within the ICDA region, or use an alternative assessment method allowed\nby sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part to assess the\nline pipe in each covered segment within the ICDA region for internal\ncorrosion; and\n(iii)\nevaluate the\npotential for internal corrosion in all pipeline segments (both covered and\nnon-covered) in the operator's pipeline system with similar characteristics to\nthe ICDA region containing the covered segment in which the corrosion was\nfound, and as appropriate, remediate the conditions the operator finds in\naccordance with section\n255.933\nof this Part. (4)\n\nPost-assessment evaluation and\nmonitoring. An operator's plan must provide for evaluating the effectiveness of\nthe ICDA process and continued monitoring of covered segments where internal\ncorrosion has been identified. The evaluation and monitoring process includes: (i) evaluating the effectiveness of ICDA as\nan assessment method for addressing internal corrosion and determining whether\na covered segment should be reassessed at more frequent intervals than those\nspecified in section\n255.939\nof this Part. An operator\nmust carry out this evaluation within a year of conducting an ICDA; and\n(ii)\ncontinually monitoring\neach covered segment where internal corrosion has been identified using\ntechniques such as coupons, UT sensors or electronic probes, periodically\ndrawing off liquids at low points and chemically analyzing the liquids for the\npresence of corrosion products. An operator must base the frequency of the\nmonitoring and liquid analysis on results from all integrity assessments that\nhave been conducted in accordance with the requirements of sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part, and risk\nfactors specific to the covered segment. If an operator finds any evidence of\ncorrosion products in the covered segment, the operator must take prompt action\nin accordance with one of the two following required actions and remediate the\nconditions the operator finds in accordance with section\n255.933\nof this Part; (a) conduct excavations of covered segments\nat locations downstream from where the electrolyte might have entered the pipe; or\n(b) assess the covered segment\nusing another integrity assessment method allowed by sections\n255.901\nthrough\n255.951\nof this Part. (5)\n\nOther requirements. The ICDA plan must also include: (i) criteria\nan operator will apply in making key decisions (e.g., ICDA feasibility, definition of ICDA regions, conditions requiring excavation) in implementing\neach stage of the ICDA process; (ii)\nprovisions for applying more restrictive\ncriteria when conducting ICDA for the first time on a covered segment and that\nbecome less stringent as the operator gains experience; and\n(iii)\nprovisions that analysis be carried out\non the entire pipeline in which covered segments are present, except that\napplication of the remediation criteria of section\n255.933\nof this Part may be\nlimited to covered segments.
