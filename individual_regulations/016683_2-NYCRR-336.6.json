Tit. 2 § 336.6 - Reemployment of disability beneficiaries\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The retirement allowance of a disability\nbeneficiary shall be reduced in the event that any such disability beneficiary\nis employed in an occupation paying more than the difference between his\nretirement allowance, as it would be without optional modification, and the\nfinal salary. The retirement allowance shall be adjusted to a sum which, when\nadded to the amount so earnable, shall equal the final salary. If the earnings\nsubsequently change, the retirement allowance shall be adjusted so that the sum\nof retirement allowance when added to the amounts earned shall not exceed his\nfinal salary. The reduction shall be from the amount that the allowance would\nhave been without optional modification. The retirement allowance of a\ndisability beneficiary shall not be reduced after he or she has attained the\napplicable mandatory retirement age, or shall have attained the age and the\ndate such beneficiary would have been eligible for service retirement under\napplicable law had he or she remained in continuous service from the date of\nretirement. For the purposes of this section, applicable law shall mean the\nplan and/or provision under which the member was enrolled on the date the\ndisability retirement became effective. (b) In the event that a disability\nbeneficiary is restored to active service of an employer, at a salary equal to\nor in excess of his final salary, his retirement allowance shall cease. Thereafter, such person shall contribute to the retirement system in the same\nmanner and at the same rate that he paid prior to his disability retirement. The total service which was credited at the time of such retirement shall be\ncredited to the restored individual. Upon subsequent retirement, additional\nservice earned by him subsequent to his last restoration to membership will be\ncredited. (c) In the event that a\ndisability beneficiary is restored to active public service at a salary less\nthan his final salary but equal to or in excess of the current minimum salary\nfor the position from which he was last retired for disability, such person, if\nhe or she so elects, shall again become a member of the retirement system and\nthe retirement allowance shall cease. If such an election is filed with the\n\nComptroller, such individual shall contribute to the retirement system in the\nsame manner and at the same rate as was paid prior to disability retirement. The total service which was credited at the time of such retirement shall be\ncredited to the restored individual. Upon his subsequent retirement, additional\nservice earned subsequent to the last restoration to membership will be\ncredited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
