  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 665.13 - Other department responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to those already specified, the act assigns\nthe department other continuing roles in freshwater wetlands protection for the\nsake of consistency and to assure adequate jurisdiction in view of the fact\nthat natural systems transcend local boundaries. (a) The department is responsible for the\npromulgation of official maps for regulatory purposes and, except in the\n\nAdirondack Park, the classification of mapped wetlands the maintenance of said\nmaps and classifications. (b) Except in the Adirondack Park, the department must delineate more precisely the\nboundary line or lines of a freshwater wetland or parts of a wetland upon\nwritten request of any person showing good cause for such delineation. Such\ndelineation must be in accordance with the provisions of subdivision 24-0301.7\nof the act. (c) The department, in\naccordance with section\n664.4\n(g) and (h), must respond to a written request by any person to change a wetland's\nclassification and must confirm the classification of a wetland to be affected\nby a proposed activity upon the written request of any person intending to\nsubmit an application for a permit to the department or a local\ngovernment. (d) The department, except in the Adirondack Park, retains regulatory authority in all cases where: (1)\nan official map has not yet been\npromulgated; (2)\nno local\ngovernment has assumed local jurisdiction or said jurisdiction has been\ntransferred to, defaulted or superseded by the department; (3)\nwetlands have been exempted from local\nimplementation and not delegated to a local government; or\n(4)\na local government is the applicant for a\npermit. (e) The\ndepartment, pursuant to subdivision 24-0501.7 of the act, will make its\ntechnical services available for a fee. Such fees are imposed at the discretion\nof the department and must not exceed the total cost of providing the service. (1)\n\nTechnical services for a fee may be\nsupplied to a local government that has temporarily lost the services of a\nperson(s) providing technical capability to the local freshwater wetlands\nprotection program and thus its ability to administer the act. The local\ngovernment must reestablish its technical capability, in accordance with\nsection\n665.4\n(h), (i) and\n(j) within six months or its authority will\nbe superseded. (2)\n\nLocal\ngovernments are encouraged to seek the advice of the department for permit\napplication review under circumstances that do not require formal participation\nand consideration of a fee. Technical information of the department that is\navailable to the public (e.g., flora and fauna occurrence) will be available\nfor free to local governments to assist them in reviewing permit\napplications. (f) Notwithstanding the requirement for local government enforcement of its local\nfreshwater wetlands protection program in accordance with section\n665.10\nof this Part, the department\nmay, at the request of local government or on its own initiative, take\nenforcement action against violation of the act, local law or ordinance or the\nterms of any permit.
