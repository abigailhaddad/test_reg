Tit. 20 §§ 4-2.2 - Net gains from the sale of real property\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 210-A(2)(d))\n(a) Net gains (not less than zero) from the\nsales of real property located in New York are included in New York receipts. Net gains (not less than zero) from sales of real property located within and\nwithout New York\n\nState are included in everywhere receipts. (b) For each sale of real\nproperty, the corporation must compute a gain or loss from the sale by\nsubtracting its adjusted basis in the real property from the sale price of the\nreal property. If the sale price exceeds the adjusted basis, the result is a\ngain. If the sale price is less than the adjusted basis, the result is a\nloss. (c) To determine the amount\nof net gains from sales of real property to be included in the numerator and\ndenominator of the BAF, the corporation first must subtract the sum of all\nlosses computed under subdivision (b) of this section from the sum of all gains\ncomputed under subdivision (b). If the result is equal to or less than zero, no\namount is included in New York receipts and everywhere receipts. If the total\namount of net gains (not less than zero) from sales of real property located in\n\nNew York exceeds the net gains (not less than zero) from sales of real property\nlocated within and without New York State, the amount included in New York\nreceipts is limited to the amount included in everywhere receipts.
