Tit. 12 § 57.4 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs used in or in connection with this Part (rule) the\nfollowing terms shall mean: (a) High-voltage lines. Electrical conductors installed aboveground and having a\nvoltage differential in excess of 600 volts between any pair of conductors or\nbetween any conductor and ground. In the case of alternating current, the\nvoltage shall be measured in R.M.S. value. All high-voltage lines shall be\nconsidered as energized high-voltage lines until assurance has been given that\nthey are otherwise by qualified representatives of the owners or persons in\ncharge of such lines. Exception:This definition shall not include approved\narmored cable used to supply power to portable equipment and insulated power\ncables enclosed in approved metallic raceways. (b) Dangerous proximity. As defined in Labor\n\nLaw, section 202-h, dangerous proximity shall be the distance within 10 feet of\nhigh-voltage lines, or within such greater distances as are set forth in the\n1990 edition of the regulations of the United States Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth Administration (29 CFR parts\n1910\nand\n1926\n), the New York Industrial\n\nCode (12 NYCRR Part\n23\n) and the National Electrical Safety Code, 1990 edition, published by the American National Standards Institute, 11 West 42nd Street, New York, NY 10036. (c) R.M.S. value. The greatest effective difference of potential between any two\nconductors of the circuit concerned. (d) Prohibited activity. The operation, erection, transportation, handling, or storage of any tools, machinery, equipment, supplies, material or apparatus, or the moving of any building, if\nin the course of such operation, erection, transportation, handling, storage or\nmoving of such objects it is possible to come within dangerous proximity of a\nhigh-voltage line. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n57.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
