  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 531.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe definitions in this section shall apply with respect to\nthe compensating use tax. (a) Consideration. Consideration is the amount paid for any property or service, valued in money. Consideration includes monetary consideration, exchange, barter, the rendering of any service, or any agreement therefor. Monetary\nconsideration includes assumption of liabilities, fees, rentals, royalties or\nany other charge that a purchaser, lessee or licensee is required to\npay. (b) Manufacturing. Manufacturing is the production of tangible personal property that has a\ndifferent identity from its ingredients. Manufacturing includes the production\nof standardized items as well as the production of items to a customer's\nspecifications. Example 1:Company A is a producer of steel beams and\ngirders which are incorporated into buildings. The beam is manufactured by\ncombining iron ore and other ingredients. Example 2:Company B furnishes concrete that is poured into\nfoundations. Cement, water and aggregates are mixed in a truck enroute to the\njob, to form concrete. The concrete is a manufactured product. Example 3:Company C at its plant combines asphalt, stone, and other ingredients to produce a compound which, when laid, is a road\nsurface. The finished compound is a manufactured product. Example 4:Company D takes concrete and other ingredients\nwhich it casts into slabs and blocks. The finished casting is a manufactured\nproduct. Example 5:Company E combines metal, wood, glass, and other\ncomponent parts into structural panel sections which are joined to form the\nbearing walls of a building. These panels are manufactured products. Example 6:Company F laminates wood panels which are joined\nto form arches. These laminated arches are manufactured products. (c) Assembling. Assembling is the\ncoupling or the uniting of parts or materials as a manufacturing process or as\na step in the manufacturing process which results in a new product. Example 1:Company A purchases drilled angle iron from\n\nCompany B and steel shelving from Company C. Company A then bolts the shelving\nto the angle iron, to produce bookcases by assembly. Example 2:Company C combines pre-cut glass, plastic, aluminum extrusions and rubber gaskets to make storm windows. Such combining of\nmaterials is assembling. (d) Fabrication. Fabrication is the\nalteration or modification of a manufactured product without a change in the\nidentity of the product. Fabrication includes cutting, perforating, and similar\noperations. Where a manufacturer, processor or assembler fabricates tangible\npersonal property which he installs to the specifications of a capital\nimprovement, the value added by such fabrication is not subject to the use tax. (See section\n531.3\n[b]\n[1][iii]\nof this Part.)\n\nExample 1:Company K bends flat sheet metal to form heating\nand air conditioning duct work. This operation constitutes fabrication as the\nidentity of the sheet metal is not lost. Example 2:Company L manufactures steel beams. It also\nmodifies them by attaching flanges according to specifications for its use in\nerecting a certain building. The steel beams have not lost their identity after\nthe flanges have been attached and Company L has manufactured and fabricated\nand installed the beams. Example 3:Company M bends, and shapes wrought iron railings\naccording to the rise in the stairs of a certain building. M's work on railings\nis fabrication. (e) Processing. Processing is the performance of any service on tangible personal\nproperty which effects a change in the nature, shape or form of the\nproperty. (f) Installation. Installation is the physical affixation of tangible personal property to other\ntangible personal property or to real property.
