(b) Any policy in which one-third or more of the total premium is allocable to any combination of hospital, surgical or medical expense benefits shall contain a conversion privilege at least equal to that required under section\n3221 (e)\nof the Insurance Law if coverage be terminated pursuant to either paragraph (a)(2) of this section, if the insured is not eligible for coverage under Medicare or, in the case of employer-employee franchise, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3) of this section or, in the case of association franchise, pursuant to paragraph (a)(3), (4), (5), (6) or (8) of this section. (c) Whenever a policy contains a conversion privilege, the insured individual shall be given written notice of the right to convert not more than 15 days after termination of insurance. If such notice is given more than 15 days but less than 90 days after termination of insurance, the time allowed for the exercise of the privilege of conversion shall be extended for 15 days after the giving of such notice. If such notice is not given within 90 days after the termination of insurance, the time allowed for the exercise of such conversion privilege shall expire at the end of such 90 days. Written notice given to the insured individual by the employer, or sponsor or insurer, to the insured individual at his last known address shall be deemed full compliance with the above.

(g) When rates are based on attained age, other than for policies which provide hospital, medical or surgical expense benefits, the policy shall include the applicable schedule of rates.
