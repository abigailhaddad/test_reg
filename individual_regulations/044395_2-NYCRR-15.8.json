  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 15.8 - Lawful extra care charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Lawful\nextra care charges shall mean those charges allowed by the mayor of a city or\nlocal licensing authority, which may be by rule or regulation promulgated for\nextra care services rendered by a collateral loan broker. It is the duty of the\ncollateral loan broker to perform those services and to take such care of\npledged articles as is normally required of a pledged article of personal\nproperty; where, however, the collateral loan broker actually gives or renders\nextra care and assumes a risk beyond those normally rendered and assumed by a\ncollateral loan broker, and a charge is made for such extra care, the\ncollateral loan broker shall specifically call the pledgor's attention to the\nsaid charge at the time the loan is made, and no such charge or fee shall be\nallowed unless the pledgor shall sign an agreement, to pay such extra charge\nand the fee for such extra charge, as agreed upon shall be inserted on the face\nof the pawn ticket. (b) The\nabove-mentioned charges are intended to apply to those extra care services\nactually performed and rendered by a collateral loan broker in addition to the\nnormal care required to be given by him, and, shall not be used as a substitute\nfor or as a means of exacting additional charges from the pledgor in excess of\nthe maximum interest rates provided for in section\n46\nof the\n\nGeneral Business Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n15.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
