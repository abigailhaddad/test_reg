Tit. 10 § 127.5 - Village of Williston Park\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law), as amended by chapter 395 of the Laws of 1928, shall apply to the wells, located on land owned by the village, and situated on a plot of ground in the northeast corner of the village, south of the Long Island Motor Parkway and west of the Long Island Railroad, which form the source of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park, Nassau County, New York. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term well wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the wells now used as a source of this public water supply or to any additional well which may be constructed at this point for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from the wells is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the well. (c) Privies adjacent to any well. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind placed or used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle, which is not watertight, placed or used for the permanent deposit of human excreta, shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind, placed or used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all excreta shall be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removal container which shall be emptied as set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nWhenever the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers become filled within six inches of the top, said receptacles or containers shall be emptied or removed and the contents disposed of as hereinafter provided in order to maintain the privy or receptacle in proper sanitary condition and effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundation or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transported from the privy or receptacle to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, or the removable containers, while being transported shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles or removable containers permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits and covered with not less than 12 inches of soil in such a manner as effectually to prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any well, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, sink wastes, garbage, etc. (1)\n\nNo bath water, laundry wastes, sewage or other excremental matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source shall be thrown, placed, led, conducted, discharged or allowed to escape or flow in any manner upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [4] and [5] of subdivision [c], or into suitable watertight iron pipes with tight leaded joints connected to a sewage disposal system, a permit for which has been granted by the State Commissioner of Health) within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park. It is provided, however, that no such watertight iron pipe shall be located within 25 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park. (2)\n\nNo garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any garage nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind shall be thrown or discharged upon the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface (except into watertight containers, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraphs [4] and [5] of subdivision [c]) within 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground, nor shall such human excreta, compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil unless covered with not less than 12 inches of soil nor within a distance of 500 feet of any well; and no manure or compost of any kind shall be placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 200 feet of any well of the public water supply of the village of Williston Park.
