(c) Any request not filed on or before the\napplicable deadline established in subdivision (a) of this section hereof will\nbe deemed untimely and such request for a hearing shall be considered denied\nunless the commission, upon written request and for good cause shown, grants\nleave to make such filing nunc pro tunc; the standard applicable to what\nconstitutes good cause shown being the standard applicable in analogous cases\nunder Federal law. Receipt of requests for hearings pursuant to this section, whether timely filed or not, shall be submitted by the executive director to\nthe commissioners for their information. (d) Petitioners shall be limited to a single\nfiling that shall set forth all matters and arguments in support thereof, including any ancillary motions or requests for relief. Issues not raised in\nthis single filing shall be considered waived for purposes of the instant\nproceeding. Where the petitioner is appealing a final determination on a\nproject application and is not the project sponsor, the petitioner shall serve\na copy of the appeal upon the project sponsor within five days of its\nfiling. (e) The commission will\ndetermine the manner in which it will hear the appeal. If a hearing is granted, the commission shall serve notice thereof upon the petitioner and project\nsponsor and shall publish such notice in the\n\nFederal Register. The hearing shall not be held less than 20 days after publication of such\nnotice. Hearings may be conducted by one or more members of the commission, or\nby such other hearing officer as the commission may designate. (1)\n\nThe petitioner may also request a stay of\nthe action or decision giving rise to the appeal pending final disposition of\nthe appeal, which stay may be granted or denied by the executive director after\nconsultation with the commission chair and the member from the affected member\nstate. The decision of the executive director on the request for stay shall not\nbe appealable to the commission under this section and shall remain in full\nforce and effect until the commission acts on the appeal. (2)\n\nIn addition to the contents of the\nrequest itself, the executive director, in granting or denying the request for\nstay, will consider the following factors: (i) irreparable harm to the petitioner; (ii)\nthe likelihood that the petitioner will\nprevail. (f) The commission shall grant the hearing request pursuant to this section if it\ndetermines that an adequate record with regard to the action or decision is not\navailable, or that the commission has found that an administrative review is\nnecessary or desirable. If the commission denies any request for a hearing, the\nparty seeking such hearing shall be limited to such remedies as may be provided\nby the compact or other applicable law or court rule. If a hearing is granted, the commission shall refer the matter for hearing to be held in accordance with\nsection\n1808.3\nof this Part, and appoint a\nhearing officer.

The request for\nintervention shall state the interest of the person filing such notice, and the\nspecific grounds of objection to the action or decision or other grounds for\nappearance. The hearing officer(s) shall determine whether the person\nrequesting intervention has standing in the matter that would justify their\nadmission as an intervener to the proceedings in accordance with Federal case\nlaw. (2)\n\nInterveners shall have the\nright to be represented by counsel, to present evidence and to examine and\ncross-examine witnesses. (i) Where a request for an appeal is made, the 90-day appeal period set forth in section\n3.10\n(6)\nand\n\nFederal reservation (o) of the compact shall not commence until the commission\nhas either denied the request for or taken final action on an administrative\nappeal.
