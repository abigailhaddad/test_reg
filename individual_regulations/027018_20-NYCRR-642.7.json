  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 642.7 - Examples of calculations of the mortgage recording taxes\n\nState Regulations\n\nExample 1: Mr. Smith acquires a one-family residence located in Nassau\n\nCounty, which imposes the additional tax, for $120,000. To finance his\npurchase, Mr. Smith borrows $100,000 from Bank Z and gives the bank a mortgage\non the residence as security for the loan. When the mortgage is presented for recording the taxes due\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n(($100,000 ÷ $100) × $.50)\n$ 500\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n(($100,000 ÷ $100) × $.25)\n$250\nless: exemption for the first $10,000\n(($10,000 ÷ $100) × $.25)\n$25\n\nAdditional tax due\n$225\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n(($100,000 ÷ $100) × $.25)\n$ 250\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$ 975.00\n* Since the mortgaged property is principally improved by a\none-family residence, the $10,000 exclusion for purposes of the additional tax\nis allowed. (See section 642[b] of this Part for information regarding the\n$10,000 exclusion.)\n** Since the mortgaged property is a one-family residence, Bank Z is required to pay the special additional tax (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Example 2: Same facts as in example 1, except that the mortgaged\nproperty is located in New York City. In addition to the total tax computed in\n\nExample 1, City of New York tax at a rate of one dollar for each $100 of\nprincipal debt must be paid. Such tax would be $1000 given the facts of Example\n1 computed as follows: ($100,000 ÷ $100) × $1.00 = $1,000. Example 3: Same facts as in Example 1, except that the mortgaged\nproperty is located in the City of Yonkers. In addition to the total tax\ncomputed in Example 1, City of yonkers tax at a rate of 50 cents for each $100\nof principal debt must be paid. Such tax would be $500 given the facts of\n\nExample 1 computed as follows: ($100,000 ÷ $100) × 50 cents = $500. Example 4: Mr. Smith borrows $100,000 from Bank Z and gives the bank a\nmortgage on his 10-unit apartment building as security for the loan. The\napartment building is located in the Bronx, New York City. When the mortgage is presented for recording the taxes due\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$500\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$250\n**Special Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$250\n\nCity of New York tax @ one dollar rate\n$1000\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$2000\n* Since the real property covered by the mortgage is not\nprincipally improved or to be improved by a one- or two-family residence or\ndwelling, the $10,000 exclusion for purposes of the additional tax is not\nallowed (see section\n642.3\n[b]\nof his Part). ** Mr. Smith is required to pay the special additional tax\nbecause the property is not principally improved by one or more structures\ncontaining in the aggregate not more than six residential dwelling units, with\neach unit having its own separate cooking facilities (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Example 5: Mr. Jones sells a one-family residence located in Albany\n\nCounty, which imposes the additional tax, to his son for $80,000 and takes back\na purchase money mortgage for 100 percent of the selling price. When the mortgage is presented for recording the taxes due\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$400\n\nAdditional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$200\n*less: exemption for the first $10,000\n$ 25\n\nAdditional tax due\n$175\n**Special additional tax\n0\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$575\n* Since the mortgaged property is principally improved by a\none family residence, the $10,000 exclusion for purposes of the additional tax\nis allowed (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** The mortgage given to Mr. Jones is exempt from the\nspecial additional tax based on the residential-natural person exemption as\nprovided at section\n642.3\n[b]\nof this Part. Example 6: Mr. Jones owns two separate parcels of real property; one\nparcel is improved with a retail store, the other with Mr. Jones' personal\nresidence. Both the store and the residence are located in Chenango County, a\ncounty which does not impose the additional tax. The fair market values of the real property comprising the\nstore and the personal residence are $110,000 and $75,000, respectively. Mr. Jones borrows $50,000 from Bank X and gives the bank a\nmortgage on the two parcels as security for the loan. When the mortgage is\npresented for recording the taxes due are computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$250\n*Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$125\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$375\n* Mr. Jones is required to pay the special additional tax\nin the above example as the fair market value of the store exceeds the fair\nmarket value of the personal residence (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Example 7: Mr. Jones owns a parcel or real property located in Albany\n\nCounty, a county that imposes the additional tax. The parcel is improved by a\nbuilding which contains a commercial unit and a residential unit. The value of\nthe commercial unit exceeds the value of the residential unit. Mr. Jones borrows $100,000 from Bank Z and gives the bank a\nmortgage on the parcel as security for the loan. When the mortgage is presented for recording the taxes due\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$ 500\n* Additional Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 250\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 250\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$1000\n* Since the value of the commercial unit exceeds the value\nof the residential unit, the parcel is considered principally improved by the\ncommercial unit, and therefore the $10,000 exclusion is not allowed for\npurposes of the additional tax (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** Also, Mr. Jones is required to pay the special\nadditional tax because the property is not principally improved by one or more\nstructures containing in the aggregate not more than six residential dwelling\nunits (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Example 8: A mortgage is to be recorded on a parcel of real property\nwhich is improved by two buildings, one a two-family residence, and the other a\nsmall retail grocery store. The parcel is located in the Bronx, New York City. The\nprincipal debt secured by the mortgage is $1 million. The mortgagee is Mr. W, a\nnatural person. The fair market value of the two-family residence is\n$750,000 and the fair market value of the grocery store is 450,000. When the mortgage is presented for recording the taxes due\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$ 5000\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$2500\nless: exemption for the first $10,000\n25\n\nAdditional tax due\n$ 2475\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 2500\n***City of New York tax @ $1.75 rate\n$17500\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$27475\n* Since the mortgage covers property principally improved\nby the two-family residence, the $10,000 exclusion for purposes of the\nadditional tax is allowed (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** The mortgage would be required to pay the special\nadditional tax, since the property is considered principally improved by the\nresidential structure (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Also, the residential-natural person exemption as described at\nsection\n642.3\n(b) of this Part would not apply since the mortgage covers property which consists\nof more than one structure. *** Since the mortgage covers property which is not\nstrictly a one-, two-, or three-family house or an individual residential\ncondominium unit and the amount secured is $500,000 or more, the City of New\n\nYork tax is computed using the highest rate (see section\n642.4\n[a]\nof this Part). Example 9: Mr. T owns a parcel of real property, a portion of which is\nlocated in Schenectady County, and a portion of which is located in Montgomery\n\nCounty. The property is improved by two buildings; one a two-family house, and\nthe other a small manufacturing plant. Scenectady County imposes the additional\ntax. Montgomery County does not impose the additional tax. The fair market values of the real property comprising the\ntwo-family house and the manufacturing plant are $150,000 and $250,000, respectively. The assessed value of the portion of the parcel that is\nlocated in Schenectady County, as such appears on the last assessment roll, is\n$37,500. Such assessed value of the portion of the parcel located in Montgomery\n\nCounty is $50,000. Mr. T borrows $200,000 from Bank Y and gives the bank a\nmortgage on the parcel as security for the loan. Upon recording the mortgage the required return was filed\nfor the purpose of determining the correct amount of additional tax due. The total taxes payable upon the recording of the mortgage\nare computed as follows: Basic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$1000\n*Additional tax - Imposed by Schenectady County\n$37,500/$87,500 × $200,000 = $85,700 (portion of\nmortgage subject to additional tax)\n$85,700 @ 25 cents rate\n$214.25\n**Special Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n500\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due\n$1714.25\n* The $10,000 exclusion is not allowed for the purpose of\ncomputing the additional tax, as the parcel is considered principally improved\nby the manufacturing plant (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** The special additional tax must be paid by the mortgagor\nsince the parcel is considered principally improved by the manufacturing plant\n(see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). Example 10: Mr. M owns an office building located in New York City. on\n\nAugust 9, 1990 Mr. m borrowed $800,000 from Bank W and gave the bank two\nmortgages (mortgage #1 and mortgage #2) on the office building as security for\nthe loan. Mortgage #1 secures $500,000 of the loan and mortgage #2 secures\n$300,000. When the mortgages are presented for recording the taxes are computed\nas follows: Taxes due upon recording of mortgage #1\n\nBasic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$2500\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$1250\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$1250\n***City of New York tax @ $1.75 rate\n$8750\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due on recording of mortgage\n#1\n$13,750\n\nTaxes due upon recording of mortgage #2\n\nBasic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$1500\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 750\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 750\n***City of New York tax @ $1.75 rate\n$5250\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due on recording of mortgage\n#2\n$8250\n* Since the mortgage covers property improved by an office\nbuilding, the $10,000 exclusion for the purpose of computing the additional tax\nis not allowed (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** Since each mortgage covers property which is principally\nimproved by an office building, the special additional tax must be paid by the\nmortgagor (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). *** Since the mortgages are part of the same or related\ntransactions and have the same mortgagor, the principal debt secured by each\nmortgage must be added together to determine the applicable rate of the City of\n\nNew York tax. Since such aggregate amount is $500,000 or more and since each\nmortgage covers other than a one-, two- or three-family house or individual\nresidential condominium unit, the City of New York tax must be computed using\nthe $1.75 rate (see section\n642.4\nof this Part). Example 11: Mr. N owns two office buildings (Building #1 and Building\n#2) located in New York City. On September 9, 1990 Mr. N borrows $700,000 from\n\nBank W. As security for the repayment of the loan Mr. N gives a mortgage to the\nbank covering Building #1 which is stated to secure $400,000 and also gives\nanother mortgage to the bank covering Building #2 which is stated to secure\n$300,000. When the mortgages are presented for recording the taxes\nare computed as follows: Taxes due upon recording of mortgage covering\n\nBuilding #1\n\nBasic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$2000\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 1000\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 1000\n***City of New York tax @ $1.75 rate\n$ 7000\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due on Building #1 mortgage\n$11000\n\nTaxes due upon recording of mortgage covering\n\nBuilding #2\n\nBasic tax @ 50 cents rate\n$1500\n*Additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 750\n**Special additional tax @ 25 cents rate\n$ 750\n***City of New York tax @ $1.75 rate\n$5250\n\nTotal mortgage taxes due on Building #2 mortgage\n$8250\n* Since each mortgage covers property improved by an office\nbuilding, the $10,000 exclusion for purpose of computing the additional tax is\nnot allowed (see section\n642.2\n[b]\nof this Part). ** Since each mortgage covers property which is principally\nimproved by an office building, the special additional tax must be paid by the\nmortgagor (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). *** Since the mortgages are part of the same or related\ntransactions and have the same mortgagor, the principal debt secured by each\nmortgage must be added together to determine the applicable rate of the City of\n\nNew York tax. Since such aggregate amount is $500,000 or more and since each\nmortgage covers other than a one-, two-, or three-family house or an individual\nresidential condominium unit, the City of New York tax must be computed using\nthe $1.75 rate (see section\n642.4\nof this Part). Footnotes\n* Since the mortgaged property is principally improved by a\none-family residence, the $10,000 exclusion for purposes of the additional tax\nis allowed. (See section 642[b] of this Part for information regarding the\n$10,000 exclusion.)\n** Since the mortgaged property is a one-family residence, Bank Z is required to pay the special additional tax (see section\n642.3\n[c]\nof this Part). *** Since the mortgage covers property which is not\nstrictly a one-, two-, or three-family house or an individual residential\ncondominium unit and the amount secured is $500,000 or more, the City of New\n\nYork tax is computed using the highest rate (see section\n642.4\n[a]\nof this Part).
