  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4120.17 - Out-of-competition testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Out-of-competition collection of samples. (1)\n\nThe commission may at a reasonable time\non any date take a blood, urine or other biologic sample from a horse that is\non a nomination list or under the care or control of a trainer or owner who is\nlicensed by the commission, in order to enhance the ability of the commission\nlaboratory to detect or confirm the impermissible administration of a drug or\nother substance to the horse. (2)\n\nHorses to be tested may be selected at random, for cause or as determined by a\ncommission judge or executive official. (3)\nA selected horse that is not made\navailable for sampling is ineligible to race for 180 days, unless the\ncommission determines that circumstances unavoidably prevented the owner and\ntrainer from making the horse available for sampling. (4)\n\nIf a selected horse is not involved in\nactivities related to racing in New York, then the trainer or owner may\nrepresent this to the commission and the commission will not sample the horse. If the trainer makes such a representation and the managing owner has\npreviously provided the commission with a means for the commission to give\nimmediate telephonic notification to the managing owner that the trainer made\nsuch a representation, then the commission shall transmit such notification to\nthe managing owner and the eligibility of the horse shall be preserved if the\nmanaging owner is able to make the horse available for immediate\nsampling. (b) Sampling procedure. (1)\n\nSamples\nshall be taken under the supervision and direction of a person who is employed\nor designated by the commission and is qualified to safeguard the health and\nsafety of the horse. A veterinarian shall collect all blood samples. (2)\n\nThe person who takes samples for the\ncommission shall provide identification and disclose the purpose of the\nsampling to the trainer or designated attendant of the horse. (3)\n\nThe owner, trainer and/or their designees\nshall cooperate with the person who takes samples for the commission by\nimmediately assisting in the location and identification of the horse, making\nthe horse available at a stall or other safe location to collect the samples, and witnessing the taking of the samples. (4)\n\nThe commission, if requested and in its\nsole discretion, may permit the owner or trainer to present an off-track horse\nfor sampling at a time and licensed racetrack designated by the\ncommission. (5)\n\nAn owner or trainer\ndoes not consent to a search of the premises by making a horse available for\nsampling at an off-track location. (6)\n\nThe commission may arrange for the\nsampling of an out-of-state horse by the racing commission or other designated\nperson in the jurisdiction where the horse is located. Such racing commission\nor other designated person shall follow the relevant provisions of this rule\nand the test results shall be available to the jurisdiction in which the horse\nis located for its regulatory use. The commission, if requested and in its sole\ndiscretion, may permit the owner or trainer instead to present the horse for\nsampling in New York State at a time and place designated by the\ncommission. (7)\nA commission judge\nor executive official may require any horse of a licensed trainer or owner to\nbe brought promptly to a racetrack under the jurisdiction of the commission for\nout-of-competition testing when: (i) the\ncommission has reasonable grounds to believe that the horse might have been\nimpermissibly administered a drug or other substance; (ii)\nthe commission has no other practical\nmeans to collect such samples without reducing the ability of the commission\nlaboratory to detect or confirm the impermissible administration of a drug or\nother substance to a horse; and\n(iii)\nthe horse is stabled out-of-state but\nwithin a radius not greater than 100 miles from such New York State racetrack. The trainer is responsible to have the horse or horses\navailable at the designated time and location. (8)\n\nNo person shall knowingly interfere with\nor obstruct a sampling. (9)\nA\nlicensed racetrack at which a horse may be located shall cooperate fully with a\nperson who is authorized to take samples. The person who collects samples for\nthe commission on track may require that the collection be done at the test\nbarn. (c) Prohibited substances. (1)\n\nThe\npresence in or administration to a horse of the following doping agents or\ndrugs, in the absence of extraordinary mitigating circumstances that excuse the\nowner and trainer from their failure to fulfill their duties and\nresponsibilities, is prohibited at any time: (i) Blood doping agents: any substance, including a protein- or peptide-based agent or drug, that is capable of\nabnormally enhancing the oxygenation of body tissues, including but not limited\nto erythropoietin (EPO), darbepoetin (e.g., Aransep), Oxyglobin, aminoimidazole\ncarboxamide ribonucleotide (\"AICAR\"), Myo-Inositol Trispyrophosphate (\"ITTP\")\nand Hemopure. (ii)\n\nGene doping\nagents: a gene, genetic element, or cell that alters the expression of genes\nfor normal physiological functions and that may produce analgesia or enhance\nthe performance of a horse beyond its natural ability, including but not\nlimited to thymosin beta-4 (\"TB500\"). This shall not apply to such agents when\nused off-track in an accepted veterinary treatment to assist a disabled horse\nto become healthy, without producing analgesia or potentially enhancing the\nperformance of the horse beyond its natural ability, provided that such use is\ndocumented in the contemporaneous veterinary records of the horse. (iii)\n\nAny other protein- or peptide-based\nagent or drug that may produce analgesia or enhance the performance of a horse\nbeyond its natural ability, including but not limited to toxins, venoms and\nallosteric effectors. (iv)\n\nThe\nsubstances described in this paragraph are prohibited regardless of any of the\nprovisions of section\n4120.2\nof this Part. (2)\n\nNo person shall possess or use\nthe prohibited substances described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision on the\npremises of any licensed racetrack. (3)\n\nIt shall be an affirmative defense to a\nviolation of this section that the person used the prohibited substance only in\na time, place and manner specifically permitted in writing by the commission\nbefore the administration of such substance, for a recognized therapeutic use, and subject to such appropriate limitations as the commission shall place on\nthe return of the horse to running races. (d) Penalties. (1)\nA horse found to be in violation of this\nrule shall be ineligible to participate in racing until it is certain that the\nhorse is no longer affected by the prohibited substance and for not less than\n180 days, after which the horse must qualify in a workout satisfactory to the\njudges and test negative for doping agents and drugs. The minimum fixed period\nof ineligibility for a horse in violation of this rule shall be reduced from\n180 to 30 days if the trainer had never violated this rule or similar rules in\nother jurisdictions and had, for any violations of Part 4120 or similar rules\nin other jurisdictions, fewer than 180 days in lifetime suspensions or\nrevocations and fewer than two suspensions or revocations of 15 days or more in\nthe preceding 24 months. (2)\nA\nperson who is found responsible for a violation of paragraph (c)(1) of this\nsection shall, in the absence of extraordinary mitigating circumstances, incur\na minimum penalty of a 10-year suspension in addition to any other penalties\nauthorized in this Subchapter. (e) A buyer who was not aware that a horse is\nor may be determined ineligible under this section may void the purchase, provided that the buyer does so within 10 days after receiving notice of the\nhorse's ineligibility. (f) An\napplication to the commission for an occupational license shall be deemed to\nconstitute consent for access to any off-track premises on which horses owned\nand/or trained by the individual applicant are stabled. The applicant shall\ntake any steps necessary to authorize access by commission representatives to\nsuch off-track premises. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
