(i) The sources of drinking water (both tap water and bottled water) include rivers, lakes, streams, ponds, reservoirs, springs, and wells. As water travels over the surface of the land or through the ground, it dissolves naturally-occurring minerals and can pick up substances resulting from the presence of animals or from human activities. Contaminants that may be present in source water include: microbial contaminants; inorganic contaminants; pesticides and herbicides; organic chemical contaminants; and radioactive contaminants. (ii)\n\nIn order to ensure that tap water is safe to drink, the State and the EPA prescribe regulations which limit the amount of certain contaminants in water provided by public water systems. The State Health Department's and the FDA's regulations establish limits for contaminants in bottled water which must provide the same protection for public health. (iii)\n\nDrinking water, including bottled water, may reasonably be expected to contain at least small amounts of some contaminants. The presence of contaminants does not necessarily indicate that water poses a health risk. More information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency's safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791). (iv)\n\nSome people may be more vulnerable to disease causing microorganisms or pathogens in drinking water than the general population. Immuno-compromised persons such as persons with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, persons who have undergone organ transplants, people with HIV/AIDS or other immune system disorders, some elderly, and infants can be particularly at risk from infections. These people should seek advice from their health care provider about their drinking water, EPA/CDC guidelines on appropriate means to lessen the risk of infection by Cryptosporidium, Giardia and other microbial pathogens are available from the safe drinking water hotline (800-426-4791). (12)\n\nAdditional health effects statements for arsenic, nitrate, lead, total trihalomethanes and fluoride: (i) A system which detects arsenic at levels above 5 ug/l, but less than or equal to the MCL must include in its report a short informational statement about arsenic, using language prescribed by the State. (ii)\nA system which detects nitrate at levels above 5 mg/l, but below the MCL must include a short informational statement about the impacts of nitrate on children using language prescribed by the State. (iii)\nA system which detects lead above the action level in more than 5 percent and up to and including 10 percent of the sites sampled (or for systems sampling less than 20 sites and even one sample is above the action level) must include a short informational statement about the special impact of lead on children using language prescribed by the State. (iv)\nA system using only groundwater or using surface water as its source and serving less than 10,000 persons, which detects TTHMs above 80 ug/l, but below 100 ug/l, as an annual average, monitored and calculated as described in section\n5-1.52\ntable 3 of this Subpart, must until January 1, 2004, include health effects language prescribed by the State.
