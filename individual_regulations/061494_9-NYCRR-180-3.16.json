Tit. 9 §§ 180-3.16 - Use of Mechanical Restraints\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Mechanical restraints may be used in\nspecialized secure detention facilities in accordance with the provisions of\nthis section if such use is part of the facility's restraint policy that was\napproved pursuant to section\n180-3.14\nof this Subpart.

(d) Mechanical\nrestraints may be used on a youth inside a specialized secure detention\nfacility only after all appropriate pro-active, non-physical behavior\nmanagement techniques have been attempted, as well as all appropriate less\nrestrictive physical behavior management techniques have been tried and failed, and the youth continues to be out of control and presents a serious and evident\ndanger to himself or herself or others. Mechanical restraints shall be removed\nas soon as the youth is sufficiently under control so that the youth can be\nmanaged safely using other less restrictive, approved methods.
