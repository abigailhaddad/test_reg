  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 404.2 - Explanatory note\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection 580.4 of article 12-C of the New York Banking Law\nrequires licensees to obtain a surety bond, or in lieu of obtaining such a\nbond, maintain certain assets on deposit, which constitute a trust fund to be\nused to reimburse payments made by debtors that have not been properly\ndistributed by the licensee to the creditors of the debtors. In circumstances\nin which a licensee uses a licensee service provider or a non-licensee service\nprovider to hold, or have access to, or to effectuate possession of, by any\nmeans, the monies of a licensee's debtors, the services of such service\nproviders shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth in sections\n404.3, 404.4, 404.5 and\n404.6\nof this Part, in order to\nprovide the consumer protections afforded to licensees' debtors as mandated\nunder article 12-C of the New York Banking Law. In complying with these terms\nand conditions, a licensee that obtains a surety bond pursuant to section 580.4\nof the Banking Law and uses the services of a licensee service provider as\ndescribed, is required to use a licensee service provider that either obtains a\nsurety bond or maintains assets on deposit, in accordance with the provisions\nof Banking Law, section 580.4. Similarly, if the licensee obtains a surety bond\nand uses the services of a non-licensee service provider as described, the\nlicensee is required to use a non-licensee service provider that maintains\nassets on deposit, in accordance with the provisions of section\n404.4\n(c)(2)\nof\nthis Part. If, however, a licensee elects to maintain assets on deposit\npursuant to Banking Law, section 580.4 and uses the services of a licensee\nservice provider or a non-licensee service provider as described, there is no\nrequirement that the licensee service provider or the non-licensee service\nprovider obtain a surety bond or maintain assets on deposit. The licensee\nservice provider would, of course, be required to obtain a surety bond or\nmaintain assets on deposit with respect to its own contracts with debtors for\nbudget planning services, pursuant to Banking Law, section 580.4.
