Tit. 9 § 566.6 - Payment for vacation credit exchange\n\nState Regulations\n\nCash payment in exchange for excess vacation credits will\nbe based on the employee's annual salary in effect on July 1 of the exchange\nprogram year, including all annual salary factors in effect on that date. Payment for such exchange will be made by separate check in the last payroll\nperiod commencing in November of the exchange program year. Such payment will\nnot be considered part of the employee's basis annual salary, nor will it be\nconsidered salary for the purpose of computing retirement benefits. The salary\nin effect on July 1 means the salary in effect at the beginning of the payroll\nperiod the first day of which is the nearest to July 1 or the beginning of the\nearlier of two payroll periods, the first days of which are nearest but not\nequally near to July 1.
