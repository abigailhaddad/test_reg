A full meal consists of\nmeat, potato, vegetable, salad, beverage and dessert. When there is a selection\nof entrees, desserts, etc., at different prices, use an average in calculating\nthe selling price of a full meal. An equivalent meal in a pay cafeteria is\ndetermined by dividing total sales by the average selling price of a full meal\nserved at noon. (c) Standard unit\nof measure: dietary meals served. Number of meals served shall include only\nregularly scheduled meals and exclude snacks and fruit juices served between\nregularly scheduled meals. For a meal count, tube feedings will be counted as\nthree meals for each day as fed. (d) Data source.
