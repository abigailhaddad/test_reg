  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 14.5 - Termination of residential service-special procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThis section provides special protections\nregarding the termination and reconnection of service in cases involving\nmedical emergencies, the elderly, blind or disabled, and heat-related service\nduring the cold weather period. (2)\n\nIf any communication required by this section is not possible because of an\napparent language barrier, the utility must take steps to assure communication\nbefore termination. (3)\n\nFor\npurposes of this section, when a utility is required to make a diligent effort\nto contact personally an individual, the utility must, at a minimum: (i) attempt to call such person once during\nnormal business hours and if unsuccessful, twice during reasonable nonbusiness\nhours (6:00 p.m.-9:00 p.m. on weekdays or 9:00 a.m.-5:00 p.m. on Saturdays and\n\nSundays), if there is a telephone; and\n(ii)\nmake an onsite personal visit, if there\nis no telephone or if telephone contacts are unsuccessful. (4)\n\nDuring any continuation of service under\nthis section, the customer remains responsible for payment of service and must\nmake reasonable efforts to pay charges for such service. (5)\n\nIn all contacts with customers entitled\nto the protections under this section, where there remains a threat of\ntermination or termination has already occurred, the utility must notify the\ncustomer that the commission's designees are available for assistance and\nprovide the customer with the commission's telephone number. (b) Medical emergencies. (1)\n\nUtility's obligations. A utility must not\nterminate or refuse to restore service to a residence when a medical emergency\nexists. A medical emergency exists when a resident of a customer's premises\nsuffers from a serious illness or medical condition that severely affects his\nor her well-being, as certified by a medical doctor or local board of health in\naccordance with this subdivision. (2)\n\nWritten certification. Written\ncertification must: (i) be submitted on\nstationery of a medical doctor or local board of health, and be signed by the\nmedical doctor or an official of the local board of health qualified to make a\nmedical judgment; (ii)\nstate the\nname and address of the certifying medical doctor or local board of health, and\nthe doctor's State registration number; (iii)\nstate the name and address of the ill\nperson; and\n(iv)\ninclude an\naffirmation that the absence of water service will aggravate an existing\nmedical emergency at a customer's premises. (3)\n\nProcedure for initial certification. (i) Initial certification of a medical\nemergency may be made either in writing or by telephone by a medical doctor or\nlocal board of health. (ii)\n\nInitial\ncertification is effective for 30 calendar days from the date the utility\nreceives it, as long as written certification is provided to the utility within\nfive business days of any certification made by telephone. (iii)\n\nCertification made only by telephone is\neffective for five business days from the date the utility receives\nit. (iv)\n\nWithin five business days\nof receipt of written certification, the utility must provide the customer with\na written notice that must: (a) state that the\nutility received such certification and that the certification is effective for\n30 calendar days; (b) advise the\ncustomer in detail of the procedures required for renewal of certification\nunder paragraph (4) of this subdivision; including specifically a statement\nthat if the customer does not renew the certification before the 30- day period\nexpires and arrangements for payment are not made, the utility may proceed with\ntermination; and\n(c) be accompanied\nby a form to be completed showing assets, income and expenses. (4)\n\nProcedure for\nrenewal of certification. (i) If the medical\nemergency is likely to continue beyond the expiration of any written\ncertification, the certification may be renewed, provided that, before the\nexpiration of the initial certification: (a) a\nmedical doctor or official of the local board of health submits a new written\ncertification that also states the expected duration of the medical emergency\nand explains the reason the absence of service would aggravate the medical\nemergency; and\n(b) the customer\ndemonstrates an inability to pay charges for service, as documented by a form\nshowing assets, income and expenses. (ii)\n\nThe utility must, within five calendar\ndays of submission of the necessary information, determine whether the\ncustomer's assets and current income are insufficient to pay charges for\nservice, considering other necessary and reasonable expenses of the\ncustomer. (iii)\n\nIf the utility\ndetermines that a customer has not demonstrated an inability to pay charges for\nservice, it must provide the customer with written notice of the determination\nmade under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph and the customer's right to a\nreview of the determination by the commission's designee. (iv)\n\nIf the utility determines that a\ncustomer has demonstrated an inability to pay charges for service and a new\nwritten certification has been submitted, the utility must inform the customer\nthat certification has been renewed, and how long it will be in\neffect. (v) A renewed certification\nremains in effect for 30 calendar days, provided that in cases certified as\nchronic by a medical doctor or official of the local board of health, the\nrenewed certification remains in effect for 60 calendar days. In such cases, a\ncustomer may request that the commission's designee approve a longer period for\nthe written certification to remain in effect, and the commission's designee\nmay approve such longer period, stating specific conditions to be met by the\ncustomer. (5)\n\nTermination of service. A utility may only terminate service to a customer who\nhas submitted a certification of medical emergency after: (i) written notice has been provided to the\ncustomer of the utility's determination either that the certification of\nmedical emergency is no longer in effect or that the customer is able to pay\ncharges for service; (ii)\nany\nreview of the utility's determination by the commission's designee has been\ncompleted; and\n(iii)\nthe\nrequirements of section\n14.4\nof this Part have been\ncomplied with. (c) Customers who are elderly, blind or\ndisabled. (1)\n\nUtility's obligations. A utility\nmust not terminate or refuse to restore service to a customer where the\ncustomer and any other remaining residents of the households are known to or\nidentified to the utility to be blind, disabled, 62 years of age or older, or\n18 years of age or under, without complying with the procedures in this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nProcedure before\ntermination of service. (i) A utility must\nmake a diligent effort to contact personally an adult resident at the\ncustomer's premises at least 72 hours before termination of service to attempt\nto create a plan that would avoid termination and arrange for\npayment. (ii)\n\nWhere efforts at\npersonal contact are unsuccessful or where a utility and a customer are unable\nto create a plan, the utility must notify the local department of social\nservices of the name and address of the customer and the date of termination so\nthat social services may ascertain if the customer is eligible for any\nassistance. The utility must continue service for at least 15 business days\nafter providing this notice, unless notified by the local department of social\nservices that other arrangements have been made. (3)\n\nProcedures after termination of service. (i) In cases where service has been\nterminated and the utility is later notified that the customer should have\nreceived the protections under this subdivision, the utility must: (a) make a diligent effort to contact\npersonally an adult resident at the customer's premises, within 24 hours of\nsuch notification, to attempt to create a plan that would restore service and\narrange for payment of bills; and\n(b) where efforts at personal contact are\nunsuccessful or where the utility and the customer are unable to create a plan, notify the local department of social services of the name and address of the\ncustomer and the date of termination so that social services may ascertain if\nthe customer is eligible for any assistance. (ii)\n\nIn cases where a utility has terminated\nservice consistent with the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the utility must make a diligent effort to contact personally an adult resident\nat the customer's premises within 10 calendar days after termination, to\ndetermine whether alternative arrangements have been made for the provision of\nservice and, if none have been made, attempt to create a plan that would\nrestore service and arrange for payment. (d) Special procedures during cold weather\nperiods for premises with heat-related service. (1)\n\nUtility's obligations. (i) During cold weather periods, before\nterminating premises with heat-related service, a utility must make attempts to\ndetermine whether a resident may suffer serious impairment to health or safety\nas a result of termination, in accordance with the procedures set forth in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. Doubts as to whether a person may suffer\nserious impairment to health or safety as a result of termination must be\nresolved in favor of making such a finding. (ii)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, a\nperson may suffer serious impairment to health or safety as a result of\ntermination when there is evidence of any of the following: (a) dependency due to age, poor physical\ncondition or mental incapacitation; (b) use of life support systems, such as\ndialysis machines or iron lungs; (c) serious illness; or\n(d) disability or blindness. (2)\n\nProcedures. (i) A utility must not terminate service to\ncustomers known to be receiving heat-related service during cold weather\nperiods, unless the utility has made a diligent effort to contact personally\nthe customer or an adult resident at the customer's premises, at least 72 hours\nbefore the intended termination and, if unsuccessful, at the time of\ntermination, in order to find out whether a resident may suffer a serious\nimpairment to health or safety as a result of termination, to fully explain the\nreasons for termination and to provide the customer with information on the\nprotections available under this Part. (ii)\n\nWhere the utility determines that a\nresident may suffer a serious impairment to health or safety as a result of\ntermination, a utility must not terminate service unless: (a) the utility notifies the local social\nservices official orally and within five calendar days in writing, that a\nresident may suffer a serious impairment to health or safety as a result of\ntermination; and\n(b) the local\nsocial services official, after an investigation, informs the utility that the\nreported condition is not likely to result in a serious impairment to health or\nsafety, or that an alternative means for protecting the person's health or\nsafety has been arranged. (iii)\nA utility notifying the local social\nservices official under subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph must inform the\ncustomer of the referral and explain its purpose. (3)\n\nTermination of service. (i) If a utility terminates service to a\ncustomer under this subdivision, and the customer or a resident 18 years or\nolder was not personally contacted by the utility before termination of service\nand the customer has not contacted the utility for the purpose of requesting\nreconnection before 12 noon on the day following termination of service, the\nutility must, by onsite personal visit with the customer or other adult\nresident, immediately attempt to determine whether there is continuing\noccupancy and whether a serious impairment to health or safety may result. If\nthe utility determines that a serious impairment may result, it must\nimmediately restore service. If the utility is unable to make an onsite\npersonal visit with the customer or an adult resident, and does not have\nreasonable grounds to believe that the customer has vacated the premises, the\nutility must immediately refer the name and address of the customer to the\nlocal social services official. (ii)\n\nIf after the discovery of tampered\nequipment, a utility decides to terminate service to a customer because of a\npotential health or safety problem, it must determine, in accordance with this\nsubdivision, whether a resident may suffer a serious impairment to health or\nsafety as a result of termination. If the utility determines that a resident\nmay suffer a serious impairment, it must follow the procedures set forth in\nthis subdivision; provided, however, that continued service is not required if\nit is impractical for the utility to eliminate an unsafe condition. In any\ncases where a resident may suffer a serious impairment and the utility\nterminates service to preclude the continuation of an unsafe condition, the\nutility must specially notify the local social services official on the same\nday service is terminated and request an immediate consideration of the\ncase.
