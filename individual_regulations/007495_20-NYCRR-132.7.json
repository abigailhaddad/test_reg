  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 132.7 - Deductions with respect to capital losses, net long-term capital gains and net operating losses\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 632(b)(3)\n(a) The deductions entering into the Federal\nadjusted gross income of a nonresident individual with respect to (1) capital\nlosses, (2) 60 percent of the net capital gain on sales and exchanges after\n\nOctober 31, 1978 (50 percent of the net capital gain on sales and exchanges\nbefore November 1, 1978), and (3) net operating losses, are included in the\ncomputation of his New York adjusted gross income only to the extent that the\nitems of income, gain, loss and deduction entered into his Federal adjusted\ngross income and are based solely on items of income, gain, loss or deduction\nderived from or connected with New York State sources. (b) The amount of any deduction under this\nsection must be computed as it would be computed for Federal income tax\npurposes if the New York items of income, gain, loss and deduction were the\nonly items making up the corresponding Federal items of income, gain, loss and\ndeduction for the particular year. (c) (1)\n\nAny\ndeduction computed under this section may, by way of carryback or carryover, affect the computation of New York adjusted gross income for other years as\nlong as such carryback or carryover is based solely on items of income, gain, loss and deduction from New York State sources. Example: Taxpayer A, a nonresident of New York State for the\nentire taxable year 1982, had a long-term capital gain from sources without New\n\nYork State (from the sale of securities) of $20,000 on his Federal income tax\nreturn. A also included on his Federal income tax return a long-term capital\nloss of $8,000 from sources exclusively within New York State (from the sale of\nowned rental property). For Federal income tax purposes, A has a gain from the\nsale or exchange of property of $12,000 ($20,000 minus $8,000). On his New York\n\nState nonresident personal income tax return, A has only a long-term capital\nloss of $8,000 as this is the only capital item derived from New York State\nsources. A is allowed to claim a maximum capital loss deduction of $3,000 on\nhis 1982 New York State nonresident personal income tax return and is allowed a\n$2,000 long-term capital loss carryover for the following year for New York\n\nState personal income tax purposes even though his 1983 Federal income tax\nreturn will show no capital loss carryover. (2)\n(i) Except as otherwise provided for in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a\nnonresident individual who incurs a net operating loss for New York State\npersonal income tax purposes but does not incur a net operating loss for\n\nFederal income tax purposes is required first to carryback such net operating\nloss to each of the three taxable years preceding the taxable year of such net\noperating loss and then to carry such net operating loss forward to each of the\n15 years following the taxable year of such net operating loss, to the extent\nnot absorbed. However, such net operating loss may not be carried back or\ncarried forward to a taxable year in which the nonresident individual was or is\na resident of New York State. (ii)\n\nWhere a nonresident individual incurs a net operating loss for New York State\npersonal income tax purposes but does not incur a net operating loss for\n\nFederal income tax purposes, such nonresident individual may make an election\nfor New York State personal income tax purposes to forego the entire three-year\ncarryback period and to carry such net operating loss forward to each of the 15\nyears following the taxable year of such net operating loss, to the extent not\nabsorbed. This election must be made by filing a New York State nonresident\npersonal income tax return for the year of the net operating loss and attaching\nthereto a statement indicating that this election to forego the three-year\ncarryback period is being made. This election must be made by the due date of\nthe New York State nonresident personal income tax return (including extensions\nof time granted under Part 157 of this Title) for the year of the net operating\nloss. Once an election under this subparagraph to forego the three-year\ncarryback period is made, such election may not be revoked. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
