Tit. 9 § 113.26 - Energy and Environmental Standards and Regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annual benchmarking of energy and water\nusage is required, in a manner required by the office with the first report to\nbe completed and submitted to the office no later than one year after\nregistration and with subsequent reports to be submitted annually to the office\nthereafter. (b) Lighting Standards\nfor indoor cultivation areas. (1)\n\nAll\nhorticultural lighting used in cultivation shall be compliant with standards\nthat are determined by the office and lighting Photosynthetic Photon Efficacy\n(PPE) must be at least 2.2 µmol/J (micromoles per joule). The office is\nauthorized to establish such standards. (2)\n\nRegistered organizations with existing\ncultivation will have one year from the date of adoption of the regulations to\ncomply with this subdivision, unless otherwise approved by the office with good\ncause shown. (3)\nA facility seeking\nto use horticultural lighting not included on the Horticultural QPL or other\nsimilar list, as determined by the Office, shall seek a waiver pursuant to a\nthird-party certification of the energy efficiency features of the proposed\nlighting. (c) Dehumidification. Dehumidification equipment for all new construction shall\ninclude one of the following: (1)\nstand-alone\ndehumidifiers that have a minimum integrated energy factor of 1.77 L/kWh for\nproduct case volumes of 8.0 cubic feet or less, and a minimum integrated energy\nfactor of 2.41 L/kWh for product case volumes greater than 8.0 cubic\nfeet; (2)\nintegrated HVAC system\nwith on-site heat recovery designed to fulfill at least 75 percent of the\nannual energy for dehumidification reheat; (3)\nchilled water system with on-site heat\nrecovery designed to fulfill at least 75 percent of the annual energy for\ndehumidification reheat; or\n(4)\nsolid or liquid desiccant dehumidification system for system designs that\nrequire dewpoint of 50°F or less; or\n(5)\nany other equipment as determined by the\n\nOffice.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Annual benchmarking of energy and water usage is required, using either EPA Energy Portfolio Manager or the Resource Innovation Institute's Cannabis PowerScore, with the first report to be completed and submitted to the\n\nOffice\nno later than one year after registration and with subsequent reports to be submitted annually to the\n\nOffice\nthereafter. (b) Lighting Standards for\nindoor cultivation\nareas. (1)\n\nAll horticultural lighting used in a\nmanufacturing\nfacility shall be listed on the current design lights consortium solid-\nstate\nhorticultural lighting qualified products list (\"Horticultural QPL\") or other similar list as determined by the\n\nOffice\nand lighting\n\nPhotosynthetic Photon Efficacy (PPE)\nmust be at least 2.2 mol/J (micromoles per joule). (2)\n\nRegistered organizations with existing\nmanufacturing\nfacilities will have one year from the date of adoption of the regulations to comply with this subdivision, unless otherwise approved by the\n\nOffice\nwith good cause shown.
