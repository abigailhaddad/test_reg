  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 300.5 - Sharing of patient information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General standard. SHIN-NY participants may only exchange patient\ninformation as authorized by law and consistent with their statewide common\nparticipation agreements. Under section 18(6) of the Public Health Law, individuals who work for a qualified entity or the entity that facilitates\nSHIN-NY participants' connection to the statewide data infrastructure are\ndeemed personnel under contract with a health care provider that is a SHIN-NY\nparticipant. As such, a SHIN-NY participant may disclose to such a qualified\nentity necessary patient information without a written authorization from the\npatient of the SHIN-NY participant. SHIN-NY participants may, but shall not be\nrequired to, provide patients the option to withhold patient information, including minor consent patient information, from the SHIN-NY. Except as set\nforth in paragraph (b)(2) or subdivision (c) of this section, a qualified\nentity shall only allow access to patient information by SHIN-NY participants\nwith a written authorization from: (1)\nthe\npatient; or\n(2)\nwhen the patient\nlacks capacity to consent, from: (i) another\nqualified person under section 18 of the Public Health Law; (ii)\na person with power of attorney whom the\npatient has authorized to access records relating to the provision of health\ncare under General Obligations Law article 5, title 15; or\n(iii)\na person authorized pursuant to law to\nconsent to health care for the individual. (b) Written authorization. (1)\n\nWritten authorizations must be obtained\nusing a statewide form of consent, approved by the New York State Department of\n\nHealth, that allows patients to approve and deny access to information in the\nSHIN-NY by SHIN-NY participants. (i) Patient\ninformation may not be disclosed to persons who, or entities that, become\nSHIN-NY participants subsequent to the execution of a written authorization\nunless: (a) the name or title of the\nindividual or the name of the organization are specified in a new written\nauthorization; or\n(b) the patient's\nwritten authorization specifies that disclosure is authorized to persons or\nentities becoming SHIN-NY participants subsequent to the execution of the\nwritten authorization and the qualified entity has documented that it has\nnotified the patient, or the patient has declined the opportunity to receive\nnotice, of the persons or entities becoming SHIN-NY participants subsequent to\nthe execution of the written authorization. (ii)\n\nAny written authorization shall remain\nin effect until it is revoked in writing or explicitly superseded by a\nsubsequent written authorization. A patient may revoke a written authorization\nin writing at any time by following procedures established by the qualified\nentity consistent with the SHIN-NY policy guidance under subdivision (b) of\nsection\n300.3\nof this Part. (2)\n\nQualified entities shall\npermit access to all of a patient's information by all persons or entities\nauthorized to access information in the SHIN-NY, or any other general\ndesignation of who may access such information, after consent is\nobtained. (3)\nA minor's parent or\nlegal guardian may authorize the disclosure of the minor's patient information, other than minor consent patient information. (4)\n\nMinor consent patient information. (i) In general, a minor's minor consent\npatient information may be disclosed to a SHIN-NY participant if the minor's\nparent or legal guardian has provided authorization for that SHIN-NY\nparticipant to access the minor's patient information through the SHIN-NY. Such\naccess shall be deemed necessary to provide appropriate care or treatment to\nthe minor. However, if federal law or regulation requires the minor's\nauthorization for disclosure of minor consent patient information or if the\nminor is the parent of a child, has married or is otherwise emancipated, the\ndisclosure may not be made without the minor's authorization. (ii)\n\nIn no event may a SHIN-NY participant\ndisclose minor consent patient information to the minor's parent or guardian\nwithout the minor's authorization. (5)\n\nMinor consent patient information\nincludes, but is not limited to patient information concerning: (i) treatment of such patient for sexually\ntransmitted disease or the performance of an abortion as provided in section 17\nof the Public Health Law; (ii)\nthe\ndiagnosis, treatment or prescription for a sexually transmitted disease as\nprovided in section 2305 of the Public Health Law; (iii)\nmedical, dental, health and hospital\nservices relating to prenatal care as provided in section 2504 (3) of the\n\nPublic Health Law; (iv)\nan HIV test\nas provided in section 2781 of the Public Health Law; (v) mental health services as provided in\nsection 33.21 of the Mental Hygiene Law; (vi)\nalcohol and substance abuse treatment as\nprovided in section\n22.11\nof the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw; (vii)\nany patient who is the\nparent of a child or has married as provided in section 2504 of the Public\n\nHealth Law or an otherwise legally emancipated minor; (viii)\ntreatment that a minor has a\nconstitutional right to receive without a parent's or guardian's permission as\ndetermined by courts of competent jurisdiction; (ix)\ntreatment for a minor who is a victim of\nsexual assault as provided in section 2805-i of the Public Health\n\nLaw; (x) emergency care as provided\nin section 2504(4) of the Public Health Law; (xi)\ntreatment provided with the consent of\nno person other than the minor patient, where the patient is a homeless youth\nas defined in section 532-A of the executive law, or receives services at an\napproved runaway and homeless youth crisis services program or transitional\nindependent living support program as defined in section 532-A of the executive\nlaw. (c) Access without written authorization. A qualified entity shall, where permitted by law, allow\naccess to patient information without written authorization when: (1)\n\nPrior consent has already been obtained\nfor the disclosure as required by section 6530 (23) of the Education Law, and\nno provision of law requires any additional written authorization. (2)\n\nDisclosure to the individual entity\naccessing the patient information is: (i) required by law; or\n(ii)\nauthorized\nby law: (a) to a public health authority for\npublic health activities; (b) to a\nhealth oversight agency for health oversight activities; or\n(c) to a federally designated organ\nprocurement organization for purposes of facilitating organ, eye or tissue\ndonation and transplantation. (3)\n\nThe health care provider treating the\npatient, a person acting at the direction of such health care provider, or\nother professional emergency personnel has documented that an emergency\ncondition exists and the patient is in immediate need of medical attention, and\nan attempt to secure consent would result in delay of treatment which would\nincrease the risk to the patient's life or health.
