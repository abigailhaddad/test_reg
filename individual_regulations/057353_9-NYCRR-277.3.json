  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 277.3 - General requirements-claims for relocation payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Documentation. Any claim for a relocation\npayment shall be supported by such documentation as may be reasonably required\nto support expenses incurred, such as bills, certified prices, appraisals, or\nother evidence of such expenses. A displaced person must be provided reasonable\nassistance necessary to complete and file any required claim for\npayment. (b) Expeditious payments. The agency shall review claims in an expeditious manner. The claimant shall be\npromptly notified as to any additional documentation that is required to\nsupport the claim. Payment for a claim shall be made as soon as feasible\nfollowing receipt of sufficient documentation to support the claim. (c) Advance payments. If a person\ndemonstrates the need for an advance relocation payment in order to avoid or\nreduce a hardship, the agency shall authorize the payment, subject to such\nsafeguards as are appropriate to ensure that the objective of the payment is\naccomplished. (d) Time for filing. (1)\n\nAll claims for a relocation payment shall\nbe filed with the agency within 18 months after: (i) for tenants, the date of\ndisplacement; (ii)\nfor owners, the\ndate of displacement or the date of the final payment for the acquisition of\nthe real property, whichever is later. (2)\n\nThis time period shall be waived by the\nagency for good cause. (e) Multiple occupants of one displacement\ndwelling. If two or more occupants of the displacement dwelling move to\nseparate replacement dwellings, each occupant is entitled to a reasonable\nprorated share, as determined by the agency, of any relocation payments that\nwould have been made if the occupants moved together to a comparable\nreplacement dwelling. However, if the agency determines that two or more\noccupants maintained separate households within the same dwelling, such\noccupants have separate entitlements to relocation payments. (f) Deductions from relocation payments. The\nagency shall deduct the amount of any advance relocation payment from the\nrelocation payment(s) to which a displaced person is otherwise entitled. Similarly, the agency may deduct from relocation payments any rent that the\ndisplaced person owes the State; provided that no deduction shall be made if it\nwould prevent the displaced person from obtaining a comparable replacement\ndwelling. The agency shall not withhold any part of a relocation payment to a\ndisplaced person to satisfy an obligation to any other creditor. (g) Notice of denial of claim. If the agency\ndisapproves all or part of a payment claimed or refuses to consider the claim\non its merits because of untimely filing or other grounds, it shall promptly\nnotify the claimant in writing of its determination, the basis for its\ndetermination, and the procedures for appealing that determination.
