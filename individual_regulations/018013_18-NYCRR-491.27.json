(1)\n\nWhen the office revokes or temporarily\nsuspends the operating certificate of a shelter for adults, a small-capacity\nshelter or a shelter for adult families and determines that appointment of a\nreceiver is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the\nresidents of a facility, the office may seek the appointment of a receiver by\napplying to the Supreme Court in the county where the facility is situated for\nan order directing the operators, owners and prime lessors, if any, of the\npremises to show cause why the office or the office's designee should not be\nappointed receiver to take charge of the facility. (2)\n\nThe office shall not be required to seek\nthe appointment of a receiver or to assume the responsibilities of a receiver\ndirectly or indirectly through its designee; nor shall any court be authorized\nto compel the office to assume the responsibilities of a receiver or to appoint\na designee to assume such responsibilities. (3)\n\nThe office may, if it deems appropriate, grant an operating certificate to any facility operating or scheduled to\noperate under a receiver. The duration of the operating certificate shall not\nexceed the duration of the receivership. (4)\n\nAny receiver appointed upon application\nof the office shall have all of the powers and duties of a receiver appointed\nin an action to foreclose a mortgage on real property, together with the\nfollowing additional powers and duties: (i) The receiver shall, with all reasonable speed but, in any case, within six\nmonths after the date on which the receivership was ordered, unless otherwise\nextended by the court, provide for the orderly transfer of all residents in the\nfacility to other facilities or make other provisions for their continued\nsafety and care. (ii)\n\nThe receiver\nshall operate the facility in compliance with regulations of the\noffice. (iii)\n\nThe receiver, with\nthe approval of the office, shall incur expenses as may be necessary to operate\nthe facility. The receiver shall collect incoming payments from all sources and\napply them to the costs incurred in the performance of their functions as\nreceiver. The receiver shall honor all existing leases, mortgages and chattel\nmortgages that have previously been undertaken as obligations of the owners or\noperators of the facility. No security interest in any real or personal\nproperty comprising the facility or contained within the facility, or in any\nfixture of the facility, shall be impaired or diminished by the receiver. The\nreceiver shall compensate the owners of any goods held in inventory for those\ngoods which they use or cause to be used by reimbursing the costs of such\ngoods, except that no such compensation shall be made for any such goods for\nwhich owners have already been reimbursed. (iv)\n\nThe receiver shall not be required to\nfile any bond. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraph (4) of this subdivision and, except in the case where\nthe receiver is assuming an existing bona fide arm's-length lease, the office\nshall determine a reasonable monthly rental for the facility, based on\nconsideration of all appropriate factors, including the condition of such\nfacility. The rent, as determined by the office, shall be paid by the receiver\nto the owners or prime lessors as may be directed by the court for each month\nthat the receivership remains in effect. In the event that the amount\nestablished by the office is less than the currently valid lease, the\nobligation of the operator shall not be altered or diminished. (6)\n\nThe receiver: (i) shall be entitled to a fee and\nreimbursement for expenses as determined by the office, based upon\nconsideration of all appropriate factors relating to the operation of the\nfacility, to be paid as a charge against the operator, not to exceed the fees, commissions and necessary expenses authorized to be paid to receivers in an\naction to foreclose a mortgage; (ii)\nshall be liable only in an official\ncapacity for injury to person and property by reason of conditions of the\nfacility in a case where an owner or operator would have been liable; the\nreceiver shall not have any liability in a personal capacity, except for gross\nnegligence and intentional acts; (iii)\nmay, subject to approval by the office, ratify any collective bargaining agreement in effect between the operator and\nthe employees of a facility, or suspend such collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that the receiver, in an official capacity, remains liable\nfor payment of wages and salaries at the rates and levels in effect at the time\nof their appointment; and\n(iv)\nshall notify the office of any lien or conveyance made in contemplation of\nreceivership with an intent to remove an asset of the facility from the\njurisdiction and use of the receiver, or to hinder or delay the receiver in the\nexecution of their duties and responsibilities as receiver. (7)\n(i) Any person who is served a copy of an\norder of the court appointing the receiver shall, upon being notified of the\nname and address of the receiver, make all payments for goods supplied by the\nfacility, or services rendered by the facility, to the receiver. A receipt\nshall be given for each such payment, and copies of all such receipts shall be\nkept on file by the receiver. The amount so received shall be deposited by the\nreceiver in a special account which shall also be used for all disbursements\nmade by the receiver. (ii)\n\nAny\nperson who refuses or omits to make such payment after such service and notice\nmay be sued therefor by the receiver. Such person shall not in such suit\ndispute the authority of the receiver to incur or order such expenses, or the\nright of the receiver for any such payments made to him or her. The receipt of\nthe receiver for any sum paid to them shall, in all suits and proceedings and\nfor every purpose, be as effectual in favor of any person holding the same as\nactual payment who would have been entitled to receive the sum so paid. No\nresident shall be discharged, nor shall any contract of rights be forfeited or\nimpaired, nor any forfeiture or liability be incurred, by reason of any\nomission to pay any owner, contractor or other person any sum so paid to the\nreceiver. (8)\n\nAll\ntransactions involving the receivership shall be on the accrual basis of\naccounting. (9)\n\nObligations of the\noperators, owners or prime lessors. (i) The\noperators, owners or prime lessors shall not be relieved of any civil or\ncriminal liability or obligation incurred, or any duty imposed by law, by\nreason of acts or omissions of such persons prior to the appointment of any\nreceiver. During the period a facility is operated by a receiver, the operator, owner or prime lessor, if any, shall continue to be liable for all obligations\nfor the payment of taxes or other operating and maintenance expenses of the\nfacility, and the owner or other appropriate person shall continue to be liable\nfor the payment of mortgages or liens. (ii)\n\nExpenses incurred by a receiver to meet\nthe operating and maintenance expenses of the facility and the basic needs of\nthe residents of the facility shall be deemed the obligations of the operator, and not the obligations of the receiver, the office or the State. (iii)\n\nThe receiver shall not be responsible\nfor any obligations incurred by the owner, operator or prime lessor, if any, prior to the appointment of the receiver. (iv)\n\nThe receiver shall be entitled to use\nfor operating and maintenance expenses, and for the basic needs of the\nresidents of the facility, a portion of the revenues due the operator during\nthe month in which the receiver is appointed. This portion shall be established\non the basis of the amounts of the operating and maintenance expenses for such\nmonth. Such amounts shall be prorated by dividing the number of days of the\nreceivership appointment by the number of days in the month. (v) Any sums determined to be due and owing\nby the receiver to the owner, operator or prime lessor shall be offset by any\ncharges determined to be the obligations of the owner, operator or prime\nlessor. (10)\n\nThe court\nshall terminate the receivership only under any of the following circumstances: (i) six months after the date on which it was\nordered, except that the court may extend such period for good cause\nshown; (ii)\nwhen the office grants\nan operator a new operating certificate; or\n(iii)\nat such time as all of the residents in\nthe facility have been provided alternative modes of care, either in another\nfacility or otherwise. (11)\n\nAt the time of termination of the\nreceivership, the receiver shall render a full and complete accounting to the\ncourt and shall dispose of any profit or surplus as instructed by the\ncourt. (12)\n\nPayments to receivers\nappointed upon application of the office. (i) The office is authorized to make payments to a receiver only if the receiver\ndemonstrates to the satisfaction of the office that the facility's funds which\nare available are insufficient to meet operating and maintenance expenses of\nthe facility and the basic needs of the residents of the facility. (ii)\n\nThe operator shall be liable for all\nmonies made available to the receiver pursuant to this paragraph. (iii)\n\nAny payments made by the office to a\nreceiver shall be made without any obligation on the part of the social\nservices district, in which the receiver-operated facility is located, to\nreimburse the office for any such payments. (b) Court-appointed receiver without\napplication of the office. (1)\n\nIn the\nevent of a transfer of possession of the premises of a facility from an\napproved operator to a court-appointed receiver, the office may authorize such\ncourt-appointed receiver to continue to operate the facility for a temporary\nperiod pending the filing and review of an application to the office by the\nreceiver or by another person for an operating certificate. (2)\n\nSuch temporary authorization shall be\ngranted and continued only if the court-appointed receiver agrees to and\ncomplies with the terms and conditions set by the office. Such terms and\nconditions shall include: (i) operation of\nthe facility in compliance with the regulations of the office; (ii)\na waiver by the receiver of any\nassessment of fees against the office, the commissioner, and the\n\nState; (iii)\nsubmission of a\nstatement of intention to apply or not to apply for certification as operator\nof the facility within 15 days after transfer of possession to the\nreceiver; (iv)\nif the receiver\nindicates an intention to apply for an operating certificate, submission of an\napplication for an operating certificate within 90 days after the transfer of\npossession to the receiver, unless the time for such filing is extended by the\noffice; and\n(v) if the receiver\nindicates no intention to apply for an operating certificate, agreement to\ncooperate fully with potential operators and the office in the orderly transfer\nof the facility to a certified operator or to provide for the orderly transfer\nof all residents in the facility to other facilities or make other provisions\nfor their continued safety and care. (3)\n\nThe office may make application to appear\nand advise the court of any objections it may have to the transfer of\npossession from the approved operator to any other persons, including a\nreceiver, or of any objections it may have to continuing a receiver or any\nother person in possession.
