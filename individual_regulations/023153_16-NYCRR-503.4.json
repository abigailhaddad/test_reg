  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 503.4 - Quantity of supply\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Quantity of\nsupply. Every water corporation will file with the department a copy of its\nemergency plan for maintaining a reasonable supply of water during a drought or\nother emergency affecting the maintenance and delivery of a safe and adequate\nsupply of potable water. A water corporation may submit a copy of the plan\nfiled with and approved by the State Department of Health pursuant to 10 NYCRR\n5-1.33. The plan will include provisions for implementing water use\nrestrictions and other conservation measures and for utilizing alternate and\nexisting or potential emergency supplies. (b) Surface sources. Each water corporation\nthat employs a surface source of supply shall comply with the provisions of the\n\nTen State Standards, with the additional requirement that the maximum projected\ndemand shall take into consideration forecasted growth or decline in both the\nnumber of customers and in system usage for at least a 10-year period into the\nfuture. Also, such projections shall be updated on an ongoing basis and where\nthey show that demand will exceed supply, the water corporation shall undertake\nall reasonable efforts to reduce and control future demands to bring them into\nbalance with supply. If appropriate, the water corporation shall develop plans, consistent with existing State requirements, to secure additional\nsupply. (c) Groundwater sources. Each water corporation that employs groundwater sources of supply shall comply\nwith the appropriate provisions of the Ten State Standards with the additional\nrequirement that the numbers used for design average and maximum day demand\nshall reflect a projection of growth or decline in the number of customers and\nin system usage for at least a 10-year period into the future. Also, such\nprojections shall be updated on an ongoing basis and where they show that\ndemand will exceed supply the water corporation shall begin measures to control\ndemand or, if appropriate, secure additional supply. (d) Monitoring requirements. (1)\n\nSurface sources. Each water corporation\nshall submit to the department for approval as soon as possible, but no later\nthan one year after the effective date of these standards, a plan to monitor\nsource capacity and establish warning levels for declining source capacity. The\nplan's warning levels should be based upon original design demand and\nhistorical source levels so as to provide a warning when the source capacity\nfalls below design capacity. Once the plan is implemented, which must occur no\nlater than two years after the effective date of these standards, daily records\nshall be kept indicating source level or capacity, date, and location of\nreading for each source. The department shall be notified within one business\nday whenever the source level falls below the established warning\nlevels. (2)\n\nGroundwater sources. Each water corporation having a groundwater source shall equip each of its well\npumps with a timing device which indicates time operated on a 24-hour basis. Each company shall have the resources to meter the discharge of each well under\nnormal operating conditions. Readings shall be taken and recorded on a daily\nbasis and shall indicate the discharge of each well or group of wells on a\ncommon discharge line, time of operation, well identification, date and time of\nday recorded. The chart produced by an automatic flow recording device shall be\nsufficient to satisfy this requirement. For the purposes of this rule, a group\nof wells from which water is withdrawn by a common source of suction shall be\nconsidered a single well. Production meters shall be calibrated every two\nyears. At least once every three years each water corporation will conduct\ntests to determine the specific capacity of each well authorized for use and\nthe actual capacity of each well's pump. As used in this Part, specific\ncapacity shall refer to the yield of a well in gallons per minute per foot of\ndrawdown. The results of these tests will be reported to the department within\n10 business days if the specific capacity results indicate a 10 percent or\ngreater decrease in specific capacity as compared with rated specific capacity\nor if the well pump capacity is less than 80 percent of the design rated\ncapacity. The rated specific capacity of each source will be reported to this\ndepartment within three months of enactment of these standards. Any changes in\nrated specific capacity of any source must be reported to this department\nwithin 10 business days. (3)\n\nAdditional monitoring requirements - total production. The average day design\ndemand and maximum day design demand will be reported to this department within\nthree months of enactment of these standards. The department will also be\nnotified whenever: (i) actual maximum day\nproduction exceeds maximum day design demand; or\n(ii)\nactual average day production exceeds\naverage day design demand on an annual basis.
