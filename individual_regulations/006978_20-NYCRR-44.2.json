  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 44.2 - Classes of utilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\nthe first class is \"every utility doing business in this State which is subject\nto the supervision of the State Department of Public Service,\" except a utility\n\"engaged in the business of operating or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad\ncars or of operating railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway\nand elevated railroads\". Such utilities are taxable on gross income. Utilities\nin this class are mainly street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated\nrailroads, and all other nonoperating railroads which lease their property to\nothers, omnibus lines, gas, electric, steam, water, telephone, telegraph, bridge, express, baggage, transfer and freight terminal companies. However, the\nlaw exempts motor carriers or brokers subject to the supervision of the State\n\nDepartment of Public Service under article 3-b of the Public Service Law. This\nprovision does not exempt motor carriers or brokers who are subject to such\nsupervision under other provisions of law. (b) (1)\n\nIn\nthe second class, is \"every other utility doing business in this state\", which\nincludes every \"person\" (as defined in the law) \"engaged in the business of\noperating one or more omnibuses having a seating capacity of more than seven\npassengers, and every person * * * who sells gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy, delivered through mains, pipes or\nwires, or furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or\ntelegraph service, by means of mains, pipes, or wires; regardless of whether\nsuch activities are the main business of such person or are only incidental\nthereto, or of whether use is made of the public streets\". Such utilities are\ntaxable on gross operating income. The word person is defined as \"persons, corporations, companies, associations, joint-stock associations, co-partnerships, estates, assignee of rents, any person acting in a fiduciary\ncapacity, or any other entity, and persons, their assignees, lessees, trustees\nor receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, or by any other means, except\nthe State, municipalities, political and civil subdivisions of the State or\nmunicipality, and public districts\". (2)\n\nUtilities in the second class are mainly\nthose which, generally speaking, would not be classed as utilities but which\nare made utilities by statute for the purpose of this tax. Ordinarily, although\nthere are exceptions, such as omnibuses, utilities in this group resell utility\nservices which are purchased from utilities in the first class. (3)\n\nThe following questions and answers are\nillustrative of utilities in this class: Question 1:Is the owner or lessee of a hotel, apartment\nhouse or office building, who purchases gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration or telephony and resells any part of all of the same to tenants, subject to tax?

Question 3:Is a mutual telephone company, not subject to\npublic service regulation, subject to tax? Answer: Yes. Question 4:Is a hotel subject to tax where it supplies\ntelephone services to its guests and makes a charge therefor? Answer: Yes. Question 5:A stock quotation company sells telegraph ticker\nservice to brokers in various localities, using wires leased from a telegraph\ncompany.
