  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.623 - Maximum and minimum allowable operating pressure: low-pressure distribution systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person\nmay operate a low-pressure distribution system at a pressure high enough to\nmake unsafe the operation of any connected and properly adjusted low-pressure\ngas burning equipment. (b) No\nperson may operate a low-pressure distribution system at a pressure lower than\nthe minimum pressure at which the safe and continuing operation of any\nconnected and properly adjusted low-pressure gas burning equipment can be\nassured. (c) Each operator shall\nmaintain a pressure throughout its low-pressure distribution systems, as\nmeasured at the consumer's end of the service line, of not less than four\ninches nor more than 12 inches of water column gauge. (d) The maximum daily pressure variation\nshall not exceed a total range of 50 percent of the maximum gauge pressure\nexperienced during the day at any point in the low-pressure distribution\nsystem, as measured at the consumer's end of the service line. Overpressure\nprotection devices may be set at levels above the normal maximum operating\npressure. The capacity of overpressure protection devices shall be sufficient\nto prevent a pressure buildup in excess of two psig (14 kPa) on the\nlow-pressure distribution system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.623\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
