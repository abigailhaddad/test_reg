  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 351.28 - Home visits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A visit to the home of an applicant for or recipient of Aid to Dependent\n\nChildren (ADC) or Home Relief (HR) may be conducted by an official of the\nsocial services district as part of an investigation into eligibility or\ncontinuing eligibility for such assistance. The visit may be conducted with\nadvance notice that a visit may take place, or without advance notice in the\ncircumstance described in subdivision (b) of this section. A home visit must\nordinarily be conducted only during the normal business hours of the social\nservices district or during daylight hours, unless the circumstances of the\napplicant or recipient make such time impractical. The social services official\nconducting such visit must properly identify himself or herself. (b) A visit to the home of an applicant for\nor a recipient of ADC or HR by an official of the social services district may\nbe conducted without advance notice to the applicant or recipient when the\ndistrict has information that is inconsistent with or fails to support\npertinent information reported by the applicant or recipient during the\neligibility or redetermination of eligibility process, when the applicant or\nrecipient fails to provide information pertinent to the eligibility or\nredetermination of eligibility process that he or she would reasonably be\nexpected to provide or when it appears that information provided by the\napplicant or recipient during the eligibility or redetermination of eligibility\nprocess is false. Examples of such circumstances include, but are not limited\nto: where the landlord does not verify the household composition or provides\ninformation which is inconsistent with the information in the application; where the household's stated expenses exceed the stated income or the current\ngrant without a reasonable explanation; where there is no information\nconcerning a parent who is alleged to be absent from the home or the\ninformation is inconsistent with the information in the application; where the\napplication is inconsistent with prior case information in the district's\npossession; or where the application contains inconsistent information that\nwould affect eligibility for ADC or HR. (c) Consent by the applicant or recipient to\na visit must not be considered to be permission to search the premises. The\nofficial may question the applicant or recipient about people or objects in\nplain view on the premises. (d) Failure by the applicant to cooperate during an unscheduled visit or to permit\nsuch visit is not a basis for a discontinuance or denial of assistance. An\nofficial conducting an unscheduled visit must not indicate or lead the\napplicant or recipient to believe that failure to cooperate or to permit the\nvisit will be a basis for denying or discontinuing benefits.
