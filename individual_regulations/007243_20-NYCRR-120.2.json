  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 120.2 - Limitations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 620(b)\n\nThe amount of the credit against ordinary tax for income\ntax imposed by another jurisdiction is subject to the limitations provided in\nthis section. Where credit is claimed against ordinary tax for income taxes\nimposed by two or more taxing jurisdictions, as defined in section\n120.1\n(b)(2)\nof this Part, these limitations must be applied separately to each jurisdiction\nfor each credit being claimed. See section\n120.3\nof this Part for the limitations in cases where such credit is claimed for\nincome taxes imposed by both a state and one or more of its political\nsubdivisions. (a) The credit for the\ntaxable year cannot exceed the income tax payable to the other jurisdiction. When both a state (other than New York State) and one or more of its political\nsubdivisions impose income taxes on the same or different amounts of income\nderived from sources within such state as defined in section\n120.4\n(d) of this Part, see section\n120.3\nof this Part. If a taxpayer on his or her New York State personal income tax\nreturn claims a credit pursuant to this Part for the income tax or taxes (or\nany portion thereof) of another jurisdiction, and it is later determined that\nthe amount of such tax or taxes (or the portion for which credit was claimed)\nis more or less than the amount of credit claimed with respect to such tax or\ntaxes on the taxpayer's New York State personal income tax return, he or she\nmust file an amended New York State personal income tax return at the address\nindicated on the form and in the instructions. (b) The credit for the taxable year cannot\nexceed the amount obtained by multiplying the New York State tax payable (see\nsection\n120.4\n[b]\nof this Part) by a percentage determined by dividing the portion of the\ntaxpayer's New York income subject to taxation in such other jurisdiction (the\nnumerator) by the taxpayer's total New York income (the denominator). (c) The credit for the taxable year cannot\nreduce the New York State tax payable to an amount less than would have been\ndue if the income subject to taxation by the other jurisdiction was excluded\nfrom the taxpayer's New York income. (d) When a taxpayer elects to claim the\nforeign tax credit for Federal income tax purposes, the resident credit for\nincome tax imposed by a province of Canada will be allowed for the portion of\nthe Canadian provincial tax that is not claimed for Federal income tax purposes\nfor the taxable year or a preceding taxable year. If any amount of such portion\nof the Canadian provincial tax is claimed for Federal purposes in a succeeding\ntaxable year, the amount claimed must be added back for New York State purposes\nin such succeeding taxable year. The Canadian provincial tax will be treated as\nbeing claimed last for Federal income tax purposes and for purposes of this\nsubdivision. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
