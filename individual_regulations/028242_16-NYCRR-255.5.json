Tit. 16 § 255.5 - Class locations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as\nprovided in paragraphs (d)(2) and (e)(2) of this section, the class location is\ndetermined by the number of buildings intended for human occupancy in the class\nlocation unit. The class location unit is an area that extends 220 yards\n(201.17 meters) on either side of the centerline of any continuous one-mile\n(1.61 kilometers) length of pipeline. For the purposes of this section, each\nseparate dwelling unit in a multiple dwelling building is counted as a separate\nbuilding intended for human occupancy. (b) A Class 1 location is any class location\nunit that has 10 or fewer buildings intended for human occupancy. (c) A Class 2 location is any class location\nunit that has more than 10 but fewer than 46 buildings intended for human\noccupancy. (d) A Class 3 location\nis: (1)\nany class location unit that has 46 or\nmore buildings intended for human occupancy; or\n(2)\nany area where the pipeline lies within\n100 yards (91.44 meters) of either a building or a small, well defined outside\narea that is occupied by 20 or more persons during normal use (such as a\nplayground, recreation area, outdoor theater, or other place of public\nassembly). (e) A Class 4\nlocation is: (1)\nany class location unit that\nhas 100 or more buildings intended for human occupancy and where wall to wall\npavement is prevalent; or\n(2)\nany\nclass location unit where buildings with four or more stories aboveground are\nprevalent. (f) The\nboundaries of the class location unit determined in accordance with\nsubdivisions (a) through (e) of this section may be extended according to the\nfollowing.

(2)\n\nWhen the number of\nbuildings with four or more stories requires a Class 4 location, the class\nlocation unit ends 220 yards (201.17 meters) from the nearest building with\nfour or more stories.
