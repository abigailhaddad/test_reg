Except as provided in section\n25.14\nof this Part, vacancies in\npositions in the competitive class shall be filled, as far as practicable, by\npromotion from among persons holding, at the time of the examination for\npromotion or at the time of appointment, competitive class positions on a\npermanent basis in a lower title in the promotion unit in which the vacancy\nexists, provided that such lower-titled positions are in direct line of\npromotion, as determined by the Chief Administrator of the Courts; except that\nwhere the Chief Administrator determines that it is impracticable or against\nthe public interest to limit eligibility for promotion to persons holding\nlower-titled positions in direct line of promotion, the Chief Administrator may\nextend eligibility for promotion to persons holding competitive class positions\nin lower titles which the Chief Administrator determines to be in related or\ncollateral lines of promotion, or in any comparable positions in the Unified\n\nCourt System. The Chief Administrator may prescribe minimum training and\nexperience qualifications for eligibility to take a promotion examination and\nfor promotion. (b) Factors in promotion. Promotion shall be based on merit and fitness as\ndetermined by examination, due weight being given to seniority. The previous\ntraining and experience of the candidates, and performance ratings where\navailable, may be considered and given due weight as factors in determining the\nrelative merit and fitness of candidates for promotion. (c) Promotion eligibility of\npersons on preferred lists and employees on leave of absence. Any employee who\nhas been suspended from his or her position through no fault of his or her own\nand whose name is on a preferred list, and any employee on leave of absence\nfrom his or her position, shall be allowed to compete in a promotion\nexamination for which he or she would otherwise be eligible on the basis of his\nor her actual service before suspension or leave of absence. (d) General and promotion unit\neligible lists. Promotion examinations may be held for such subdivisions of the\n\nUnified Court System as the Chief Administrator may determine to be appropriate\npromotion units. No general promotion eligible list shall be certified for any\npromotion unit until after the promotion unit eligible list for that promotion\nunit has been exhausted. (e) Promotion by noncompetitive\nexamination. (1)\n\nWhenever there\nare no more than three persons eligible for examination for promotion to a\nvacant competitive class position, or whenever no more than three persons file\napplications for examination for promotion to such position, one of such\npersons may be nominated and, upon passing an examination appropriate to the\nduties and responsibilities of the position, may be promoted. Any person who is\nnominated for noncompetitive examination for promotion to such position and who\nfails to pass two examinations for such promotion shall not thereafter be\neligible for employment in such position, except by appointment or promotion\nfrom and eligible list established following competitive examination. (2)\n\nAn examination may be\nwaived for noncompetitive promotion where the nominee has already qualified in\nan examination appropriate to the duties and responsibilities of the\nposition. (f) Limitation upon promotion. No person\nshall be promoted to a position or title for which there is required an\nexamination involving essential tests or qualifications different from or\nhigher than those required for the position or title held by such person unless\nhe or she has passed the examination and is eligible for appointment to such\nhigher position or title. (g) Credit for provisional service. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, no credit in a promotion examination shall\nbe granted to any person for any time served as a provisional appointee in the\nposition to which promotion is sought or in any similar position; provided, however, such provisional appointee by reason of such provisional appointment\nshall receive credit in such person's permanent position from which promotion\nis sought for such time served in such provisional appointment. (2)\nA provisional appointee, appointed in accordance with section\n25.25\nof this Part, who receives a\npermanent appointment to the same title immediately following the provisional\nappointment, shall have all time spent as a provisional appointee in such title\ncredited towards the qualifications required to take a promotional examination\nas well as eligibility for appointment from the resulting eligible list. Such\ntime credited pursuant to this subparagraph shall be used only for the purposes\nof any term that is required for a promotional examination and eligibility for\nappointment from the resulting eligible list and shall not be used for any\nother purpose. (h) Extension of promotion examinations. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Part, the Chief Administrator of\nthe Courts may, for designated titles: (1)\nextend to employees in the Unified\n\nCourt System who are holding or who have held a position in the noncompetitive, exempt or labor class of such service, the same opportunity as employees in the\ncompetitive class to take promotion examinations (i) if said employees in the\npast have held qualifying competitive class positions for that examination on a\npermanent basis, or (ii) if such examinations are to be held in conjunction\nwith open competitive examinations; and\n(2)\nextend to employees in the Unified\n\nCourt System who are holding or who have held a position in the noncompetitive\nclass pursuant to the provisions of section\n25.16\n(b) of this\n\nPart, or to disabled veterans of the Vietnam era as defined in section\n85\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law, the same opportunities to take promotion examinations as\nprovided to employees in the competitive class. (i) Appointment or promotion to\nnoncompetitive or exempt positions from competitive positions. An employee\nholding a permanent position in the competitive class who accepts an\nappointment or promotion to a position in the noncompetitive or exempt class, and to any successive positions in either of those classes, shall be eligible\nto return to his or her former competitive class position, in the manner\nprovided herein, upon termination of employment in the noncompetitive or exempt\nposition for reasons other than misconduct or incompetency. Upon such\ntermination, and upon request, the name of the employee shall be placed on a\npreferred list for his or her former position pursuant to section\n25.31\nof this Part, and the\nemployee shall be eligible for reinstatement from such preferred list for a\nperiod of four years.
