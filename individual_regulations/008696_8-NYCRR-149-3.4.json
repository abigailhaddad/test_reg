  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 149-3.4 - Allowable costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A school\ndistrict shall use the funds required to be set aside under paragraph h of\nsubdivision 12 of section\n3602\nof the\n\nEducation Law for the assignment of additional teachers in sufficient numbers\nto reduce, within limits of the setaside, the class size in grades one, two and\nthree to a maximum class size of 24 pupils each or for the establishment of a\ncomprehensive continuum of developmentally appropriate programs for pupils from\nkindergarten to grade three which shall include: manageable learning group\nsizes to insure proper individualized age-appropriate programming; an\nintegrated curriculum and assessment program in grades one, two and three with\nassociated staff development; and opportunities for meaningful parent\nparticipation in the planning and implementation of day to day activities. In\nthe event that a school district cannot, in particular school buildings, meet\nthe class size requirements due to severe physical plant limitations, or where\nimplementation of such class size would result in multiple classes of fewer\nthan 18 pupils, a teacher assistant may be provided to increase the adult to\npupil ratio in grades one, two and three in lieu of the assignment of\nadditional teachers. (b) Alternative allowable costs. After meeting the requirements of subdivision (a)\nof this section, a school district may use the remaining portion of the\nsetaside for programs, such as establishing early childhood centers for grades\nkindergarten through two, or assigning additional teachers or teacher\nassistants for the purposes of increasing individualized attention for those\npupils who are experiencing learning difficulties in grades one, two and\nthree.
