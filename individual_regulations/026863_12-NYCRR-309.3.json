  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 309.3 - Livery drivers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Independent livery drivers. (1)\nA livery\ndriver is an independent livery driver when he or she is licensed to drive a\nlivery by the appropriate governing taxi and limousine commission and is\ndispatched by an independent livery base with which he or she is affiliated. An\nindependent livery driver also includes a person who is operating a vehicle\nthat is affiliated with a member of the Black Car Operators' Injury\n\nCompensation Fund when that person is dispatched by an independent livery\nbase. (2)\n\nAn independent livery\ndriver that sustains injury as a result of the use or operation of a livery\nduring a dispatch by an independent livery base shall be eligible to receive\nany benefits for which such driver is eligible under Insurance Law article 51\nand shall not be entitled to workers' compensation benefits except as set forth\nin Executive Law section 160-ddd and paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nWorkers'\ncompensation benefits shall be provided by the fund for independent livery\ndrivers dispatched by independent livery bases for deaths of such drivers\narising out of and in the course of providing covered services, and all\ninjuries sustained by such drivers arising out of and in the course of\nproviding covered services either: (i) resulting from a crime committed against such livery driver as evidenced by a\npolice report; or\n(ii)\nresulting in\nthe following conditions: (a) amputation or\nphysical loss of an arm, leg, hand, foot, multiple fingers, index finger, multiple toes, ear or nose; (b) paraplegia or quadriplegia; or\n(c) total and permanent blindness or deafness. (4)\n\nWorkers' compensation benefits shall not\nbe provided by the fund if the independent livery driver was not performing\ncovered services or was in violation of the rules and regulations of the\ngoverning taxi and limousine commission regarding the solicitation or picking\nup of passengers at the time the crime was committed against him or her or when\nhis or her death or injury occurred. (5)\n\nAll claims of independent livery drivers\nfor workers' compensation benefits as provided in Executive Law, section 160-d\ndd and paragraph (3) of this subdivision must be filed in this State with the\nboard, regardless of the location of the incident. (6)\n\nAn independent livery driver that may be\nentitled to workers' compensation benefits as provided in Executive Law, section 160-d dd and paragraph (3) of this subdivision, or someone on his or\nher behalf, must provide written notice to the fund in accordance with Workers'\nCompensation Law, section 18. (7)\n\nPresumptive wages. (i) Independent livery\ndrivers are presumed to receive annual wages of $13,000 for an average weekly\nwage of $250. An independent livery driver or the fund may rebut the\npresumptive annual or average weekly wage by submitting competent evidence to\nthe board that the independent livery driver's actual wages for covered\nservices were different. Competent evidence includes State or Federal income\ntax returns or financial or business records of comparable probative value to\nincome tax returns. State or Federal income tax returns which should have been\nfiled as of the date of the injury or death but had not then been filed shall\nnot be sufficient to overcome the presumptive wage without other evidence. The\nboard shall evaluate any other evidence of earnings in light of its probative\nvalue and reliability. (ii)\n\nFor\ndeaths and injuries occurring on or after July 1, 2011, and on or after July\n1st of each succeeding year, the presumptive wage shall increase by the\npercentage increase in the New York State average weekly wage between the year\nin which it is reported and the previous year. If there is no increase in the\n\nNew York State average weekly wage in a particular year, then the presumptive\nwage shall remain unchanged. (b) A livery driver that is not an\nindependent livery driver is not entitled to any benefits from the fund but is\ndeemed an employee of the livery base with which he or she is affiliated and\nworkers' compensation benefits shall be paid for any death or injury arising\nout of and in the course of employment as provided by the Workers' Compensation\n\nLaw.
