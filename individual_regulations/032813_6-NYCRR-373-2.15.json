  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.15 - Incinerators\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations of this section apply to owners and operators of hazardous waste\nincinerators (as defined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle), except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (2)\n\nAdditional regulations governing construction and operation of incinerators for\npurposes of air pollution control are set forth in Parts 200, 201, 212, 219, 225, 227 and 257 of this Title. (3)\n\nIntegration of the MACT standards. (i) Except\nas provided by subparagraphs (ii) through (v) of this paragraph, the standards\nof this Subpart: (a) do not apply to a new\nhazardous waste incineration unit that becomes subject to Part 373 permit\nrequirements after October 12, 2005; or\n(b) no longer apply when an owner or operator\nof an existing hazardous waste incineration unit demonstrates compliance with\nthe maximum achievable control technology (MACT) requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to\nthe department a Notification of Compliance under\n40 CFR sections\n63.1207(j)\nand\n63.1210(d)\nof subpart EEE documenting compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title. (ii)\n\nPart\n373 permit conditions that were based on the standards of this Subpart will\ncontinue to be in effect until they are removed from the permit or the permit\nis terminated or revoked, unless the permit expressly provides\notherwise. (iii)\n\nThe MACT standards\ndo not replace the closure requirements of subdivision (h) of this section or\nthe applicable requirements of sections\n373-2.1\n\"\"373-2.8, 373-2.28 and\n373-2.29 of this Subpart. (iv)\n\nThe\nparticulate matter standard of paragraph (d)(3) of this section remains in\neffect for incinerators that elect to comply with the alternative to the\nparticulate matter standard under\n40\nCFR section\n63.1206(b)(14)\nand\n63.1219(e)\nof subpart EEE, as incorporated by reference in and implemented by section\n200.10(a) and (d) of this Title. (v) The following requirements remain in\neffect for startup, shutdown, and malfunction events if the owner or operator\nelects to comply with section\n373-1.12\n(a)(1)(i)\nof this Part to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from these events: (a) paragraph (f)(1) of this section\nrequiring that an incinerator operate in accordance with operating requirements\nspecified in the permit; and\n(b) paragraph (f)(3) of this section requiring compliance with the emission\nstandards and operating requirements during startup and shutdown if hazardous\nwaste is in the combustion chamber, except for particular hazardous\nwastes. (4)\n\nAfter consideration of the waste analysis included with the permit application, the commissioner, in establishing the permit conditions, must exempt the\napplicant from all requirements of this section except subdivisions (b) (waste\nanalysis) and (h) (closure): (i) if the\ncommissioner finds that the waste to be burned is: (a) listed as a hazardous waste in section\n371.4\nof this Title, solely because\nit is ignitable (Hazard Code I), corrosive (Hazard Code C), or both; or\n(b) listed as a hazardous waste\nin section\n371.4\nof this Title, solely because\nit is reactive (Hazard Code R) for characteristics other than those listed in\nsection\n371.3\n(d)(1)(iv) and\n(v) of this Title, and will not be burned\nwhen other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; or\n(c) a hazardous waste solely because it\npossesses the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or both, as\ndetermined by the test for characteristics of hazardous wastes under section\n371.3\nof this Title; or\n(d) a hazardous waste solely because it\npossesses any of the reactivity characteristics described by section\n371.3\n(d)(1)(i), (ii), (iii), (vi), (vii) and\n(viii)\nof this Title, and will not be burned\nwhen other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; and\n(ii)\nif the waste\nanalysis shows that the waste contains none of the hazardous constituents\nlisted in Appendix 23 (see Part 371) of this Title, which would reasonably be\nexpected to be in the waste. (5)\n\nIf the waste to be burned is one which is\ndescribed by clause (3)(i)(\na\n), (\nb\n), (\nc\n) or (\nd\n) of this subdivision and contains\ninsignificant concentrations of the hazardous constituents listed in Appendix\n23 of this Title, then the commissioner may, in establishing permit conditions, exempt the applicant from all requirements of this section, except subdivisions\n(b) (waste analysis) and (h) (closure), after consideration of the waste\nanalysis included with the permit application, unless the commissioner finds\nthat the waste will pose a threat to human health and the environment when\nburned in an incinerator. (6)\n\nThe\nowner or operator of an incinerator may conduct trial burns, subject only to\nthe requirements of section\n373-1.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (b) Waste\nanalysis. (1)\n\nAs a portion of the\ntrial burn plan required by section\n373-1.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart, or with the Part 373 permit application, the owner or operator must have\nincluded an analysis of the waste feed sufficient to provide all information\nrequired by section\n373-1.9\n(a)(2)\nor\n373-1.5\n(f) of this\n\nPart. Owners or operators of new hazardous waste incinerators must provide the\ninformation required by section\n373-1.9\n(a)(3)\nor\n373-1.5\n(f) to the\ngreatest extent possible. (2)\n\nThroughout normal operation, the owner or operator must conduct sufficient\nwaste analysis to verify that waste feed to the incinerator is within the\nphysical and chemical composition limits specified in the permit (under\nparagraph [f][2] of this section). (c) Principal organic hazardous\nconstituents (POHC's). (1)\n\nPrincipal\norganic hazardous constituents (POHC's) in the waste feed must be treated to\nthe extent required by the performance standard of subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (2)\n(i) One or more POHC's will be specified in\nthe facility's permit, from among those constituents listed in Appendix 23 (see\n\nPart 371) of this Title, for each waste feed to be burned. This specification\nwill be based on the degree of difficulty of incineration of the organic\nconstituents in the waste and on their concentration or mass in the waste feed, considering the results of waste analyses and trial burns or alternative data\nsubmitted with the facility's Part 373 permit application. Organic constituents\nwhich represent the greatest degree of difficulty of incineration will be those\nmost likely to be designated as POHC's. Constituents are more likely to be\ndesignated as POHC's if they are present in large quantities or concentrations\nin the waste. (ii)\n\nTrial POHC's\nwill be designated for performance of trial burns in accordance with the\nprocedure specified in section\n373-1.9\nof this Part for obtaining\ntrial burn permits. (d) Performance standards. An incinerator burning hazardous waste must be designed, constructed and maintained so that, when operated in accordance with operating\nrequirements specified under subdivision (f) of this section, it will meet the\nfollowing performance standards: (1)\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, an incinerator burning hazardous waste must achieve a\ndestruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.99 percent for each principal\norganic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated (under subdivision [c] of this\nsection) in its permit for each waste feed. DRE is determined for each POHC\nfrom the following equation: DRE=(W\nin-\nW\nout\n)\n×-100%/W\nin\n\nWhere: W\nin\n= Mass feed rate of one\nprincipal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) in the waste stream feeding the\nincinerator; and\nW\nout\n= Mass emission rate of the\nsame POHC present in exhaust emissions prior to release to the\natmosphere. (ii)\n\nAn\nincinerator burning hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 or F027 must\nachieve a destruction and removal efficiency (DRE) of 99.9999 percent for each\nprincipal organic hazardous constituent (POHC) designated under subdivision (c)\nof this section in its permit. This performance must be demonstrated on POHC's\nthat are more difficult to incinerate than tetra, penta, and\nhexachlorodibenzo-p dioxins and dibenzofurans. DRE is determined for each POHC\nfrom the equation in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. In addition, the owner\nor operator of the incinerator must notify the department of the intent to\nincinerate hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 or F027. (2)\n\nAn incinerator\nburning hazardous waste and producing stack emissions of more than 1.8\nkilograms per hour (four pounds per hour) of hydrogen chloride (HCl) must\ncontrol HCl emissions such that the rate of emission is no greater than the\nlarger of either 1.8 kilograms per hour or one percent of the HCl in the stack\ngas prior to entering any pollution control equipment. (3)\n\nAn incinerator burning hazardous waste\nmust not emit particulate matter in excess of 180 milligrams per dry standard\ncubic meter (0.08 grains per dry standard cubic foot) when corrected for the\namount of oxygen in the stack gas according to the formula: P\nc\n=P\nm\n×- 14/\n21-Y\nWhere P\nc\nis the corrected\nconcentration of particulate matter, P\nm\nis the measured\nconcentration of particulate matter, and Y is the measured concentration of\noxygen in the stack gas, using the Orsat method for oxygen analysis of dry flue\ngas. This method is presented in 40 CFR part\n60, Appendix A (Method 3) (see 6\nNYCRR\n370.1\n[e]). This correction procedure is to be used by all hazardous waste\nincinerators except those operating under conditions of oxygen enrichment. For\nthese facilities, the commissioner will select an appropriate correction\nprocedure to be specified in the facility permit. (4)\n\nFor purposes of permit enforcement, compliance with the operating requirements specified in the permit (under\nsubdivision [f] of this section) will be regarded as compliance with this\nsubdivision. However, evidence that compliance with those permit conditions is\ninsufficient to ensure compliance with the performance requirements of this\nsection may be \"information\" justifying modification, revocation or reissuance\nof a permit under section\n373-1.7\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (e) Hazardous\nwaste incinerator permits. (1)\n\nThe\nowner or operator of a hazardous waste incinerator may burn only wastes\nspecified in the permit, and only under operating conditions specified for\nthose wastes under subdivision (f) of this section, except: (i) in approved trial burns under section\n373-1.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart; or\n(ii)\nunder exemptions in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (2)\n\nOther hazardous wastes may be burned only\nafter operating conditions have been specified in a new permit or a permit\nmodification as applicable. Operating requirements for new wastes may be based\non either trial burn results or alternative data included with a permit\napplication under section\n373-1.5\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nThe permit for a new\nhazardous waste incinerator must establish appropriate conditions for each of\nthe applicable requirements of this section, including but not limited to\nallowable waste feeds and operating conditions necessary to meet the\nrequirements of subdivision (f) of this section, sufficient to comply with the\nfollowing standards: (i) For the period\nbeginning with initial introduction of hazardous waste to the incinerator and\nending with initiation of the trial burn, and only for the minimum time\nrequired to establish operating conditions required in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, not to exceed a duration of 720 hours' operating time for\ntreatment of hazardous waste, the operating requirements must be those most\nlikely to ensure compliance with the performance standards of subdivision (d)\nof this section. The commissioner may extend the duration of this period once\nfor up to 720 additional hours when good cause for the extension is\ndemonstrated by the applicant. (ii)\n\nFor the duration of the trial burn, the operating requirements must be\nsufficient to demonstrate compliance with the performance standards of\nsubdivision (d) of this section and must be in accordance with the approved\ntrial burn plan. (iii)\n\nFor the\nperiod immediately following completion of the trial burn and only for the\nminimum period sufficient to allow sample analysis, data computation and\nsubmission of the trial burn results by the applicant, and review of the trial\nburn results and modification of the facility permit by the commissioner, the\noperating requirements must be those most likely to ensure compliance with the\nperformance standards of subdivision (d) of this section. (iv)\n\nFor the remaining duration of the\npermit, the operating requirements must be those demonstrated in a trial burn\nor by alternative data specified in section\n373-1.5\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Part, as sufficient to ensure compliance with the performance standards of\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (f) Operating requirements. (1)\n\nAn incinerator must be operated in\naccordance with operating requirements specified in the permit. These will be\nspecified on a case-by-case basis as those demonstrated (in a trial burn or in\nalternative data as specified in paragraph [e][2] of this section and included\nwith a facility's permit application) to be sufficient to comply with the\nperformance standards of subdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nEach set of operating requirements will\nspecify the composition of the waste feed (including acceptable variations in\nthe physical or chemical properties of the waste feed which will not affect\ncompliance with the performance requirement of subdivision [d] of this section)\nto which the operating requirements apply. For each such waste feed, the permit\nwill specify acceptable operating limits, including the following conditions: (i) carbon monoxide (CO) level in the stack\nexhaust gas; (ii)\nwaste feed\nrate; (iii)\ncombustion\ntemperature; (iv)\nan appropriate\nindicator of combustion gas velocity; (v) allowable variations in incinerator\nsystem design or operating procedures; and\n(vi)\nsuch other operating requirements as are\nnecessary to ensure that the performance standards of subdivision (d) of this\nsection are met. (3)\n\nDuring start-up and shut-down of an incinerator, hazardous waste (except wastes\nexempted in accordance with subdivision [a] of this section) must not be fed\ninto the incinerator unless the incinerator is operating within the conditions\nof operation (temperature, air feed rate, etc.) specified in the\npermit. (4)\n\nFugitive emissions from\nthe combustion zone must be controlled by: (i) keeping the combustion zone totally\nsealed against fugitive emissions; (ii)\nmaintaining a combustion zone pressure\nlower than atmospheric pressure; or\n(iii)\nan alternate means of control\ndemonstrated (with Part 373 permit application) to provide fugitive emissions\ncontrol equivalent to maintenance of combustion zone pressure lower than\natmospheric pressure. (5)\n\nAn incinerator must be operated with a functioning system to automatically cut\noff waste feed to the incinerator when operating conditions deviate from limits\nestablished under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nAn incinerator must cease operation when\nchanges in waste feed, incinerator design, or operating conditions exceed\nlimits designated in its permit. (g) Monitoring and inspections. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator must conduct, as a\nminimum, the following monitoring while incinerating hazardous waste: (i) Combustion temperature, waste feed rate, and the indicator of combustion gas velocity specified in the facility permit\nmust be monitored on a continuous basis. (ii)\n\nCarbon monoxide must be monitored on a\ncontinuous basis at a point in the incinerator downstream of the combustion\nzone and prior to release to the atmosphere. (iii)\n\nUpon request by the commissioner, sampling and analysis of the waste and exhaust emissions must be conducted to\nverify that the operating requirements established in the permit achieve the\nperformance standards of subdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nThe incinerator and associated equipment\n(pumps, valves, conveyors, pipes, etc.) must be subjected to thorough visual\ninspection, at least daily, for leaks, spills, fugitive emissions and signs of\ntampering. (3)\n\nThe emergency waste\nfeed cutoff system and associated alarms must be tested at least weekly to\nverify operability, unless the applicant demonstrates to the commissioner that\nweekly inspections will unduly restrict or upset operations and that less\nfrequent inspection will be adequate. At a minimum, operational testing must be\nconducted at least monthly. (4)\n\nThis monitoring and inspection data must be recorded and the records must be\nplaced in the operating record required by section\n373-2.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (h) Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all\nhazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including but not limited to ash, scrubber waters and scrubber sludges) from the incinerator\nsite.
