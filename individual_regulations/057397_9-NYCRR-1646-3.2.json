  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-3.2 - Certificate of purposes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. The Certificate of Purposes (form DH-216) is a printed form supplied\nby the division and consists of three sheets. A specimen certificate of\npurposes is shown as Exhibit 3, 4 and 5 of Appendix S-11. The certificate of\npurposes supports the housing loan voucher and purports to show in accordance\nwith the uniform classification of accounts, how the funds which are to be\nborrowed will be used by the local agency in the development of the project. The certificate of purposes, in addition, recapitulates how the funds\npreviously borrowed were to be used, relates the breakdown of the anticipated\nuses of the previous and current borrowings to the most recent approved\ndevelopment cost budget (sheets 1 and 2) summarizes the development costs\nincurred and disbursed (sheet 2) and reconciles the latter to the development\nfund bank balances (sheet 3). Approval and payment of a requisition does not, however, constitute prior approval as to the disbursement of funds for the\nparticular items set forth in the certificate of purposes, nor does it permit\nthe disbursement of funds, in any manner except as provided by law and the\ncontract for State aid. (b) Instructions for the preparation of certificate of purposes. Detailed\ninstructions for the preparation of the certificate of purposes will be found\non sheet 3 of the certificate of purposes (Exhibit 5, Appendix S-11). Supplementary instructions follow: (1)\n\nAccount classification (column 1, sheets 1 and 2). Local agencies shall not\ninclude items and amounts on the untitled lines without first furnishing the\ndivision with a complete description of the nature of such items and receiving\nadvice as to the approved classification. (2)\n\nRequirements for the period of the\nrequisition (column 3, sheets 1 and 2). (i) The period of the requisition refers to the future period (in most cases, six\nmonths, but never in excess of one year) during which it is anticipated that\nthe loan funds which are to be borrowed will be used. Where the loan funds are\nto be borrowed from sources other than the State, the period of the requisition\nmust be the same as the term of the temporary loan note to be issued and the\nclosing date of the period will be the date of maturity of the temporary loan\nnote to be issued. Ordinarily, the term of a temporary loan note is six months. In some cases the term may be extended to one year with the prior approval of\nthe division. (ii)\n\nThe amounts\nentered in column 3 should be to the nearest dollar, the cents being omitted, and the grand total of column 3 should be to the nearest $1,000. (iii)\nA worksheet justifying the amounts to\nbe entered in column 3 is shown as Exhibit 6 of Appendix S-11. The exhibit is\nnot complete, but it indicates the recommended approach to preparing a\ncertificate of purposes. The use of this worksheet will not only facilitate the\npreparation of the certificate of purposes but copies thereof filed with the\ncertificate of purposes will also greatly facilitate the processing of the\nlatter. The starting point for the preparation of the worksheet should be the\n\nAnalysis of Expenditures--Budget Control Statement, form DH-213, of the most\nrecent date. In preparing the specimen worksheet (Exhibit 6, Appendix S-11) in\nsupport of the specimen certificate of purposes (Exhibit 3, 4 and 5, Appendix\nS-11) the following facts, as reflected in the certificate of purposes, were\nassumed: (a) Closing date of requisition\npreviously filed. February 1, 1956. This date coincides with the maturity date\nof the current temporary loan note and it is presumed that funds will be\nrequired to refinance the maturing temporary loan notes and to meet the\nanticipated requirements of the period of the requisition being\nprepared. (b) Period of this\nrequisition. Six months ending August 1, 1956. (c) Date of preparation of the requisition. December 10, 1955. This date, it should be noted, would permit the requisition\npapers to be filed with the division six weeks before February 1, 1956, the\ndate the funds to meet the anticipated requirements for the period of the\nrequisition will be borrowed. (d) Date of most recent form DH-213. November 30, 1955. The costs incurred for the\nvarious classifications are taken from column 5 of form DH-213 (see Exhibits 24\nand 25 of Appendix S-11). (iv)\nA study of the specimen worksheet\n(Exhibit 6, Appendix S-11) will show that column 3 will reflect anticipated\nrequirements for the period of the requisition after they have been adjusted\nfor over- and under-estimates of requirements in previous requisitions. See\nalso subdivision (d) of this section. (3)\n\nTotal requirements (column 5, sheets 1\nand 2). (i) As noted above, the date to be\ninserted at the head of this column refers to the closing date of the period\nduring which, it is anticipated, that the funds to be borrowed will be used. If\nthe funds are to be borrowed from sources other than the State, the closing\ndate of the period will be the date of maturity of the temporary loan note to\nbe issued. (ii)\n\nIf funds are to be\nborrowed from sources other than the State, the total requirements must include\nprovision for interest on the temporary loan note(s) to be issued, at an\nassumed rate which should be not less than the current market rate. The\nprovision for the interest on the temporary loan note(s) should be reflected in\na footnote to the total requirements for account 1420.1, Interest Expense, as\nindicated on the specimen sheet 1 of the certificate of purposes (Exhibit 3 of\n\nAppendix S-11) and is included in the amount of the advance loan note to be\nissued to the State, but not in the amount of the temporary loan note(s). The\nprovision for the interest therefore represents the difference between the\namount of the advance loan note and the amount of the temporary loan note(s), as indicated at the foot of sheet 2 of the specimen certificate of purposes\n(Exhibit 4 of Appendix S-11). It is important that the total requirements and\nthe provision for interest be expressed in even thousands of dollars so that\nthe advance loan and temporary loan notes are likewise in even thousands of\ndollars. (4)\n\nSummary\n(sheet 2). Columns 3, 4 and 5 of the summary on sheet 2 merely recapitulate the\nbreakdown of the requirements on sheet 1 and need no further explanation. The\nsource of the information for columns 6 and 7 of the summary is the Analysis of\n\nExpenditures--Budget Control Statement, form DH-213, of the most recent date, which date should be inserted in the headings of each column. The figures to be\ninserted in column 7, development costs incurred, are taken from column 5 of\nform DH-213. The individual items in column 7 are adjusted for development cost\naccruals and payables, as listed in schedule B of form DH-213, to yield the\nfigures to be inserted in column 6, amounts disbursed for development costs. The total of column 6 should then be carried forward to column (e) of sheet 3\nof the certificate of purposes. (5)\n\nOther disbursements (line [h], sheet 3). This item represents the net of\ndisbursements of development funds not charged to development costs\n(investments, prepaid insurance, etc.) and of amounts, other than loan funds, deposited in the development fund but not credited to development costs\n(deposits on plans and specifications, etc.) The source of the information\nrequired for this item is schedule A of form DH-213. A study of Exhibit 7 of\n\nAppendix S-11, worksheet for 'other disbursements', certificate of purposes\ntogether with the specimen of form DH-213 (Exhibits 24 and 25 of Appendix S-11)\nwill indicate the procedure to be followed. (c) Special instruction for first requisition\nof loan funds. The first requisition of loan funds should include sufficient\nfunds to permit reimbursement for such costs, if any, incurred prior to the\ndate of the contract for State aid as have been or may be approved by the\ncommissioner. The certificate of depositary on sheet 3 will not be necessary, nor will it be necessary to fill in column 4 of sheets 1 and 2 or columns 4 and\n6 of the summary on sheet 2. All other information must be furnished. (d) Overruns on amounts approved on\ncertificates of purposes. The following procedure is established in reference\nto disbursements of amounts approved by the division on certificates of\npurposes. (1)\n\nOverruns not in excess of 20\nper cent of approved amounts. Approval is hereby given for disbursement of loan\nfunds, in excess of up to 20 per cent of the approved amount requested on a\ncertificate of purposes for any item, other than a restricted item (see §\n1646-2.3, subd. [b]), provided\nthat: (i) Total costs incurred for any\ndevelopment cost subaccount classification or group of development cost\naccounts by reason of such disbursement shall not exceed the limitations\nimposed by subdivision (b) of section\n1646-2.3\non overruns on development\ncost budget amounts unless such overrun has had the prior written approval of\nthe division. (ii)\n\nFunds for such\nexcess disbursements are available from other unobligated balances in other\nsubaccount classifications as shown in the certificate of purposes. (2)\n\nAs explained in paragraph (2)\nof subdivision (b), supra,adjustments for over- and under-estimates of\nrequirements in an approved certificate of purposes will be reflected in column\n3 of the certificate of purposes filed with the next requisition of loan funds. The foregoing approval does not apply to amounts approved on certificate of\npurposes for restricted items nor does it constitute approval of the\ndisbursement of funds in any manner than as provided by law, the contract for\n\nState aid, and the division's manuals of procedure [FN*]. (3)\n\nOther overruns. Should the local agency\nrequire amounts in excess of the 20 per cent limitation above, or in excess of\nthe amounts approved for restricted items, or for items for which no funds have\nbeen requisitioned and have excess funds available in other subaccount\nclassifications which have not been obligated, the local agency shall request\nthe division, in writing, to authorize the overruns, furnishing complete\ndetails with respect to the purpose of the expenditure and the necessity of the\noverrun on the amount approved on the certificate of purposes. The adjustments\nfor the over- and under-estimate of requirements for such items are likewise\nreflected in column 3 of the certificate of purposes filed with the next\nrequisition. [FN*] See Subchapter C of this\n\nChapter. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1646-3.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
