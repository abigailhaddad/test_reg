  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.2 - Regulations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe regulations of the Division of\n\nTaxation are official statements of general applicability that implement or\napply the provisions of the Tax Law and related statutes and prescribe the\npractices and procedural requirements of the division. These regulations are\nintended to foster a uniform and equitable administration of the Tax Law and\nrelated statutes. (2)\n\nSubdivision\n\nFirst of section\n171\nof the Tax Law provides explicit\nauthority for the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance to make such reasonable\nrules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may be necessary for the\nexercise of the commissioner's power and for the performance of the\ncommissioner's duties under the Tax Law. Numerous other provisions throughout\nthe Tax Law and related statutes provide similar or specific authority to\neffectuate the purposes of such laws. (b) Rule making. (1)\n\nThe terms rules and regulations are\ninterchangeable. In accordance with section 8 of article\nIV\nof the Constitution\nof New York State and section\n102\nof the Executive Law, the division's\nregulations are adopted by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance pursuant to\nthe rule making procedure prescribed in article 2 of the State Administrative\n\nProcedure Act. This procedure ensures that interested taxpayers, tax\npractitioners, personnel of the department and members of the general public\nare notified of all regulations being adopted by the commissioner and that they\nare afforded an opportunity to comment on, and participate in the development\nof, such regulations. (2)\n\nAmong the\nmethods of communication that are specifically excluded from the rule making\nprocedure imposed by the State Administrative Procedure Act are: (i) declaratory rulings; and\n(ii)\nforms, instructions, interpretative\nstatements and statements of general policy which in themselves have no legal\neffect but are merely explanatory. These methods of communication by the\ndivision, including others, are discussed in the sections of this Part that\nfollow. (c) Force and effect. (1)\n\nRegulations have\ntraditionally been classified as being either legislative or interpretive in\ncharacter. The division's regulations are no exception, although this\ndistinction may not always be apparent. Legislative regulations of the division\nare regulations that create rights and responsibilities under the Tax Law and\nrelated statutes pursuant to the statutory delegations by the Legislature to\nmake reasonable rules and regulations. They are adopted to implement provisions\nof the Tax Law or related statutes that have intentionally been left incomplete\nand to fill in the details that are necessary to complete the framework\nestablished by such laws. Accordingly, legislative regulations of the division\nhave the full force and effect of law, unless they are beyond the power\ndelegated, improperly promulgated, arbitrary, capricious, or contrary to law. Such regulations should not be altered or set aside merely because alternative\nconstructions of the underlying provisions of the Tax Law or related statutes\ncan be made. Where the division's legislative regulations are within the powers\ndelegated, are properly promulgated and are otherwise in accordance with law, such regulations set precedent and are binding. (2)\n\nInterpretive regulations of the division\ndo not create rights or responsibilities, but merely explain and clarify the\ndivision's position on the various provisions of the Tax Law and related\nstatutes. However, although interpretive regulations of the division are merely\nexplanatory, they do constitute an authoritative codification of the division's\nspecialized experience and informed judgments which have undergone the formal\nrule making procedure imposed by the State Administrative Procedure Act. Thus, the division's interpretive regulations set precedent and are binding upon the\ntaxpayer, the division and the commissioner, unless they are altered or set\naside by the Tax Appeals Tribunal (see, however, section\n2375.1\n[a][2]\nof this Part), a reviewing court of competent jurisdiction, duly enacted\nlegislation or properly promulgated amendments to such regulations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
