  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-8.9 - Equipment and waste container decontamination and removal procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Timing of waste\ntransfer activities. During Phase II B of the project, after ACM, PACM, asbestos material and debris is bagged, wrapped, or containerized, waste\ntransfer from the regulated abatement work area as per this section, shall\noccur when no gross removal is taking place. (b) First cleaning. External surfaces of\ncontaminated bags/containers and equipment shall be cleaned by wet wiping or\nHEPA-vacuuming or both in the regulated abatement work area before moving such\nitems into the waste decontamination system washroom by persons assigned to\nthis duty. (1)\n\nException. Minor size\nregulated abatement work areas that do not have a contiguous washroom, are\nallowed to have all waste bag/container cleaning with additional\ncontainerization completed within that work area. The waste generated shall be\nimmediately bagged/containerized within the regulated abatement work area. Once\nthe abatement and cleaning is complete within the regulated abatement work\narea, each waste bag/container shall be wet-wiped, placed in a second\nbag/container and sealed airtight (except for non-porous drums which shall be\nwashed and dried only), labeled with the generator's name, location generated\nand other caution labels as per current EPA NESHAP regulation requirements, then moved to the airlock. The waste bags/container shall then be transferred\nto the secured waste trailer/dumpster for disposal by appropriate legal\nmethod. (c) Washroom\nprocedures. All bagged/containerized contaminated items and asbestos waste\nshall be passed into the washroom during waste transfer operations. Workers\nfrom uncontaminated areas in full protective clothing and appropriate\nrespiratory protection shall enter the washroom and place the appropriate\nsupply of specified clean waste bags/containers within the washroom. One team\nof workers shall be stationed in the washroom for bag/container cleaning and\nadditional containerization as necessary. The workers shall ensure all\ncurtained doorways are closed during the waste container transfer procedure and\nthat all bags/containers are sealed properly before removing for transport and\ndisposal. (1)\n\nAdditional cleaning. Once in\nthe waste decontamination system, external surfaces of the contaminated\nbags/containers and equipment shall be cleaned an additional time by wet\ncleaning in the washroom. (2)\n\nAdditional containerizing. Once the additional cleaning is completed and the\ncleaned bags/containers of asbestos waste are dried of any excessive pooled or\nbeaded liquid, they shall be placed in a clean uncontaminated plastic bag or\nwrapped in sheeting (except for non-porous drums which shall be washed and\ndried only), as the items physical characteristics demand, and sealed airtight. When the bags/containers are moved to the holding area, lockable trailer, or\nlockable hardtop dumpster, the bags/containers shall be appropriately labeled\nwith the date they are moved from the waste decontamination system marked on\nthe container in waterproof markings. Caution labels as per the requirements of\ncurrent EPA NESHAP regulations, including the generator's name and location\ngenerated shall also be affixed at this time. (3)\n\nRemoval to airlock or small project clean\nroom. The equipment and cleaned/containerized waste shall be moved into the\nairlock, or for small projects to the clean room, that leads from the washroom. The washroom workers shall not enter this airlock, small project clean room or\nthe regulated abatement work area until waste transfer is finished for that\ntransfer period. Once waste transfer is complete, the washroom workers shall\nproceed to the regulated abatement work area and then to the personal\ndecontamination system, or immediately to the remote personal decontamination\nsystem. (d) Removal to\nholding area, lockable trailer or lockable hard top dumpster. Bags/containers\nand equipment shall be moved from the airlock and into the holding area, or\ndirectly from the holding area to the lockable trailer or lockable hardtop\ndumpster by persons attired in clean personal protective equipment who have\nentered from uncontaminated areas. Asbestos waste may stay in the holding area\nno longer than one week or in a lockable trailer or lockable hard top dumpster\nuntil filled but in no instance longer than 10 calendar days after successful\ncompletion of Phase II C for all regulated abatement work areas at the\nsite. (e) Cart usage and cleaning. The cleaned containers of asbestos waste and equipment shall not be stored in\nthe clean room but shall be placed in holding carts adjacent to but outside of\nthe clean room, after passing through the decontamination unit. The carts may\nbe used for temporary storage adjacent to the clean room until the end of the\nwork shift. (f) Holding carts. The\ncarts shall be watertight and have doors or tops that shall be closed and\nsecured. The carts shall be HEPA-vacuumed and wet cleaned at least once a\nday. (g) Trailers and dumpsters. Waste transport trailers and dumpsters used to transport RACM waste, shall be\nhard topped, lockable and lined with two layers of six mil fire-retardant\npolyethylene. Prior to transport from the work site, all waste trailers and\ndumpsters shall be sealed to ensure air, dust and watertight integrity, utilizing six mil plastic, duct tape and expandable foam sealant as necessary. The waste transporter is responsible for cleaning/decontamination of waste\ntrailers or dumpsters, once the waste has been properly disposed of at the\nappropriately licensed and permitted landfill facility. Waste haulers (truck\ndrivers) accessing the work area to remove waste trailers/dumpsters, do not\nrequire certification as asbestos handlers. Waste hauler truck operators shall\nbe allowed within the regulated work area for loading of waste and shall remain\nin their vehicle with the windows up and the ventilation system off while in\nthe work area. (h) Enclosure\nsecurity. The entrance to and exit from the waste decontamination system\nenclosure(s) shall be secured to prevent unauthorized entry. Signs per section\n56-7.4\nof this Part shall be\nposted at the entrance to the decontamination units. (i) Assigned persons for small asbestos\nprojects. Where only one egress exists and the shower is used as a waste\nremoval washroom, workers shall be stationed in each area/room of the\ndecontamination system enclosure to transfer/process the contaminated\nbags/containers and equipment through adjacent areas/rooms as per this section. These workers shall not cross into the adjacent areas/rooms until waste\ntransfer is finished for that transfer period and all other workers have\ndecontaminated as per these regulations. The clean room/holding area workers\nshall enter from uncontaminated areas attired in clean personal protective\nequipment. The clean room shall not be used as a holding area, but shall be\nused as a waste bag/container transfer area for loading waste bags/containers\ninto carts, for immediate transfer to the waste transport\ntrailer/dumpster. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-8.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
