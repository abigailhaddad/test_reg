  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 8C.04 - Automatic Gates\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraphs 02 and 03. INSERT the following paragraphs: Standard: 01A The automatic gate (see Figure 8C-1) shall consist of a\ndrive mechanism and a fully retroreflectorized red-and white-striped gate arm\nwith lights. When in the down position, the gate arm shall effectively block\nall approach lanes, the adjacent shoulder, and all sidewalks. Automatic gates\nshall not be used without railroad flashing-light signals. Guidance: 01B The gate mechanism should be mounted on the same\nsupport as the railroad flashing-light signal. 01C Automatic gates should be perpendicular to the roadway\nor sidewalk, unless conditions warrant placement at a different angle. Option: 01D Where conditions require, the gate may be mounted on a\nseparate support located between the railroad flashing-light signal support and\nthe track. Standard: 01E If the gate is mounted on a separate support located\nbetween the railroad flashing-light signal support and the track, the minimum\nclearances shown in Figures 8C-2, 8C-101, and 8C-102 shall be met. Standard: 01F In the normal sequence of operation, unless constant\nwarning time detection or other advanced system requires otherwise, the\nflashing-light signals and the lights on the gate arm (in its normal upright\nposition) shall be activated immediately upon detection of approaching rail\ntraffic. The gate arm shall start its downward motion not less than 3 seconds\nafter the flashing-light signals are activated, shall reach its horizontal\nposition at least 10 seconds before the arrival of the rail traffic, and shall\nremain in the down position until the rail traffic has cleared the grade\ncrossing. Guidance: 05B When the rear of the train is approximately 50 feet\nbeyond the crossing, and no other train is approaching, the train should be\nconsidered clear of the highway-rail grade crossing. Standard: 07A Automatic gates, when in the down position, shall not\nbe less than 42 inches or more than 54 inches above the pavement crown or\nsidewalk. Each roadway gate shall be equipped with at least three red lights\nwith a minimum diameter of 3 inches and visible in both directions along the\nroadway. Guidance: 07B The lights should be positioned along the gate at the\nfollowing distances: the first light should be within one foot of the gate tip, the others should be evenly spaced over the roadway surface, as per Figure\n8C-1. 07C If installed, the light on a sidewalk gate should be\nlocated approximately over the center of the sidewalk. Standard: 08A Each sidewalk gate longer than 6 feet shall be equipped\nwith one red light with a minimum diameter of 3 inches and visible in both\ndirections along the sidewalk. The light shall be continuously illuminated when\nactivated. Guidance: 13A In the down position, the tip of the roadway gate\nshould be within one foot of the left edge of the approach. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n8C.04\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
