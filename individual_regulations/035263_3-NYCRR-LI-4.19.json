  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 4.19 - Direct deposits of payroll funds by a corporate employer into a checking account maintained at a savings bank by its employee\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe department has been asked for its opinion of the legality\nof an arrangement whereby, pursuant to an agreement among a savings bank, its\ndepositors and the corporate employer of the depositors, some of the depositors\nhave instructed the corporate employer to deposit all or part of their salaries\ninto checking accounts which they maintain with the savings bank. The\ndepartment has concluded that this arrangement is authorized by the Banking\n\nLaw. The authority for a savings bank to accept deposits of all or\na part of a depositor's salary from his corporate employer into the depositor's\nchecking account is found in section 234.1 of the Banking Law as supplemented\nby section 234.23. Subdivision one of section 234 authorizes savings banks \"to\nreceive and repay deposits, including demand deposits.\" It also authorizes\nsavings banks to \"exercise all such incidental powers as shall be necessary to\nconduct the business of a savings bank.\" Subdivision 23 of section 234\nauthorizes savings banks \"to have and exercise all other powers necessary or\nappropriate in conducting the business of the savings bank.\" While the\nincidental powers authorized by subdivision 23 relate to the general conduct of\nthe business of a savings bank (including the receipt of demand deposits), the\nincidental powers authorized in subdivision one relate specifically to the\nreceipt of deposits, including demand deposits. Thus, it is clear that the\n\nBanking Law now authorizes savings banks to perform those operations associated\nwith the receipt of demand deposits including the making of an arrangement for\nthe direct deposit of salaries into the checking accounts of their\ndepositors. The Banking Law does impose certain restrictions upon the\nacceptance of checking accounts by savings banks, including a prohibition of\nthe imposition of charges for maintaining these accounts or for honoring checks\ndrawn on them as well as prohibition of the maintenance of checking accounts\nfor corporate depositors. Neither section 234.1 nor any other section of the\n\nBanking Law, however, appears to impose limitations on the method or the\nmechanics by which deposits are made into checking accounts which are otherwise\nlawfully maintained. In connection with this issue, a question has been raised\nabout the meaning of the language added to section 238.5 by chapter 225 of the\n\nLaws of 1976, the chapter which authorized savings banks to accept demand\ndeposits. Section 238.5 provides, as follows: \"A savings bank may accept deposits, other than demand\ndeposits and deposits held pursuant to subdivision one-a of section two hundred\nthirty-four of this chapter, from an employer or an employee group, to be\ncredited to the individual accounts of the members of a group of employees\nhaving a common employer, without the issuance of a passbook in connection\ntherewith, and may pay to any one of the members of such group, or to his\nauthorized agent, in person, the whole or any part of such deposits credited to\nhis account together with the dividends credited thereon, without requiring the\nproduction of a passbook.\"\nIt is the department's opinion that the exclusion of demand\ndeposits from the authority granted by section 238.5 was not intended to and in\nfact did not prohibit savings banks from accepting payroll funds from employers\nfor deposit into the checking accounts maintained by their employees at a\nsavings bank. Until 1947, all savings bank accounts required a passbook because\nsection 238.3 required that all interest credited and withdrawals charged be\nentered in the passbook. In 1947, section 238.5 was added to create an\nexception from the strict passbook rule of section 238.3 by permitting savings\nbanks to maintain no-passbook (savings) accounts for the purpose of receiving\nfrom employers of savings bank depositors direct deposits of all or a part of\nthe depositors' wages. Only in 1965, with the addition of section 238.6 were\nsavings banks granted general authority to accept no-passbook accounts. Even\nthen, however, savings banks were still restricted to the acceptance of savings\ndeposits. Section 238.5 is but one of a series of restrictions which\nthe Banking Law had imposed upon savings accounts. Each of these restrictions\nwas amended by chapter 225 of the Laws of 1976 to make it clear that its\nlimitation did not apply to demand accounts. For example, section 238.2 --the\nrequirement of 60 days' notice prior to withdrawal--and section 238.4\n--dividend crediting provisions--were amended to exclude demand accounts from\ntheir restraints. Section 238.5 was amended in the same fashion. The purpose of\nthe amendment, then, was not to prohibit direct deposit of payroll funds by\nemployers into their employees' checking accounts, but rather to make it clear\nthat section 238.5 applies only to savings deposits.
