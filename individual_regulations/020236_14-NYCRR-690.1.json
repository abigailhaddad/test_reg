  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 690.1 - Background and applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\n\nFederal Social Security Act authorizes Federal financial participation to an\napproved State plan for Medicaid services authorizing payment for the costs of\nmedical and remedial care for persons whose income and resources are\ninsufficient to meet the costs of such services. (b) The Medical Assistance Program in New\n\nYork State is administered by the Department of Social Services in cooperation\nwith the New York State Department of Health, the Education Department, and the\n\nOffice for People With Developmental Disabilities (hereinafter referred to as\nOPWDD). (c) This Part establishes\nthe programmatic, administrative and funding standards for the certification\nand operation of day treatment facilities or services (see glossary) for\npersons with developmental disabilities (see glossary). The certification and\nrecertification of day treatment facilities also requires demonstrated\nsubstantial compliance with Parts 624, 633, and 635 of this Title. (d) For meeting the needs of persons (see\nglossary) with developmental disabilities, day treatment is intended to be a\nplanned combination of diagnostic, treatment and habilitative services provided\nto persons with developmental disabilities in need of a broad range of\nclinically supported and structured habilitation services. (1)\n\nPersons provided day treatment services\nin a free-standing certified site or approved satellite (see glossary) site, will attend for periods in excess of three hours if reimbursement is to be\nclaimed. A reimbursable half-day visit covers a period of three to five hours. A full-day reimbursable visit covers a period of five hours or more. (2)\n\nPersons who attend a certified day\ntreatment facility which is collocated on the same site as a day training or\nsheltered program (\na.k.a., \"collocated day treatment\"; see\nalso section\n635-7.1\n(a)(8) and\n(9)(ii)\n(\nd\n) of this Title), for the purposes of receiving needed active treatment based, pre-vocational/independent living activities, shall participate for periods of\nat least 90 minutes as the minimum unit of service. (3)\n\nDay treatment facilities may vary widely\nin the services offered, the level of disability of persons served, the\nstaffing plan, the program goals and the types and numbers of cooperative\nagency relationships. However, at its very essence, is the direct and\nmeaningful involvement of the person as service recipient, and his/her parent, guardian or correspondent/advocate (as applicable), in the program planning and\nreview process. (4)\nA day treatment\nfacility is eligible to participate as a provider in the Medical Assistance\n\nProgram only if the provider is certified as a day treatment facility by OPWDD\nto provide services based at a specific inspected and certified site. Said\nrequirement shall not preclude operation of a satellite site, if the\nlocation(s) of said satellite(s) have been inspected, meet the appropriate\nphysical plant requirements, and are listed on the primary facility's operating\ncertificate. (e) Sections\n690.3, 690.4, 690.5 and\n690.6\nof this Part are organized\nin a format consisting of principles of compliance and standards of\ncertification. In reviewing the continued eligibility of a day treatment\nfacility for an operating certificate, OPWDD shall survey for compliance with\nall \"standards of certification,\" herein and any other applicable requirements. OPWDD may evaluate non-compliance with the applicable \"principles of\ncompliance.\" The detailed premises for the principles of compliance and\nstandards of certification format may be found in Part 633.2 of this Title. (1)\n\nPrinciples of compliance set forth the\nbasic conditions for the operation of a facility. Facilities will not be\nroutinely examined against principles of compliance at surveys for\nrecertification. OPWDD reserves the right to monitor compliance with any\napplicable requirements at any time pursuant to the responsibilities of the\ncommissioner (see glossary) under the Mental Hygiene Law. (2)\n\nStandards of certification are criteria\nspecified by OPWDD as necessary for compliance in order for a facility to\ndemonstrate on a regular and ongoing basis that it can and will continue\nproviding the appropriate environment to assure an adequate level of quality of\ncare, welfare, individual rights, safety, and fiscal accountability. Surveys\nare conducted for the purpose of documenting compliance with standards of\ncertification. Compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations, or an\nacceptable plan of correction, is a basis for issuing an operating certificate\nand/or renewing an operating certificate. (f) The OPWDD certification process defined\nin subdivision\n690.1\n(e) of this\nsection is superseded by requirements in Part 619 of this Title, Certification\nof Facilities and Home and Community Based Services (HCBS), effective on the\neffective date of these regulations. (g) OPWDD expects ongoing compliance with\nboth principles of compliance and standards of certification included in this\n\nPart. Therefore, such compliance shall be the responsibility of the agency and\nshall be necessary for continued participation as a certified facility or\nfunding as an approved program or service. (h) As used herein, the terms, person(s)/people, shall be understood to refer to those who have been admitted\nto and are receiving allowable day treatment services. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
