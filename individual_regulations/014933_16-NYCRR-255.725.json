Tit. 16 § 255.725 - Test requirements for reinstating service lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in subdivision (e) of\nthis section, each disconnected service line must be tested in accordance with\nthis section before being reinstated; however, if provisions are made to\nmaintain continuous service, such as by installation of a bypass, any part of\nthe original service line used to maintain continuous service need not be\ntested. The limits of the test shall be in accordance with section\n255.511\n(g) of\nthis Part. (b) For each service\nline to be operated at a pressure of not more than 20 psig (138 kPa), the test\npressure shall be three psig (21 kPa) or three times the maximum allowable\noperating pressure, whichever is greater. (c) For each service line to be operated at\nmore than 20 psig (138 kPa) but not more than 60 psig (414 kPa), the test\npressure shall be 90 psig (621 kPa). (d) For each service line to be operated at\nmore than 60 psig (414 kPa), the test pressure shall be 1.5 times the maximum\nallowable operating pressure. (e) All exposed connections on low-pressure service lines temporarily disconnected\nfrom the main because of main renewals or other planned work shall be\nsoap-tested at operating pressure and the entire service line shall be checked\nfor leakage with a combustible gas indicator both at the time of turn on and on\nthe following day. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.725\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
