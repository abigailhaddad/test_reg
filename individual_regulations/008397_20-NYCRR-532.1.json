  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 532.1 - Collection of tax from customer\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Time\nof collection. (1)\n\nEvery person\nrequired to collect the tax shall collect the tax from the customer when\ncollecting the price, amusement charge or rent to which it applies. (2)\n\nWhere a vendor makes a sale for which\npayment is not received at the time of delivery, such sale must be reported on\nthe return covering the period in which the sale is made. Thus, if the sale is\na taxable sale, the full amount of tax must be remitted with the return whether\nor not any money was collected at the time of sale. Cross-reference: For credit for bad debts, see Part 534 of this Title. For\nreporting and payment of tax by vendor, see Part 533 of this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nAny person\nwillfully failing to collect the tax from a customer may be subject to the\ncriminal penalties prescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law and the Penal Law. See Part 536 of this Title. (b) Statement of and reference to\ntax. (1)\n\nWhenever the customer is given\nany sales slip, invoice, receipt, or other statement or memorandum of the\nprice, amusement charge, or rent paid or payable, the tax shall be stated, charged and shown separately on the first of such documents given to\nhim. (2)\n\nWhenever the sales and use\ntax is separately stated on such document, it may be referred to as\ntax. (3)\n\nThe words\ntax included\nor words of similar import, on a sales slip or\nother document, do not constitute a separate statement of the tax, and the\nentire amount charged is deemed the sales price of the property sold or\nservices rendered. (4)\n\nNo written\nreceipt. For sales other than sales of gasoline and diesel fuel a unit price\nmethod of accounting for sales may be used where no written receipt is given to\nthe customer. The\nunit price\nis the price, including sales\ntax, at which the sale is recorded. Since the customer must be made aware of\nthe inclusion of sales tax in the total sales price, every business\nestablishment employing the unit price method must visibly display, to all\ncustomers a placard stating that the prices of all taxable items include sales\ntax. If the sale is recorded on a cash register it may be rung up on a single\nring, a quantity of individual items may be rung up in total, or a quantity of\nitems can be rung up individually with a total. In addition, the vendor shall, for the benefit of his customers, distinguish between taxable and nontaxable\nitems offered for sale. This may be done by such methods as: (i) attaching labels to merchandise to\nindicate taxable or nontaxable status; (ii)\ndisplaying taxable and nontaxable\nmerchandise separately; or\n(iii)\nhaving available detailed listings of taxable and/or nontaxable items. It is\nthe responsibility of every vendor who sells both taxable and nontaxable items\nto maintain accurate records indicating such sales. Cross-reference: For posting of signs at retail service stations, see\nsection\n530.2\nof this\n\nTitle. (5)\n\nAny\nperson willfully failing to charge or state separately the tax, or referring to\nthe tax in a manner other than prescribed, may be subject to the criminal\npenalties prescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law and the Penal Law. See Part\n536 of this Title. (c) Absorption of tax and forms of advertising prohibited. No person required to collect any tax imposed by article 28\nand pursuant to the authority of article 29 of the Tax Law, shall advertise or\nhold out to any purchaser, to any other person, or to the public in general, in\nany manner, that the tax is not considered as an element in the price, amusement charge, or rent payable by the customer. Among the acts prohibited\nare statements that the customer is not being charged the tax, or that the tax\nwill be refunded to the customer, or applied as a credit against the customer's\nbill, account or future purchases. The following examples illustrate violations\nof section\n1133 (d)\nof the Tax Law: Example 1: A vendor gives a sales slip which reads: Merchandise\n$100\n\nTax Credit or Allowance\n(7)\n\nSales Tax\n7\n\nTotal\n$100\n\nExample 2: A vendor gives a sales slip which reads: Merchandise\n$100\n\nSales Tax\n7\n$107\n\nLess Tax Allowance\n(7)\n\nTotal\n$100\n\nExample 3: A vendor gives a sales slip which reads: Merchandise\n$100\n\nTax\n7\n\nTotal\n$107\n\nTax credit on subsequent purchase $7. (d) Vendor's remedy for customer's failure to pay tax. (1)\n\nEvery person required to collect any tax\nimposed by article 28 and pursuant to the authority of article 29 of the Tax\n\nLaw shall have the same right in respect to collecting the tax from his\ncustomer or in respect to nonpayment of the tax by the customer as if the tax\nwere a part of the purchase price of the property or service, amusement charge\nor rent, as the case may be, and payable at the same time; provided, however, that the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance shall be joined as a party in any\naction or proceeding brought to collect the tax. (2)\n\nThe joining of the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance as a party in any action or proceeding brought to collect\nthe tax shall be effected by service upon the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance of a summons and complaint naming the Commissioner of Taxation and\n\nFinance as a plaintiff or defendant thereon. (e) Payment and report by\ncustomer. Where any customer has failed to pay sales tax imposed by\narticle 28 and pursuant to the authority of article 29 of the Tax Law to the\nperson required to collect the tax, such tax shall be payable by the customer\ndirectly to the Department of Taxation and Finance, and it shall be the duty of\nthe customer to file a report of sales and use tax with the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance and to pay the tax as provided in section\n531.6\nor\n533.3\nof this Title.
