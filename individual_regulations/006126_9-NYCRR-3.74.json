The Commission shall submit a preliminary report to the\n\nGovernor by February 15, 1979, and a final report by February 15, 1980. II. Membership. The Commission shall consist of the Commissioner of\n\nTaxation and Finance, the Commissioner of Commerce, the Director of the Budget, the Chairman of the State Consumer Protection Board and at least three other\nmembers to be chosen by the Governor.
