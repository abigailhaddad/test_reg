  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 365-2.6 - General treatment requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements in section\n365-2.5\nof this Subpart, a RMW\ntreatment facility must comply with the following criteria: (a) Except as provided in subdivisions (b)\nand (c) of this section, treatment of RMW must be by: (1)\ndischarge into a sanitary sewer system\nconnected to a secondary treatment facility, if the waste is liquid or\nsemi-solid, except as specifically prohibited by the NYSDOH, or by local law or\nordinance; (2)\nincineration in a\nRMW incineration facility regulated under Subpart 362-1 of this\n\nTitle; (3)\ndecontamination or\ninactivation by autoclaving in conformance with the requirements of this\n\nSubpart; (4)\ndecontamination by\ndischarge to an effluent decontamination system approved by the department; or\n(5)\nan alternative RMW treatment\nsystem approved by the NYSDOH. (b) Restrictions on autoclave use\n(1)\n\nAn autoclave cannot be used for treatment\nof RMW containing or mixed with hazardous waste and/or\npharmaceuticals. (2)\n\nAn autoclave\ncannot be used for treatment of radiological RMW unless decayed to a background\nradiation level or the facility set alarm for radiation levels prior to\ntreatment. (3)\n\nAn autoclave cannot\nbe used for treatment of recognizable human organs or body parts, or animal\nbody parts or carcasses unless in small quantities, and approved by the\ndepartment, or provided the NYSDOH has approved the autoclave model as an\nalternative treatment technology for those wastes. (4)\n\nAn autoclave cannot be used for treatment\nof thermally resistant materials such as solidified liquids or bulk animal\nbedding having a volume of more than five cubic feet unless approved by the\ndepartment and NYSDOH as an alternative treatment system. (5)\n\nAn autoclave cannot be used for the\ntreatment of toxins of biological origin unless autoclaving can be verified by\nidentifying the scientific source documenting it as an effective and\nappropriate method for inactivating biological toxins or the method used for\ninactivating toxins of biological origin is one of those listed by the Centers\nfor Disease Control and Prevention in the \"Biosafety in Microbiological and\n\nBiomedical Laboratories\" publication as incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. (c) Cultures and stocks\n(1)\n\nCultures and stocks containing select\nagents or non-exempt quantities of toxins of biological origin listed in 7 CFR\nPart\n331, 9 CFR Part\n121\nand 42 CFR part\n73\nas incorporated by reference in\nsection\n360.3\nof this Title, must be\ntreated on-site by incineration, autoclaving, use of an alternative treatment\nsystem approved by the NYSDOH, or inactivation in accordance with the Federal\n\nSelect Agent Program. However, if the generating facility does not have a\npredictable need for on-site treatment and the waste is incidental to the\ndelivery of medical care or research, the generating facility can arrange for\ntransportation of the select agents and toxins of biological origin to a\nfacility authorized by the department to treat the waste. If the waste is\nshipped off-site for treatment, the generator must comply with federal\nregulations regarding possession, use and transfer of select agents and toxins\nof biological origin found in 7 CFR Part\n331, 9 CFR Part\n121\nand 42 CFR part\n73\nas incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. (2)\n\nCultures and stocks containing infectious\nagents other than those referenced in paragraph (1) of this subdivision may be\ntransported off-site for treatment. (d) Discarded sharps must be destroyed prior\nto disposal. Sharps that have not come into contact with infectious agents do\nnot need to be treated. (e) Treatment facilities must have a response plan in place to be followed in the\nevent the facility is notified or discovers that RMW has left the facility\nwithout required treatment. (f) Treated RMW can be disposed of as MSW at a combustor, landfill or other\ndisposal facility authorized by the department to accept RMW after\ntreatment. (g) Treated RMW must be\naccompanied by a NYSDOH certificate of treatment. (h) Effective treatment of RMW. Treatment of\nRMW must be demonstrated by no growth in viable 'G. stearothermophilus' spore\nconcentration, or other biological indicator or measure of effectiveness\nacceptable to the department. In addition: (1)\nfor infectious agents including certain\nvegetative bacteria, fungi, lipophilic and hydrophilic viruses, parasites, mycobacteria, and similar organisms, no growth is required; (2)\nfor human tissues, human organs, or\nanimal waste body parts, the treatment must render the waste visually\nunrecognizable; (3)\nfor sharps, the\ntreatment must render the sharps unusable; and\n(4)\nfor toxins of biological origin, the\ndecontamination, inactivation and treatment must inactivate the\ntoxin. (i) Validation\ntesting prior to equipment use. Prior to using an RMW treatment system, the\nfacility must conduct validation testing. Written approval of validation and\nrepeat validation test protocols and test results must be obtained from the\ndepartment prior to acceptance of RMW for treatment. The department must be\nnotified before all validation testing is conducted, review and approve the\nscientific source documenting it as effective. (1)\n\nThe testing must include three separate\ntreatment runs in accordance with the following requirements: (i) the operational parameters used during\nthe tests must be consistent with the parameters that will be used during\nroutine operation of the treatment process (e.g., cycle duration, heat, chemical, or irradiation exposure time, chemical concentration, or other\ntreatment parameters, etc.); (ii)\nfor autoclaves, each test must document removal of all air from the autoclave\nand include one or more pre-vacuum cycles or depending on the autoclave one or\nmore steam pulses; (iii)\nthe RMW\ncomposition (e.g., porosity, liquids, solids, organic matter, thermal\nresistance and type of packaging etc.) and load configuration (e.g., packing\ndensity, orientation etc.) during the tests must be consistent with the waste\nproperties and loading process during routine operation; and\n(iv)\nthe moisture content (i.e., wet or dry)\nand volume of the waste during the tests must be consistent with the waste that\nwill be treated during routine operation. (2)\n\nTo assess treatment performance, the\nsystem must employ commercially-prepared biological indicators from the same\nlot or batch, each containing spores of 'Geobacillus stearothermophilus' (for\nsteam, or moist heat, or hydrogen peroxide systems), 'Bacillus atropheus' (for\ndry heat or chemical systems) or an organism that demonstrates the necessary\nresistance for the treatment method, as determined by the department. The\nindicators must: (i) have a minimum\nconcentration of 6 log 10 spores. The concentration must be higher and more\nthermally resistant than the bioburden routinely associated with the\nwaste; (ii)\ninclude a supplier's\ncertificate of performance that identifies the organism (genus, species, strain\nand population) and, for thermal treatment systems, the D-value and the\nZ-value. The D-value must be 1.8 minutes and the Z-value must be no less than\n50 degrees Fahrenheit (10 degrees Celsius); (iii)\nbe appropriate for the type of RMW and\ndevice (i.e., self-contained, suspension or paper strip), including the shelf\nlife, the carrier material and primary packaging, the culture medium for\nself-contained biological indicators and the media, growth and culture\nconditions for non-self-contained biological indicators; (iv)\nbe compatible with the treatment process\nand have a resistance relative to the temperature, pressures, conditions, chemicals or irradiation used in the process, the infectious agents on a\nsubstrate, the type and density of the waste to be treated and its\npackaging; (v) be placed throughout\nthe RMW load during each validation test, including at the coldest point in the\ntreatment system. The department may also require alternative and/or\nsupplemental indicators (e.g., thermocouples, etc.) to demonstrate chemical\nsaturation, heat penetration or irradiation exposure and effectiveness of\ntreatment; (vi)\ncomply with the\nfollowing number of biological indicators in each validation test load: (a) three biological indicators per cycle for\n0-110 pounds of RMW per load; (b) five biological indicators per cycle for 111-550 pounds of RMW per\nload; (c) seven biological\nindicators per cycle for 551-1100 pounds of RMW per load; (d) nine biological indicators per cycle for\n1101-1650 pounds of RMW per load; (e) 11 or more, as determined by the\ndepartment, biological indicators per cycle for any treatment system greater\nthan 1650 pounds of RMW per load; and\n(f) one or more controls from the same lot or\nbatch; (vii)\nbe wrapped\nin a paper towel and encased in cotton batting or in another carrier system\ndesigned to mimic the thermal resistance in the RMW before placement into the\npackage to be treated with the RMW. Materials used to hold the indicator units\nmust be similar to the RMW to be treated, provide effective protection from\nbreakage, be loose in the bulk of the RMW and be easily retrievable at the end\nof each validation run; and\n(viii)\nbe wrapped in a thick layer of cotton, wool, or equivalent to prevent direct\nconduction of heat from the metal if metal containers are used to contain the\nindicators. (3)\n\nBiological indicators requiring microbial bioassay to confirm efficacy must be\nquantitatively analyzed after the treatment cycle. All self-contained\nbiological indicators used for test runs must be qualitatively analyzed for\ncolor change following incubation. (4)\n\nUnless otherwise approved by the\ndepartment, the laboratory used to analyze the results of the validation test\nmust be independent of the facility owner or operator. No less than one-third\nof the biological indicators used during each validation test run must be\nanalyzed by an independent laboratory. (5)\n\nThe system must employ process monitoring\nconcurrent with biological indicators, including devices and instrumentation to\nrecord temperature and/or other critical operating parameters. (6)\n\nVerification testing for commercially\npurchased biological indicators. Each lot or batch of biological indicators\nwith a stated population must be tested prior to use at the facility. Each\nverification test must use a minimum of three indicators from the same lot or\nbatch that must be sent to an independent laboratory. (7)\n\nAll commercially-purchased biological\nindicators must be stored in accordance with the manufacturer's\nspecifications. (8)\n\nCommercially-purchased indicators in the form of paper strips must not be used\nin devices or areas where fluids can pool or puddle around the biological\nindicator. Self-contained biological indicators with vent caps must not be used\nwhere liquids may accumulate and contaminate the indicators. (j) Repeat validation testing. Validation testing must be repeated when any of the following occurs. The\ndepartment must be notified before validation occurs. (1)\nfailure of any treatment process\noperational parameters such as time, temperature, or pressure during\nvalidation; (2)\nfailure to achieve\nmicrobial inactivation and treatment in at least 95 percent of the biological\nindicators during each treatment cycle during validation; (3)\nany modifications to the treatment\nprocess operational parameters; (4)\na treatment device has been operational without a repeat validation for at\nleast five years; or\n(5)\nthe\ntreatment device has not been used for at least one year. (k) RMW treatment system operation\nrequirements\n(1)\n\nThe facility must use\ncontrols appropriate for the treatment system (e.g., real time monitoring\ndevices that record process feed rate or flow, cycle time, pressure, temperature, pH, chemical or irradiation levels, etc.). (2)\n\nBiological monitors (e.g., thermochemical\nindicators and integrators such as autoclave tape, paper strips or small\nampoules, thermocouples, wireless data loggers, etc., or other monitors\nsuitable for the treatment technology) must be placed in or on the outside of\nRMW containers and distributed throughout the load, chamber, or vessel during\ntreatment. (3)\n\nBio-challenge\ntesting is required with each load for biocontainment facilities at BSL 3 or\n4. (4)\n\nLoading devices must be\nautomated or, if mechanical, designed and operated to maintain the integrity of\nthe container being loaded into a treatment device. (5)\n\nProcess control instruments must be\nmaintained in operable condition. All process instruments must be calibrated at\nthe intervals recommended by the manufacturer, but not less than once per\nyear. (6)\nA general facility\ninspection must be undertaken at least annually to determine the operating\ncondition of the process and control equipment. The annual inspection must be\nperformed by a qualified individual such as a certified industrial hygienist or\nbiosafety specialist, or a licensed professional engineer not affiliated with\nthe facility. The results of the inspection must be included in the annual\nreport. (7)\n\nAll emptied reusable\nRMW containers must be appropriately washed and disinfected after each use and\nfacility equipment used for handling and processing the waste must be cleaned\nand decontaminated whenever it is visibly soiled or contaminated. (8)\n\nIf a treatment system fails to operate in\naccordance with the permitted and acceptable operating parameters (time, temperature, pressure, or chemical concentration), or if more than 5% of the\nbiological indicators used during the treatment cycle fail or show growth, the\nfacility must: (i) discontinue use of the\nsystem, using emergency shutdown procedures if appropriate, until corrective\naction has been taken and then repeat the treatment cycle. Repeat validation or\nbio-challenge testing must be performed to verify that effective treatment can\nresume; (ii)\nensure that all RMW\nthat was processed by the system since the last run when the unit was in\ncompliance, is identified as untreated RMW and document that the RMW was\nproperly retreated; (iii)\ndocument\nthe failure, including date and system identifier; (iv)\ndocument the facility response, including corrective action; and\n(v) whenever a facility has reason to believe\nuntreated RMW certified as treated RMW has left the facility, notify the waste\ntransporter, the receiving facility, and the department as soon as\npracticable. (l) An operation log must be maintained for\neach treatment device. The log must record the date, time, name of operator, the type and amount of RMW treated, operating parameters, and the dates and\nresults of calibration and testing. These records may be maintained\nelectronically. (m) Sharps\nconsolidation. Sharps consolidation prior to treatment must be conducted as\nfollows. (1)\n\nReusable sharps containers\nprocessed at the facility must be processed with an automated or mechanical\ndelidder and dumping system. Lids may not be removed manually. (2)\n\nReusable sharps containers and transport\ncages must be mechanically cleaned with an appropriate disinfectant prior to\nreuse. (3)\n\nReusable sharps\ncontainers must be approved by the USFDA for reuse. (4)\n\nReusable sharps containers removed from\nservice must be managed as RMW or, if proposed to be recycled, cleaned and\ndecontaminated. (5)\n\nAll reusable\ncontainers, including sharps containers, must be tested using bio-challenge\ntests on an annual basis, in a manner approved by the department. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
