Such person may also be subject to the criminal penalties\nprescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law. Cross-references: For registration procedures see Part 539 of this Title. For\nexpiration of certificates of authority and registration renewals see Part 540\nof this Title. For persons required to collect tax, see section\n526.11\nof this Title. For bulk sales, see Part 537 of this Title. For tax on hotel\noccupancy, see section\n527.9\nof this Title. For tax on amusement charges, see sections\n527.10\nthrough\n527.12\nof this Title. (b) Registration of show\nvendors. Every person who has no permanent place of business in the\n\nState who intends to display for sale or sell tangible personal property or\nservices subject to tax at a flea market, craft show, antique show, coin show, stamp show, comic book show, fair, or any similar show in the State must file a\ncertificate of registration for a certificate of authority in accordance with\n\nPart 539 of this Title. (c) Registering and applying for a permit to operate a show. (1)\n\nEvery person who intends to be a promoter\nof a show must file a notice of show and application for show permit with the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance to obtain a show permit. (2)\nA\nshow\nis a flea market, craft show, antique show, coin show, stamp show, comic book show, fair, and any\nsimilar show held on a regular or temporary basis at which more than one vendor\ndisplays for sale or sells tangible personal property or services subject to\ntax. (i) For purposes of determining the\nexistence of a show, the permanent nature of the premises or structure in which\nthe activity is held is not relevant. Instead, it is the transient nature of\nthe vendors which is relevant. Accordingly, when there are two or more vendors\noperating on the same premises, and two or more vendors have leases or licenses\nto use such premises for a period of less than one year or where the leases or\nlicenses to use may be cancelled on notice of less than 30 days, then a show is\npresumed to exist for all purposes of this Part. Another fact which indicates\nthe existence of a show is where the vendors regularly remove their merchandise\nfrom the premises at the close of each business day. (ii)\n\nIf no taxable tangible personal property\nor services are displayed for sale or sold, then the activity is not a show for\npurposes of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nSales of food and drink for consumption on the premises, although taxable, will\nnot be considered for purposes of determining the existence of a show. Further, admission charges for games of chance or skill, like those typically operated\non a carnival midway will not be considered for purposes of determining the\nexistence of a show. Example 1: A market, where the only items for sale are nontaxable\nfruits and vegetables, is not a show for purposes of this subdivision. Example 2: A market which consists of many stands selling nontaxable\nfruits and vegetables and, as well, two stands selling taxable beverages and\nprepared food for consumption on the premises is not a show for purposes of\nthis subdivision. Example 3: A market which consists of many stands selling nontaxable\nfruits and vegetables and, as well, two booths selling cut flowers and\nvegetable plants, which are subject to sales tax, is a show. (3)\nA\npromoter\nis\nany person who: (i) directly or indirectly\nrents, leases or grants a license to use space to any person for the conduct of\nmore than three shows in a calendar year; or\n(ii)\noperates more than three shows in a\ncalendar year. A\npromoter\nmay also be a person required\nto collect sales tax within the meaning of section\n1131 (1)\nof the Tax Law and\nthe related provisions of section\n526.11\nof this Title. A person may be a promoter with respect to show vendors\noperating on his premises, and at the same time not a promoter with respect to\nvendors who have permanent places of business on the same premises. For the\npurposes of determining whether three shows have been held, the conduct of a\nshow on one day alone or up to seven consecutive days shall constitute a single\nshow. If there is more than one person involved in the organization or\noperation of a show who is within the definition of\npromoter, then all such persons must file a single notice of show and application for\nshow permit as copromoters. Example 1: A, the owner of the X shopping mall, leases an area in the\nmall to B for the purpose of holding a flea market on each of five weekends\nduring the year. B intends to sublease space to individual show vendors. If\nneither A nor B is involved in organizing or operating any show other than at\nthe X shopping mall, then, after the third weekend the flea market is held, both A and B are promoters subject to this subdivision. While A, the owner of\nthe X mall, is a promoter with respect to the show vendors participating in the\nflea market, A is not a promoter with respect to the permanent vendors of the X\nmall. Example 2: A, the owner of the X shopping mall, leases area in the\nmall to B for the purpose of holding a flea market on the first weekend of\n\nJuly. B intends to sublease portions of the mall area to individual show\nvendors. A is not involved in organizing or operating any other show during the\ncalendar year. B, however, will operate similar shows on three weekends during\n\nJune at a location other than the X shopping mall. With regard to the flea\nmarket at the X shopping mall, A is not a promoter, but B is a promoter subject\nto this subdivision. (4)\n\nPromoters must file a notice of show and\nan application for show permit 10 days prior to the opening of the fourth\nshow. (5)\n\nThe application for show\npermit should be filed with the New York State Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance, Sales Tax Registration Unit, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY\n12227. (6)\n\nPromoters must file\nseparate applications for show permits for each location at which a show or\nshows are to be held. However, promoters may file a single application for\nmultiple shows held at a single location. A separate application must be\nsubmitted for any show not listed on a show application previously filed. A\npermit to operate a show may not be amended. (7)\n\nThe applicant must submit the following\ninformation: (i) name and address of the\napplicant; (ii)\ndate(s) of\nshow(s); (iii)\nlocation of\nshow(s); (iv)\nname, address and\nsocial security number of each officer of a corporation; (v) name and address of each co-promoter; and\n(vi)\nany additional information\nwhich may be requested. (8)\n\nThe Department of Taxation and Finance\nwill, within five days after the receipt of an application for show permit, issue to the promoter, without charge, a permit to operate such show. (9)\n\nFailure to comply with any of the\nrequirements for promoters may, after an opportunity for a hearing has been\nafforded, result in the revocation of all existing show permits and the denial\nof any show permits for up to six months. In addition, any person failing to\nfile a notice of show, or operating a show without a permit, or allowing a show\non his property without a permit, may be subject to the criminal penalties\nprescribed by section\n1817\nof the Tax Law. (10)\n\nAny promoter, who is also a person\nrequired to register with the Department of Taxation and Finance to obtain a\ncertificate of authority, must comply with all requirements relating to such\nstatus, as well as with the requirements governing promoters. (d) Display of certificates\nand permits. (1)\n\nEach certificate of\nauthority must be prominently displayed at each place of business of the\nregistrant. A registrant who has no fixed place of doing business must attach\nsuch certificate to the registrant's cart, stand, truck, or other merchandising\ndevice. Example 1: A certificate of authority that is attached to a vendor's\ncash register, placed in his store window or at his customer relations counter, is considered properly displayed. Example 2: A certificate of authority which is located in a vendor's\nprivate office or some other place that is not accessible and visible to the\nvendor's customers is not properly displayed. Example 3: A vendor who owns a craft shop and who holds a valid\ncertificate of authority also appears with his merchandise at a craft show in\nan armory. The vendor is required to obtain a duplicate certificate of\nauthority (see section\n539.2\n[b]\nof this Title), and to display it at the stand at which he is displaying or\nselling merchandise at the armory. (2)\n\nPromoters are required to prominently\ndisplay the permit to operate a show at the main entrance to the show. If the\nnotice of show has been filed by the promoter and the permit has not been\nreceived prior to the opening of the show, the requirement with respect to\nobtaining and displaying such permit is deemed to have been complied with\nunless and until the promoter receives a notice sent by registered or certified\nmail from the Department of Taxation and Finance denying the application for a\npermit. (3)\nA vending machine\noperator may, in lieu of placing a certificate of authority on each vending\nmachine, place a card on each vending machine, in a location visible to the\ncustomer, which contains the name, address and number that appear on the\nvendor's certificate of authority. (4)\nA show promoter must not permit any\nperson to display for sale or sell tangible personal property or services\nsubject to tax at a show unless such person has obtained a certificate of\nauthority and properly displays such certificate. (5)\n\nAny person failing to display a\ncertificate of authority may be subject to the civil and criminal penalties\nprescribed, respectively, by sections\n1145 (a)(4)\nand\n1817\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (e) Amending\nthe certificate of authority or the certificate of registration.

Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227, within 20 days if any of the\nfollowing changes are made: (i) there is a\nchange in the form of the business; (ii)\nthere is a change in the name of the\nbusiness; (iii)\nthere is a change\nin the address of the business, including an additional place of business at a\nnew location; (iv)\nthere is a\nchange in the name or address of an owner; (v) there is a change in the responsible\npersons of the business, including those responsible for collecting or paying\ntax (as such persons are described in section\n539.2\n[h][2]\nof this Title); (vi)\nthere is a\nchange in trade name; or\n(vii)\nthere is a change in business activity. (2)\n\nAny person failing to furnish data with\nrespect to changes in any of the information listed on a registration\ncertificate may be subject to the penalty provisions of section 1817 of article\n37 of the Tax Law. (f) Surrender of certificates and permits. (1)\n\nCertificates of authority must be\nsurrendered to the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance, Sales Tax\n\nRegistration Unit, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227 within 20 days of the\nregistrant's ceasing to do business, and must accompany the final return. Ceasing to do business\nmeans that the registrant is no longer\noperating the business even though the business may continue. Cross-reference: For final returns, see section\n533.3\n(e) of this Part. (2)\n\nUpon\nsurrendering the certificate of authority, the vendor must complete the reverse\nside of the certificate and indicate the details of the sale or other\ndisposition of the business. Where a certificate of authority has been lost, stolen, destroyed or is otherwise unreturnable to the department, the owner, partner or responsible officer of a vendor which was issued such certificate is\nrequired to notify the Sales Tax Registration Unit that such certificate cannot\nbe returned, setting forth the specific reasons for such failure. The\nnotification must be in written form, signed by the owner, partner or\nresponsible officer and received within 20 days of the registrant's ceasing to\ndo business. (3)\nA show vendor must\nsurrender the vendor's certificate of authority to the New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance, together with a final return of the vendor, within 20 days after the termination of the vendor's business. A show vendor's\nbusiness is terminated when the vendor no longer participates in shows in New\n\nYork State. (4)\n\nAny person who\nassigns or transfers a certificate of authority or who fails to surrender a\ncertificate of authority may be subject to the criminal penalties prescribed by\nsection\n1817\nof the Tax Law. Example 1: Mr. Brown has operated a flower shop for 25 years as a sole\nproprietorship. He decides to retire and give the shop to his daughter. His\ndaughter will continue to operate the shop as a sole proprietorship. Mr. Brown\nmust surrender his certificate of authority, and his daughter is required to\nobtain a new certificate in her name. Example 2: A vendor sells his business to another who will operate the\nbusiness under the same name.
