(a) As used in this section: \"patient\" means a person admitted to a hospital or school in\nthe department and retained therein on an involuntary basis pursuant to the\nprovisions of this chapter. \"dangerous\" means that a patient has committed or is liable to\ncommit an act or acts which, if committed by a person criminally responsible\nfor his conduct, would constitute homicide or felonious assault or is so\ndangerously mentally disabled that his presence in the department hospital or\nschool is dangerous to the safety of other patients therein, to the officers or\nemployees thereof, or to the community. (b) The director of any hospital or school in the department\nmay, upon order of the commissioner and after notice to the patient and the\nmental health information service, make application to the supreme court or\ncounty court within the county wherein such facility is located or to the\nsupreme court in the judicial district wherein such county is located for an\norder of examination of an allegedly dangerous patient at such hospital or\nschool. Such examination shall be conducted by two examining physicians, other\nthan a physician connected with such hospital or school, to be designated by\nthe court. Each physician, if satisfied, after a personal examination, that\nsuch patient is dangerous shall make a certificate to that effect. (c) Upon such certificate of the examining physicians being so\nmade, it shall be delivered to the director of the facility, who shall\nforthwith apply by petition to the court which ordered the examination, annexing such certificate to his petition, for an order committing such\nallegedly dangerous patient to an appropriate institution in the state\ndepartment of correction. Written notice of such application, together with a\ncopy of the petition, shall be served upon the allegedly dangerous patient\npersonally, upon the mental health information service, and upon either the\nwife husband, father, mother, or nearest relative of such patient or, if there\nbe no such relative within the state, upon any known friend of the patient. Such service shall be made at least five days in advance of the return date if\nservice is effected personally or at least eight days in advance of the return\ndate if service is effected by mail. If there be no such known relative or\nfriend within the state, the giving of such notice shall be dispensed with, but\nin such care the petition and the order of commitment shall recite the reasons\nwhy service of such notice on a relative or friend of the allegedly dangerous\npatient was dispensed with. (d) The court to which such application for the commitment of\nthe allegedly dangerous patient has been made shall order a hearing. The date\nof such hearing shall be fixed at a time not more than five days from the date\non which the application is received by the court. Such allegedly dangerous\npatient shall be represented by counsel in any such proceedings. The court\nshall hear the testimony introduced by the parties and shall examine such\nallegedly dangerous patient, if deemed advisable in or out of court, and render\na decision in writing as to such patient's dangerousness. If it be determined\nthat such patient is dangerous, the court shall forthwith issue its order\ncommitting such patient to an appropriate institution in the state department\nof correction for a period not to exceed six months from the date of such\norder. The director of the department facility shall thereupon cause such\ndangerous patient to be delivered to such institution in the department of\ncorrection and such dangerous patient shall be received into such institution\nand retained there until the expiration of the period of authorized retention\nprovided for in the order of commitment or in any further order issued pursuant\nto this section. If such patient is no longer dangerous to safety, he shall be\nreleased prior to the expiration of any such period in the manner provided in\nsectionsection four hundred nine of the correction law or, if he is in need of\ncontinued care and treatment, he may be transferred to an in-patient hospital\nor school in the department of mental hygiene upon the order of the\ncommissioner of mental hygiene. If the director of the facility\nIV\nin the department of mental hygiene shall deem that the\ncondition of a patient so transferred is in need of continued retention, he\nshall apply to the supreme court or county court prior to the expiration of\nsixty days from the date of such transfer for an order authorizing continued\nretention in accordance with the provisions of this chapter relating to\napplication for court authorization for retention of such a mentally ill or\nmentally retarded patient. (e) If the director or person in charge of the institution in\nthe correction department to which the dangerous patient has been committed\npursuant to this section shall deem that the condition of such patient requires\nhis further retention in such institution because of his dangerousness, he\nshall apply during the period of retention authorized by the last order of the\ncourt for an order authorizing the continued retention of such patient. The\nprovisions of this chapter which apply to applications for orders authorizing\nthe retention or further continued retention of a patient in a hospital or a\nschool shall apply except that, in addition to the need for retention for\nmental illness or mental retardation, the question of the continued\ndangerousness of such patient shall be determined. If it be determined that the\npatient is no longer in need of retention or is no longer dangerous, the court\nmay order the discharge of the patient or it may order the transfer of the\npatient to a facility in the department. (f) Any court order of commitment or court order authorizing\nretention or continued retention pursuant to this section is subject to review\nin accordance with section 31.35 of this chapter in the case of a mentally ill\nperson or in accordance with section 33.35 of this chapter in the case of a\nmentally retarded person. (g) Orders for commitment or authorizing retention pursuant to\nthis section shall not be deemed as, or received in any court in evidence of, the commission of a crime by the patient so committed nor shall such commitment\nbe deemed or considered as punishment for a crime. (h) The costs necessarily incurred, under this section, in\ndetermining the dangerousness of such patient, including fees of the examiners, fees of the medical witnesses, and any other necessary expenses allowed by the\ncourt, shall be a charge upon the county from which such person was originally\ncertified, but in the city of New York, the court shall order such costs\naudited and allowed by the comptroller from the court fund and charged to the\nproper county within the said city. (i) During the pendency of such proceeding the court may\nforthwith order the commitment of such allegedly dangerous patient to an\nappropriate institution in the department of correction upon petition and the\naffidavit of two examining physicians that the director of the hospital or\nschool is not able to properly care for such patient at the facility where he\nis confined and that such patient is in need of immediate treatment. (j) The notices provided for herein may be served by registered\nmail on all persons required to be served other than the allegedly dangerous\npatient.
