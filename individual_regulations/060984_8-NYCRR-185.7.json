  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 185.7 - Replacing original records with microforms or electronic images\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Negative\nmicrophotographic film. When a microform will replace an original record having\na legal minimum retention period of 10 years or longer and when the local\ngovernment still must maintain it for at least 10 years to meet this\nrequirement, or when the records being microphotographed are identified on a\nrecords retention and disposition schedule as having a permanent retention\nperiod, only a polyester-based black and white silver gelatin microform shall\nbe used as the original camera negative film. (b) Preservation of the camera negative. When\na microform will replace an original record, the camera negative shall be used\nonly to produce duplicate copies of the film. Once the duplicates have been\nmade, the camera negative film must be placed in an offsite storage facility\nthat meets standards established by the Commissioner of Education for security, fire protection and environmental control to ensure the preservation of the\ninformation on the microform. (c) Microforms to meet quality standards. When a microform will replace an original\nrecord, the microform shall meet quality standards established by the\ncommissioner for resolution and density to ensure that the film and copies made\nfrom it will be clear and legible and to ensure the long-term viability of the\nfilm. (d) Targeting and\ncertification of microforms. When a microform will replace an original record, the following measures must be taken to ensure access to the information\ncontained on the microform, and the quality and legal admissibility of the\nmicroform itself: (1)\n\nThe records to be\nfilmed shall be arranged and identified to ensure reasonable access to\nindividual documents. (2)\n\nEach\ndiscrete roll of original negative film and each discrete original negative\nfiche shall begin with a target identifying the records being filmed and\ncertifying that the records are being filmed in the normal course of business. Each shall end with a signed declaration by the camera operator identifying the\ndate of filming and the office for whom the film is being produced. (3)\n\nIn addition, each roll of film must have\nthe following targets at the beginning of the roll: density target, resolution\ntarget and start target. (4)\n\nIn\naddition, each roll of film shall have an end target at the end of each\nroll. (5)\n\nWhere needed, roll film\nshall contain retake and correction targets. (e) Inspection of microforms. A\nrepresentative sample of all microforms shall be quality inspected to ensure\nthat the film images meet quality standards set by the commissioner. Each batch\nof processed film shall be tested to ensure that processing chemicals which\ncould cause image deterioration are washed from the film. Film and film images\nthat do not meet standards must be reshot before the original document may be\ndestroyed. (f) Digital images of\npublic records. Digital images of public records may be stored on electronic\nmedia, and such electronic records may replace paper originals or micrographic\ncopies of these records. In order to ensure accessibility and intelligibility\nfor the life of these records, local governments must follow the procedures\ndescribed in section\n185.8\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§\n185.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
