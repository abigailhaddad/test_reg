  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 450.2 - Premium rates\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe rates for workers' compensation and employer's liability, disability benefits, volunteer ambulance and volunteer firefighters' benefit\ninsurance shall be fixed as low as possible consistent with the maintenance of\na solvent fund and reasonable reserves and surplus. For such purpose the rate\nmanual and rating plans and classifications established and promulgated by the\n\nCompensation Insurance Rating Board and approved by the Superintendent of\n\nInsurance pursuant to, and under the authority of the Insurance Law, are hereby\nadopted insofar as they are consistent with article 6 of the Workers'\nCompensation Law. Such rate manual and rating plans as applied to the standard\nrisks insured with the State Fund may be modified to permit the application of\nsuch initial discount in rates and to permit other reductions in net costs of\ninsurance as, in the judgment of the commissioners, or under their direction, seem to be appropriate consistent with the financial status of the State Fund; and similarly, for nonstandard risks, such rate manual and rating plans may be\nmodified to permit the application of increased rates as may reflect the\npeculiar hazards of each individual risk. The term standard risk shall refer to\na risk whose indicated accident and moral hazards approximate the normal\nhazards of the risk's governing classification. Rates for disability benefits\nshall be fixed as low as possible in accordance with the Insurance\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n450.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
