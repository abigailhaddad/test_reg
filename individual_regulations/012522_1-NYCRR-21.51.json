  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 21.51 - Net pool obligation of any other marketer\n\nState Regulations\n\nOn or before the 25th day after the end of the month\n(except as provided in section\n21.92\nof this Part) a marketer who\ndistributes packaged fluid milk products into the Western New York Milk\n\nMarketing Area (other than by receipt at a pool plant) which fluid milk\nproducts are not otherwise priced under this Part, by a Federal Milk Marketing\n\nOrder, or by a State government's milk classification and pricing program that\nsubjects the marketer's plant to market-wide pooling of producer returns shall\npay to the commissioner for the equalization fund the amount computed pursuant\nto subdivision (a) of this section or, if the marketer submits the applicable\ninformation required pursuant to section\n21.20\nof this Part, the marketer\nmay elect to pay the amount computed pursuant to subdivision (b) of this\nsection. A marketer whose plant is subject to market-wide pooling of producer\nreturns under a State government's milk classification and pricing program\nshall pay the amount computed pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (a) The payment under this\nsubdivision shall be an amount resulting from the following computations: (1)\n\nFrom the plant's route disposition in the\nmarketing area: (i) subtract receipts of\nfluid milk products classified as Class I milk from pool plants, plants fully\nregulated under Federal orders, and including such receipts from collecting\ncooperatives which have arranged to make the reports and payments with respect\nto the milk of producers each month, except those receipts subtracted under a\nsimilar provision of a Federal milk order; (ii)\nsubtract receipts of fluid milk products\nfrom another nonpool plant that is not a plant fully regulated under a Federal\norder to the extent that an equivalent amount of fluid milk products disposed\nof to the nonpool plant by marketers fully regulated under any Federal order is\nclassified and priced as Class I milk and is not used as an offset for any\npayment obligation under any order; and\n(iii)\nsubtract the pounds of reconstituted\nmilk made from non-fluid milk products which are disposed of as route\ndisposition in the marketing area. (2)\n\nCompute a Class I differential price by\nsubtracting the Class III price from the current month's Class I price. Multiply the pounds remaining after the computation in subparagraph (1)(iii) of\nthis subdivision by the amount by which the Class I differential price exceeds\nthe producer price differential, both prices to be applicable at the location\nof the marketer's plant except that neither the adjusted Class I differential\nprice nor the adjusted producer price differential shall be less than\nzero. (3)\n\nUnless the payment option\ndescribed in subdivision (d) of this section is selected, add the amount\nobtained from multiplying the pounds of labeled reconstituted milk included in\nsubparagraph (1)(iii) of this subdivision by any positive difference between\nthe Class I price applicable at the location of the plant (less $1.00 if the\nreconstituted milk is labeled as such) and the Class IV price. (b) The payment under this\nsubdivision shall be the amount resulting from the following computations: (1)\n\nDetermine the value that would have been\ncomputed pursuant to section\n21.50\nof this Part for the plant if\nthe plant had been a pool plant, subject to the following modifications: (i) fluid milk products and bulk fluid cream\nproducts received at the plant from pool plants, plants which are fully\nregulated under a Federal order, and including such receipts from collecting\ncooperatives which have arranged to make the reports and payments with respect\nto the milk of producers each month shall be allocated at the plant to the same\nclass in which such products were classified at the fully regulated\nplant; (ii)\nfluid milk products and\nbulk fluid cream products transferred from the plant to pool plants or plants\nwhich are fully regulated under a Federal order shall be classified at the\nplant in the class to which allocated at the fully regulated plant. Such\ntransfers shall be allocated to the extent possible to those receipts at the\nplant from pool plants and plants fully regulated under Federal orders that are\nclassified in the corresponding class pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. Any such transfers remaining after the above allocation which are in\n\nClass I and for which a value is computed pursuant to section\n21.50\nof this Part of similar\nsections of another order for the plant shall be priced at the statistical\nuniform price or uniform price, whichever is applicable, of the respective\norder regulating the handling of milk at the receiving plant, with such\nstatistical uniform price or uniform price adjusted to the location of the\nnonpool plant (but not to be less than the lowest announced class price of the\nrespective order); and\n(iii)\nif the\noperator of the plant so requests, the marketer's value of milk determined\npursuant to section\n21.50\nof this Part shall include a\nvalue of milk determined for each nonpool plant that is not a plant fully\nregulated under a Federal order which serves as a supply plant for the plant by\nmaking shipments to the plant during the month equivalent to the requirements\nof section 7(c) of a Federal order subject to the following conditions: (a) the operator of the plant submits with\nits reports filed pursuant to section\n21.20\nof this Part similar reports\nfor each such nonpool supply plant; (b) the operator of the nonpool plant\nmaintains books and records showing the utilization of all skim milk and\nbutterfat received at the plant which are made available if requested by the\ncommissioner for verification purposes; and\n(c) the value of milk determined pursuant to\nsection\n21.50\nof this Part for the\nunregulated supply plant shall be determined in the same manner prescribed for\ncomputing the obligation of the plant. (2)\n\nFrom the plant's value of milk computed\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision subtract: (i) the gross payments that were made for\nmilk that would have been producer milk had the plant been fully\nregulated; (ii)\nsubparagraph\n(1)(iii) of this subdivision applies, the gross payments by the operator of the\nnonpool supply plant for milk received at the plant during the month that would\nhave been producer milk if the plant had been fully regulated; and\n(iii)\nthe payments by the operator of the\nplant to the producer-settlement fund of a Federal order under which the plant\nis a partially regulated distributing plant and, if subparagraph (1)(iii) of\nthis subdivision applies, payments made by the operator of the nonpool supply\nplant to the producer-settlement fund of any Federal order. (c) The operator of a\nplant that is subject to market-wide pooling of returns under a milk\nclassification and pricing program that is imposed under the authority of a\n\nState government shall pay on or before the 25th day after the end of the month\n(except as provided in section\n21.92\nof this Part) to the market\nadministrator for the equalization fund an amount computed as follows: After\ncompleting the computations described in subparagraph (a)(1)(ii) of this\nsection, determine the value of the remaining pounds of fluid milk products\ndisposed of as route disposition in the marketing area by multiplying the\nhundredweight of such pounds by the amount, if greater than zero, that remains\nafter subtracting the State program's class prices applicable to such products\nat the plant's location from the Class I price applicable at the location of\nthe plant pursuant to section\n21.42\nof this Part. (d) Any marketer may elect to compute its net\npool obligation pursuant to this section with respect to receipts of nonfluid\nmilk ingredients that are reconstituted for fluid use. Payments may be made to\nthe producer-settlement fund of the order regulating the producer milk used to\nproduce the nonfluid milk ingredients at the positive difference between the\n\nClass I price applicable under the other order at the location of the plant\nwhere the nonfluid milk ingredients were processed and the Class IV price. This\npayment option shall apply only if a majority of the total milk received at the\nplant that processed the nonfluid milk ingredients is regulated under one or\nmore Federal orders and payment may only be made to the producer-settlement\nfund of the order pricing a plurality of the milk used to produce the nonfluid\nmilk ingredients. This payment option shall not apply if the source of the\nnonfluid ingredients used in reconstituted fluid milk products cannot be\ndetermined by the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
