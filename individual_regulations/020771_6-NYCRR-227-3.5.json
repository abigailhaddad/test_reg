  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-3.5 - Compliance options\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Ozone\nseason stop. An owner or operator of an existing SCCT may opt to\ncomply with this Subpart by not operating the SCCT during the ozone season. The\nozone season stop provision must be included as an enforceable permit condition\nin a final permit or permit modification issued prior to the applicable\ncompliance deadline of this Subpart. (b) Electric storage and renewable\nenergy resources. An owner or operator of an SCCT may opt to comply with\nthis Subpart by meeting the following weighted average output-based emission\nlimits on a daily basis pursuant to the following: (1)\n\nOwners and operators must meet the\nfollowing facility-level daily weighted average emission limits on a pounds of\nNO\nx\nper megawatt hour (lb/MWh) basis for all applicable\nSCCTs, electric storage resources and/or renewable generation resources at a\nfacility. (i) By May 1, 2023: Emission Limit (lb\nNO\nx\n/MWh)\n\nAll SCCTs\n3.0\n(ii)\n\nBy May 1, 2025: Fuel Type\n\nEffective Daily Emission Limit\n(lb NO\nx\n/MWh)\n\nGaseous fuels\n1.5\n\nDistillate oil or other liquid\nfuel\n2.0\n(2)\n\nThe owner or operator of an SCCT that\nuses electric storage or renewable energy resources to inject electricity to\nthe transmission and distribution system may demonstrate compliance with the\napplicable effective daily NO\nx\nemission limits by\nincluding the electrical energy, in MWh, injected to the transmission and\ndistribution system from electric storage and/or renewable generation resources\nin the emission rate calculation provided that: (i) the renewable generation resource and/or\nthe electric storage resource must be directly connected to the same physical\nsubstation as the SCCT with which it is being averaged; or\n(ii)\nwithin one-half mile radius of the SCCT\nwith which it is being averaged; (iii)\nall sources that are averaged under\nthis compliance option must be under common control. (3)\n\nThe effective emission rate may be\ncalculated by: (i) Effective Rate =\nClick\nto view image\n(a) MassNO\nx\n= NO\nx\nemissions (pounds)\neach day from all applicable SCCTs at the permitted facility. (b) MWhCT = electrical energy delivered to\nthe transmission and distribution system (in MWh) from applicable SCCTs at the\npermitted facility each day. (c) MWhST = electrical energy delivered to the transmission and distribution system\n(in MWh) from storage resources over each day. (d) MWhRE = electrical energy delivered to\nthe transmission and distribution system (in MWh) from renewable generation\neach day. (4)\n\nIf the owner or operator burns both gaseous fuel and liquid fuel during the\nsame day, a facility electrical energy (MWh) weighted average must be\ncalculated to determine a resultant mix fuel emission rate. The mix fuel rate\nmust first be calculated to determine the allowable emission rate and then\ncalculated again to determine the actual mix fuel emission rate. (i) Allowable Mix Fuel Rate =\nRateGxGenG+Rate0xGen0\n/\nGenG+Gen0\nwhere: (a) RateG = Effective daily emission\nlimit (lb NO\nx\n/MWh) burning gas as defined in subdivision\n(b) of this section. (b) RateO =\nEffective daily emission limit (lb NO\nx\n/MWh) burning oil\nas defined in subdivision (b) of this section. (c) GenG = electrical energy (MWh) generated\nburning gas each day. (d) GenO =\nelectrical energy (MWh) generated burning oil each day. (ii)\n\nActual Mix Fuel Rate =\nRateGxGenG+Rate0xGen0\n/\nGenG+Gen0+GenR+GenS\nwhere: (a) RateG = lb\nNO\nx\n/MWh burning gas. (b) RateO = lb NO\nx\n/MWh\nburning oil. (c) GenG = electrical\nenergy (MWh) generated burning gas each day. (d) GenO = electrical energy (MWh) generated\nburning oil each day. (e) GenR =\nelectrical energy (MWh) injected to the transmission and distribution system\nfrom renewable energy resources each day. (f) GenS = electrical energy (MWh) injected\nto the transmission and distribution system from electric storage resources\neach day. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
