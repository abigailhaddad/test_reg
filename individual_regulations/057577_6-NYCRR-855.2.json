  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 855.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In tables I and II of this Part an item number is\nassigned to each specifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in tables I and II of this Part shall mean that number or\nabbreviation which has been assigned to any specifically designated waters or\nportions thereof for the purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering or index system used to\nidentify specific waters of New York State was adapted from that used by the\n\nNew York State Conservation Department in its biological survey series of\nreports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name or an\nabbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Rondout-Wallkill River watershed and has been closely followed in\nconnection with the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of\nstreams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department\nat the time of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Rondout-Wallkill River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters Index No. Name\n\nExplanation\nH-139\n\nRondout River\n\nThe 139th tributary entering Hudson River at\n\nKingston (Maps 1, 2). H-139-14\n\nRondout Creek\n\nThe 14th tributary entering the Rondout River (Map\n3). H-139-14-38\n\nSandburg Creek\n\nThe 38th tributary entering Rondout Creek from\nsouth approximately 1.0 mile south of Napanoch (Maps 14, 16). H-139-14-38-3\n\nBeer Kill\n\nThe 3rd tributary entering Sandburg Creek from west\napproximately 0.5 mile north of Ellenville (Map 16). H-139-14-38-3-1\n\nWest Branch Beer Kill\n\nThe 1st tributary entering Beer Kill from west\napproximately 1.0 mile northwest of Ellenville (Map 16). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary\nand\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water\nwhich flows into any other stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or other body of\nsurface water referenced by such waters index number; where tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the specifically\ndesignated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface\nwater referenced by such waters index number and all tributaries and\nsubtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless\nexceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntables I and II of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the\nspecifically designated waters are generally known and which may appear on the\nreference maps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as\nfar as possible. (e) Description\nas appearing in tables I and II of this Part shall\nmean a brief indication as to the location of the specifically designated\nwaters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to\nwhich a particular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may\nalso include any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in tables I and II means map reference number and\nindicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein\ncompletely, or in part. on which the specifically designated waters and their\nindex numbers are shown. The following maps were produced from original maps\nwhich may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey. Map ref. no.
