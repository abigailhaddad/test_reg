(2)\n\nThe notice shall refer to the applicable provisions of the law under which action is proposed to be taken and the grounds therefor, but failure to make such reference shall not render the notice ineffective if the provider to whom it is addressed is thereby or otherwise reasonably apprised of such grounds.

(b) At least 10 days prior to the hearing date fixed in the notice, the provider may file an answer to any charges with the superintendent or noticing commissioner.
