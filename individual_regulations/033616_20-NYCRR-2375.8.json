  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2375.8 - Forms and instructions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe Division of Taxation\ncreates, and updates as need be, a multitude of forms and instructions\nnecessary for the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the Tax\n\nLaw, related statutes and the regulations adopted thereunder. As used in this\nsection, the phrase forms and instructions includes not only those documents\nthat are designed to facilitate voluntary compliance by guiding taxpayers\nstep-by-step through the procedures that are needed to accurately provide the\ndivision with required information and/or correctly pay the amount of taxes\ndue, but also includes administrative documents issued by the division such as\nthe statutory notices defined in section\n2376.1\n(c)(2)\nof this Title. Accordingly, forms and instructions include, but are not limited\nto, tax returns, informational reports, certificates, applications and the like\n(whether or not filed on hardcopy, magnetic media, electronically or otherwise)\nas well as assessment, denial, suspension and cancellation notices. (2)\n\nThe forms and instructions of the\ndivision are either specifically provided for or authorized by various\nprovisions throughout the Tax Law and the related statutes. (b) Dissemination. Generally, forms and instructions for use by taxpayers are distributed regularly by the\ndivision and are available on the department's website. Such forms and\ninstructions are also available upon individual requests. Failure on the part\nof any taxpayer to receive the necessary forms and instructions will not excuse\nthe taxpayer from the obligation to timely comply with the Tax Law, related\nstatutes and regulations thereunder. Certain widely used forms and instructions\nmay be provided by the division in bulk to various institutions (such as banks, libraries and post offices) and tax practitioners for dissemination to the\npublic. The forms and instructions that constitute the administrative documents\nthat are issued by the division are provided to affected taxpayers, when\nappropriate, in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Tax Law, related statutes and regulations thereunder. (c) Force and effect. All forms and\ninstructions of the division directly reflect the provisions of the underlying\nlaws and regulations. However, forms and instructions in themselves have no\nlegal effect, unless such effect is specifically provided for by law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2375.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
