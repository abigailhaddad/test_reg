  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 838.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation\nin its biological survey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The\nprimary waters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually\nreferred to by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are\nconsecutively numbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are\nnumbered consecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by\nthe letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Department of Environmental\n\nConservation in its biological survey of the Lake Erie-Niagara River watershed\nin 1928 and has been closely followed in connection with the identification of\nthe waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream numbers do not run\nconsecutively due to the omission of streams originally shown on older maps\nemployed by the Department of Environmental Conservation at the time of its\n1928 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Cattaraugus Creek drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nE\nLake Erie\n\nPrimary waters. E-23\n\nCattaraugus Creek\n\nThe 23rd tributary of Lake Erie proceeding\nconsecutively clockwise from its outlet at the Niagara River. E-23-48\n\nElton Creek\n\nThe 48th tributary entering Cattaraugus Creek\nupstream from its mouth. E-23-48-3\n\nLime Lake Outlet\n\nThe 3rd tributary entering Elton Creek upstream\nfrom its mouth. E-23-48-3-P 130\n\nLime Lake\n\nThe source of Lime Lake Outlet. The 130th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in the biological survey area of the Lake\n\nErie-Niagara River watershed. It is located on the 3rd tributary upstream from\nthe mouth of Elton Creek. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after\nthe waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of sections of waters to which a particular assignment\nof a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I means map reference number and indicates one or more of\nthe following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on which\nthe specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps which may be procured through\nthe Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref.

The symbol (T) appearing after any standard designation\nshall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved\noxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS)\nafter any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto.
