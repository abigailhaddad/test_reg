Tit. 21 § 151.14 - Assistance to floats\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In case any\nfloat grounds, sinks or otherwise obstructs navigation on the canal, the Canal\n\nCorporation may cause the same to be salvaged, destroyed or removed, subject to\nthe provisions of section\n83\nof the Canal\n\nLaw. (b) The Canal Corporation will\nprovide equipment and personnel to assist floats meeting with mishap on the\ncanal as follows: (1)\n\nWhere a float is in the\nchannel and in danger of obstructing navigation, or there is danger of loss of\nlife or serious property damage, the Canal Corporation assistance will be as\nprompt and thorough as possible. (2)\n\nWhere a float is sunk entirely outside of\nthe channel and there is no immediate prospect of such float coming into the\nchannel or otherwise interfering with navigation, Canal Corporation equipment\nwill ordinarily not be used in such salvage work. However, the division canal\nengineer may grant a request for such assistance when the division canal\nengineer determines that the equipment is available. In such cases, the fee\nestablished by this Chapter will be charged. Before the Canal Corporation will\nstart work of this character, the owner, master or representative must deliver\nto the division canal engineer a guarantee in the form of a certified check for\nthe estimated cost of the work. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n151.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
