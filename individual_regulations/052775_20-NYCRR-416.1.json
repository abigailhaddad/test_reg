  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 416.1 - Failure to file a return or to pay the tax due\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 289-b(1)(a)\n(a) A distributor or any other person subject\nto the provisions of article 12-A of the Tax Law who or which fails to file a\nreturn or fails to pay any tax due on or before the last date prescribed for\nfiling or paying, unless it can be shown that such failure was due to\nreasonable cause and not due to willful neglect, is subject to a penalty: (1)\nof 10 percent of the amount of tax\ndetermined to be due pursuant to article 12-A of the Tax Law, for the first\nmonth or any fraction thereof succeeding the last date prescribed for filing or\npaying; plus\n(2)\nan additional one\npercent of the amount of tax determined to be due pursuant to such article, for\neach additional month or fraction thereof during which such failure continues\nafter the expiration of the first month after such return was required to be\nfiled or such tax became due. The initial 10 percent and the additional one percent per\nmonth may not exceed 30 percent in the aggregate. Thus this penalty accrues for\na period of 21 months. The amount of tax determined to be due will be reduced\nby the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the date\nprescribed for payment and by the amount of any credits against the tax which\nmay be claimed on the return whether or not they were in fact claimed. Further, in computing the additional one percent per month, the amount of tax determined\nto be due will also be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is\npaid before the first day of each month. For purposes of this section, a\nmonth\nconstitutes a period which terminates with the date\nnumerically corresponding to the prescribed due date. Where a distributor or\nother person fails to both timely file a return and timely pay any tax due, separate penalties for the failure to file and the failure to pay are not\nimposed. (b) Where a return is filed later than 60 days after the last date prescribed for\nfiling, unless it can be shown that such failure was due to reasonable cause\nand not due to willful neglect, the penalty imposed by this section for a\nfailure to file may not be less than $100 or 100 percent of the amount of tax\nrequired to be shown on the return, whichever is the lower amount. For purposes\nof this subdivision, the amount of tax required to be shown on the return will\nbe reduced by the amount of any part of the tax which is paid on or before the\ndate prescribed for payment of the tax and by the amount of any credits against\nthe tax which may be claimed upon the return whether or not they were in fact\nclaimed. Example: A January return of tax on motor fuel, due February 20th, is filed on April 25th. The amount of tax required to be shown on the return is\n$200, of which $100 was paid on April 15th and the balance upon filing. The\npenalty imposed is computed as follows: February 21st through March 20th-$220 at 10%\n$20.00\n\nMarch 21st through April 20th-$200 at 1%\n2.00\n\nApril 21st through April 25th-$100 at 1%\n1.00\n\nTotal\n$23.00\n\nSince the return was not filed within 60 days of the due\ndate, the penalty due may not be less than the smaller of $100 or 100 percent\nof $200. Accordingly, a $100 penalty is due. (c) The penalty pursuant to this section is\ndetermined, assessed, collected and paid in the same manner as the taxes\nimposed by article 12-A of the Tax Law.
