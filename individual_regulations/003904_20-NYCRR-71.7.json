Unless the applicant or agent, in writing, subsequently\nnotifies the Department of Taxation and Finance to the contrary, the last known\naddress shall be, in the case of an applicant, the address on its application\nfor a license as a cigarette agent and, in the case of an agent, the address on\nits last return filed with the department. Such notifications will set forth\nthe basis for cancellation or suspension of a license or the basis for refusal\nto license and contain a statement to the effect that the impending\ncancellation, suspension or refusal may be protested through a hearing process\nprovided a petition for such protest is filed within 90 days after the date of\nsuch notice. (b) In the case of a\nperson applying for a license as a cigarette agent, a notice of proposed\nrefusal to license will be issued promptly after the application for the\nlicense is received by the Department of Taxation and Finance. (c) Unless acts involving falsity or fraud\nare at issue, a notice of proposed cancellation or suspension of a license or\nof proposed refusal to license must be issued within five years from the date\nof the act or omission which formed the basis for such cancellation, suspension\nor refusal to license (see sections\n71.5\nand\n71.6\nof this Part).
