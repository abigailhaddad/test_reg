  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 602.10 - Directories\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All service\nproviders shall publish directories, or cause their numbers to be published. Directories shall be regularly published at approximately yearly intervals. The\ninterval between directories shall not exceed 15 months without express\ncommission approval. The form of directories shall ordinarily conform to the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\nA directory shall be\nin such form and list such information, as will permit the numbers of local\nexchange customers in the area covered by the directory to be obtained, except\nfor public telephones and numbers unlisted at a customer's request. (2)\n\nInformation pertaining to emergency calls\nto such agencies as the police and fire departments shall appear conspicuously\nin the opening pages of the directory. (3)\n\nInstructions concerning the placing of\nlocal and long distance calls, shall appear conspicuously in the opening pages\nof the directory. This section shall include access codes that can be used for\nplacement of long distance calls, for those interexchange carriers agreeing to\nhave their codes published. Directories will also include a telephone number\nfor contacting each local service provider that serves the area covered by the\ndirectory at no additional cost to the service provider being listed. (4)\n\nThe introduction to the directory shall\ninstruct customers to call the local service provider from which they receive\nservice for information on billing, party lines, annoyance call procedures, emergency calling procedures and how to obtain tariff information. (b) Each service provider shall\ndistribute at no charge to its customers within a local exchange area, a copy\nof the local exchange directory for that area, and one additional copy shall be\nprovided for each working telephone number upon request. A copy shall be filed\nwith the commission. (c) A service\nprovider shall furnish its directory databases to all directory assistance\nservice providers on terms and conditions no less favorable than the service\nprovider furnishes such databases to its own or affiliated directory assistance\nservice operations. (d) In the\nevent of an error in a number published in the directory, the service provider\nshall intercept calls to the published number for the life of the directory\nwhere such number is not already in service. Where the published number is in\nservice, the party served by it shall be given appropriate transfer\ninformation, and also the opportunity for a number change (at no charge). In\nthat event, the normal practice shall be to place the published number on\nintercept, for the life of the directory listing plus 30 days. (e) Reasonable advance notice shall normally\nbe given to the consumers affected when a service provider has cause to change\na large group of numbers, even if such changes coincide with a directory\nissuance.
