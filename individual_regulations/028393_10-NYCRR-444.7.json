  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 444.7 - General\n\nState Regulations\n[ 3200 ]\n(a) An Income Statement is an accounting\nstatement which reflects the financial results of a hospital during a reporting\nperiod. (b) Hospitals are required\nto report all revenue and expense accounts in this section when such a function\nas defined in this manual exists, even though the activity is not separately\norganized within the hospital. The only circumstances under which the hospital\nneed not report a revenue or expense account is when the patient services\nprovided in a daily hospital services cost center is not provided in a discrete\nunit. For example, if pediatric patients receive care in the Medical/Surgical\nacute cost center, no reclassification of expense from the Medical/Surgical\ncost center to the Pediatric Acute cost center is required. No functional\nreporting of revenue and expense is required for daily hospital service cost\ncenters. (c) Where a function\nrequired by the reporting system is not separately organized within the\nhospital, but combined with one or more functions required by the reporting\nsystem, an analysis will be required to determine the gross revenue and direct\nexpenses applicable to each required function. For instance, some hospitals may\nbe combining the function of Electrocardiography (accounts 4290/7290) and\n\nNeurology-Diagnostic (accounts 4460/7460). In such cases, it is necessary to\ndetermine the total direct revenue and direct expenses relative to the two\ndifferent types of services rendered, and if significant, as defined below, reclassification is required. (d) The gross revenue reported in each required revenue account must be the actual\ngross revenue attributable to such identified functions. The expenses reported\nin each required expense account must represent the direct expenses related to\neach identified function. The direct expenses related to such functions may be\ndetermined based upon analysis. (e) It should be noted that reclassification must be made for significant amounts\nof misplaced costs or revenue. Significant\nis defined, for the\npurposes of this Article, as an amount equivalent to an aggregate amount of\nmisplaced costs or revenue in excess of the lesser of: (1)\nthree percent of the direct costs of the\nfunctional center transferred to or from; or\n(2)\none quarter of one percent of the total\nannual operating expenses. (f) However, in no case is a reclassification\nnecessary if the aggregate amount of misplaced cost per cost center is less\nthan $1,000. (g) Since the zero\nlevel accounts presented in this manual are required, all zero level accounts\npresented herein, except as noted above, must be reported by the hospital where\nthe related item or function exists in that hospital. A hospital will not be\ngranted an exception to the reporting of an account solely because of\naccounting difficulty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n444.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
