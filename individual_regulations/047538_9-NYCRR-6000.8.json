  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6000.8 - Physical fitness screening\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Procedures. (1)\n\nThe municipal civil service commission\nshall designate a qualified trainer to administer the physical fitness\nscreening test to determine the underlying physiological capacity of a\ncandidate to learn and perform the essential job functions of an entry-level\npolice officer. Such test shall be administered prior to the making of a\nconditional offer of employment by the local police agency seeking to employ\nthe candidate and shall be administered to the candidate prior to the\npost-offer medical examination to be conducted by the qualified physician or\npractitioner in accordance with section\n6000.4\nof this Part unless the\nmunicipal civil service commission can demonstrate that it could not reasonably\nconduct such screening test at the pre-offer stage of employment. (2)\n\nPrior to the administration of the test\nby the qualified trainer, the municipal civil service commission may ask the\ncandidate to assume legal responsibility and release such commission of\nliability for injuries resulting from any physical or mental disorders. In\naddition, the commission may furnish such candidate with a description of the\nphysical fitness screening test and require certification from the candidate's\nphysician that he/she is physically capable of participating in the physical\nfitness screening test. If the commission requests such certification from one\ncandidate, it must request such certification from all candidates. (3)\n\nIf a candidate is unable to perform an\nelement of the test, the municipal civil service commission may provide for an\nalternative element to be substituted, which, in the judgment of such\ncommission, will render a demonstrably valid assessment of the individual's\nphysiological capacity for the particular factor to be\nmeasured. (b) Elements of the test battery. Elements of the test battery to be used for physical\nfitness screening are described below. Although these elements may not be\ndirectly representative of essential job functions to be performed by an\nentry-level police officer, such elements do measure the candidate's\nphysiological capacity to learn and perform the essential job functions. The\nminimum scores for employment as an entry-level police officer as set forth\nbelow represent the 40th percentile of fitness. If a candidate does not\nsuccessfully score to the 40th percentile of fitness for each of the elements\nof the test battery, the candidate shall not be deemed to have successfully\ncompleted the physical fitness screening test. Nothing herein shall preclude an\nadministrator of such screening test from substituting an element of the test\nbattery, which such administrator has determined and validated to accurately\nassess the candidate's physiological capacity to learn and perform essential\njob functions. The 1.5 mile run shall only be administered to such individuals\nwho have successfully completed each of the other two elements of the test\nbattery (sit-up and push-up). Sit-up\n\nMuscular endurance (core body) - The score\nindicated below is the number of bent-leg sit-ups performed in one minute. Push-up\n\nMuscular endurance (upper body) - The score below\nis the number of full body repetitions that a candidate must complete without\nbreaks. 1.5 Mile Run\n\nCardiovascular capacity - The score indicated\nbelow is calculated in minutes:seconds.
