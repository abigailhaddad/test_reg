  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.476 - Internal corrosion control: design and construction of transmission line\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Design and\nconstruction. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, each new\ntransmission line and each replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other\nline component in a transmission line must have features incorporated into its\ndesign and construction to reduce the risk of internal corrosion. At a minimum, unless it is impracticable or unnecessary to do so, each new transmission line\nor replacement of line pipe, valve, fitting, or other line component in a\ntransmission line must: (1)\nbe configured to\nreduce the risk that liquids will collect in the line; (2)\nhave effective liquid removal features\nwhenever the configuration would allow liquids to collect; and\n(3)\nallow use of devices for monitoring\ninternal corrosion at locations with significant potential for internal\ncorrosion. (b) Exceptions to applicability. The design and construction requirements of\nsubdivision (a) of this section do not apply to pipeline installed or line\npipe, valve, fitting or other line component replaced before May 23, 2007. (c) Change to existing\ntransmission line. When an operator changes the configuration of a transmission\nline, the operator must evaluate the impact of the change on internal corrosion\nrisk to the downstream portion of an existing onshore transmission line and\nprovide for removal of liquids and monitoring of internal corrosion as\nappropriate. (d) Records. An\noperator must maintain records demonstrating compliance with this section. Provided the records show why incorporating design features addressing\nparagraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section is impracticable or unnecessary, an operator may fulfill this requirement through written procedures supported\nby as-built drawings or other construction records. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.476\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
