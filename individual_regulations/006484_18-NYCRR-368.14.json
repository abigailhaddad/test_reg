(b) Cases reopened as Group II in\naccordance with above instructions, without review team review shall be\nreviewed at the date which had been set before the case was closed. If\nreapplication of Group II cases occurs subsequent to the date set for review by\nthe review team the agency secures and transmits any additional data requested\nat previous review and all previous forms DSS-486, DSS-1151 and\nDSS-639.
