  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 366.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Under the\n\nRetirement and Social Security Law, it is frequently of great importance to a\nmember, pensioner or employer to file certain documents in a timely manner. In\nmany situations, the Retirement and Social Security Law provides firm deadlines\nby which important documents, such as benefit application forms, designation of\nbeneficiary forms, option election forms, etc., must be filed. Under a line of\ncases which predated both the era during which facsimile transmission\ntechnology became commonplace and the enactment of sections\n19\nand\n319\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, it was held that a document could not be considered \"filed with the\n\nComptroller\" for the purposes of the Retirement and Social Security Law until\nit was actually received by the Comptroller or the Retirement System. (b) In 1986, the principle that filing could\nnot occur until a document was actually received was qualified by the enactment\nof sections\n19\nand\n319\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. These sections provide that whenever a statute requires that document be\nfiled with the Comptroller, as Administrative Head of the New York State and\n\nLocal Retirement Systems, within a prescribed period of time or by a specified\ndate, and such document has been mailed to the Comptroller or the Retirement\n\nSystem by United States Postal Service certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, the document shall be deemed filed on the date of mailing. Sections\n19 and 319 further provide that notwithstanding the fact that the filing date\nmay be established as the date of mailing where the document is ultimately\nthereafter received by the Comptroller or Retirement System, no document shall\nbe deemed filed on the date of mailing unless it is actually received by the\n\nRetirement System as a result of such mailing. (c) Accordingly, sections 19 and 319\nestablish the principle that while a Retirement System document must be\nreceived by the Comptroller or the Retirement System in order to be deemed\nfiled for the purposes of the Retirement and Social Security Law, the date of\nfiling may be established as a date prior to the actual receipt date, where the\ntransmission is attained via a technology that ensures that the Retirement\n\nSystem is able to reliably determine the date of transmission. This Part\nextends this principle to the transmission of documents via facsimile (\"fax\")\nmachine. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n366.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
