  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2188.8 - Miscellaneous Provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subsidy layering review: applicability. (1)\n\nCertain projects that receive LIHTC are\nsubject to a process called subsidy layering review. Pursuant to section 102(d)\nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989, 42 U.S.C. section\n3545(d), the Department of\n\nHousing and Urban Development (HUD) is required to ensure that housing projects\nare not awarded excessive subsidies by combining HUD housing assistance with\nother government assistance. (2)\n\nThe review process whereby HUD ensures against excessive subsidy is termed\nsubsidy layering review. Every project with HUD housing assistance and LIHTC is\nsubject to subsidy layering review. Note, however, that the mere transfer of\nexisting HUD housing assistance (such as a section 236 contract or a HAP\ncontract) does not trigger subsidy layering review. Only the award of new HUD\nhousing assistance (combined with other government assistance) triggers the\nreview. (3)\n\nPursuant to section 911\nof the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, 42 U.S.C. section\n3545\nnote, State or local agencies may elect\nto undertake subsidy layering review on behalf of HUD for projects that receive\nLIHTC. The agency has elected to undertake subsidy layering review when\nallowable. (b) No\nrecourse or reliance. No provision of this QAP shall be the basis for\nany claim against the agency or any member, officer or employee of the agency. The QAP may be amended at any time, and such amendment may be prospective or\nretroactive. The QAP may also be applied as necessary and convenient in\nresponse to Federal or State mandates. (c) Information requests. Requests for information made under the Freedom of Information Law must be\nsubmitted pursuant to the instructions provided on HCR's website at\nhttps://hcr.ny.gov/.

(e) Requests for a qualified contract during\nthe period such a request is permitted under code section 42(h)(6). This\nsection only applies to projects in which the project owner has a regulatory\nagreement executed by the agency which specifically grants the right to request\na qualified contract. A project owner may request only in writing, by certified\nmail to HFA to the attention of the LIHTC monitoring office, that HFA produce a\nqualified contract from a buyer who will continue to operate the building(s)\nfor Low-Income use. A request for a qualified contract shall be an irrevocable\noffer to sell during the applicable one year period. If HFA presents a\nqualified contract during the above one year period, such qualified contract\nshall confer upon the buyer an exclusive right to purchase the project. For the\npurpose of determining the value of a qualified contract, cash distributions\nfrom (or available for distribution from) the project as set forth in the Code\nshall include management incentive fees paid or due to anyone who at any time\nafter the issuance of an IRS form 8609 had any ownership interest in the\nproject. The agency will specify the checklist of items required to be\nsubmitted as part of a request for a qualified contract.
