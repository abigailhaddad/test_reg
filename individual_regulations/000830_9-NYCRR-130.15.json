  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 130.15 - Approval of Laboratory-Developed Methods\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A cannabis laboratory shall obtain\napproval from the Office prior to performing a laboratory-developed method, or\nother method not otherwise approved or given similar recognition as described\nin this Part. The Office may approve such a method, provided a cannabis\nlaboratory submits data and other information as required supporting the\ntechnical merit of the method, and demonstrating that method's precision and\naccuracy are equivalent or superior to that of an approved method. Such data\nand information shall include, but not be limited to: (1)\na description of the method, including\nanalyte or group of analytes, sample type, working range, reagents and their\npreparation, equipment specifications, analytical procedures, precision, accuracy, related calculations, intended purpose and pertinent literature\ncitations; (2)\nthe anticipated date\nof method implementation; (3)\ncomparative data, if of the same technology, including: sample types, dates and\ntimes collected, and product or form, whether the sample was spiked, and, if\nso, the spiking procedure, and spiking samples at different concentrations; the\napproved method used; and analytical results for both the approved method and\nthe method submitted for approval; (4)\ndata from two (2) or more proficiency\ntests; (5)\ndemonstration of\ncapability data; (6)\nlimit of\ndetection data, if applicable; and\n(7)\nany other information pertinent to the\n\nOffice's determination of the method's technical merit. (b) Provided all other requirements of\nsubdivision (a) above are met, the Office may approve a method for which\nreproducibility has not been demonstrated by inter-laboratory comparisons if a\ncannabis laboratory demonstrates that its performance of the method is\ntechnically acceptable for the intended sample types and analytical purpose. Such approval shall be limited to a cannabis laboratory which applied for such\napproval. (c) In addition to the\nrequirements of subdivisions (a) and (b) above, the Office may conduct a\nlaboratory regulatory audit. (d) The Office shall respond to a cannabis laboratory's request for method\napproval, notifying a cannabis laboratory of method approval, proposed denial\nof the request by the Office, or the need for further information. (e) The Office may propose to deny a request\nfor method approval if a method does not meet the established requirements. A\ncannabis laboratory shall be advised of a proposed denial and the reasons for\nthe denial. A proposed denial shall become final thirty (30) calendar days from\nthe date of notice of proposed denial, unless a cannabis laboratory submits, prior to the date that is thirty (30) calendar days after the date of such\nnotice, a written request for reconsideration, including all documentation and\nrationale in support of such request. The Office shall consider a request for\nreconsideration and shall issue a final determination concerning the request\nfor reconsideration. (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Part, the Office may conduct an\nindependent review of any approved method to substantiate or refute its\ntechnical merit. If the method's technical merit is found to be unacceptable, the Office shall notify a cannabis laboratory of its proposed determination\nthat the method may not be performed under a New York State cannabis\nlaboratory's permit, giving the reasons for such determination. Such proposed\ndetermination shall become final thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the\nnotice of proposed determination, unless a cannabis laboratory offering such\nmethod submits, within thirty (30) calendar days of the date of the notice, a\nwritten request for reconsideration, including all documentation and rationale\nin support of such request. The Office shall consider a request for\nreconsideration and shall issue a final determination concerning the request\nfor reconsideration. (g) All\ninformation and data pertinent to method approval shall be documented and be\nmade available for Office review at the time of a laboratory regulatory audit\nor upon request for a minimum of five (5) years after the date of the method's\ndiscontinuation.
