The parent of a student who has violated any rule or code of conduct\nof the school district and was not identified as a student with a disability at\nthe time of such behavior may assert any of the protections set forth in this\n\nPart, if the school district is deemed to have had knowledge as determined in\naccordance with subdivision (b) of this section, that the student was a student\nwith a disability before the behavior that precipitated the disciplinary action\noccurred. Where the school district is deemed to have had knowledge that the\nstudent was a student with a disability before such behavior occurred, such\nstudent is a \"student presumed to have a disability for discipline\npurposes.\"\n(b) Basis of knowledge. Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (c) of this section, a school\ndistrict shall be deemed to have knowledge that such student had a disability\nif prior to the time the behavior occurred: (1)\nthe parent of such student has expressed\nconcern in writing to supervisory or administrative personnel of the\nappropriate educational agency or to a teacher of the student that the student\nis in need of special education, provided that such expression of concern may\nbe oral if the parent does not know how to write or has a disability that\nprevents a written statement; (2)\nthe parent of the student has requested an evaluation of the student pursuant\nto section 200.4 or\n200.16\nof this Title; or\n(3)\na teacher of the student, or other\npersonnel of the school district, has expressed specific concerns about a\npattern of behavior demonstrated by the student, directly to the director of\nspecial education of the school district or to other supervisory personnel of\nthe school district. (c) Exception. A student is not a student presumed to have a disability for\ndiscipline purposes if, as a result of receiving the information specified in\nsubdivision (b) of this section: (1)\nthe\nparent of the student has not allowed an evaluation of the student pursuant to\nsection\n200.4\nof this Title; or\n(2)\nthe parent of the student has refused\nservices under this Part; or\n(3)\nit\nwas determined that the student is not a student with a disability pursuant to\nsection 200.4 or\n200.16\nof this Title. (d) Responsibility for determining\nwhether a student is a student presumed to have a disability. If it is claimed\nby the parent of the student or by school district personnel that the school\ndistrict had a basis for knowledge, in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection, that the student was a student with a disability prior to the time the\nbehavior subject to disciplinary action occurred, it shall be the\nresponsibility of the superintendent of schools, building principal or other\nschool official imposing the suspension or removal to determine whether the\nstudent is a student presumed to have a disability. (e) Conditions that apply if there is no\nbasis for knowledge. If the superintendent of schools, building principal or\nother school official imposing the disciplinary removal determines that there\nis no basis for knowledge that the student is a student with a disability prior\nto taking disciplinary measures against the student, the student may be\nsubjected to the same disciplinary measures as any other nondisabled student\nwho engaged in comparable behaviors. However, if a request for an individual\nevaluation is made while such nondisabled student is subjected to a\ndisciplinary removal, an expedited evaluation shall be conducted in accordance\nwith section\n201.6\nof this Part.
