Tit. 9 § 5319.10 - Program memory, non-volatile memory and non-volatile devices used to store program memory\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Non-volatile\nmemory requirements. (1)\nA gaming device\nshall have the ability to retain data for all critical memory, as set forth in\nsection\n5319.11\nof this Part, and shall be\ncapable of maintaining the accuracy of all information required for 30 days\nafter power is discontinued from such gaming device. (2)\n\nFor rechargeable battery types only, if a\nbattery backup is used as an \"off-chip\" battery source, such battery backup\nshall recharge itself to its full potential in a maximum of 24 hours. The shelf\nlife of such battery backup shall be at least five years. (3)\nNV memory that uses an off-chip backup\npower source to retain NV memory contents when the main power is switched off\nshall have a detection system that shall provide a method for software to\ninterpret and act upon a low-battery condition before the battery reaches a\nlevel where such battery is no longer capable of maintaining NV\nmemory. (4)\n\nClearing NV memory\nshall require access to the locked logic area or other secure method that the\ncommission shall control. (b) Function of NV memory reset. Following\nthe initiation of an NV memory reset procedure (using an approved NV\nmemory-clear method), a game program shall execute a routine that initializes\nall bits in critical NV memory to the default state. All memory locations\nintended to be cleared through such NV memory-clear process shall be fully\nreset in all cases. The commission shall review and, in the discretion of the\ncommission, approve the methodology for games that allow for partial NV memory\nclears. (c) Default reel position\nor game display. The default reel position or game display immediately after an\nNV memory reset shall not be the advertised top award on any selectable line. The default game display, upon entering game-play mode, also shall not be the\nadvertised top award. This section applies to the base game only and not to any\nsecondary bonus features. (d) Configuration settings. A configuration setting that causes an obstruction to\nthe electronic accounting meters without an NV memory clear shall not be\npermitted. A change to the denomination shall be performed by a secure means, which includes access to the locked logic area or other secure method, so long\nas such method can be controlled by the commission (e.g., security tape, password or PIN-based controls)\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
