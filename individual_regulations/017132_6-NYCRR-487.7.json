  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 487.7 - Cumulative impact analysis of air quality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If the applicant is required to complete\nan EJ analysis and the proposed facility is an air emission source, the\napplicant shall conduct a cumulative impact analysis of air quality in\naccordance with an air modeling protocol approved by the department and\nconsistent with the requirements of this section. The requirements set forth in\nthis section do not alter any other Federal and State air pollution\nrequirements applicable to the proposed facility. (b) The cumulative impact analysis of air\nquality shall consider the impacts of the proposed facility with respect to air\npollutants specified in subdivision (c) of this section on ambient air quality\nwithin a circular area extending from the location of the proposed facility to\nthe larger of the following distances, to be referred to as the EJ air impact\narea (EJAIA): (1)\none-half mile; (2)\nthe impact study area defined pursuant to\nsection\n487.4\nof this Part; or\n(3)\nthe distance to the furthest receptor\nlocation of maximum impact for any pollutants modeled for the proposed\nfacility. (c) The\ncumulative impact analysis shall examine the impacts associated with the\nfollowing air pollutants: (1)\nall criteria\nair pollutants, except for ozone and its precursors, which are emitted from the\nproposed facility. The procedures identified in 6 NYCRR Part\n231\nfor assessing\nozone precursor emissions will satisfy the requirements of this section for the\ncumulative impact analysis; (2)\nmercury, to the extent that mercury emissions data for the air emissions\nsources identified in subdivision (d) of this section are reasonably available\nand acceptable to the department. Emissions of mercury shall not be considered\nif the proposed facility exclusively uses natural gas for fuel; and\n(3)\na limited set of non-criteria pollutants. Any non-criteria pollutant to be emitted by the facility and required to be\nidentified in the applicant's preliminary scoping statement shall be considered\nif the projected concentration of such pollutant may exceed quantified public\nhealth-based air criteria, as determined by the department in consultation with\nthe Department of Health and in accordance with the applicant's approved air\nmodeling protocol. For any non-criteria pollutants to be used in the cumulative\nanalysis, the air emission sources identified in subdivision (d) of this\nsection will be included to the extent that emissions data for such sources are\nreasonably available and acceptable to the department. (d) The cumulative impact analysis shall take\ninto account the following air emission sources with respect to the pollutants\nidentified in subdivision (c) of this section: (1)\nthe proposed facility; (2)\nany additional proposed article 10\nfacility for which an application has been submitted and determined by the\nboard to be in compliance with PSL section 164 and which is located in the\ncircular area extending from the EJAIA plus 10 kilometers (6 miles); (3)\nany major stationary source located in\nthe circular area extending from the EJAIA plus 10 kilometers (6 miles) that\nhas not yet commenced operations and which has received a permit from the\ndepartment pursuant to 6 NYCRR Part\n201\nat least 60 days prior to the date of\nthe applicant's filing of an application pursuant to PSL section 164; (4)\nany other permitted stationary source\nlocated within the EJAIA that emits an air pollutant in an amount at or above\nthe significant project thresholds as defined in tables 4 and 6 of 6 NYCRR\nsections 231-13.4 and\n231-13.6; and\n(5)\non a site-specific basis and at the\ndepartment's discretion, any air emission source that is located contiguous to\nthe proposed facility and for which the necessary emissions data is reasonably\navailable and acceptable to the department. (e) The total cumulative air impacts for each\nof the applicable air pollutants are determined by adding the impacts\nassociated with such pollutants from: (1)\nthe\nproposed facility; (2)\nthe other\nair emission sources identified in subdivision (d) of this section; and\n(3)\nreasonably available\nbackground air quality concentrations for each applicable pollutant, in\naccordance with the applicant's approved air modeling protocol. (f) The total cumulative air\nemissions impacts determined pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section shall\nbe used by the applicant in accordance with its approved air modeling protocol\nto evaluate the significant and adverse environmental impacts of the proposed\nfacility on the impact study area as required pursuant to section\n487.9\n(d) of this\n\nPart and to evaluate any significant and adverse disproportionate environmental\nimpacts as required pursuant to section\n487.10\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n487.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
