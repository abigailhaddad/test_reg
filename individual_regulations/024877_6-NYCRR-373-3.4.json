  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.4 - Contingency plan and emergency procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of all hazardous waste facilities, except as section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Purpose and implementation of\ncontingency plan. (1)\n\nEach owner or\noperator must have a contingency plan for the facility. The contingency plan\nmust be designed to minimize hazards to human health or the environment from\nfires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or nonsudden release of hazardous\nwaste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil or surface water. (2)\n\nThe provisions of the plan must be\ncarried out immediately whenever there is a fire, explosion, or release of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents which could threaten human\nhealth or the environment. (c) Content of contingency plan. (1)\n\nThe contingency plan must describe the\nactions facility personnel must take to comply with subdivisions (b) and (g) of\nthis section in response to fires, explosions, or any unplanned sudden or\nnonsudden release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil or surface water at the facility. (2)\n\nIf the owner or operator has already\nprepared a Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) plan as defined\nin section\n610.2\n(j) of this\n\nTitle and 40 CFR part\n300\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), or some other emergency or contingency plan, that plan need only be\namended to incorporate hazardous waste management provisions that are\nsufficient to comply with the requirements of this Subpart. The owner or\noperator may develop one contingency plan which meets all regulatory\nrequirements. When modifications are made to the non-Part 370 through 374 and\n\nPart 376 provisions in an integrated contingency plan, the changes do not\ntrigger the need for a Part 373 permit modification. (3)\n\nThe plan must describe arrangements\nagreed to by local police departments, fire departments, hospitals, contractors, and State and local emergency response teams to coordinate\nemergency services, pursuant to section\n373-3.3\n(g) of this\n\nSubpart. (4)\n\nThe plan must list\nnames, addresses and phone numbers (office and home) of all persons qualified\nto act as emergency coordinator (see subdivision [f] of this section), and this\nlist must be kept up-to-date. Where more than one person is listed, one must be\nnamed as primary emergency coordinator and others must be listed in the order\nin which they will assume responsibility as alternates. (5)\n\nThe plan must include a list of all\nemergency equipment at the facility (such as fire-extinguishing systems, spill\ncontrol equipment, communications and alarm systems [internal and external] and\ndecontamination equipment), where this equipment is required. This list must be\nkept up-to-date. In addition, the plan must include the location and a physical\ndescription of each item on the list, and a brief outline of its\ncapabilities. (6)\n\nThe plan must\ninclude an evacuation plan for facility personnel where there is a possibility\nthat evacuation could be necessary. This plan must describe the signal(s) to be\nused to begin evacuation, evacuation routes, and alternate evacuation routes\n(in cases where the primary routes could be blocked by releases of hazardous\nwaste or fires). (d) Copies of contingency plan. A copy of the contingency plan and all revisions to the\nplan must be: (1)\nmaintained at the\nfacility; and\n(2)\nsubmitted to all\nlocal police departments, fire departments, hospitals, and State and local\nemergency response teams that may be called upon to provide emergency\nservices. (e) Amendment of contingency plan. The contingency plan must be reviewed, and immediately\namended, if necessary, whenever: (1)\napplicable regulations are revised; (2)\nthe plan fails in an emergency; (3)\nthe facility changes-in its design, construction, operation, maintenance or other circumstances-in a way that\nmaterially increases the potential for fires, explosions, or releases of\nhazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents, or changes the response\nnecessary in an emergency; (4)\nthe\nlist of emergency coordinators changes; or\n(5)\nthe list of emergency equipment\nchanges. (f) Emergency coordinator. At all times, there must be at least one employee either\non the facility premises or on call (\ni.e., available to\nrespond to an emergency by reaching the facility within a short period of\ntime), with the responsibility for coordinating all emergency response\nmeasures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with all\naspects of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at\nthe facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location\nof all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this\nperson must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the\ncontingency plan. (g) Emergency procedures. (1)\n\nWhenever there is an imminent or actual emergency situation, the emergency\ncoordinator (or the emergency coordinator's designee when the emergency\ncoordinator is on call) must immediately: (i) activate internal facility alarms or communication systems, where applicable, to notify all facility personnel; and\n(ii)\nnotify appropriate State or local\nagencies with designated response roles if their help is needed. (2)\n\nWhenever there is a release, fire or explosion, the emergency coordinator must immediately identify the\ncharacter, exact source, amount, and areal extent of any released materials. This may be done by observation or review of facility records or manifests and, if necessary, by chemical analysis. (3)\n\nConcurrently, the emergency coordinator\nmust assess possible hazards to human health or the environment that may result\nfrom the release, fire or explosion. This assessment must consider both direct\nand indirect effects of the release, fire or explosion (\ne.g., the effects of any toxic, irritating or asphyxiating gases that are generated, or the effects of any hazardous surface water runoff from water or chemical\nagents used to control fire and heat-induced explosions). (4)\n\nIf the emergency coordinator determines\nthat the facility has had a release, fire or explosion which could threaten\nhuman health, or the environment, outside the facility, the emergency\ncoordinator's findings must be reported as follows: (i) if the assessment indicates that\nevacuation of local areas may be advisable, appropriate local authorities must\nbe notified immediately. The emergency coordinator must be available to help\nappropriate officials decide whether local areas should be evacuated; and\n(ii)\nthe emergency coordinator\nmust immediately notify both the department (using the New York State 24-hour\noil and hazardous material spill notification number, 518/457-7362), and either\nthe government official designated as the on-scene coordinator for that\ngeographical area (in the applicable regional contingency plan under 40 CFR\npart\n300\n) (see 6 NYCRR\n370.1\n[e]), or the National Response Center (using their\n24-hour toll free number, 800/424-8802) must be notified immediately. The\nreport must include: (a) name and telephone\nnumber of reporter; (b) name and\naddress of facility; (c) time and\ntype of incident (\ne.g., release, fire); (d) name and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved, to the extent known; (e) the extent of injuries, if any; and\n(f) the possible hazards to human health, or\nthe environment, outside the facility. (5)\n\nDuring an emergency, the emergency\ncoordinator must take all reasonable measures necessary to ensure that fires, explosions and releases do not occur, recur, or spread to other hazardous waste\nat the facility. These measures must include, where applicable, stopping\nprocesses and operations, collecting and containing released waste, and\nremoving or isolating containers. (6)\n\nIf the facility stops operations in\nresponse to a fire, explosion or release, the emergency coordinator must\nmonitor for leaks, pressure buildup, gas generation or ruptures in valves, pipes or other equipment, wherever this is appropriate. (7)\n\nImmediately after an emergency, the\nemergency coordinator must provide for treating, storing or disposing of\nrecovered waste, contaminated soil or surface water, or any other material that\nresults from a release, fire or explosion at the facility. Note: Unless the owner or operator can demonstrate, in\naccordance with 6 NYCRR\n371.1\n(d)(3) or (4), that the recovered material is not\na hazardous waste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste\nand must manage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of 6 NYCRR\nPart\n372\nand Subpart 373-2. (8)\n\nThe emergency coordinator must ensure\nthat, in the affected area(s) of the facility: (i) no waste that may be incompatible with\nthe released material is treated, stored or disposed of until cleanup\nprocedures are completed; and\n(ii)\nall emergency equipment listed in the contingency plan is cleaned and fit for\nits intended use before operations are resumed. (9)\n\nThe owner or operator must notify the\ncommissioner, and appropriate State and local authorities, that the facility is\nin compliance with paragraph (8) of this subdivision before operations are\nresumed in the affected area(s) of the facility. (10)\n\nThe owner or operator must note in the\noperating record the time, date and details of any incident that requires\nimplementing the contingency plan. Within 15 days after the incident, a written\nreport on the incident must be submitted to the commissioner. The report must\ninclude: (i) name, address and telephone\nnumber of the owner or operator; (ii)\nname, address and telephone number of\nthe facility; (iii)\ndate, time and\ntype of incident (\ne.g., fire, explosion); (iv)\nname and quantity of material(s)\ninvolved; (v) the extent of\ninjuries, if any; (vi)\nan\nassessment of actual or potential hazards to human health or the environment, where this is applicable; and\n(vii)\nestimated quantity and disposition of recovered material that resulted from the\nincident.
