  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 262.111 - Retention of samples and additional testing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Samples that yield positive results on\nconfirmation must be retained by the laboratory in properly secured, long term, frozen storage for at least 365 days as required by the DOT procedures. Within\nthis 365-day period, the employee or his representative, the operator, the\nadministrator, or the department may request that the laboratory retain the\nsample for an additional period. If, within the 365-day period, the laboratory\nhas not received a proper written request to retain the sample for a further\nreasonable period specified in the request, the sample may be discarded\nfollowing the end of the 365-day period. (b) If the medical review officer (MRO)\ndetermines there is no legitimate medical explanation for a confirmed positive\ntest result other than the unauthorized use of a prohibited drug, and if timely\nadditional testing is requested by the employee according to DOT procedures, the split specimen must be tested. The employee may specify retesting by the\noriginal laboratory or by a second laboratory that is certified by the\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services. The operator may require the employee\nto pay in advance the cost of shipment (if any) and reanalysis of the sample, but the employee must be reimbursed for such expense if the additional test is\nnegative. (c) If the employee\nspecifies testing by a second laboratory, the original laboratory must follow\napproved chain of custody procedures in transferring a portion of the\nsample. (d) Since some analytes may\ndeteriorate during storage, detected levels of the drug below the detection\nlimits established in the DOT procedures, but equal to or greater than the\nestablished sensitivity of the assay, must, as technically appropriate, be\nreported and considered corroborative of the original positive\nresults. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n262.111\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
