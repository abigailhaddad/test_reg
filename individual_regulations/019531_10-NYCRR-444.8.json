  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 444.8 - Operating revenue accounts-general\n\nState Regulations\n[ 3210 ]\n(a) Hospital revenue consists mainly of the\nvalue, at the hospital's full established rates, of all hospital services\nrendered to patients, regardless of amounts actually paid to the hospital by or\non behalf of patients. The objective of patient service revenue reporting is to\ncompile complete and accurate information, on the accrual basis, of gross\nrevenue, by revenue centers and by inpatient and outpatient classification, and\na record of revenue deductions, classified by type. (b) Patient service revenues must be reported\nin such a manner as to clearly identify these revenues with the functional\nambulatory and ancillary services cost centers and the discrete daily hospital\nservices cost centers of the hospital. Revenues of revenue producing cost\ncenters are needed for comparison with the expenses of the center, so that\noperating performances can be evaluated. (c) In addition to patient service revenue, hospitals obtain revenue from sources and activities only indirectly related to\npatient care. These \"other\" operating revenues typically consist of tuition\nrevenue, parking lot revenue, nonpatient food sales, etc. (d) Regardless of the source of hospital\nrevenue, it is important that it be reported for on the accrual basis. This\nbasis of reporting requires that revenue be recognized and reported in the time\nperiod it is earned, irrespective of the timing of the cash flow between the\nhospital and other parties. No other basis provides the necessary qualities of\ncompleteness, accuracy, and usefulness of financial data and/or the proper\nbasis for matching revenues with expenses. The requirement for accrual\nreporting is only that the reports be prepared on the accrual basis and not\nthat the books be maintained on that basis throughout the reporting period. Hospitals will be permitted two reporting periods in which to meet the accrual\nreporting requirements. The Health Care Financial Administration (HCFA) will\nconsider requests for waivers where a State law requires other than full\naccrual accounting. (e) The\noperating revenue accounts in the Listing of Accounts are classified into five\ncategories. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n444.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
