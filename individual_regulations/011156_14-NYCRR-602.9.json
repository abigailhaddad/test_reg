  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 602.9 - Second level rate and fee appeal procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nWhere a conflict exists between this\nsection and section\n602.2\nof this Part, the provisions\nof this section shall be controlling. This Part shall apply to and be\ncontrolling in all second level appeals of the following decisions pursuant to\nthe Mental Hygiene Law and/or regulations issued pursuant thereto: (i) Decisions on first level appeals to rates\nfor intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities\npursuant to section\n681.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle. (ii)\n\nDecisions on first\nlevel appeals to rates for specialty hospitals pursuant to section\n680.12\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (iii)\n\nDecisions on first\nlevel appeals to fees and rent appeals for community residences pursuant to\nsection\n686.13\nof this Title. (2)\n\nAt the conclusion of the first\nlevel appeal process, the OPWDD shall notify the provider of any proposed\nrevised rate, fee, or rent, or denial of same. The OPWDD shall inform the\nprovider that, for any given rate or fee period, it may either accept the\nproposed revised rate, fee or rent or request a second level appeal in the\nevent that the proposed revised rate, fee or rent fails to grant some or all of\nthe relief requested in the first level appeal. In the event that a second\nlevel appeal is requested and the commissioner determines that no second level\nappeal issues are presented by a provider's request for a second level appeal, the proposed revised rate, fee or rent shall become final and shall be\ncertified by the commissioner and forwarded to the State Division of the Budget\nfor approval and subsequent payment. In the event that a second level appeal is\nrequested and the commissioner determines that second level appeal issues are\npresented by a provider's request for a second level appeal, the proposed\nrevised rate, fee or rent for the rate or fee period being appealed shall be\nwithout further force or effect and shall not be considered by the hearing\nofficer or the commissioner in determining the second level appeal. (3)\n\nIf the OPWDD approves the revision to any\nrate, fee or rent at the conclusion of the first or second level of appeal, and\nif the State Division of the Budget fails to approve such revision, the\nprovider shall have no further right to administrative review pursuant to this\nsection. (b) Request for second level appeal. (1)\n\nThe OPWDD's denial of the first level\nappeal of any or all of the relief requested in the appeals provided for in\nparagraph (a)(2) of this section shall be final, unless the provider requests a\nsecond level appeal to the commissioner in writing within 30 days of service of\nnotification of denial or proposed revised rate. (2)\n\nThe request shall include: a copy of the\noffice's notice to the provider on the first level appeal; a statement of the\nfactual issues involved; a detailed statement and documentation of the\nprovider's position as to each identified issue; the name and a current address\nof the person to be notified or communicated with for service of notice and\nother papers and, if the provider is represented by an attorney, the name and\naddress of that attorney. (c) Determination of appealable factual\nissues. (1)\n\nUnless otherwise agreed to\nby all parties to the proceeding, the issues to be decided in the second level\nappeal shall be limited to those grounds of appeal and those specific items of\nexpense which were the subject to the first level appeal. Any request for the\ninclusion of new material shall be denial unless the commissioner finds, after\nnotice to the division of the office responsible for the first level appeal\ndecision, and after giving that division 30 days to comment, compelling reasons\nfor its omission during the first level appeal. (2)\n\nUpon receipt of a request for a second\nlevel appeal, the commissioner shall review the request and identify those\nissues which have been appealed within the limits imposed by paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section, and those which raise issues of fact. A copy of the request\nfor an appeal and the commissioner's preliminary identification of the issues\nshall be sent to the parties. (3)\n\nThe appeal shall be considered withdrawn by the provider 90 days after the\nprovider's receipt of the commissioner's preliminary identification of the\nissues, unless the provider takes one of the following three actions: (i) submits for the commissioner's approval a\nproposed settlement, as agreed to between the provider and the division of the\noffice which decided the first level appeal; or\n(ii)\nadvises the commissioner that it intends\nto proceed with the appeal; or\n(iii)\nadvises the commissioner that the\nprovider and the division of the office which decided the first level appeal\nhave agreed to an extension of time. In that event, the appeal shall be\nconsidered withdrawn by the provider 90 days after the commissioner has been\nadvised of the agreement, unless the provider again takes one of the three\nactions set forth in this paragraph. (4)\n\nIf the provider and the division of the\noffice which decided the first level appeal agree to a proposed settlement of\nthe identified issues for some, but not all of the rate or fee periods for\nwhich a second level appeal has been requested, such a settlement shall be\nsubmitted to the commissioner for approval, and the provider may proceed on the\nremaining rate or fee periods according to the procedures set forth in\nsubparagraph (3)(ii) or (iii) of this subdivision. A rate or fee revised by\nOPWDD pursuant to an appeal shall not be considered final unless and until\napproved by the Division of the Budget. (5)\n\nUpon notice that the provider wishes to\nproceed with the appeal, the commissioner shall send a proposed statement of\nissues to all parties. The parties shall have 30 days to reply and raise\nobjections to the commissioner's inclusion, exclusion or statement of any\nissue. (6)\n\nThe commissioner shall, after the conclusion of the time provided for in paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision, determine whether a factual appealable issue is in dispute. If\nfurther information is needed to make the determination of whether there is an\nappealable factual issue, the commissioner shall direct the parties to provide\nthe necessary information. (7)\n\nIf\nthe commissioner determines there is no factual appealable issue, he or she\nshall deny the request for a second level appeal and notify the provider of\nsuch denial. There shall be no further administrative review of this\ndetermination.

(2)\n\nIn second level rent appeals, the burden\nof proof shall be on the community residence to present sufficient evidence to\ndemonstrate that an individual who has been admitted to the community residence\nis not able to pay the rent charged him or her. (e) Development of written\nrecord. (1)\n\nThe provider and the OPWDD\nshall each participate in developing a written record consisting of relevant\ndocuments and statements for the hearing officer.

(3)\n\nNew evidence. When a provider wishes to\nsubmit new or additional facts expert opinions for review which were not part\nof the first level appeal, that provider must make a written request to the\nhearing officer. Such request shall include, in detail, the nature of the\nevidence and the reasons the evidence was not submitted for or considered at\nthe first level appeal. A copy of the request shall be served on all other\nparties to the proceeding. A provider may introduce such evidence only after\nthe hearing officer, in his or her discretion, grants the request after giving\nother parties 10 days to file written objections. (4)\n\nWithin 30 days after receiving the\nprovider's submission under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the OPWDD shall\nsubmit the following to the hearing officer and a copy to the provider: (i) Any documents supporting the OPWDD's\nposition, organized and indexed as indicated under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision.

Where the truth or authenticity of facts or\nevidence claimed to be relevant by one party is not disputed, an objection on\nthe ground of materiality or relevance may be noted by any other party but is\nnot to be regarded as just cause for refusal to stipulate. The requirement of\nstipulation applies under this section without regard to where the burden of\nproof may lie with respect to the controversies involved.
