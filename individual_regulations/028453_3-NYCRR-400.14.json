  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 400.14 - Relocation of licensed location\n\nState Regulations\n\nBackground. Chapter 546 of the Laws of 1994 altered the\nlicensing criteria applicable to check cashers by substantially amending\nsection\n369\nof the Banking\n\nLaw to require, among other things, that the superintendent determine whether\nthere is a community need for a new licensee in the proposed area to be served\nand to prohibit entirely the granting of a license at a location which is less\nthan three-tenths of a mile from an existing licensee. In so acting, the\n\nLegislature adopted a specific statutory finding of legislative intent, to wit, \"The legislature hereby finds and declares that check cashers provide important\nand vital services to New York citizens; that the business of check cashers\nshall be supervised and regulated through the Banking Department in such a\nmanner as to maintain consumer confidence in such business and protect the\npublic interest; that the licensing of check cashers shall be determined in\naccordance with the needs of the communities they are to serve; and that it is\nin the public interest to promote the stability of the check cashing business\nfor the purpose of meeting the needs of the communities that are served by\ncheck cashers.\" However, the legislation left unamended Banking Law, section\n370 which permits a licensee to apply to the superintendent for leave to change\nits place of business to any other location and which does not make explicit\nthe standards to be applied by the superintendent in granting permission to\nrelocate. A licensee must obtain a new license to conduct business at another\nlocation. In order to promote and maintain the stability of the check cashing\nbusiness while accommodating the reasonable needs of current licensees to\nrelocate, the following standards shall be applied by the superintendent in\ndetermining whether to approve applications for relocation to any site which is\nwithin three-tenths of a mile of another licensed location: (a) No relocation shall be permitted to a\nsite within three-tenths of a mile of another existing licensee location from a\nlocation greater than three-tenths of a mile from such existing licensee\nlocation, unless such other existing licensee engages in the cashing of checks, drafts or money orders only for payees of such checks, drafts or money orders\nthat are other than natural persons at a restricted location authorized\npursuant to subdivision 1 of section\n369\nof the Banking\n\nLaw or at any other licensed location whereat the licensee engages solely in\nthe cashing of checks, drafts or money orders only for payees that are other\nthan natural persons. (b) A\nrelocation may be approved, from a site within three-tenths of mile of another\nlicensee to another site within three-tenths of a mile of such other licensee\nso long as such new site is farther from such existing licensee than the site\nfrom which permission to relocate is sought. If, however, a licensee seeks to\nrelocate from a site within three-tenths of a mile of another licensee and the\nnew site is closer to an existing licensee, the superintendent shall approve\nthe relocation only under the following conditions: (1)\nthe relocation is consistent with the\nlegislative intent as expressed in chapter 546 of the Laws of 1994; (2)\nthe licensee seeking to relocate must\ndemonstrate that extraordinary circumstances are forcing it to relocate (e.g., fire, condemnation). The superintendent, in his or her sole discretion, shall\ndetermine the existence of \"extraordinary circumstances\"; and\n(3)\nthe licensee seeking to relocate has no\nreasonable alternative but to move closer to another licensee. If the licensee seeks to relocate from a site within\nthree-tenths of a mile of another licensee to another site within three-tenths\nof a mile of another licensee and the new site is closer to an existing\nlicensee it may relocate to such site without complying with the conditions set\nforth in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3) of this subdivision if the licensee which\nis impacted by the relocation gives its written consent to such relocation. A\ncopy of this consent shall be submitted to the superintendent by the licensee\nseeking to relocate together with its application. The superintendent shall\napprove or disapprove such application in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n370\n(3)\nof the Banking Law. In the case in which\na licensee applies to relocate to a site which is not within three-tenths of a\nmile from another licensed location, in the absence of special factors, public\nconvenience and advantage shall be deemed to be promoted without demonstration\nof community need therefor where the new location is no greater than\nthree-tenths of a mile from the site from which permission to relocate is\nsought. For purposes of this subdivision, the term \" special factors\" shall\ninclude such interceding geographic or topographic features as may inhibit\nreasonable foot traffic between such locations (e.g., major roads or highways, bridges, mountains or the lack of reasonably direct street\naccess).
