  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 39.10 - General provisions for the possession, handling, storage and transportation of blasting agents\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll of the provisions of this Part (rule) relating to the\npossession, handling, storage and transportation of explosives shall also apply\nto blasting agents with the following exceptions: (a) Separation distances of blasting agents\nand ammonium nitrate from explosives or other blasting agents are given in\n\nTable 3 of this Part (rule). Table 3 applies only to the separation of stores. Table 1 shall be used in determining separation distances from inhabited\nbuildings, public highways and passenger railways. Separation distances to\nprevent the explosion of ammonium nitrate and ammonium nitrate-based blasting\nagents are referred to in Table 3 of this Part (rule) as the donor. Ammonium\nnitrate, by itself, is not considered to be a donor when applying this table. Ammonium nitrate, ammonium nitrate fuel oil, or combinations thereof, are\nacceptors. If stores of ammonium nitrate are located within the sympathetic\ndetonation distance of explosives or blasting agents, one half of the mass of\nthe ammonium nitrate shall be included in the mass of the donor. (b) When the ammonium nitrate and/or blasting\nagents are not barricaded, the distances shown in Table 3 of this Part (rule)\nshall be multiplied by six. Such distances allow for the possibility of\nhigh-velocity metal fragments from mixers, hoppers, truck bodies, sheet metal\nstructures, metal containers and similar materials which may enclose the donor. Where storage is in bullet-resistant magazines recommended for explosives or\nwhere the storage is protected by a bullet-resistant wall, distances in excess\nof those listed in Table 1 of this Part (rule) are not required. (c) The distances in Table 3 of this Part\n(rule) apply to ammonium nitrate that passes the insensitivity test prescribed\nin the definition of ammonium nitrate fertilizer promulgated by the National\n\nPlant Food Institute. Ammonium nitrate which fails to pass such insensitivity\ntest shall be stored at separation distances determined by the licensee and\nsuch distances shall be acceptable to the commissioner. (d) The separation distances listed in Table\n3 of this Part (rule) also apply to nitro-carbo-nitrates and blasting agents\nwhich pass the insensitivity test prescribed in the United States Department of\n\nTransportation (DOT) regulations. (e) Earth, sand dikes or enclosures filled\nwith the prescribed minimum thickness of earth or sand are acceptable\nartificial barricades. Natural barricades, such as hills or timber of\nsufficient density that the surrounding exposures which require protection\ncannot be seen from the \"donor\" when the trees are bare of leaves, are also\nacceptable. (f) When the ammonium\nnitrate must be counted in order to determine the separation distances from\ninhabited buildings, public highways and passenger railways, it may be counted\nat one half of its actual weight. (g) Pneumatic loading equipment when handling\nsensitized ammonium nitrate blasting agents shall not be grounded to water\nlines, air lines, rails or permanent electrical grounding systems. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n39.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
