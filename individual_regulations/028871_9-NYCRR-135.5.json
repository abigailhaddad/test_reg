An eligible member of the\nsecurity services unit authorized and scheduled to assemble for briefing prior\nto his tour of duty shall be considered to be on duty during time spent in each\nsuch briefing in excess of 10 minutes. Compensatory time off granted in the\nsame workweek in which it is earned, except compensatory time off granted in\nlieu of a holiday worked in such workweek, does not add to the total hours\nworked and is not to be construed as time worked by an officer or\nemployee.

(d) Work performed on a Saturday, Sunday or\nholiday, as part of an officer's or employee's regular work schedule and not in\nexcess of 40 hours per workweek, is not considered to be overtime under the\nprovisions of section\n134\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law.
