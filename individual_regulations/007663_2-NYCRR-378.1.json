  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 378.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n1000\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, enacted pursuant to chapter 548 of the Laws of 2000, authorizes a member\nto purchase up to three years of service credit for military service rendered\nduring certain periods of military conflict defined in that section. In order\nto obtain the credit, the member must pay to the Retirement System an amount\nequal to the product of the number of years of military service being claimed\nand three percent of the compensation earned during the 12 months of credited\nservice immediately preceding the date that the member made application for the\ncredit. Section 1000 permits the member to pay such cost by lump sum or by\npayroll deduction over a period of time not to exceed the time period of\nmilitary service to be credited. Subdivision 4 of that section provides that\nthe Comptroller may promulgate a regulation regarding the payment process. In\nview of the fact that it takes time for the Retirement System to determine the\ncost and communicate it to the member, this Part is enacted to set forth the\ntime period for the commencement of payment of the member cost for the purchase\nof military service credit pursuant to section 1000. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n378.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
