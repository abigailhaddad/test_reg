  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.3 - Functions of natural protective features\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Natural features such as beaches, bluffs, dunes and nearshore areas, and the vegetation thereon, protect coastal areas\nand human lives from wind and water erosion and storm-induced high water. Inappropriate activities of man may diminish or eliminate entirely the\nerosion-buffering function of natural protective features. (b) The specific functions and protective\nvalues of different types of natural protective features may vary. Certain\ntypes of natural protective features are intrinsically better suited for\ncertain types of uses, activities, or development than others. The standards\nand development restrictions of this Part that apply to regulated activities\nwithin specific types of natural protective features are based on: (1)\nthe protective functions that specific\ntypes of natural protective features provide; and\n(2)\nthe interaction between specific types of\nnatural protective features and physical coastal processes. (c) Described below are the\nerosion protection functions of various types of natural protective features\nand their relationship to physical coastal processes. These descriptions are to\nbe used to guide the review of coastal erosion management permit applications\nas required in sections\n505.5\n-505.9 of this Part, and in\nthe review of variance requests as required in section\n505.13\nof this Part. (1)\n\nBeaches buffer shorelands from erosion by\nabsorbing wave energy that otherwise would be expended on the toes of bluffs or\ndunes. Beaches that are high and wide protect shorelands from erosion more\neffectively than beaches that are low or narrow. Beaches also act as a\nreservoir of sand or other unconsolidated material for longshore littoral\ntransport and offshore sandbar and shoal formation. (2)\n\nBluffs protect shorelands and coastal\ndevelopment by absorbing the often destructive energy of open water. Bluffs are\nof greatest protective value during times of storm-induced high water. Bluffs\nare a source of depositional material for beaches and other unconsolidated\nnatural protective features. (3)\n\nDunes, along with bluffs and beaches, buffer shorelands from the energy of open\nwater. Like bluffs, dunes are of greatest protective value during conditions of\nstorm-induced high water. Because dunes often protect some of the most\nbiologically productive as well as developed coastal areas, their value as\nprotective features is especially great. The two primary functions of dunes are\nprevention of wave overtopping and storage of sand for coastal processes. High, vegetated dunes provide a greater degree of protection than low, unvegetated\nones. The keys to maintaining a stable dune system are the establishment and\nmaintenance of beachgrass or other vegetation on the dunes and assurance of a\nsupply of nourishment sand to the dunes. (4)\n\nNearshore areas dissipate a substantial\namount of wave energy before it is expended on beaches, bluffs or dunes by\ncausing waves to collapse or break. Nearshore areas also function as reservoirs\nof sand, gravel and other unconsolidated material that is returned to beaches. Sandbars, which are located in nearshore areas, control the orientation of\nincoming waves and promote the development of ice-cap formations which help to\nprotect shorelines during winter storms. The roots of aquatic vegetation in\nnearshore areas bind fine-grained silts, clays and organic matter to form a\nfairly cohesive bottom that resists erosion. Such vegetation also assists in\ntrapping sediments. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n505.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
