  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 33.6 - Grouping of loans\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf a lending institution adjusts the rate of interest charged\non loans on common adjustment dates (such as the first day of January, April, July and October, or less frequently) rather than adjusting the rate of\ninterest on an individual quarterly (or less frequent) interval measured from\nthe date of the loan, the lending institution may on any common adjustment date\nincrease the rate of interest charged on a loan made within 25 days before that\ncommon adjustment date only if prior to the consummation of the loan the\nlending institution provides notice of the increase and the new rate of\ninterest to the person who is to be primarily liable on the loan. In no case\nmay the rate be adjusted more than once within any three-month\nperiod. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n33.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
