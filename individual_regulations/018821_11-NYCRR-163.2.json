  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 163.2 - Rules and standards governing proposed file and use overall average rate changes for nonbusiness automobile insurance policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An insurer may implement a proposed overall average rate increase on a file and use basis provided that the change is within the five percent flex-band. If the proposed overall average rate increase exceeds the five percent flex-band, then the insurer shall obtain the superintendent's prior approval before implementing the change. (b) During any 12-month period, an insurer may implement no more than two overall average rate increases on a file and use basis provided that the cumulative effect of the increases shall be within the five percent flex-band. If a proposed overall average rate increase combined with a prior rate increase implemented within a 12-month period of the proposed effective date of the request exceeds the five percent flex-band, then the insurer shall obtain the superintendent's prior approval before implementing the change. The cumulative effect of two or more rate charges in a 12-month period is derived in a multiplicative manner. For example, if an insurer implements on a file and use basis a 2.9 percent overall average rate increase effective February 1, 2009 and a 2 percent overall average rate increase effective August 1, 2009, then the insurer may not implement another file and use overall average rate increase before February 1, 2010. However, at such time, the insurer may implement an overall average rate increase up to a maximum of 2.9 percent. (c) An insurer may implement an overall average rate decrease on a file and use basis up to a maximum of five percent at any one time from the overall average rate currently in effect. (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Part, an insurer shall not implement an overall average rate increase on a file and use basis subsequent to an overall average rate increase greater than the five percent flex-band that the superintendent has already prior approved in the 12-month period immediately preceding the effective date of the proposed increase.
