  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2302.18 - Distribution of funds-part b\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Assurance, distribution of funds. The State Educational Agency assures that\nfunds which the State educational agency receives from appropriations made\nunder section 401(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act will be\ndistributed among local educational agencies according to the enrollments in\npublic and nonpublic schools within the school districts of such agencies, except that substantial funds will be provided to: (i) local educational agencies whose tax\neffort for education is substantially greater than the State average tax effort\nfor education, but whose per pupil expenditure (excluding payments made under\ntitle I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act) is no greater than the\naverage per pupil expenditure in the State, and (ii) local educational agencies\nwhich have the greatest number or percentages of children whose education\nimposes a higher than average cost per child, such as children from low-income\nfamilies, children living in sparsely populated areas, and children from\nfamilies in which English is not the dominant language. (b) Criteria for distribution of funds--part\nB. The following criteria have been developed and will be applied to meet the\nrequirements of section (403)(a)(4)(A) of the Elementary and Secondary\n\nEducation Act regarding distribution of part B funds: (1)\n70 percent of the funds available for\nlocal assistance under part B will be distributed on a per capita basis to the\n756 local education agencies according to enrollments in public and private\nschools. The 756 figure includes not only operating school districts (737) but\nalso other agencies operating the approved educational program. (2)\nfive percent of the funds available for\nlocal assistance under part B will be distributed on a per capita basis to\nlocal education agencies whose tax effort for education is substantially\ngreater than the State average tax effort for education, but whose per pupil\nexpenditure (excluding payments made under title I of The Elementary and\n\nSecondary Education Act is no greater than the average per pupil expenditure in\nthe State. (3)\n25 percent of the\nfunds available for local assistance under part B will be distributed on a per\ncapita basis to local education agencies whose pupils have special educational\nneeds (PSEN). These pupils are identified through the State's pupil evaluation\nprogram (PEP) which measures reading and mathematics achievement. (c) Per pupil allocation and\neligibility criteria. (1)\n\nEnrollment portion. Based on the fall 1976 public and private school enrollment data, 4,027,360\nchildren in 756 local education agencies will share in 70 percent of the local\nassistance funds available under part B ($8,296,075). The estimated per pupil\nallocation is approximately $2.06. (2)\n\nHigh tax/low expenditure portion. The\n\nState average per pupil expenditure is $1696. Statistical computations\ncomparing the State-approved operating expense (AOE) per weighted average daily\nattendance (WADA) determined an averaged operating cost and ration factor of\nproperty tax rate based on full value. Pupils in districts below $1,696 per\npupil in expenditure and above.0223 full value tax rate are eligible. Approximately 256,499 public and nonpublic school children in 39 districts will\nshare in the five percent of the local assistance funds available under part B\n($592,576). The estimated per pupil allocation is approximately $2.46. These\nestimates were based on required State aid formula component information and is\nthat of the 1974-75 year. Most of the districts in this category are small and\nrural with several larger cities or suburban sites with low economic bases or\nunique taxing situations. (3)\n\nSpecial needs portion. (i) The Board of\n\nRegents and the State's local education agencies, after a lengthy collaborative\nneeds assessment, identified increased student achievement in the basic skills\nas the first educational priority for New York State. (ii)\n\nAchievement in the basic skills of\nreading and mathematics is measured annually through the statewide evaluation\nprogram. PEP tests are administered to both public and private school pupils in\ngrades 3, 6 and 9. The statewide reference point for the test is below level 4\nin grade 6. For the purpose of the part B distribution formula, the percentage\nof students achieving below the statewide reference point will be applied to\nthe public school district enrollment and to the enrollment in private schools. Approximately 1,288,755 public and nonpublic school children in 731 districts\nwill share in the 25 percent of the local assistance funds available under part\nB ($2,962,884). The estimated per pupil allocation is approximately $2.30 per\nPSEN pupil (pupils with special education needs). Pupils in urban and rural\nareas will benefit primarily. (4)\n\nEligible LEA's to be recipients of funds\ninclude: (i) all public school\ndistricts; (ii)\ncampus schools of\nthe State University of New York and the City University of New York. Several\nbranches of the State University operate campus or experimental schools. These\ncampus schools are State-supported. (iii)\n\nState-operated schools; (a) New York State School for the Deaf, Rome, N.Y., and\n(b) New York State School\nfor the Blind, Batavia, N.Y. (iv)\n\nState-supported schools; (a) Cleary School for the Deaf, Ronkonkoma, (b) Human Resources\n\nSchool, Albertson, (c) Lavelle\n\nSchool for the Blind, Bronx, (d) Lexington School for the Deaf, Queens, (e) Mill Neck Manor School for the Deaf, Mill\n\nNeck, (f) New York School for the\n\nDeaf, White Plains, (g) New York\n\nInstitute for the Education of the Blind, Bronx, (h) Rochester School for the Deaf, Rochester, (i) St. Joseph's School\nfor the Deaf, Bronx, (j) St. Francis DeSales School for the Deaf, Brooklyn, and\n(k) St. Mary's School for the Deaf. Buffalo. (v) New York\n\nState Division for Youth. The Division for Youth will administer the program\nfor children institutionalized in nine schools. (vi)\n\nBoards of Cooperative Educational\n\nServices are deemed eligible applicants when local school districts elect to\nparticipate in a cooperative part B project and designate the BOCES as the\nadministrative and fiscal agent to administer all or a portion of the\nparticipating local educational agency's part B allocation to carry out a\ncooperative project.
