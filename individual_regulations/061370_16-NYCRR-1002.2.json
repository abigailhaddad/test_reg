Tit. 16 § 1002.2 - General procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\napplicant may not commence construction of the facility or interconnections\nuntil the applicant has accepted the certificate in accordance with section\n1000.14\nof this Title. (b) The applicant may not commence\nconstruction of all or any portion of the facility or interconnections for\nwhich the board has required approval of a compliance filing as a condition\nprecedent to such construction until the applicant has submitted the required\ncompliance filing for that portion of the facility and received approval of it\nby the board, or by the commission after the board's jurisdiction has\nceased. (c) The applicant shall\nfile an electronic copy and 10 paper copies of any compliance filing with the\nboard, or the commission after the board's jurisdiction has ceased, by filing\nit with the secretary at the Albany, New York Offices of the DPS and shall\nserve copies as follows: (1)\none paper copy on\nthe DEC project manager; (2)\none\npaper copy on each affected DEC regional office; (3)\nthree paper copies on the DEC at its\ncentral office; (4)\none paper copy\non any other party specified in the certificate or order requiring the\ncompliance filing; and\n(5)\nan\nelectronic copy on every party to the proceeding. (d) Any interested person or party may file\ncomments regarding any compliance filing within 21 days of the filing and\nservice of such compliance filing done in accordance with subdivision (c) of\nthis section. (e) A compliance\nfiling may not be used to request an amendment to a certificate. If the\nsecretary determines that a request in a compliance filing is a request for an\namendment to a certificate, the secretary shall issue a letter denying further\nprocessing of such request as a compliance filing. (f) Compliance filings will not be effective\nuntil approved by the board or by the commission after the board's jurisdiction\nhas ceased. (g) Approval may be\nmade subject to specified terms, conditions, limitations, or\nmodifications. (h) Decisions on\ncompliance filings will generally be made at the next available session of the\nboard or the commission, as the case may be, provided the compliance filing is\nreceived sufficiently in advance of such sessions that there is adequate time\nin the circumstances to receive comments and process the matter, unless\nadditional information is required to make the determination or the nature of\nthe compliance filing warrants additional time for deliberation or\nanalysis. (i) The standard of\nreview for compliance filings shall be whether the compliance filing reasonably\nassures compliance with the certificate. (j) After a compliance filing is approved, an\napplicant may request a change in what was so approved as a result of a\ncompliance filing by requesting either a major change or a minor change. Requests for a major change in what was so approved as a result of a compliance\nfiling shall be filed, served and reviewed in the same manner as an original\ncompliance filing pursuant to subdivisions (c) through (i) of this section. Requests for a change in what was approved as a result of a compliance filing\nin which there is no discernable potential for increased adverse environmental\nimpact and in which there will be no change in the specified terms, conditions, limitations, or modifications applicable to a prior approval shall be deemed a\nminor change. A minor change may be requested by filing an electronic copy with\nthe secretary at the Albany, New York Offices of the DPS and serving an\nelectronic copy on the DEC project manager. The secretary shall determine\nwhether DPS or the DEC project manager have an objection to the proposed minor\nchange. If there is such an objection, the secretary shall issue a letter\ndenying further processing of such request as a minor change. If there is no\nsuch objection, the secretary shall issue a letter stating that the minor\nchange may be implemented. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
