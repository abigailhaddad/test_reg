  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 179-3.6 - Criteria for selection of participants\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe selection of applicants for participation in the\ndivision's temporary release program involves a two-phase process. The first\nphase - eligibility - involves the application of basic threshold criteria to\ndetermine whether a resident is eligible to participate in the program. The\nsecond phase suitability - involves the application of general criteria to\ndetermine whether an eligible resident is suitable to participate in the\nprogram. (a) Eligibility. The\napplicant's file shall be reviewed to determine whether the resident is\neligible to participate in a temporary release program. Eligibility criteria\ninclude: (1)\n\nParole or conditional release\ndate. (i) The resident is within 12 months of\npossible parole or conditional release. (ii)\n\nAn applicant for a leave of absence is\nexempted from this requirement. (2)\n\nEscape offenses. The resident has never\nbeen convicted of any escape offenses or of absconding from temporary release\nor furlough as defined in the Penal Law. (3)\n\nOut-of-state escape offenses. (i) The resident has no out-of-state\nconvictions for offenses comparable to the escape and absconding offenses\nreferred to in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nConvictions for attempt to commit these\noffenses also render a resident ineligible. (4)\n\nOutstanding warrants. (i) The resident has no outstanding warrants\nfrom any jurisdiction, except Family Court warrants for alimony, child support\nor paternity; nor any concurrent or consecutive commitments by a local, out-of-state or Federal jurisdiction; unless the sentencing authority has\nindicated in writing that there is no objection to temporary release\nparticipation. (ii)\n\nThe\ninterviewer, or a designated staff person, shall contact the appropriate\ncourt(s) to ascertain the status of any outstanding warrants or commitments. Failure to respond within 30 days will be construed as an indication that\neither no record of the charges exists or that the sentencing authority has no\nobjection to the resident's participation in a temporary release\nprogram. (iii)\n\nAfter the 30-day\nperiod has lapsed, the resident's application shall be processed using the\ninformation readily available. Open charges for which no disposition is\nreceived shall not be considered in determining the resident's eligibility or\nsuitability for temporary release. (5)\n\nApplicant's facility behavior. The\nresident has not, in the eight weeks prior to application, been found to have\ncommitted a serious or very serious misbehavior by a facility director's\nproceeding. (6)\n\nPrior temporary\nrelease participation. The resident has not been found, in a disciplinary\nproceeding, to have absconded from a temporary release program. (7)\n\nConsistent purpose. The resident's\npurpose for requesting temporary release is consistent with the purposes set\nout in section\n179-3.4\nof this Subpart for the\ntype of temporary release program for which he is applying. (8)\n\nTime in system. The resident has served\nthe following time in system: (i) A resident\nunder sentence for an offense involving the use or threatened use of a deadly\nweapon, infliction of serious physical injury upon another, or a sex offense\ninvolving forcible compulsion, shall not be permitted to participate in a\ntemporary release program until he has served at least six months in custody. Jail time shall be credited toward the six-month requirement. Serious physical\ninjury means physical injury which creates a substantial risk of death, or\nwhich causes death or serious and protracted disfigurement, protracted\nimpairment of health or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any\nbodily organ. (ii)\nA resident not\nunder sentence for an offense described in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph\nmay apply for, and be permitted to participate in, a temporary release program\nupon admission, provided that a parole eligibility date is known and he is\notherwise eligible and qualified pursuant to this Subpart. (iii)\nA returned parole violator must serve\nat least six months after his most recent return before he may apply for\ntemporary release. (iv)\nA resident\nwhose last application for temporary release has been disapproved must wait at\nleast eight weeks from the date of original disapproval before reapplication\nfor the same type of temporary release program, unless otherwise directed to\nwait a longer period of time prior to reapplication. These time requirements shall not apply to a request for a\nleave of absence. (9)\n\nImmigration status. (i) Prior to the processing of a temporary\nrelease program application, the division must request clarification of an\nalien resident applicant's immigration status from the U.S. Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine the\nresident's immigration status and to clarify whether the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service is going to commence deportation proceedings upon the\nresident's release from State custody. (ii)\nA letter must be forwarded to the\n\nImmigration and Naturalization Service regarding the possibility of deportation\nproceedings against the resident. A failure by the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization Service to respond to an inquiry within 30 days will be\nconstrued as an indication by the Immigration and Naturalization Service that\nthey do not intend to initiate deportation proceedings. The letter must advise\nthem of the 30-day deadline. (iii)\nA resident shall be ineligible for temporary release consideration if a\nresponse from the Immigration and Naturalization Service: (a) indicates an investigation is underway; or\n(b) indicates deportation\nproceedings are underway. (b) Suitability criteria. The applicant's\nlegal history and facility record shall be reviewed and evaluated to determine\nwhether permitting the resident to participate in a temporary release program\nis consistent with the safety of the community and the welfare of the\napplicant. (1)\n\nLegal history. The applicant's\nentire legal history shall be reviewed and evaluated, including any probation\npresentence reports, intake sheets, court transcripts, juvenile delinquency\nprobation reports and placement orders, paying specific attention to: (i) prior and current juvenile delinquent\nresidential placements and juvenile offender and juvenile offender/youthful\noffender sentences of confinement; (ii)\nprior and current juvenile delinquent\nand juvenile offender/youthful offender adjudications and juvenile offender\nconvictions; (iii)\nprior\nrevocations of probation, parole or release; and\n(iv)\nincidents in which the individual\nabsconded or AWOLed or attempted to abscond or AWOL during current juvenile\noffender secure or nonsecure confinement under division authority, from\nescorted or unescorted off-campus trips, or from bail, detention or a previous\nresidential placement. (2)\n\nFacility record. The applicant's entire\nfacility record for his current juvenile offender confinement also shall be\nreviewed and evaluated, paying specific attention to the youth's physical and\nmental health and his behavior and performance in program, on escorted and/or\nunescorted trips or in a previous temporary release program. All available\ndocuments shall be reviewed, including but not limited to: (i) The resident's behavioral record, including: (a) facility director's proceeding\ndispositions for serious or very serious misbehaviors within the past six\nmonths; (b) adjustment committee\nreviews and recommendations; (c) room confinement reports; (d) counseling area referrals; (e) facility and wing log entries; (f) facility infractions; and\n(g) violations of program rules on escorted and unescorted trips or while in a\ntemporary release program.
