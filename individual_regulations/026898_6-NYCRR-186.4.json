The Department may, at its discretion, issue permits pursuant to\nthis section to any of the following entities or their designated\nrepresentatives to deploy automated feeding de vices using whole kernel corn in\nparts of the state where 4-Poster TM Tickicide is registered for use: municipalities, public or private landowners, or home- owner associations that, singly or in combination, own and control a contiguous land area inhabited by\nwhite-tailed deer and totaling at least 40 acres in size. (b) Criteria for permit issuance. The\nfollowing criteria must be met before a permit may be issued by the Department\npursuant to this section: (1)\n\nThe applicant\nmust identify the specific properties (e.g., tax parcel numbers, latitude/longitude, or UTM coordinates of proposed deployment locations) that\nare included in the proposed deployment are a and their owners; (2)\n\nThe identified properties must include a\ncontiguous land area totaling at least 40 acres in size; (3)\n\nThe applicant(s) must be one or more of\nthe person(s) who own(s) property included in the application, or be an agent\nwith written permission from the owner(s) of the property(ies) where the\ndevice(s) will be located; (4)\n\nWritten consent of owners of all properties that are wholly or partially\nincluded in a circle centered on each device location and with a radius of 745\nfeet must be provided as part of the application; (5)\n\nThe applicant must provide a written deer\nmanagement plan using a format provided by the Department that will be\nimplemented in conjunction with the use of 4-Poster TM Tickicide and an\nautomated feeding device. At a minimum, the plan must include measures to en\nsure that white-tailed deer populations and the impacts of deer (e.g., vehicle\ncollisions and damage to ornamental plantings and native vegetation) will not\nincrease as a result of deploying the automated feeding devices. The deer\nmanagement plan may include, but is not limited to, recreational hunting, culling, surgical sterilization, fencing of sensitive areas, and enforcement of\n\nState and local deer feeding prohibitions pursuant to this Part or local laws\nor regulations. The plan must clearly indicate how it relates to any deer\nmanagement plans currently in place for the municipality where automated\nfeeding devices would be deployed. Prior to the issuance of a permit for an\nautomated feeding device using 4-Poster TM Tickicide, the deer management plan\nmust be approved by the Department. The Department may deny a permit to any\nperson that it determines has not adequately considered and incorporated deer\npopulation management techniques in conjunction with deployment of automated\nfeeding devices. Examples of this would include, but not be limited to, maintaining land owner restrictions on deer hunting that exceed State and local\nstatutes necessary to ensure public safety; (6)\n\nIf the applicant is not a municipality, written approval of the specific location(s) of deployment of automated feeding\ndevices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide must be provided by the smallest\nmunicipality with jurisdiction where the property is located; and\n(7)\n\nPermit applications may be submitted at\nany time of year using forms provided by the Department. (c) Permit conditions and reporting\nrequirements: (1)\n\nAutomated feeding devices\nmay only be used in parts of the state where 4-Poster TM Tickicide is\nregistered for use and may be deployed only at the locations identified in an\napplication approved by the Department; (2)\n\nPermits may be issued for up to a 3-year\nperiod, but will include an annual reporting requirement using a form provided\nby the Department. Annual reports shall be submitted to the Department on or\nbefore December 31 and shall include a summary of bait consumption and 4-Poster\nTM Tickicide applications by week for each automated feeding de- vice, recommendations for future use of automated feeding devices in the areas\ncovered by the permit, and a summary of actions employe d by the permittee to\ncontrol deer population growth and impacts and monitor impacts; (3)\n\nPermits may allow deployment and\nmaintenance of automated feeding devices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide at any time\nof year; (4)\n\nAutomated feeding\ndevices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide may not be placed within 300 feet of a\npublic highway pursuant to Environmental Conservation Law 11-0505(8); (5)\n\nAutomated feeding devices with 4-Poster\nTM Tickicide may not be placed within 300 feet of any dwelling, multiple\ndwelling, playground or any other locations where children may be present\nwithout adult supervision, unless the area around the automated feeding device\nwith 4-Poster TM Tickicide is surrounded with a fence 28 to 30 inches high with\na minimum diameter of 29 feet and constructed in accordance with specifications\noutlined in New York State-approved labeling for 4-Poster TM\nTickicide; (6)\n\nThe Department may, when it determines that attraction of black bears or other non-target species\n(e.g., raccoons) poses an ecological or public safety risk, require that\nautomated feeding devices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide be surrounded with an\nelectrified fence with a minimum diameter of 29 feet, constructed and\nmaintained in such a manner as to prevent any non-target species of concern\nfrom gaining access to the automated feeding device; (7)\n\nAny person that receives a permit to use\nan automated feeding de- vice with 4-Poster TM Tickicide and any municipality\nthat endorses such a permit issued to any entity located in their jurisdiction\nmust take steps to inform the public, including landowners, hunters, and local\nlaw enforcement agencies, of the presence and locations of automated feeding\ndevices in their area. Examples of such steps would include but not be limited\nto notices on municipal websites, in local newspapers, and posted at entrances\nto properties where automated feeding devices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide are\ndeployed; (8)\n\nThe permittee shall\ndeploy automated feeding devices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide in accordance with\nthe manufacturer's instructions, in compliance with U.S. Environmental\n\nProtection Agency an d New York State label requirements and subject to the\napplicable provisions of Environmental Conservation Law Article 33; (9)\n\nAn automated feeding device shall only be\nbaited with feed when rollers are charged with 4-Poster TM Tickicide and all\nbait shall be removed and disposed of in an approved waste disposal facility\nupon cessation of 4-Poster TM Tickicide application; and (10) Additional permit\nconditions may be included at the Department's discretion. (d) Revocation. Permits may be revoked for\nviolation of perm it conditions or failure to implement and maintain deer\nmanagement measures as described in the Department-approved deer management\nplan, or when the Department determines that the continued use of automated\nfeeding devices with 4-Poster TM Tickicide poses a threat of disease spread or\ntransmission. (e) An automated\nfeeding device with 4-Poster TM Tickicide deployed in accordance with a\n\nDepartment-issued permit shall not be considered a \"pre-established bait pile\"\nthat would prohibit the taking of deer by a licensed hunter pursuant to ECL\n11-0901(4)(b)(7).
