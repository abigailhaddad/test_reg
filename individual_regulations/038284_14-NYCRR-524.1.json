  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 524.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthis Part is to ensure that providers of mental health services develop and\nimplement effective incident management programs in order to protect the health\nand safety of patients and enhance their quality of care. Incident management\nprograms include the components of effective abuse protection; the\nclassification of incidents; tracking and trending of incidents; and\nimplementing effective actions to protect individuals served from\nharm. (b) It is the expectation of\nthe Office of Mental Health that providers of mental health services under its\njurisdiction will afford their patients appropriate services in a caring and\nhospitable environment that is recovery-oriented and free from harm. In order\nto create this environment, providers must seek to eliminate, wherever\npossible, the occurrence of incidents, i.e., episodes of harm or potential\nharm. This Part thus requires providers to assure that any reportable incidents\nare reported and analyzed, and the appropriate corrective, remedial, or\ndisciplinary action occurs, in accordance with applicable federal or state law\nand regulations. (c) Incident\nmanagement programs must also incorporate principles of clinical risk\nmanagement, which emphasize the improvement of systems and processes. Clinical\nrisk management involves review of incident patterns and trends to identify the\nfacts, circumstances, processes, systems, and areas of risk that may have\ncontributed to such incidents in order to identify opportunities for\nperformance improvement.
