  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4026.3 - Nonmanaging ownership\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Owners-registration and disclosure. (1)\n\nThe\nmanaging owner of a horse shall not enter or start such horse, nor shall such\nhorse race, unless each individual holding any property interest in such horse\nat such time has been disclosed to The Jockey Club and registered therewith by\nthe managing owner. (2)\n\nIn\naddition, should any property interest in a horse be held by a general or\nlimited partnership, syndicate, association, corporation, trust, estate, or\nother form of representative or joint ownership or legal entity, such entity\nshall be registered with The Jockey Club; and there shall also be disclosed the\nidentity of all officers, directors, managing agents, representatives, trustees\nor other individuals holding the power to manage such entities, in addition to\nall individuals holding any legal or beneficial interest in such entity. Any\nchanges in such information shall be clearly indicated and submitted to The\n\nJockey Club within 10 days after the end of each calendar quarter after\nregistration or, if no changes have occurred, a statement to that effect shall\ninstead be filed. (3)\n\nFor good\ncause shown, the commission may waive for a particular case, or for a category\nof cases, the obligation to file the identity of numerous owners of an\ninsignificant interest and allow such interest to be filed as an identified\nclass. At any time, however, upon demand of the commission, individual identity\nshall be disclosed. (b) Nonmanaging owners--licensing. No horse shall be entered or started by such\nhorse's managing owner that is owned by 35 or less owners, unless all of the\nowners are licensed, or, if owned by more than 35 owners, unless each\nindividual having a three percent or greater property interest is licensed as\nan owner by the commission. In addition, each such owner that is not an\nindividual must be registered and licensed with the commission, and all such\nentity's officers, directors, trustees or other managing individuals must be\nlicensed by the commission unless otherwise directed by the commission. The\ncommission may also require any other individual involved in ownership to be\nlicensed at any time it may deem desirable. The commission or the State\nsteward, for good cause, may waive any of such requirements for a race. In no\nevent, however, may a horse start, if the license of any such individual has\nbeen denied, suspended or revoked, until the commission is satisfied that any\nwithdrawal of such individual or transfer of such individual's interest is in\ngood faith. (c) Coupled entries. Should the same individual or legal entity required to be disclosed and\nregistered as a nonmanaging owner for a horse be present in the ownership\n(including the managing ownership) of another horse or horses in a race, to the\nextent that there is a 25 percent commonality in ownership between any two of\nsuch horses, all such horses shall be coupled as an entry. In addition, the\nstewards may require the coupling of horses having a lesser degree of common\nownership where the stewards deem it desirable in the public\ninterest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4026.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
