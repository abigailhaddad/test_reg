  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1628-4.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purchases and\ncontracts for materials and services will be limited to those items needed for\nproject operation. Such purchases and contracts are also subject to budgetary\nlimitations, except where the expenditure is necessary to protect life or\nproperty from imminent danger. (b) The authority shall take affirmative steps to solicit bids from minority-and\nwomen-owned business enterprises, as defined by the division pursuant to\narticle IX of Executive Order No. 21, dated August 3, 1983, and shall make\ncertain that such bids receive full and fair consideration. (c) Purchases and contracts will be awarded\non the basis of competitive bidding to the fullest extent possible. Section\n151\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law, governing contracts and purchases in excess of $10,000, requires sealed bids in compliance with public advertisement not less than 20\ndays before the date set for the receipt of bids. The authority should utilize\ncompetitive bidding for all its purchases or contracts unless it is obviously\nimpossible or impracticable to do so, as in the case of gas, electric and\ntelephone services; replacement parts for equipment whose manufacturer is the\nonly source of supply; local area purchases (usually not in excess of $25 per\nmonth), where need is immediate and work of mechanics would be delayed; and\nemergency purchases where there is no time to obtain competitive\nbidding. (d) When division approval\nis required for purchases or contracts as listed under section\n1628-3.1\nof this Part, a\npreliminary submission of the proposed specifications of the items to be\npurchased or work to be contracted will be made to the Bureau of Management. Such preliminary submission is not required, however, if the division's\nstandard contracts or specifications prepared by the division are to be used. Upon approval of the preliminary submission, bids will be solicited. A copy of\nthe lowest bid, a tabulation of all bids received, a listing of all bidders\nsolicited and the authority's recommendation, will be forwarded to the Bureau\nof Management for review and approval prior to award. If public advertisement\nis required, a copy of such advertisement showing date of publication will be\nincluded. (e) The authority's\ncounsel will indicate on all contracts that he has reviewed the bids and\ncontract documents, and approves them as to form, including necessary\nacknowledgments. (f) Recommendation\nof award will normally be for supplier or contractor who submits the lowest bid\nfor the material or work as specified. Recommendation for award to other than\nthe lowest bidder shall be in accordance with section\n151\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law. (g) Upon\napproval by the division, the authority will award the purchase or contract, with an original and a conformed copy of the executed contract being forwarded\nto the division for its files. Prior to permitting any supplier or contractor\nto perform, the authority will require the contractor to submit satisfactory\nevidence of any insurance coverages and performances and payment bonds that may\nbe required by the contract or purchase documents.
