Tit. 6 §§ 363-11.3 - Feasibility study\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nfeasibility study must be conducted prior to any reclamation activities and in\naccordance with a department-approved work plan. Landfill reclamation\nfeasibility study work plans must include: (1)\nA preliminary site investigation, including: (i) a description of the vertical\nand areal extent of the landfill; (ii)\na delineation of discrete or partially\nseparated areas of the landfill, or special waste (e.g., ash, biosolids, friable asbestos-containing waste, C&D debris, etc.) disposal\nareas; (iii)\na description of the\nage, type of waste and cover material, landfill operation method, and estimate\nof volume for each area of the landfill identified in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph; (iv)\nan estimate of the\nwater table depth throughout the area to be reclaimed; (v) an assessment of available work space for\nequipment staging, material storage, and other work areas; (vi)\nan evaluation of the landfill's existing\ngroundwater monitoring system, procedures, and most recent analytical\ndata; (vii)\nan assessment of the\nlandfill gas generated by the landfill; and\n(viii)\na description of the regulatory\nhistory of the landfill (e.g., results of department inspections, compliance\nhistory, permit status, etc.). (2)\na feasibility study field investigation\nwork plan that describes all of the field work and laboratory analysis that is\npart of the feasibility study, including: (i) all proposed work areas; (ii)\nthe\nnumber and location of all borings, trenches, and test pits and their estimated\ndepth and volume; (iii)\na\ndescription of all excavation and material handling operations; (iv)\na description of all material\nquantification methods and laboratory analyses that will be used to\ncharacterize and estimate the quantities of recyclables, combustibles, reusable\nfill material, and other components; (v) a delineation of project management\nresponsibilities and a proposed work schedule; and\n(vi)\nan emergency response plan as described\nin section\n363-11.6\nof this Subpart. (b) Upon completion of\nthe feasibility study, the data must be compiled and presented in a feasibility\nstudy report submitted to the department. The report must include: (1)\na description of sampling, analysis, test\npits and test borings; (2)\nthe\nthickness of waste fill and depth to the water table; (3)\na characterization of excavated materials\n(e.g., recyclables, combustibles, reusable fill material, and other\ncomponents); (4)\nanalysis of\nreusable fill material component, if applicable; (5)\nan evaluation of the suitability of the\nexcavated material for reuse or recycling, the need for further processing, and\nthe expected final disposition; (6)\nan assessment of potential costs; (7)\nan assessment of the benefits and impacts\nassociated with landfill reclamation; and\n(8)\na determination as to whether landfill\nreclamation is feasible.
