  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 375-6.7 - Other considerations and media\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Soil vapor and vapor intrusion. (1)\n\nThe soil cleanup objectives presented in\nthis Subpart do not account for the impact of concentrations of contaminants in\nsoil relative to soil vapor or vapor intrusion attributable to a remedial\nsite. (2)\n\nThe nature and extent of\nany contamination of the soil vapor media, if present at the site, will be\nevaluated by the remedial investigation. (3)\n\nThe remedy will be protective for soil\nvapor and vapor intrusion and shall address through appropriate removal or\nengineering controls the migration of contaminants in soil and groundwater at\nlevels which could impact the indoor air of buildings. (b) Surface water and sediments. (1)\n\nThe soil cleanup objectives presented in\nthis Subpart do not account for the impact of contaminants in soil relative to\nsurface water and surface water sediments attributable to a remedial\nsite. (2)\n\nThe nature and extent of\nany contamination of the surface water and sediment, if present at the site, will be evaluated by the remedial investigation. (3)\n\nThe remedy for a site will eliminate or\nmitigate the threat to public health and the environment from contaminated\nsurface water and surface water sediments and shall, to the extent feasible: (i) remove, contain or treat the source of a\ndischarge of contaminants from the site to the surface water and\nsediments; (ii)\naddress through\nappropriate removal or engineering controls the migration of contaminants in\nsoil and groundwater at levels which could impact the water quality or\nadversely impact the sediments of a surface water body on or adjacent to the\nsite; and\n(iii)\nremove, contain or\ntreat the impacted surface water and surface water sediments based upon the\ncleanup objectives developed for the remedial program. (c) Adjacent residential\nproperties. (1)\n\nThe soil cleanup objectives\npresented for commercial or industrial use in this Subpart do not directly\naccount for the impact of concentrations of contaminants in soil relative to\nadjacent residential properties attributable to a remedial site. (2)\n\nThe remedy for a site using the\ncommercial or industrial soil cleanup objectives will be protective of adjacent\nresidential properties and shall address, through appropriate removal or\nengineering controls, the migration of contaminants in soil which could impact\nresidential properties adjacent to the site. (d) Soil covers and backfill. (1)\n\nSoil brought to the site for use as a\nsoil cover or backfill must: (i) be comprised\nof soil or other unregulated material as set forth in Part 360 of this\n\nTitle; (ii)\nnot exceed the\napplicable soil cleanup objectives for the use of the site, as set forth in\n\nTable 375-6.8(a) or (b) of this Subpart, as follows: (a) for unrestricted use sites, as set forth\nin Table 375-6.8(a) of this Subpart; (b) for residential, restricted-residential, and commercial use sites use the lower of the protection of groundwater or the\nprotection of public health soil cleanup objectives, for the identified use of\nthe site as set forth in Table 375-6.8(b) of this Subpart; (c) for industrial use sites, use the lower\nof the protection of groundwater or the protection of public health soil\ncleanup objectives for commercial use as set forth in Table 375-6.8(b) of this\n\nSubpart; (d) for restricted use\nsites where an ecological resource that constitutes an important component of\nthe environment is determined to be present, the protection of ecological\nresources soil cleanup objective must also be considered, so as not to preclude\nthe growth and development of plants and soil dwelling organisms nor inhibit\nthe activity of burrowing organisms; or\n(e) a site specific modification to a soil\ncleanup objective, as set forth in section\n375-6.9\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, may also be utilized in compliance with clauses (a) through (d) of\nthis subparagraph. (2)\n\nAnalytical data is required to\ndemonstrate that the material complies with the requirements of paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision. The number of samples required to confirm compliance will\nbe approved in the work plan. The department may issue a site specific\nexemption for the analytical testing requirements, based upon documentation of\nthe origin and composition of the material. (3)\n\nThe department may issue a site specific\nexemption for one or more of the requirements set forth in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, based upon site specific conditions, including but not\nlimited to, the following: (i) the use and\nredevelopment of the site; (ii)\nthe\ndepth of placement of the backfill material; (iii)\nthe depth of placement of the backfill\nmaterial relative to groundwater; (iv)\nthe volume of backfill\nmaterial; (v) the potential for\nodor from the backfill material; (vi)\nthe presence of historic fill in the\nvicinity of the site; (vii)\na\ndepartment issued beneficial use determination, pursuant to Part 360 of this\n\nTitle; or\n(viii)\nbackground levels\nof contamination in areas surrounding the site. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n375-6.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
