  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 4.11 - Contingent permanent appointments to encumbered positions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A position in the competitive, non-competitive or labor class which is temporarily vacant by reason of the\nleave of absence of the permanent incumbent, may be filled on a contingent\npermanent basis through transfer, reinstatement, reassignment or appointment\nfrom an appropriate eligible or reemployment list. (b) An employee appointed on a contingent\npermanent basis shall have all the rights and benefits of a permanent\nappointment; provided, however, that, in the event of the return from leave of\nabsence of the permanent incumbent, such contingent permanent employee shall\ndisplace; first, any temporary or provisional employee serving in the same\ntitle and work location under the jurisdiction of the same appointing\nauthority; and second, the contingent permanent employee with the most recent\ncontingent permanent appointment date serving in the same title and work\nlocation under the jurisdiction of the same appointing authority. Where there\nare no opportunities for displacement as provided herein, such contingent\npermanent employee may return to the position from which he or she is on leave, if any, and shall have his or her name entered on the appropriate reemployment\nlists for the title held on a contingent permanent basis. Additionally, such\nemployee may request to have his or her name restored to the eligible list or\nreemployment list, if any, from which the contingent permanent appointment was\nmade, if such list is still in existence. (c) Upon a vacancy in an unencumbered\nposition, which is in the same title and work location and under the\njurisdiction of the same appointing authority, the contingent permanent\nemployee with the earliest date of contingent permanent appointment shall be\npermanently appointed to such position. (d) The appointing authority shall, at the\ntime of appointment, advise an employee appointed to a position on a contingent\npermanent basis, in writing, that their continuous service in such position is\ncontingent upon the continuing leave of absence of the prior permanent\nincumbent. Further, permanent contingent appointees must be advised of their\nright to a leave of absence, if any, and to permanent appointment, as provided\nin subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Leaves of absence. (1)\nA permanent employee who receives a\ncontingent permanent appointment to a position under the jurisdiction of the\nsame appointing authority shall be entitled to a leave of absence from his or\nher permanent position for the duration of such contingent permanent\nappointment; provided, however, that upon successful completion of the\nprobationary period in the contingent permanent position, he or she may return\nto such permanent position only upon the return of the permanent incumbent, and\nthere are no displacement opportunities as provided for in subdivision (b) of\nthis section. (2)\nA permanent\nemployee who receives a contingent permanent appointment to a position under\nthe jurisdiction of a different appointing authority shall be entitled to a\npermanent appointment to a position in his or her former title under the\njurisdiction of such appointing authority, upon successful completion of the\nprobationary period, if available at that time or at any time during the\ncontingent appointment, from which he or she shall be provided with a leave of\nabsence for the duration of their contingent permanent appointment; provided, however, he or she may return to such permanent position only upon the return\nof the permanent incumbent, and there are no displacement opportunities as\nprovided for in subdivision (b) of this section. (3)\nA contingent permanent employee may be\ngiven a leave of absence from his or her position. If the permanent incumbent\nreturns to the position during the leave of absence of the contingent permanent\nemployee, the right of the contingent permanent employee to return to such\nposition is extinguished and such employee shall have the displacement and\nreemployment rights provided for in subdivision (b) of this section. (f) A permanent employee may not\nbe reassigned to an encumbered position unless the employee agrees, in writing, to accept a contingent permanent appointment to such position. (g) This rule shall not apply to\nreassignments made pursuant to a reassignment list program approved by the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
