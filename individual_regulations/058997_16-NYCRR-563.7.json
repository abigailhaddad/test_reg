  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 563.7 - Land and land rights\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\naccounts for land and land rights shall include the cost of land owned in fee\nby the utility, and rights, interests, and privileges held by the utility in\nland owned by others, such as leaseholds, easements, water and water power\nrights, diversion rights, submersion rights, rights-of-way, and other like\ninterests in land. Do not include in the accounts for land and land rights and\nrights-of-way, costs incurred with first clearing and grading the land and\nrights-of-way and the damage costs associated with the construction and\ninstallation of plant. Such costs shall be included in the appropriate plant\naccounts directly benefited. (b) Where special assessments for public improvements provide for deferred\npayments, the full amount of the assessments shall be charged to the\nappropriate land account and the unpaid balance shall be carried in an\nappropriate liability account. Interest on unpaid balances shall be charged to\nthe appropriate interest account. If any part of the cost of public\nimprovements is included in the general tax levy, the amount thereof shall be\ncharged to the appropriate tax account. (c) The net profit from the sale of timber, wood, sand, gravel, other resources, or other property acquired with the\nright-of-way or other lands shall be credited to the appropriate plant account\nto which related. Where land is held for a considerable period of time and\ntimber and other natural resources on the land at the time of purchase\nincreases in value, the net profit, (after giving effect to the cost of the\nnatural resources) from the sales of timber or its products or other natural\nresources shall be credited to the appropriate utility operating income account\nwhen such land has been recorded in account 105, Water Plant Held for Future\n\nUse, or classified as plant in service otherwise to account 421, Miscellaneous\n\nNonoperating Income. (d) Separate\nentries shall be made for the acquisition, transfer, or retirement of each\nparcel of land, and of each water right, land right, (except rights-of- way for\ndistribution lines), having a life of more than one year. A record shall be\nmaintained showing the nature of ownership, full legal description, area, map\nreference, purpose for which used, city, county, and tax district in which\nsituated, from whom purchased or to whom sold, payment given or received, other\ncosts, contract date and number, date of recording of deed, and book and page\nof record. Entries transferring or retiring land or land rights shall refer to\nthe original entry recording its acquisition. A parcel of land acquired and\ncarried on the books as a unit is not required to be subdivided with transfers\nto other land accounts merely because of the erection thereon of an incidental\nstructure to be used in water operations but for a purpose differing from that\nfor which the land is chiefly employed; for example, a small storehouse on\nsource of supply land. Note: In the case of distribution land rights, when the\nexpected period of occupancy does not exceed the estimated life of the initial\nplant installed, the cost of permits or privileges to place distribution lines\nor other distribution plant and the related pay and expenses of employees and\nother costs incident to acquiring such permits, shall be included in the\naccount appropriate for the cost of the property constructed and not in the\naccounts for distribution land or land rights. (e) Any difference between the amount\nreceived from the sale of land or land rights, less agents' commissions and\nother costs incident to the sale, and the book cost of such land or rights\nshall be included in account 117, Accumulated Gains and Losses from Disposition\nof Utility Land and Land Rights, when such property has been used in utility\nservice or recorded in account 105, Water Plant Held for Future Use, otherwise, such difference shall be included in account 421.1, Gain on Disposition of\n\nProperty, or 421.2, Loss on Disposition of Property, as appropriate, unless a\nreserve therefore has been authorized and provided. Appropriate adjustments of\nthe accounts shall be made with respect to any structures or improvements\nlocated on land sold. (f) The cost\nof buildings and other improvements (other than public improvements) shall not\nbe included in the land accounts. If at the time of acquisition of an interest\nin land such interest extends to buildings or other improvements (other than\npublic improvements), which are then devoted to water operations, the land and\nimprovements shall be separately appraised and the cost allocated to land and\nbuildings or improvements on the basis of the appraisals. If the improvements\nare removed or wrecked without being used in operations, the cost of removing\nor wrecking shall be charged and the salvage credited to the account in which\nthe cost of the land is recorded. (g) When the purchase of land for water\noperations requires the purchase of more land than needed for such purposes, the charge to the specific land account shall be based upon the cost of the\nland purchased, less the fair market value of that portion of the land which is\nnot to be used in utility operations. The portion of the cost measured by the\nfair market value of the land not to be used shall be included in account 105, Water Plant Held for Future Use, account 118.2, Other Utility Plant, or account\n121, Nonutility Property, as appropriate. (h) Provision shall be made for amortizing\namounts carried in the accounts for limited-term interest in land, so as to\napportion equitably the cost of each interest over the life thereof. (See\naccount 111, Accumulated Provision for Amortization of Water Plant in Service, and account 404, Amortization of Limited-term Water Plant.)\n(i) The items of cost to be included in the\naccounts for land and land rights are as follows: (1)\n\nBulkheads, buried, not requiring\nmaintenance or replacement.
