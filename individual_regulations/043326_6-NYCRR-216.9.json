  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 216.9 - Test procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Compliance\nwith the mass emission standards in Table 1 of this Part will be determined by\nstack testing in a manner acceptable to the commissioner. Method 5 as described\nin appendix\nA\nof part 60 of title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations (see\ntable 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) shall be\nconsidered an acceptable method. The sampling rate shall be at least 0.9 dry\nstandard cubic meters per hour (0.53 dry standard cubic feet per minute). The\nsampling for each run must continue for an integral number of cycles with a\ntotal duration of at least 60 minutes except where shorter sampling times, as\nnecessitated by process variables or other factors, are approved by the\ncommissioner. In order to obtain this approval, the source owner must make a\nwritten request describing the factors which make sampling for 60 minutes of\noperation impractical. This written request may be submitted with the testing\nnotification required by Part 202 of this Title. (b) For blast furnace tapping operations, sampling must be conducted during the blast furnace tapping period. (c) For basic oxygen furnaces, sampling of\nthe lancing and fluxing cycles must start at the beginning of the oxygen blow\nand must terminate at the end of the oxygen blow prior to tapping. Sampling of\nflue gases must be discontinued whenever oxygen lancing is terminated (such as\nwhen the vessel is outside of the main hood for temperature measurements and\nsampling) and must resume when oxygen lancing is reinitiated. The sampling\ncycle for tapping must start when the molten steel begins flowing into the\nladle and must end when the molten steel flow stops. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n216.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
