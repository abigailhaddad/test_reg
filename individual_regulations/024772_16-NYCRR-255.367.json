Tit. 16 § 255.367 - Service lines: general requirements for connections to main piping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each service\nline connection to a main should be located at the top of the main or, if that\nis not practical, at the side of the main, unless a suitable protective device\nis installed to minimize the possibility of dust and moisture being carried\nfrom the main into the service line. (b) Each compression-type service line to\nmain connection must: (1)\nbe designed and\ninstalled to effectively sustain the longitudinal pullout or thrust forces\ncaused by contraction or expansion of the piping, or by anticipated external or\ninternal loading; and\n(2)\nif\ngaskets are used in connecting the service line to the main connection fitting, have gaskets that are compatible with the kind of gas in the system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.367\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
