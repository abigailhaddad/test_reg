  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.1 - Sale of tangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1105(a), 1115(a), 1116, 1132(c)\n(a) Imposition. The sales tax is imposed on the receipts from every retail\nsale of tangible personal property delivered by the vendor to the purchaser or\nthe purchaser's designee in this State, unless specifically exempt or excluded\nunder the Tax Law. Cross references: See Part 528 of this Title for sales of property\nspecifically exempt and used in an exempt manner. See Part 529 of this Title for exempt organizations. See Part 534 of this Title for refunds and\ncredits. (b) Taxable\nand exempt items sold as a single unit. When tangible personal property, composed of taxable and\nexempt items is sold as a single unit, the tax shall be collected on the total\nprice. Example: A vendor sells a package containing assorted cheeses, a\ncheese board and a knife for $15. He is required to collect tax on\n$15. (c) Coins or\nother currency. (1)\n\nCurrency exchange. The sale of coins or other currency of one nation for that of another (\ni.e., an exchange) is a financial transaction and is not a\nsale of tangible personal property subject to sales or use tax where: (i) the coins or other currency is\nexchanged; (ii)\nthe exchange rate\nreflects actual currency value; and\n(iii)\nthe coins or other currency is in\ngeneral circulation in the respective nations. (2)\n\nCollecting or investment transaction. The\nsale of a coin which is legal tender is deemed to be a sale for numismatic, coin collecting or investment purposes and is subject to sales or use tax\n(unless otherwise qualifying for exemption under section\n528.29\nof this Title) where the coin: (i) is not in\ngeneral circulation; (ii)\nis\npurchased at a price greater than its legal tender value or, in the case of a\ncoin from a foreign country, is purchased at a price greater than the exchange\nrate; or\n(iii)\nis purchased at a\nvalue determined by the precious metal content of the coin. Example 1: Mr. Smith buys a foreign coin which is legal tender in a\nforeign nation and has an exchange rate value of $30 U.S. The foreign coin\ncontains 800 grains of sterling silver valued at $9. The offering advertisement\nindicated that the coin was a limited, commemorative edition and that the price\non buying or selling will vary from the exchange rate. Mr. Smith pays $40 U.S. for the coin. The sale of the coin in New York is a taxable sale of tangible\npersonal property since it is sold at a price greater than the exchange rate. Example 2: A foreign nation issues a coin for general circulation. The\ncoin is advertised for sale in New York at its exchange rate ($10 U.S. currency), plus postage and handling charges ($3.75). The advertisement\nstresses the limited availability and uniqueness of the coin, the fact that the\ncoins sold are in brilliant, uncirculated condition and that the buying and\nselling rates will reflect service charges and will vary from the exchange\nrate. The sale of these coins is subject to sales tax because the price paid\nfor the coins of $13.75 is greater than the exchange rate. Example 3: A coin dealer purchases a number of uncirculated coin sets\nfrom the U.S. Mint and holds them for sale. The dealer subsequently sells the\ncoin sets at a price greater than their legal tender value. The dealer's\npurchase of the coin sets is not subject to tax as the dealer purchased them\nfor resale. The dealer's subsequent sales of the coin sets to consumers are\nretail sales of tangible personal property subject to sales or use tax, since\nthe coins are sold at a price greater than their legal tender value. Example 4: Mrs. Burns purchases coins from the U.S. Mint. The coins\nhave a legal tender value of $3.35. While the coins purchased are of a\ndenomination and series that are in general circulation, the particular coins\n\nMrs. Burns purchases are uncirculated and are packaged in such a manner as to\nprotect the coins from scratches and other damage. The coins are sold as a set\nfor $10. The sale of these coins is subject to tax because the coins are sold\nat a price greater than their legal tender value.
