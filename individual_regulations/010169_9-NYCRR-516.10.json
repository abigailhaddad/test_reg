  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.10 - Sentencing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Presentencing\nprocedure. (1)\n\nIn general. (i) Procedure. After findings of guilty have\nbeen announced, the prosecution and defense may present matter pursuant to this\nsubdivision to aid the court-martial in determining an appropriate sentence. Such matter is ordinarily presented in the following sequence: (a) presentation by trial counsel of: (1)\nservice data relating to the accused\ntaken from the charge sheet; (2)\npersonal data relating to the accused and of the character of the accused's\nprior service as reflected in the personnel records of the accused; (3)\nevidence of prior convictions, military\nor civilian; (4)\nevidence of\naggravation; and\n(5)\nevidence of\nrehabilitative potential. (b) Presentation by the defense of evidence\nin extenuation or mitigation or both. (c) Rebuttal. (d) Argument by the trial counsel on\nsentence. (e) Argument by the\ndefense counsel on sentence. (f) Rebuttal arguments in the discretion of the military judge. (ii)\n\nAdjudging sentence. A\nsentence must be adjudged in all cases without unreasonable delay. (iii)\n\nAdvice and inquiry. The military judge\nmust personally inform the accused of the right to present matters in\nextenuation and mitigation, including the right to make a sworn or unsworn\nstatement or to remain silent, and must ask whether the accused chooses to\nexercise those rights. (2)\n\nMatter to be presented by the\nprosecution. (i) Service data from the charge\nsheet. Trial counsel must inform the court-martial of the data on the charge\nsheet relating to the age, pay, and service of the accused and the duration and\nnature of any pretrial restraint. In the discretion of the military judge, this\nmay be done by reading the material from the charge sheet or by giving the\ncourt-martial a written statement of such matter. If the defense objects to the\ndata as being materially inaccurate or incomplete, or containing specified\nobjectionable matter, the military judge must determine the issue. Objections\nnot asserted are waived. (ii)\n\nPersonal data and character of prior service of the accused. Trial counsel may\nobtain and introduce from the personnel records of the accused evidence of the\naccused's marital status; number of dependents, if any; and character of prior\nservice. Such evidence includes copies of reports reflecting the past military\nefficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accused and evidence of\nany disciplinary actions including punishments under ML, 130.15. Personnel\nrecords of the accused includes all those records made or maintained in\naccordance with pertinent regulations that reflect the past military\nefficiency, conduct, performance, and history of the accused. If the accused\nobjects to a particular document as inaccurate or incomplete in a specified\nrespect, or as containing matter that is not admissible under the Military\n\nRules of Evidence, the matter must be determined by the military judge. Objections not asserted are waived. (iii)\n\nEvidence of prior convictions of the\naccused. (a) In general. The trial counsel may\nintroduce evidence of military or civilian convictions of the accused. For\npurpose of this subdivision, there is a \"conviction\" in a court-martial case\nwhen a sentence has been adjudged. (b) Pendency of appeal. The pendency of an\nappeal therefrom does not render evidence of a conviction inadmissible except\nthat conviction by summary court-martial or special court-martial without a\nmilitary judge may not be used for purposes of this subdivision until review\nhas been completed pursuant to ML, 130.63 or 130.65, if applicable. Evidence of\nthe pendency of an appeal is admissible. (c) Methods of proof. Previous convictions\nmay be proved by any evidence admissible under the Military Rules of\n\nEvidence. (iv)\n\nEvidence\nin aggravation. The trial counsel may present evidence as to any aggravating\ncircumstances directly relating to or resulting from the offenses of which the\naccused has been found guilty. A written or oral deposition taken in accordance\nwith N.Y.R.C.M. 702 is admissible in aggravation. (v) Evidence of rehabilitative potential. The\ntrial counsel may present, by testimony or oral deposition in accordance with\nN.Y.R.C.M. 702(g)(1), evidence, in the form of opinion, concerning the\naccused's previous performance as a service member and potential for\nrehabilitation. On cross-examination, inquiry is allowable into relevant and\nspecific instances of conduct. (3)\n\nMatter to be presented by the defense. (i) In general. The defense may present\nmatters in rebuttal of any material presented by the prosecution and may\npresent matters in extenuation and mitigation regardless of whether the defense\noffered evidence before findings. (a) Matter\nin extenuation. Matter in extenuation of an offense serves to explain the\ncircumstance surrounding the commission of an offense, including those reasons\nfor committing the offense which do not constitute a legal justification or\nexcuse. (b) Matter in mitigation. Matter in mitigation of an offense is introduced to lessen the punishment to be\nadjudged by the court-martial, or to furnish grounds for a recommendation of\nclemency. It includes the fact that non-judicial punishment under ML, 130.15\nhas been imposed for an offense growing out of the same act or omission that\nconstitutes the offense of which the accused has been found guilty, particular\nacts of good conduct or bravery, and evidence of the reputation or record of\nthe accused in the service for efficiency, fidelity, subordination, temperance, courage, or any other trait that is desirable in a service member. (ii)\n\nStatement by the accused. (a) In general. The accused may testify, make\nan unsworn statement, or both in extenuation, in mitigation, or to rebut\nmatters presented by the trial counsel, or for all three purposes whether or\nnot the accused testified prior to findings. The accused may limit such\ntestimony or statement to any one or more of the specifications of which the\naccused has been found guilty. The filing of an affidavit of the accused is not\npermitted. (b) Testimony of the\naccused. The accused may give sworn oral testimony and is subject to\ncross-examination concerning it by the trial counsel or examination on it by\nthe court-martial, or both. (c) Unsworn statement. The accused may make an unsworn statement and may not be\ncross-examined by the trial counsel upon it by the court-martial. The trial\ncounsel may, however, rebut any statements of facts therein. The unsworn\nstatement may be oral, written, or both, and may be made by the accused, by\ncounsel, or both. (iii)\n\nRules of evidence relaxed. The military judge may, with respect to matters in\nextenuation or mitigation or both, relax the rules of evidence. This may\ninclude admitting letters, affidavits, certificates of military and civil\nofficers, and other writings of similar authenticity and reliability. (4)\n\nRebuttal and surrebuttal. The\ntrial counsel may rebut matters presented by the defense. The defense in\nsurrebuttal may then rebut any rebuttal offered by the trial counsel. Rebuttal\nand surrebuttal may continue, in the discretion of the military judge. If the\n\nMilitary Rules of Evidence were relaxed under subparagraph (3)(iii) of this\nsubdivision, they may be relaxed during rebuttal and surrebuttal to the same\ndegree. (5)\n\nProduction of\nwitnesses. (i) In general. During the\npresentence proceedings, there is to be much greater latitude than on the\nmerits to receive information by means other than testimony presented through\nthe personal appearance of witnesses. Whether a witness will be produced to\ntestify during presentence proceedings is a matter within the discretion of the\nmilitary judge, subject to the limitations in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nLimitations. A\nwitness may be produced to testify during presentence proceedings through a\nsubpoena or travel orders at State expense only if: (a) the testimony expected to be offered by\nthe witness is necessary for consideration of a matter of substantial\nsignificance to a determination or an appropriate sentence, including evidence\nnecessary to resolve an alleged inaccuracy or dispute as to a material\nfact; (b) the weight or credibility\nof the testimony is of substantial significance to the determination of an\nappropriate sentence; (c) the other\nparty refuses to enter into a stipulation of fact containing the matters to\nwhich the witness is expected to testify, except in an extraordinary case when\nsuch a stipulation of fact would be an insufficient substitute for the\ntestimony; (d) other forms of\nevidence, such as oral depositions, written interrogatories, or former\ntestimony would not be sufficient to meet the needs of the court-martial in the\ndetermination of an appropriate sentence; (e) the significance of the personal\nappearance of the witness to the determination of an appropriate sentence, when\nbalanced against the practical difficulties of producing the witness, favors\nproduction of the witness. Factors to be considered include the costs of\nproducing the witness, the timing of the request for production of the witness, the potential delay in the presentencing proceeding that may be caused by the\nproduction of the witness, and the likelihood of significant interference with\nmilitary operational deployment, mission accomplishment, or essential\ntraining. (6)\n\nAdditional matters to be considered. In addition to matters introduced under\nthis subdivision, the court-martial may consider: (i) that a plea of guilty is a mitigating\nfactor; and\n(ii)\nany evidence\nproperly introduced on the merits before findings, including: (a) evidence of other offenses or acts of\nmisconduct even if introduced for a limited purpose; and\n(b) evidence relating to any mental\nimpairment or deficiency of the accused. (7)\n\nArgument. After introduction of matters\nrelating to sentence under this subdivision, trial counsel and defense counsel\nmay argue for an appropriate sentence. Trial counsel may not in argument\npurport to speak for the convening authority or any higher authority, or refer\nto the views of such authorities or any policy directive relative to punishment\nor to any punishment or quantum of punishment greater than that court-martial\nmay adjudge. Trial counsel may, however, recommend a specific lawful sentence\nand may also refer to generally accepted sentencing philosophies, including\nrehabilitation of the accused, general deterrence, specific deterrence of\nmisconduct by the accused, and social retribution. Failure to object to\nimproper argument before the military judge begins to instruct the members on\nsentencing shall waive the objection. (b) Sentence determination. Subject to\nlimitations in 130.18, 130.19 and 130.20(b), ML, as appropriate, the sentence\nto be adjudged is a matter within the discretion of the court-martial. To the\nextent that punishment is discretionary, the sentence must provide a legal, appropriate, and adequate punishment, including a sentence of no\npunishment. (c) Punishments. (1)\n\nIn general. Subject to the limitations in\nthis Chapter, the punishments authorized in the code may be adjudged in the\ncase of any person found guilty of an offense by a court-martial. (2)\n\nAuthorized punishments. Subject to the\nlimitations in ML, 130.18, 130.19 and 130.20(b), a court-martial may adjudge\nonly the following punishments: (i) Reprimand. A court-martial cannot specify the terms or wording of a reprimand. A\nreprimand, if approved, must be issued, in writing, by the convening\nauthority. (ii)\n\nForfeiture of pay\nand allowances. A sentence of forfeiture must state the exact amount in whole\ndollars to be forfeited each month and the number of months the forfeitures\nwill last. The maximum authorized amount of a partial forfeiture is determined\nby using the basic pay authorized by the cumulative years of service of the\naccused, and, if no confinement is adjudged any sea or foreign duty pay. If the\nsentence also includes reduction in grade expressly or by operation of law, the\nmaximum forfeiture is based on the grade to which the accused is\nreduced. (iii)\n\nFine. Any\ncourt-martial may adjudge a fine instead of, or in addition to, forfeitures. Special and summary courts-martial may not adjudge any fine in excess of the\ntotal amount of forfeitures which may be adjudged in that case. In order to\nenforce collection, a fine may be accompanied by a provision in the sentence\nthat, in the event the fine is not paid, the person fined must, in addition to\nany period of confinement adjudged, be further confined for a period not\nexceeding one day for each dollar of fine imposed. The total period of\nconfinement so adjudged cannot exceed the jurisdictional limitations of the\ncourt-martial (see ML, 131.8). (iv)\n\nReduction in pay grade. Except as provided in N.Y.R.C.M. 1301(d), a\ncourt-martial may sentence an enlisted member to be reduced to an inferior pay\ngrade. (v) Confinement at hard\nlabor. The place of confinement cannot be designated by the court-martial. A\ncourt-martial cannot adjudge a sentence to solitary confinement or to\nconfinement without hard labor (ML, 130.57 and 130.58). (vi)\n\nPunitive separation. A court-martial may\nnot adjudge an administrative separation from the service. There are three\ntypes of punitive separation: (a) Dismissal. Dismissal applies only to commissioned officers, commissioned warrant officers, cadets, and midshipmen and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial. A\ndismissal may be adjudged for any offense of which an officer, cadet, or\nmidshipman has been found guilty. (b) Dishonorable discharge. A dishonorable\ndischarge applies only to enlisted persons and warrant officers who are not\ncommissioned and may be adjudged only by a general court-martial. A\ndishonorable discharge should be reserved for those who should be separated\nunder conditions of dishonor, after having been convicted to offenses requiring\nsevere punishment. (c) Bad-conduct\ndischarge. A bad-conduct discharge applies only to enlisted persons and may be\nadjudged by a general court-martial and by a special court-martial which has\nmet the requirement of N.Y.R.C.M. 201(f)(2). A bad-conduct discharge is less\nsevere than a dishonorable discharge and is designed as a punishment for\nbad-conduct rather than as a punishment for serious offenses. It is also\nappropriate for an accused who has been convicted repeatedly of minor offenses\nand whose punitive separation appears to be necessary. (3)\n\nLimits on punishments. (i) Maximum punishment. The maximum limits\nfor the authorized punishments of confinement, forfeitures, and punitive\ndischarge (if any) are set forth in ML, 130.18, 130,19, and 130.20(c), for\nrespectively, general, special, and summary courts-martial. It is not mandatory\nthat any or all of the maximum punishments be imposed. When a dishonorable\ndischarge is authorized, a bad-conduct discharge is also authorized. The types\nof punishments listed in paragraph (2) of this subdivision may be\nimposed. (ii)\n\nBased on rank of\naccused. (a) Commissioned or warrant\nofficers. (1)\nA commissioned or warrant\nofficer may not be reduced in grade by any court-martial. (2)\n\nOnly a general court-martial may sentence\na commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet, or midshipman to\nconfinement. (3)\n\nOnly a general\ncourt-martial, upon conviction of any offense in violation of the code, may\nsentence a commissioned or warrant officer or a cadet or midshipman to be\nseparated from the service with a punitive separation. In the case of officers, cadets, and midshipmen, the separation is by dismissal. In the case of\nnoncommissioned warrant officers, the separation is by dishonorable\ndischarge. (b) Enlisted\npersons (see subsection N.Y.R.C.M. 1301[d]). (d) Instructions on sentence. (1)\n\nIn general. The military judge must give\nthe members appropriate instructions on sentence. (2)\n\nWhen given. Instructions on sentence must\nbe given after arguments by counsel and before the members close to deliberate\non sentence, but the military judge may upon request of the members, any party, or sua sponte, give additional instructions at a later time. (3)\n\nRequests for instructions. After\npresentation of matters relating to sentence or at such other time as the\nmilitary judge may permit, any party may request that the military judge\ninstruct the members on the law as set forth in the request. The military judge\nmay require the requested instruction to be written. Each party has the\nopportunity to be heard on any proposed instruction on sentence before it is\ngiven. The military judge must inform the parties of the proposed action on\nsuch requests before their closing arguments on sentence. (4)\n\nHow given. Instructions on sentence must\nbe given orally on the record in the presence of all parties and the members. Written copies of the instructions, or unless a party objects, portions of\nthem, may also be given to the members for their use during\ndeliberations. (5)\n\nRequired\ninstructions. Instructions on sentence must include: (i) a statement of the maximum authorized\npunishment which may be adjudged; (ii)\na statement of the procedures for\ndeliberation and voting on the sentence set out in N.Y.R.C.M. 1006; (iii)\na statement informing the members that\nthey are solely responsible for selecting an appropriate sentence and may not\nrely on the possibility of any mitigating action by the convening or higher\nauthority; and\n(iv)\na statement\nthat the members should consider all matters in extenuation, mitigation, and\naggravation, whether introduced before or after findings, and matters\nintroduced under N.Y.R.C.M. 1006(b)(1), (2), (3) and (5). (6)\n\nWaiver. Failure to object to an\ninstruction or to omission of an instruction before the members close to\ndeliberate on the sentence waives the objection in the absence of plain error. The military judge may require the party objecting to specify in what respect\nthe instructions were improper. The parties have the opportunity to be heard on\nany objection outside the presence of the members. (e) Deliberations and voting on sentence. (1)\n\nIn general. The members must deliberate\nand vote after the military judge instructs the members on sentence. Only the\nmembers are to be present during deliberations and voting. Superiority in rank\ncannot be used in any manner to control the independence of members in the\nexercise of their judgement (130.37, ML). (2)\n\nDeliberations. Deliberations may properly\ninclude full and free discussion of the sentence to be imposed in the case. Unless otherwise directed by the military judge, members may take with them in\ndeliberations their notes, if any, any exhibits admitted in evidence, and any\nwritten instructions. Members may request that the court-martial be reopened\nand that portions of the record be read to them or additional evidence\nintroduced. The military judge may, in the exercise of discretion, grant such\nrequests. (3)\n\nProposal of\nsentences. Any member may propose a sentence. Each proposal must be in writing\nand must contain the complete sentence proposed. The junior member collects the\nproposed sentences and submits them to the president. (4)\n\nVoting (ML, 130.51). (i) Duty of members. Each member has the duty\nto vote for a proper sentence for the offenses of which the court-martial found\nthe accused guilty regardless of the member's vote or opinion as to the guilt\nof the accused. (ii)\n\nSecret ballot. Proposed sentences must be voted on by secret written ballot. (iii)\n\nProcedure. (a) Order. All members must vote on each\nproposed sentence in its entirety beginning with the least severe, and\ncontinuing, as necessary, with the next least severe, until a sentence is\nadopted by the concurrence of the number of members required under subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph. The process of proposing sentences and voting on them\nmay be repeated as necessary until a sentence is adopted. (b) Counting votes. The junior member\ncollects the ballots and counts the votes. The president checks the count and\ninforms the other members of the result. (iv)\n\nNumber of votes required. A sentence may\nbe adjudged only if at least two-thirds of the members present vote for that\nsentence. (v) Effect of failure to\nagree. If the required number of members do not agree on a sentence after a\nreasonable effort to do so, a mistrial may be declared as to the sentence and\nthe case must be returned to the convening authority, who may order a rehearing\non sentence only or order that a sentence of no punishment be\nimposed. (5)\n\nAction\nafter a sentence is reached. After the members have agreed upon a sentence, the\ncourt-martial must be opened and the president must inform the military judge\nthat a sentence has been reached. The military judge may, in the presence of\nthe parties, examine any writing which the president intends to read to\nannounce the sentence and may assist the members in putting the sentence in\nproper form. Neither that writing nor any oral or written clarification or\ndiscussion concerning it constitutes announcement of the sentence. (f) Announcement of sentence. (1)\n\nIn general. The sentence is announced by\nthe president or, in a court-martial composed of a military judge alone, by the\nmilitary judge, in the presence of all parties promptly after it has been\ndetermined (ML, 130.53). (2)\n\nErroneous announcement. If the announced sentence is not the one actually\ndetermined by the court-martial, the error may be corrected by a new\nannouncement made before the record of trial is authenticated and forwarded to\nthe convening authority. This action is not a reconsideration of the sentence. If the court-martial has been adjourned before the error is discovered, the\nmilitary judge may call the court-martial into session to correct the\nannouncement. (3)\n\nPolling\nprohibited. Except as provided in Mil. R. Evid. 606, members may not otherwise\nbe questioned about their deliberations and voting. (g) Impeachment of sentence. A sentence which\nis proper on its fact may be impeached only when extraneous prejudicial\ninformation was improperly brought to the attention of a member, outside\ninfluence was improperly brought to bear upon any member, or unlawful command\ninfluence was brought to bear upon any member. (h) Reconsideration of sentence. (1)\n\nTime for reconsideration. Subject to this\nsubdivision, a sentence may be reconsidered by the members or the military\njudge who reached it at any time before the record of trial is\nauthenticated. (2)\n\nLimitations. After a sentence has been announced, it may not be increased upon\nreconsideration unless the sentence announced was less than the mandatory\nminimum prescribed for an offense of which the accused has been found\nguilty. (3)\n\nInitiation of\nreconsideration. (i) By members. Any member\nmay propose that a sentence reached by the members be reconsidered. (ii)\n\nBy military judge. (a) Adjudged by military judge. The military\njudge may initiate reconsideration of a sentence adjudged by that military\njudge. (b) Reached by members. When\na sentence reached by members is ambiguous or apparently illegal, the military\njudge must bring the matter to the attention of the members if the matter\ndiscovered before the court-martial is adjourned. If the matter is discovered\nafter adjournment, the military judge may call a session for reconsideration\nand proceed in accordance with paragraph (4) of this subdivision, or may bring\nthe matter to the attention of the convening authority. (iii)\n\nBy convening authority. When a sentence\nadjudged by the court-martial is ambiguous or apparently illegal, the convening\nauthority may return the matter to the court-martial for clarification or may\napprove a sentence no more severe than the legal, unambiguous portions of the\nadjudged sentence. (4)\n\nProcedure with members. (i) Instructions. When\na sentence has been reached by members and reconsideration has been initiated\nunder paragraph (3) of this subdivision, the military judge must instruct the\nmembers on the procedure for reconsideration. (ii)\n\nVoting. The members must vote by secret\nwritten ballot in closed session whether to reconsider a sentence already\nreached by them. (iii)\n\nNumber of\nvotes required. (a) With a view to\nincreasing. Subject to paragraph (2) of this subdivision, members may\nreconsider a sentence with a view of increasing it only if at least a majority\nvote to reconsider. (b) With a view\nto decreasing. Members may reconsider a sentence with a view to decreasing it\nonly if more than one-third of the members vote to reconsider. (iv)\n\nSuccessful vote. If a vote to\nreconsider a sentence succeeds, the procedure in N.Y.R.C.M. 1005 shall\napply. (i) Advice concerning post-trial and appellate rights. (1)\n\nAdvice. In each general and special\ncourt-martial, after the sentence is announced and before the court-martial is\nadjourned, the military judge must inform the accused of: (i) the right to submit matters to the\nconvening authority to consider before taking action; (ii)\nthe right to appellate review, as\napplicable, and the effect of waiver or withdrawal of such rights; (iii)\nthe right to apply for relief from the\n\nState judge advocate if the case is not reviewed by the Board of Military\n\nReview; and\n(iv)\nthe right to the\nadvice and assistance of counsel in the exercise of the foregoing rights or any\ndecision to waive them. (2)\n\nInquiry. After compliance with paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision, the military judge must inquire of the accused to\nensure that the accused understands the advice. (j) Adjournment. The military judge may\nadjourn the court-martial at the end of the trial of an accused or proceed to\ntrial of other cases referred to that court-martial. Such an adjournment may be\nfor a definite or indefinite period. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
