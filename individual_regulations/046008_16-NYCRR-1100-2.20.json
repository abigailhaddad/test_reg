  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.20 - Exhibit 19: Environmental Justice\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 19 shall contain: (a) An identification and evaluation of\nsignificant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts of the facility\non an Environmental Justice (EJ) area, if any, resulting from its construction\nand operation, including any studies which were used in the evaluation and\nidentifying the author and dates thereof. The evaluation shall be conducted\nconsistent with the applicable requirements of 6 NYCRR Part\n487.10. The impact\nstudy area for purposes of EJ analysis shall be: (1)\n\nAt a minimum, be within a one-half\n(0.5)-mile radius around the proposed facility; or\n(2)\nA greater radius based on site-specific\nfactors, including nature, scope and magnitude of the environmental impacts, the projected range of those impacts on various environmental resources, and\nthe geography of the area surrounding the location of the proposed\nfacility. (b) Separately\nidentified to the fullest extent possible and with sufficient detail, the\nnature and magnitude of all significant and adverse disproportionate\nenvironmental impacts of the facility resulting from its construction and\noperation required to be identified pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection, a description of: (1)\n\nThe specific\nmeasures the applicant proposes to take to avoid such impacts to the maximum\nextent practicable for the duration of the siting permit, including a\ndescription of the manner in which such impact avoidance measures will be\nverified and a statement of the cost of such measures; (2)\n\nIf such impacts cannot be avoided, measures the applicant proposes to take to minimize such impacts to the maximum\nextent practicable for the duration that the siting permit is granted, including a description of the manner in which such impact mitigation measures\nwill be verified and a statement of the cost of such measures; and\n(3)\n\nIf such impacts cannot be avoided, the\nspecific measures the applicant proposes to take to offset such impacts to the\nmaximum extent practicable for the duration that the siting permit is in\neffect, including a description of the manner in which such impact offset\nmeasures will be verified and a statement of the cost of such\nmeasures. (c) A\nqualitative and, where possible, quantitative analysis demonstrating that the\nscope of avoidance, mitigation and offset measures is appropriate given the\nscope of significant and adverse disproportionate environmental impacts of the\nfacility resulting from its construction and operation. (d) A summary of the applicant's final EJ\nanalysis, including the evaluation of any significant and adverse\ndisproportionate environmental impacts in the impact study area. The statement\nshall provide a detailed explanation of the rationale for any conclusions made\nrelated to EJ issues and identify the individual studies and investigations\nrelied upon in conducting each element of the EJ analysis. The applicant shall\narticulate the reasons why the proposed measures to avoid, minimize, or offset\nany disproportionate environmental impacts of the proposed facility will, to\nthe maximum extent practicable, avoid, minimize or offset any identified\nsignificant and adverse disproportionate impacts, including a description of\nthe manner in which such measures can be verified and a statement of the cost\nof such measures.
