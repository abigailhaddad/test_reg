Tit. 6 §§ 43-1.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of this Subpart is to promote and support the\nmaintenance of viable surf clam and ocean quahog populations in select areas of\nthe Marine and Coastal District. The Marine and Coastal District includes the\nwaters of the Atlantic Ocean within three nautical miles from the coastline and\nall other tidal waters within the State, including the Hudson River up to the\n\nGovernor Mario M. Cuomo Bridge. The provisions of this Subpart are designed to\nlimit mechanical surf clam and ocean quahog harvesting activities to\nspecifically defined areas of the Marine and Coastal District, to require a\nspecial surf clam/ocean quahog mechanical harvesting permit, to provide\nspecific controls over the design of mechanical harvesting gear, weekly and\nannual harvest quotas, open and closed seasons, and to require recordkeeping\nand reporting. Such requirements and controls are intended to support the\ncontinuation of a limited capacity fishery in the involved waters of the Marine\nand Coastal District so that the fishery continues to operate in basic balance\nwith available surf clam and ocean quahog stocks and to aid in the management\nof a complex system of shellfish resources in adjoining\nwaters.
