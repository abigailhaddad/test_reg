  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2502.4 - Adjustment of legal regulated rent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAn owner may file an application to\nincrease the legal regulated rents of the building or building complex, on\nforms prescribed by the division, on the following ground: Substantial\nrehabilitation. (2)\n\nUpon\napplication by the owner, the division may grant an appropriate adjustment of a\nlegal regulated rent where it finds that: (i) There has been since January 1, 1974 an increase in the rental value of the\nhousing accommodations as a result of a substantial rehabilitation of the\nbuilding or housing accommodations therein which materially adds to the value\nof the property or appreciably prolongs its life, excluding ordinary repairs, maintenance and replacements and that the legal regulated rent has not been\nadjusted prior to the application based in whole or part upon the grounds set\nforth in the application. (b) Temporary major capital improvement rent\nadjustments. (1)\n\nAn owner of a building or\nbuilding complex that contains more than thirty-five (35) percent\nrent-regulated units may file an application to temporarily increase the legal\nregulated rents of the building or building complex on forms prescribed by the\nDHCR which includes an itemized list of work performed and a description or\nexplanation of the reason or purpose of such work, on one or more of the\nfollowing grounds: (i) There has been a major\ncapital improvement, including an installation, which must meet all of the\nfollowing criteria: (a) it is deemed\ndepreciable under the Internal Revenue Code, other than for ordinary\nrepairs; (b) it is essential for\nthe preservation, energy efficiency, functionality or infrastructure of the\nentire building, including heating, windows, plumbing and roofing, but shall\nnot be for operational costs or unnecessary cosmetic improvements; (c) it is an improvement to the building or\nto the building complex which inures directly or indirectly to the benefit of\nall tenants, and which includes the same work performed in all similar\ncomponents of the building or building complex, unless the owner can\nsatisfactorily demonstrate to the DHCR that certain of such similar components\ndid not require improvement; and\n(d) the item being replaced meets the\nrequirements set forth on the following useful life schedule, except with DHCR\napproval of a waiver, as set forth in clause (e) of this subparagraph.

(e) (1)\n\nAn\nowner who wishes to request a waiver of the useful life requirement set forth\nin clause (d) of this subparagraph must apply to the DHCR for such waiver prior\nto the commencement of the work for which he or she will be seeking a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rental increase. Notwithstanding this requirement, where the waiver requested is for an item being replaced because of an\nemergency, which causes the building or any part thereof to be dangerous to\nhuman life and safety or detrimental to health, an owner may apply to the DHCR\nfor such waiver at the time he or she submits the temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase application. (2)\n\nIf the waiver is denied, the owner will\nnot be eligible for a temporary major capital improvement increase. However, if\nthe waiver is granted, the useful life requirement will not be a factor in the\ndetermination of eligibility for the temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease. Approval of the waiver does not assure that the application will be\ngranted, as all other requirements set for thin this paragraph must be\nmet. (3)\n\nAn owner may apply for, and the DHCR may grant, a waiver of the useful life requirements set forth in\nthe Useful Life Schedule, if the owner satisfactorily demonstrates the\nexistence of one or more of the following circumstances: (i) The item or equipment cannot be repaired\nand must be replaced during its useful life because of a fire, vandalism or\nother emergency, or \"act of God\" resulting in an emergency; (ii)\n\nThe item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced because such item or equipment is beyond repair, or spare parts are no\nlonger available, or required repairs would cost more than seventy-five (75)\npercent of the cost of the total replacement of the item or equipment. Certification by a duly licensed engineer or architect, where there is no\ncommon ownership or other financial interest with the owner, shall be\nconsidered substantial proof of such condition(s). The owner may also be\nrequired to submit proof that the item or equipment was properly maintained. Such proof may include receipts for repairs and parts or maintenance\nlogs; (iii)\n(A)\n\nAn appropriate New York State or local\ngovernmental agency has determined that the item or equipment needs to be\nreplaced as part of a government housing program; (B)\n\nIf a governmental lender or insurer, for\nthe purposes of qualifying for a New York State or local government long-term\nloan or insured loan, requires the remaining useful life of the building or\nbuilding complex, as well as the component parts of such building or building\ncomplex, to be as great as or greater than the term of the loan\nagreement. (iv)\n\nThe\nreplacement of an item or equipment which has proven inadequate, through no\nfault of the owner, is necessary, provided that there has been no major capital\nimprovement rent increase for that item or equipment being replaced. (4)\n\nIn the event that the DHCR\ndetermines that an installation qualifies for a waiver of the useful life\nrequirements, the DHCR may, subject to all other requirements of this section\nand the limitations of the reasonable cost schedule provisions in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision: (i) Where no previous\nincrease was granted within the useful life of the item or equipment being\nreplaced, approve 100 percent of the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of\nthe item or equipment, including installation; (ii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced during its useful life, grant a temporary increase\nbased on the actual, reasonable, and verifiable cost of the item or equipment, including installation, less both (a) the amount reimbursed from other sources, such as insurance proceeds or any other form of commercial guarantee, and (b)\nthe amount of any increase previously granted for the same item or equipment\neither as a major capital improvement, or pursuant to other governmental\nprograms, if such item or equipment has not exhausted at least seventy-five\n(75) percent of its useful life at the time of the installation; (iii)\n\nWhere it is determined that an item is\neligible to be replaced even though it has not exhausted seventy-five (75)\npercent of its useful life and that it was installed as part of a substantial\nrehabilitation or the new construction of a building for which the owner set\ninitial building-wide rents, the DHCR may reduce the increase granted for a\nmajor capital improvement by a proportion of the remaining useful life of such\nitem or equipment; (iv)\n\nWhere it is\ndetermined that an item is eligible to be replaced even though it has not\nexhausted one-hundred (100) percent of its useful life, but has exhausted more\nthan seventy-five (75) percent of its useful life, the DHCR may reduce the\nincrease granted for a major capital improvement by a proportion of the\nremaining useful life of such item or equipment. (f) In no event shall a temporary major\ncapital improvement increase be granted for work done in individual apartments\nthat is otherwise not an improvement to an entire building. (ii)\n\nThere has been other necessary work\nperformed in connection with, and directly related to a major capital\nimprovement, which may be included in the computation of an increase in the\nlegal regulated rent only if such other necessary work was completed within a\nreasonable time after the completion of the major capital improvement to which\nit relates. Such other necessary work must: (a) improve, restore or preserve the quality\nof the structure and the grounds; (b) have been completed subsequent to, or\ncontemporaneously with, the completion of the work for the major capital\nimprovement; and\n(c) not be for\nprimarily cosmetic improvements or for operational costs. (iii)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there has\nbeen an increase in services or improvement, other than repairs, on a\nbuilding-wide basis, which the owner can demonstrate are necessary in order to\ncomply with a specific requirement of law. (iv)\n\nWith approval by the DHCR, there have\nbeen other improvements made or services provided to the building or building\ncomplex, other than those specified in subparagraphs (i)-(iii) of this\nparagraph, with the express consent of the tenants in occupancy of at least\nseventy-five (75) percent of the rent regulated housing\naccommodations. (2)\n\nMajor\n\nCapital Improvement Schedules\n(i) The\nreasonable costs that may be recovered for qualified major capital improvements\nmay not exceed the recoverable costs, as determined by DHCR. In making such\ndetermination, DHCR shall, unless for good cause shown or other wise specified, refer to such reasonable costs as specified in the Reasonable Cost Schedule\nfound in the Reasonable Cost Schedule that is in effect at the time that the\ncontract for work for the major capital improvement was executed. (ii)\n\nThe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall\nprovide the recoverable cost of major capital improvements that fall within the\nfollowing main three categories: 1. Major\n\nSystems; i. The maximum recoverable costs\nshall be presented for the following classes of work: (a) Plumbing; (b) Gas Repipe; (c) Wiring; (d) Windows; (e) Boiler/Burner; (f) Hot Water Heater; (g) Elevator Replacement; and\n(h) Elevator Modernization. 2. Facade, Parapet, Roof; i. The maximum recoverable costs shall\nbe presented for the following classes of work: (a) Facade; (b) Parapet; and\n(c) Roof. 3. Other Systems. i. The maximum recoverable costs shall be\npresented for the following classes of work: (a) Chimney; (b) Doors; (c) Security System; and\n(d) Intercom; and may include such other\nsystems as DHCR may determine. (iii)\n\nEach class of major capital improvement\nmay list more detailed types of capital improvement work. Each class of major\ncapital improvement described in the Schedule may be inclusive of additional\ncosts that can be associated with the type of improvements listed within such\nclass. (iv)\n\nThe costs of each type\nof major capital improvement work will be listed as per unit, per unit of\nmeasurement or per piece of equipment, as is appropriate given the nature of\nthe improvement. (v) The maximum\nrecoverable costs for each type of major capital improvement specified in the\ninitial Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be based on a survey of such\nconstruction costs undertaken for such installation. (a) The maximum recoverable costs listed in\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be initially published and made available\nfor public review and comment in conjunction with the promulgation process\nrequired for adoption of this regulation. (vi)\n\nPeriodic Review of Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule: Every year after adoption of this regulation, DHCR shall assess and\nreview the categories of major capital improvements, the classes of work within\ncategories eligible for major capital improvements and the maximum recoverable\ncosts listed for the types of major capital improvement costs identified in the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (vii)\n\nProcedure: (a) When applying for a temporary\nmajor capital improvement rent increase, owners are required to submit an\nitemized list of work performed with a description or explanation of the reason\nor purpose of such work. (1)\n\nCosts may be\ngranted for related expenses that are not specified in the actual schedule, if\nthey are found to be: (i) within or below the\nmaximum costs for the class of work, (ii)\nare necessary for the claimed\nimprovement, and\n(iii)\neligible for\nreimbursement as a major capital improvement. (2)\n\nCosts will not be granted for expenses\nwhich are ineligible for major capital improvement rent increases. (3)\n\nOnly the actual and verifiable amounts\nexpended by owners for qualifying major capital improvement costs will be the\nbasis for any temporary major capital improvement rent increase. Qualifying\nowners will, therefore, be awarded a temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease on the lesser of either: (i) the\nactual amount expended, or\n(ii)\nthe\nmaximum reasonable cost from the schedule, and such other additional items that\nare eligible as a major capital improvement but are not listed as part of the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule. (b) The schedule provides a maximum of costs\nthat can be granted for eligible major capital improvements. All costs granted\nfor a temporary major capital improvement rent increase must be actual, reasonable, verifiable, and meet all other regulatory\nrequirements. (viii)\n\nWaiver of Application of Reasonable Cost Schedule\n(a) Owners may apply for a waiver of\napplication of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. The waiver request will be denied, unless the owner satisfies the waiver requirements provided herein, and the\n\nDivision finds the waiver of the application of the schedule to be reasonable\nand warranted under the circumstances set forth in such application. (b) If an owner's application for a waiver of\nthe reasonable cost schedule is denied, the owner's maximum recoupment shall be\nlimited to that required by the applicable Reasonable Cost Schedule. (c) Notwithstanding any waiver of the\nreasonable cost schedule, not all costs claimed for a temporary major capital\nimprovement rent increase may be awarded, as the costs of items claimed may be\ndisallowed, in whole or in part, pursuant to all other requirements set forth\nin this section that must be met and fully supported. (d) Pursuant to the requirements specified\nbelow, such application must be fully supported and demonstrate that the\nclaimed costs underlying the temporary MCI rent increase are: (1)\nnot identified in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule, or\n(2)\nnecessarily and\nappropriately priced higher than those costs listed in the Reasonable Cost\n\nSchedule due to the unique nature of the installation and the circumstances\nsurrounding such installation, and such costs are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under these\ncircumstances, or\n(3)\nthat use of\nthe Reasonable Cost Schedule will cause an undue hardship and the use of\nalternative procedures are appropriate to the interests of the owner, the\ntenants, and the public, and the costs of such improvement are accurate, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase under the\ncircumstances. (e) Owners\nmust request a waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule in writing and\naccompany the application with the information and documentation as specified\nin subparagraph (x) of this paragraph. (ix)\n\nRequirements for Waiver under Specific\n\nCircumstances\n(a) At the time of the initial\napplication for a temporary major capital improvement rent increase, an owner\nmust apply for a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule. Such\napplication shall include all necessary requirements set forth in subparagraph\n(viii) of this paragraph and must also meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nNon-Landmarked Buildings (Buildings not\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission): (i) A\nlicensed engineer or architect must certify that: (A)\nthe major capital improvement costs for\nwhich an owner seeks a temporary major capital improvement rent increase are\naccurate and reasonable under the circumstances; and\n(B)\nthere is no common ownership or other\nfinancial interest between the contractor installing the replacement or upgrade\nand the ownership entity of the owner; and\n(C)\na bid process was conducted and\nsupervised by a licensed architect or engineer. (2)\n\nLandmarked Buildings (Buildings\ndesignated by the Landmark Commission): The costs beyond those permitted by the\n\nReasonable Cost Schedule that were the result of any law, regulation, rule, or\nrequirement under which the premises have been designated a landmark\nbuilding. (3)\n\nCapital Improvement\n\nWork Performed While Also Under Another Governmental Agency's Supervision: DHCR\nmay also accept the cost of contract where: (i) the building is subject to both (a) this\n\nTitle and (b) another housing program, and\n(ii)\nthe contract is approved by or awarded\nunder the supervision of a state, city or local housing entity in conjunction\nwith that affordable housing program, and\n(iii)\nsuch supervision includes a process by\nwhich such supervising agency reviews the costs to assure they are\nreasonable. (4)\n\nEmergency\n\nCapital Improvements: DHCR may also accept the cost of contract where capital\nimprovements were performed to remedy an emergency condition and for which the\nowner paid more than the reasonable costs due to such emergency. The costs must\nbe actual, reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible for a rent increase\nunder the circumstances. (5)\n\nInterim Rules: (i) An owner may apply for a\nwaiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule if, prior to the\neffective date of this subparagraph (ix), it has either: (A)\nentered a contract for the performance of\nmajor capital improvement work within two years immediately preceding January\n27, 2021, the final adoption date of Emergency Regulation HCR-26-20-00012, or\n(B)\nsubmitted to DHCR an\napplication for a temporary major capital improvement rent\nincrease. (ii)\n\nThe\nrecoverable costs will be determined according to the applicable Reasonable\n\nCost Schedule and these provisions, but the owner need not submit evidence of\ncompliance with the bidding requirements set forth in clause (b) of\nsubparagraph (x) of this paragraph; owner may instead submit for review\nalternative means of establishing the reasonableness of the major capital\nimprovement costs sought to be recovered. (iii)\n\nFor pending major capital improvement\napplications, an owner was required to make this waiver application within 60\ndays of June 16, 2020, unless in the context of processing the major capital\nimprovement application the owner was directed by DHCR to submit an application\nfor waiver. (x) Waiver Procedure: As part of the written Waiver application for\nnon-emergency capital improvements, owners must submit the following: (a) A certification by a licensed architect\nor engineer stating that: (1)\n\nThe purchases\nand contracts, whose costs owner seeks to recover have been awarded on the\nbasis of analysis and bidding to the fullest extent possible, but with no less\nthan three bidders having been solicited to perform the work unless the owner\ncan demonstrate that the work is so highly specialized that such bids cannot be\nextended; (2)\n\nList of items for\nwhich owner solicited bids were necessary; (3)\n\nThe costs claimed by owner for the major\ncapital improvement work are accurate and reasonable, provided that the\narchitect or engineer's basis for such conclusion is fully and credibly\nsupported; (4)\n\nAll changes to the\noriginal agreed upon scope of work were necessary to the underlying major\ncapital improvement and reasonably priced; (5)\n\nThe owner selected the lowest responsible\nbidder or the bidder best suited to perform the major capital improvement work, provided that the architect or engineer's basis for such conclusion is credibly\nsupported; and\n(6)\n\nSuch other and\nadditional proof as DHCR may require to as certain the need for the waiver and\nthe certification of such reasonable, necessary, verifiable, and eligible\ncosts. (b) Certification\nby owner that it has complied with bid process requirements including\nsubmission of: (1)\n\nTabulation of all bids\nreceived; and\n(2)\n\nCopies of all\nbids received; and\n(3)\nA\ncertification by each bidder disclosing whether the owner or any board member, general partner, officer or employee of owner, and/or principal or employee of\nany managing agent retained by owner, has a direct or indirect interest in the\nbidder or in the compensation to be received by the bidder pursuant to the\nproposed contract. Failure to accurately and fully complete this certification\nmay result in the rejection of the bid for purposes of determining owner's\napplication for waiver of the use of the Reasonable Cost Schedule, as well as\nrejection and a dismissal of the major capital improvement application; and\n(4)\n\nDetailed description of the\nitems for which owner initially solicited bids. (c) A certification by the owner's architect\nor engineer certifying the necessity, appropriateness, and reasonableness of\nthe costs of all changes to the original agreed upon scope of work that were\nperformed in connection with the major capital improvement, along with a\ndescription of the changes in the scope, price, or time of completion of the\nwork related to each change order. (xi)\n\nFor Emergency Capital Improvement MCI\nApplications: The owner must submit a statement from an independent\nengineer or architect describing the emergency, why the costs were greater than\nthose in the schedule, that the costs were reasonable for the situation, and\nwhy the owner could not obtain three bids in a timely manner due to the exigent\ncircumstances. (xii)\n\nNotice: As part of the MCI application process, any request by an\nowner for a waiver of application of the Reasonable Cost Schedule shall be made\navailable to the tenants of the subject building(s) with an opportunity to\ncomment on and contest the waiver. (xiii)\n\nOperational Bulletin The initial\n\nOperational Bulletin 2020-1 including all amendments, shall be issued pursuant\nto this paragraph and Section\n2507.11\nof this Title. The\n\nOperational Bulletin 2020-1 and all amended versions shall be available in\nhardcopy form at 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and will\nbe available on DHCR's website at\nwww.hcr.ny.gov.

For\nincreases pursuant to subparagraphs (1) (iii) and (iv) of this subdivision, in\nthe discretion of the DHCR, an appropriate charge may be imposed in lieu of an\namortization charge when an amortization charge is insignificant or\ninappropriate. (5)\n(i) A temporary major capital improvement\nincrease is fixed to the unit and such increase shall be collectible\nprospectively on the first day of the first month beginning sixty (60) days\nfrom the date of mailing notice of approval to the tenant.

(iv)\n\nThe collection of such temporary\nincreases shall not exceed two percent in any year from the effective date of\nthe order granting the increase over the rent set forth in the schedule of\ngross rents, with collectability of any dollar excess above said sum to be\nspread forward in similar increments and added to the rent as established or\nset in future years. In no event shall more than one two-percent increase in\nthe legal regulated rent pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision be\ncollected in the same year, provided, however, that upon a vacancy, the owner\nmay temporarily increase the rent to the full temporary major capital\nimprovement increase amount. (v) In\naddition, for any rent increases due to any major capital improvements approved\non or after June 16, 2012 and before June 16, 2019, an owner may not collect\nmore than two percent in any year from any tenant in occupancy on the date the\nmajor capital improvement was approved, provided the tenant has entered into a\nrenewal lease commencing on or after June 14, 2019, or is or was entitled to\nreceive a renewal lease on or after such date.

(vi)\n\nNo increase pursuant\nto paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be collectible from a tenant to whom\nthere has been issued a currently valid senior citizen or disability rent\nincrease exemption pursuant to local law or ordinance to the extent that such\nincrease may cause the legal regulated rent of the housing accommodation to\nexceed a specified portion, if any, pursuant to such local law or ordinance, of\nthe aggregate disposable income of all members of the household residing in the\nhousing accommodation. (6)\n\nThe determination of the appropriate\nadjustment of a legal regulated rent shall take into consideration all factors\nbearing on the equities involved, subject to the general limitation that the\nadjustment can be put into effect without dislocation and hardship inconsistent\nwith the purposes of the ETPA, and including as a factor a return of the\nactual, reasonable, and verifiable cost to the owner, limited to the reasonable\ncost schedule in paragraph (2) of this subdivision and exclusive of interest or\nother carrying charges, and the increase in the rental value of the housing\naccommodations. (7)\nDHCR may issue, upon an owner application, an advisory prior opinion pursuant to section\n2507.11\nof this Title, as to\nwhether the proposed work qualifies for an increase in the legal regulated\nrent. (8)\n\nNo increase pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision shall be granted by the DHCR, unless an\napplication is filed no later than two years after the completion of the\ninstallation or improvement unless the applicant can demonstrate that the\napplication could not be made within two years due to delay, beyond the\napplicant's control, in obtaining required governmental approvals for which the\napplicant has applied within such two-year period. (9)\n\nAn increase for an improvement made\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall not be granted by the DHCR\nto the extent that, after a plan for the conversion of a building to\ncooperative or condominium ownership is declared effective, such improvement is\npaid for out of the cash reserve fund of the cooperative corporation or\ncondominium association. However, where prior to the issuance of an order\ngranting the increase, the funds taken from the reserve fund are returned to it\nby the sponsor or holder of unsold shares or units or through a special\nassessment of all shareholders or unit owners, the increase may be based upon\nthe actual, reasonable and verifiable cost of the improvement. Nothing in this\nparagraph shall prevent an owner from applying for, and the DHCR from granting, an increase for such improvement to the extent that the cost thereof is\notherwise paid for by an owner. (10)\n\nAny temporary major capital improvement\nincrease granted pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be reduced\nby an amount equal to (i) any governmental grant received by the landlord, where such grant compensates the landlord for any improvements required by a\ncity, state or federal government, an agency or any granting governmental\nentity to be expended for improvements and (ii) any insurance payment received\nby the landlord where such insurance payment compensates the landlord for any\npart of the costs of the improvements. Low interest loans or repayable\nsubsidies shall not be considered grants for the purposes of this\nparagraph. (11)\n\nRent adjustments\npursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision and subdivisions (e) and (f) of\nthis section shall be allocated as follows: The DHCR shall determine the dollar\namount of the monthly rent adjustment. Such dollar amount shall be divided by\nthe total number of rooms in the building. The amount so derived shall then be\nadded to the rent chargeable to each housing accommodation in accordance with\nthe number of rooms contained in such housing accommodation. (12)\n\nWhen determining the adjustment of legal\nregulated rents pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, where the\nsubject building contains commercial rental space in addition to residential\nrental space, and the DHCR determines that such commercial space benefits from\nthe improvement, DHCR shall allocate the approved costs between the commercial\nrental space and the residential rental space based upon the relative square\nfeet of each rental area. (13)\n\nThe\nDHCR shall not grant an owner's application for a rental adjustment pursuant to\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, in whole or in part, if after review by\nDHCR, it is determined that the owner is not maintaining all required building\nwide services, or that there are outstanding hazardous, immediately hazardous, or other similar violations of any municipal, county, State or Federal law. Certain tenant caused violations may be excepted. A tenant's repeated failure\nto provide access to remediate a violation may result in the violation being\nconsidered to be tenant caused. (i) An owner\napplication, pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subdivision, may be rejected if\nit is determined that there are one or more unresolved applicable violations. A\nrejected application may be refiled within sixty (60) days which shall stay the\ntwo-year filing requirement provided in paragraph (8) of this subdivision and\npreserve the original filing date. In the absence of good cause shown, a\nrejected application that is refiled outside of the sixty (60) day period will\nnot retain the original filing date. (ii)\nA timely refiled application pursuant to\nsubparagraph 13(i) of this subdivision, that has not addressed the outstanding\nviolations placed against the building or has had new violations placed against\nthe building in the interim period since rejection, will again be denied\nwithout leave to refile within sixty (60) days. (iii)\n\nPrior to the issuance of a\ndetermination, the DHCR shall review and determine if one or more violations\nhave been issued and not corrected to the subject building during the\nprocessing of an owner application pursuant to paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. The owner will be allowed sixty (60) days to correct such\nviolation(s). In the absence of good cause shown, failure to correct\nthe violation(s) within the allotted time shall result in a denial of the\napplication. (iv)\nDHCR shall\nretain the ability and right where appropriate to review all penalties and\nviolations at any other time during the pendency of such\napplication. (14)\n\nWhere\nan application for a temporary major capital improvement rent increase has been\nfiled, a tenant shall have sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of a notice\nof a proceeding in which to answer or reply. The DHCR shall provide any\nresponding tenant with the reasons for the DHCR's approval or denial of such\napplication. (15)\n\nWhere during the\nprocessing of a rent increase application filed pursuant to paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, tenants interpose answers complaining of defective operation\nof the major capital improvement, the complaint may be resolved in the\nfollowing manner: (i) Where municipal\nsign-offs (other than building permits) are required for the approval of the\ninstallation, and the tenants' complaints relate to the subject matter of the\nsign-off, the complaints may be resolved on the basis of the sign-off, and the\ntenants referred to the approving governmental agency for whatever action such\nagency may deem appropriate. (ii)\n\nWhere municipal sign-offs are not required, or where the alleged defective\noperation of the major capital improvement does not relate to the subject\nmatter of the sign-off, the complaint may be resolved by the affidavit of an\nindependent licensed architect or engineer that the condition complained of was\ninvestigated and found not to have existed, or if found to have existed, was\ncorrected. Such affidavit, which shall be served by the DHCR on the tenants, will raise a rebuttable presumption that the major capital improvement is\nproperly operative. Tenants may only rebut this presumption based on persuasive\nevidence, for example, a counter affidavit by an independent licensed architect\nor engineer, or an affirmation by 51 percent of the complaining tenants. (a) General requirements. There must be no\ncommon ownership, or other financial interest, between such architect or\nengineer and the owner or tenants. The affidavit shall state that there is no\nsuch relationship or other financial interest. The affidavit must also contain\na statement that the architect or engineer did not engage in the performance of\nany work, other than the investigation, relating to the conditions that are the\nsubject of the affidavit. The affidavit submitted must contain the signature\nand professional stamp of the architect or engineer. DHCR may conduct follow-up\ninspections randomly to ensure that the affidavits accurately indicate the\ncondition of the premises. Any person or party who submits a false statement\nshall be subject to all penalties provided by law. (iii)\n\nAt the discretion of the DHCR, the DHCR\nmay inspect the major capital improvement to determine whether the installation\nwas conducted in a workman like manner or the work was sufficiently\ncomprehensive so as to benefit all tenants. (16)\n\nThe DHCR shall annually inspect and\naudit no less than twenty-five percent of applications for a temporary major\ncapital improvement increase that have been submitted and approved. Such\nprocess shall include individual inspections and document review to ensure that\nowners complied with all obligations and responsibilities under the law for\ntemporary major capital improvement increases. Inspections shall include\nin-person confirmation that such improvements have been completed in such way\nas described in the application. (c) Individual Apartment Improvements\n(1)\n\nIncrease in space and services, new\nequipment, new furniture or furnishings; and other adjustments. (2)\n\nAn owner is entitled to a rent increase\nwhere there has been a reasonable and verifiable modification, other than an\nincrease for which an adjustment may be claimed pursuant to subdivision (b) of\nthis section, of dwelling space, or installation of new equipment or\nimprovements, or new furniture or furnishings, provided in or to the tenant's\nhousing accommodation, where the tenant has agreed to such modification or\nincrease and the owner has obtained written informed consent to such rent\nincrease. In the case of vacant housing accommodations, tenant consent shall\nnot be required. (i) For all work that\ncommenced on or after June 14, 2019, notification of all modifications must be\nsubmitted to the division for verification. As part of such verification, an\nowner shall: (a) Provide a copy of the\nwritten informed tenant consent on an approved division form, when tenant\nconsent is required. (b) Provide\nthe division with an itemized list of work performed, including a description\nand/or explanation of the reason or purpose for such work. (c) Provide the division with photographs of\nthe subject apartment where the work is to be completed, taken prior to such\nmodification or increase as well as photographs taken after, and showing that\nthe work has been completed. Such photographs must be kept as part of the\nowner's permanent records such that the owner must at any future time produce\nsuch photographs upon request by an agency with appropriate\njurisdiction. (d) Use a licensed\ncontractor to complete such work, where using a licensed contractor is required\nby an appropriate New York State or local government agency or rule. The costs\nfor an individual apartment improvement paid to a person or organization\nconducted to do the improvement or installation work sharing a common ownership\nwith the owner or managing agent of the subject building or apartment will be\ndisallowed. (e) Resolve, within the\ndwelling space, all outstanding hazardous and immediately hazardous violations. In no event shall an owner be permitted to begin collection of any rent\nincrease pursuant to this subdivision while there are any hazardous or\nimmediately hazardous violations of the Uniform Fire Prevention and Building\n\nCode (Uniform Code), local Fire Code, or local Building and Housing Maintenance\n\nCodes, pending against the affected housing accommodation. (ii)\n\nFor work commenced on or after June 14, 2019, the recoverable costs incurred by the owner pursuant to this subdivision\nshall be limited to a total aggregate cost of fifteen thousand dollars\n($15,000) that may be expended on no more than three (3) separate individual\napartment improvements in any fifteen (15) year period. (iii)\n\nAn owner who is entitled to a rent\nincrease pursuant to this subdivision shall not been titled to a further rent\nincrease based upon the installation of similar equipment, or new furniture or\nfurnishings within the useful life of such new equipment, or new furniture or\nfurnishings. (iv)\n\nAny increases to\nthe legal regulated rent pursuant to this subdivision shall be temporary and\nshall be removed from the legal regulated rent thirty (30) years from the date\nthe increase became effective inclusive of any increases granted by the\napplicable Rent Guidelines Board that had been calculated based upon such rent\nincrease. (v) For individual\napartment improvements pursuant to this subdivision, the division shall\nmaintain an itemized list of work performed and a description or explanation of\nthe reason or purpose of such work, inclusive of photographic evidence\ndocumenting the condition prior to and after the completion of the performed\nwork. Such documentation and any other supporting documentation shall be\nsubmitted to the division by the owner within 90 days of the completion of the\nwork, retained in a centralized electronic retention system and made available\nin cases pertaining to the adjustment of legal regulated rents. (vi)\n\nWhere an owner seeks a temporary\nindividual apartment improvement rent increase pursuant to this subdivision\nwhile the unit is occupied, the division shall provide a form for use by the\nowner, to obtain written informed consent from the tenant that shall include\nthe estimated total cost of the improvement and the estimated monthly rent\nincrease. Such form shall be completed and submitted to the division by the\nowner within 90 days of the completion of the work and preserved in a\ncentralized electronic retention system. Nothing herein shall relieve an owner, lessor, or agent thereof of his or her duty to retain proper documentation of\nall improvements performed or any rent increases resulting from said\nimprovements. (vii)\n\nFor rent\nincreases pursuant to this subdivision that took effect prior to June 14, 2019, the increase in the monthly legal regulated rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be\n1\n/ 40th of the total cost, including\ninstallation but excluding finance charges; and for buildings and complexes\ncontaining more than 35 housing accommodations be\n1\n/ 60th of the total cost, including\ninstallation but excluding finance charges. (viii)\n\nFor temporary rent increases pursuant\nto this subdivision effective as of or after June 14, 2019, the temporary\nincrease in the monthly legal regulated rent for the affected housing\naccommodations when authorized pursuant to this paragraph shall for buildings\nand complexes containing 35 or fewer housing accommodations be\n1\n/168th of the total cost, including\nthe cost of installation but excluding finance charges; and for buildings and\ncomplexes containing more than 35 housing accommodations be\n1\n/180th of the total cost, including\nthe cost of installation but excluding finance\ncharges. (d) An\nowner may file an application to decrease essential services for a reduction of\nthe legal regulated rent, or to modify or substitute essential services at no\nchange in the legal regulated rent, on forms prescribed by the division on the\ngrounds that: (1)\nthe owner and tenant by\nmutual voluntary written agreement, consent to a decrease indwelling space, or\na decrease in the services, furniture, furnishings or equipment, or to a\nmodification or substitution of the essential services provided in the housing\naccommodation; or\n(2)\nsuch\ndecrease, modification or substitution is required for the operation of the\nbuilding in accordance with specific requirements of law; or\n(3)\nsuch decrease, modification or\nsubstitution results from an approved conversion from master metering of\nelectricity, with the cost of electricity included in the rent, to individual\nmetering of electricity, with the tenant paying separately for electricity, and\nis in amounts set forth in a Schedule of Rent Reductions for different-sized\nrent stabilized housing accommodations included in Operational Bulletin 2014-1\ngoverning electrical conversions issued pursuant to this paragraph and section\n2507.11\nof this Title by DHCR, 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, Queens, New York, and available at DHCR's\nwebsite at\nwww.hcr.ny.gov\nand determined as\nfollows: (i) Direct Metering. Where the\nconversion is to direct metering of electricity, with the tenant purchasing\nelectricity directly from a utility, such Schedule of Rent Reductions is based\non the median monthly cost of electricity to tenants derived from data from the\n\nUnited States Census Bureau's \"New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as\ntabulated by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite\n2210., New York, New York, and available on its website at\nrentguidelinesboard.cityofnewyork.us,and as further adjusted where appropriate\nto reflect differences in electric rates outside New York City. The charge for\nelectricity is not part of the legal regulated rent and is not subject to this\n\nSubchapter. The resolution of any dispute arising from the billing or\ncollection of such charge is not within the jurisdiction of the Division. A\nconversion to direct metering is required to include rewiring the building\nunless the owner can establish that rewiring is unnecessary. (ii)\n\nSubmetering: Where the conversion is to\nsubmetering of electricity, with the tenant purchasing electricity from the\nowner or a contractor retained by the owner, who purchases electricity from a\nutility at the bulk rate, such Schedule of Rent Reductions is based on the\nmedian monthly cost of electricity to tenants derived from data from the United\n\nStates Census Bureau's \"New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey,\" as tabulated\nby the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, 1 Centre Street, Suite 2210, Suite\n202, New York, New York, and available on its website at\nrentguidelinesboard.cityofNew York.us, adjusted to reflect the bulk rate for\nelectricity plus a reasonable service fee for the cost of meter reading and\nbilling, based on the maximum estimated fee included in the \"Residential\n\nElectric Submetering Manual\" revised October 2001, published by the New York\n\nState Energy Research and Development Authority, 17 Columbia Circle, Albany, New York, and available on its website at\nwww.nyserda.org, and further adjusted where\nappropriate to reflect differences in electric rates outside New York City, and\nreflected in Operational Bulletin 2014-1. The owner or contractor retained by\nthe owner is not permitted to charge the tenant more than the bulk rate for\nelectricity plus a reasonable service charge for the cost of meter reading and\nbilling. The charge for electricity as well as any related service surcharge is\nnot part of the legal regulated rent and is not subject to this Subchapter. The\nresolution of any dispute arising from the billing or collection of such charge\nor surcharge is not within the jurisdiction of the Division. A conversion to\nsubmetering does not require rewiring the building provided the owner submits\nan affidavit sworn to by a licensed electrician that the existing wiring is\nsafe and of sufficient capacity for the building. (iii)\n\nRecipients of Senior Citizen Rent\n\nIncrease Exemptions (SCRIE) or Disability Rent Increase Exemptions (DRIE): For\na tenant who on the date of the conversion is receiving a SCRIE or DRIE\nauthorized by local law, the rent is not reduced and the cost of electricity\nremains included in the rent, although the owner is permitted to install any\nequipment in such tenant's housing accommodation as is required for\neffectuation of electrical conversion pursuant to this paragraph. (a) After the conversion, upon the vacancy of\nthe tenant, the owner, without making application to the division, is required\nto reduce the legal regulated rent for the housing accommodation in accordance\nwith the Schedule of Rent Reductions set forth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and thereafter any subsequent tenant is responsible for the cost of their\nconsumption of electricity, and for the legal rent as reduced, including any\napplicable major capital improvement rent increase based upon the cost of work\ndone to effectuate the electrical conversion. (b) After the conversion, if a tenant ceases\nto receive a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without making application to the\ndivision, may reduce the rent in accordance with the Schedule of Rent\n\nReductions set forth in Operational Bulletin 2014-1, and thereafter the tenant\nis responsible for the cost of their electricity, and for the legal rent as\nreduced, including any applicable major capital improvement rent increase based\nupon the cost of work done to effectuate the electrical conversion, for as long\nas the tenant is not receiving a SCRIE or DRIE. Thereafter, in the event that\nthe tenant resumes receiving a SCRIE or DRIE, the owner, without making\napplication to the division, is required to eliminate the rent reduction and\nresume responsibility for the tenant's electric bills. (iv)\n\nEvery three years, upon the publication\nof a new New York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and tabulation of the survey\ndata by the New York City Rent Guidelines Board, DHCR shall issue a new\n\nOperational Bulletin governing electrical conversions setting forth rent\nreductions based on the new survey data, and shall move to amend the\nregulations to incorporate by reference the new Operational Bulletin, the new\n\nNew York City Housing and Vacancy Survey, and Rent Guidelines Board tabulation. At such time as NYSERDA issues a new Residential Electric Submetering Manual\nsetting forth a new maximum estimated submetering service fee, DHCR shall move\nto amend the regulations to incorporate that document by\nreference. (4)\nsuch\ndecrease, modification or substitution is not inconsistent with the act or this\n\nSubchapter. No such reduction in rent or decrease in services, or modification\nor substitution of essential services shall take place prior to the approval of\nthe owner's application by the division, except that a service decrease, modification, or substitution pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision may take place prior to such approval. (e) Comparative hardship. The division may\ngrant an appropriate adjustment of the legal regulated rent where the landlord, by application for increases in rents in excess of the rent adjustment\nauthorized by the Rent Guidelines Board under the act and as provided for in\nsection\n2502.5\nof this Part, establishes a\nhardship, and the division finds that the rate of such rent adjustment is not\nsufficient to enable the owner to maintain approximately the same ratio between\noperating expenses (including taxes and labor costs, but excluding debt\nservice, financing costs and management fees) and gross rents which prevailed\non the average over the immediate preceding five-year period, or for the entire\nlife of the building if less than five years. No application may be made under\nthis subdivision for an increase if a six-percent rent increase is still in\neffect based on an application pursuant to this subdivision or pursuant to\nsubdivision (f) of this section. (f) Alternative hardship. As an alternative\nto the hardship application provided under subdivision (e) this section, owners\nof buildings acquired by the same owner or a related entity owned by the same\nprincipals three years prior to the date of application may apply to the\ndivision, on forms prescribed by the division, for increases in excess of the\nlevel of applicable guideline increases established under the act, based on a\nfinding by the division that such guideline increases are not sufficient to\nenable the owner to maintain an annual gross rent income collectible for such\nbuilding which exceeds the annual operating expenses of such building by a sum\nequal to at least five percent of such annual gross rent income collectible, subject to the definitions and restrictions provided for herein. (1)\n\nDefinitions. For this subdivision, the\nfollowing terms shall mean: (i) Annual gross\nrent income collectible shall be the actual income receivable per annum arising\nout of the operation and ownership of the property, including but not limited\nto rental from housing accommodations, stores, professional or business use, garages, parking spaces, and income from easements or air rights, washing\nmachines, vending machines and signs, plus the rent calculated under\nsubparagraph (2)(iii) of this subdivision. In ascertaining income receivable, the division shall determine what efforts, if any, the owner has followed in\ncollecting unpaid rent. (ii)\n\nOperating expenses shall consist of the actual, reasonable costs of fuel, labor, utilities, taxes (other than income or corporate franchise taxes), fees\n(including attorney's fees for services rendered during the test year not\nrelated to refinancing of mortgage), permits, necessary contracted services and\nrepairs for which an owner is not eligible for an increase pursuant to this\nsection, insurance, parts and supplies, reasonable management fees, mortgage\ninterest, and other reasonable and necessary administrative costs applicable to\nthe operation and maintenance of the property. (iii)\n\nMortgage interest shall be deemed to\nmean interest on that portion of the principal of an institutional or_a bona\nfide mortgage, including an allocable portion of the charges related thereto. Criteria to be considered in determining a bona fide mortgage other than an\ninstitutional mortgage shall include, but not be limited to, the following: the\ncondition of the property, the location of the property, the existing mortgage\nmarket at the time the mortgage is placed, the principal amount of the\nmortgage, the term of the mortgage, the amortization rate, security and other\nterms and conditions of the mortgage. (iv)\n\nInstitutional mortgage shall include a\nmortgage given to any insurance company, licensed by the State of New York or\nauthorized to do business in the State of New York, or any commercial bank, trust company, bank and trust company, savings bank or savings and loan\nassociation (which must be licensed under the laws of any jurisdiction within\nthe United States and authorized to do business in the State of New York), pension funds, credit unions, insurance companies and governmental entities. The division may determine that any other mortgage is an institutional mortgage\nin its discretion. (v) Owner's\nequity shall mean the sum of: (a) the purchase\nprice of the property, less the principal of any mortgage or loan used to\nfinance the purchase of the property; (b) the cost of any capital improvement for\nwhich the owner has not collected an increase in rent, less the principal of\nany mortgage or loan used to finance said improvement; (c) any repayment of the principal of any\nmortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of the property, or any capital\nimprovement for which the owner has not collected an increase in rent; and\n(d) any increase in the\nequalized assessed value of the property which occurred subsequent to the first\nvaluation of the property after purchase by the owner. (vi)\n\nThreshold income shall mean that income\nfor such building which exceeds the annual operating expense for such building\nby a sum equal to five percent of such threshold income. (vii)\n\nTest year shall mean any one of the\nfollowing: (a) the most recent calendar year\n(January 1st to December 31st); (b) the most recent fiscal year (one year ending on the last day of a month other\nthan December 31st), provided that books of account are maintained and closed\naccordingly; or\n(c) any 12\nconsecutive months ending within 90 days prior to the date of filing of the\nhardship application. Such period must end on the last day of a month. Nothing\nherein shall prevent the division from comparing and adjusting expenses and\nincome during the test year with expenses and income occurring during the three\nyears prior to the date of application, in order to determine the\nreasonableness of such expenses and income. (2)\n\nRestrictions. (i) No owner may file an application, nor may\nthe division grant such owner an increase in excess of the level of applicable\nguideline increases, unless: (a) the annual\ngross rent income collectible for the test year does not exceed the annual\noperating expenses of such building by a sum equal to at least five percent of\nsuch annual gross rental income collectible; and\n(b) the owner or an entity related to the\nowner acquired the building at least 36 months prior to the date of\napplication; and\n(c) the owner's\nequity in the building exceeds five percent of the sum of: (1)\nthe arm's length purchase price of the\nproperty; and\n(2)\nthe cost of any\ncapital improvements for which the owner has not collected an increase in rent\npursuant to subdivision (a), (b) & (c) of this section; and\n(3)\nany repayment of principal of any\nmortgage or loan used to finance the purchase of the property or any capital\nimprovements for which the owner has not collected an increase in rent pursuant\nto subdivision (a), (b) & (c) of this section; and\n(4)\nany increase in the equalized assessed\nvalue of the property which occurred subsequent to the first valuation of the\nproperty after purchase by the owner; and\n(d) the building was last granted a hardship\nincrease more than 36 months prior to the date of application, provided that no\napplication may be made for any hardship if a six-percent increase is still in\neffect based on a prior application; and\n(e) the owner has resolved all legal\nobjections to any real estate taxes and water and sewer charges for the test\nyear. (ii)\n\nThe division\nmay, in its discretion, deny an owner an increase as provided, in whole or in\npart, if the owner is not maintaining all essential services as required bylaw, or there are violations of record of any municipal, county, State or Federal\nlaw to his knowledge which relates to the maintenance of such services. Any\nincrease granted herein may be conditioned or revoked upon the owner's failure\nto continue to maintain such services during the period for which the increase\nis granted, provided that where the division determines that insufficient\nincome is the cause of such failure to maintain essential services, hardship\nincreases may be granted conditionally, provided that such services will be\nrestored within a reasonable time as determined by the division. (iii)\n\nThe maximum amount of hardship increase\nto which an owner shall be entitled shall be the difference between the\nthreshold income and the annual gross rent income collectible for the test\nyear. In buildings that also contain apartments subject to the Emergency\n\nHousing Rent Control Law, appropriate adjustments for both income and expenses\nwill be made by the division in order to calculate the pro rata rate share for\nthose apartments subject to this application. However, notwithstanding the\nabove, the collection of any increase in the rent for any housing accommodation\npursuant to this section shall not exceed six percent of the legal regulated\nrent in effect at the time immediately prior to the issuance of the order. The\ncollectability of any amount above said sum shall be spread forward in similar\nincrements and added to the rent as established or set in future years. No\napplication may be made for any hardship if a six-percent increase is still in\neffect based on a prior application. (iv)\n\nThe division shall set a rental value\nfor any unit occupied by the owner or managing agent, or a person related to\nthe owner or managing agent, or an employee of the owner or managing agent, or\nunoccupied at the owner's choice for more than one month at the last regulated\nrent plus the minimum number of guideline increases; or, if no such regulated\nrent existed or is known, the division shall impute a rent equal to the average\nof rents for similar or comparable apartments subject to these regulations in\nthe building during the test year. (v) Each owner who files an application for a\nhardship rent increase shall be required to maintain all records as submitted\nwith the subject application, and further be required to retain same for a\nperiod of three years after the effective date of the order. (vi)\n\nEach application under this section\nshall be certified by the owner or his duly authorized agent as to its accuracy\nand compliance with this section, under the penalty of\nperjury.
