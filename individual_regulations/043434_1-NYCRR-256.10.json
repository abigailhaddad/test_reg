  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 256.10 - Visual aids for the inspection of food containers\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following photographs illustrate major defects of\ndamaged containers which shall not be offered for sale or donated, and minor\ndefects of less damaged containers which may be offered for sale or donated. These photographs are demonstrative and illustrative only. Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to an extent that it is likely to affect the safety\nand viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to an extent that it is likely to affect the safety\nand viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to an extent that it is likely to affect the safety\nand viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to an extent that it is likely to affect the safety\nand viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which a dent affects\nthe end seam, but has not forced it of position to the extent that it affects\nthe safety and viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits moderate, acute crimping of the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits a moderate\ndent which has created a slight end seam malposition (see section\n256.8\n[b][5]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to an extent that it is likely to affect the safety\nand viability of the container (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits a moderate\ndent in the end seam (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which the end seam has\nbeen forced out of position to such an extent that the safety and viability of\nthe container is affected (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits a moderate\ndent in the end seam (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting deep, sharp, angular dents and acute crimping of the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting deep, sharp, angular dents and acute crimping of the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). In addition, the end seam has been pulled out of position (see\nsection\n256.8\n[b][5]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting deep, sharp, angular dents and acute crimping of the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). In addition, the end seam has been pulled out of position (see\nsection\n256.8\n[b][5]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting deep, sharp, angular dents and acute crimping of the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). In addition, the end seam has been pulled out of position (see\nsection\n256.8\n[b][5]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits moderate\ndents and moderate acute crimping in the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][5]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits sharp, angular dents (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits moderate\ndents which have not crimped the body wall (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits sharp, angular dents (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that has a bulged end\n(see section\n256.8\n[b] [1]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that has a bulged end\n(see section\n256.8\n[b] [1]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container that exhibits a moderate\nindentation (see section\n256.8\n[b][6]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container in which buckles extend\ninto the end seam distorting the countersink. The end seam may have been placed\nunder tension sufficient to jeopardize the hermetic seal (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container with a buckle that does\nnot involve the end seam (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container with buckles which extend\ninto the end seam materially affecting the safety and viability of the\ncontainer (see section\n256.8\n[b][7]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container with a cable cut (white\narrow) which is deep enough to expose the seam laminations.

Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting a false seam\n(see section\n256.8\n[b] [8]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a container exhibiting slight rust\nwhich is easily removable by cleaning or moderate buffing (see section\n256.8\n[b][4]\nof\nthis Part). Image\n\nThis is an example of a badly rusted and severely pitted\ncontainer that cannot be properly cleaned and reconditioned by moderate buffing\nby means other than steel wire brushes (see section\n256.8\n[b][4]\nof\nthis Part).

Image\n\nThese are examples of unlabeled containers (see section\n256.8\n[b][10]\nof\nthis Part).

Image\n\nThis is an example of a pull top container which contains\nobvious fractures of the lip scorelines (see section\n256.8\n[b][3]\nof\nthis Part). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n256.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
