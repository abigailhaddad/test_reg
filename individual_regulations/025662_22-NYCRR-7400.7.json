If the extension is granted, the\ndecision shall include the date certain on or before which the candidate's\nfinancial disclosure statement must be filed. (5)\n\nVacation periods, and the ordinary and\nnecessary tasks, routines, and obligations of a candidate's personal and work\nlife shall not constitute undue hardship or justifiable cause for an extension\nof time to file a financial disclosure statement. (6)\n\nNo extension of time to file a financial\ndisclosure statement shall be granted to a candidate beyond 35 days after he or\nshe becomes a candidate. (e) Procedure regarding deletion\nrequests. (1)\nA candidate may request\ndeletion of one or more items of information from the copy of the financial\ndisclosure statement made available to the public by filing a written request\nwith the commission on or before the date that his or her financial disclosure\nstatement is due. (2)\n\nThe request\nfor the deletion shall include: (i) the name, home address, work address, and work telephone number of the candidate\nrequesting the deletion; (ii)\nthe\ninformation which the candidate seeks to have deleted; (iii)\na statement in support of the\ncandidate's claim that the information that would otherwise be made available\nfor public inspection will have no material bearing on the discharge of the\ncandidate's official duties, if he or she is elected, giving specific reasons\nand justifications therefor.

(2)\n\nIf the commission\ndetermines that additional information would be useful, it may request such\ninformation from the candidate requesting the deletion. The commission, in its\ndiscretion, may request a meeting with the candidate to discuss the deletion\nrequest. (3)\n\nUnless the commission\ndecides by a majority of the total members of the commission without vacancy\nthat the information that would otherwise be required to be made available for\npublic inspection will have no material bearing on the discharge of the\ncandidate's official duties, if he or she is elected, the commission shall deny\nthe request for deletion. In applying the material bearing standard to decide\ndeletion requests, the commission weighs competing public and private interests\nincluding the following: (i) whether the\ndisclosure of the information could pose a safety threat to the candidate or\nhis or her family, and the nature of that threat, including its seriousness and\nimminence; (ii)\nwhether the\ninformation may relate in a substantial and important way to the candidate's\nofficial duties, if he or she is elected; (iii)\nwhether the information could reveal or\nrelate to an actual or potential conflict of interest; (iv)\nsuch other factors as may be relevant. Judiciary Law, section 211(4) and Part 40 of this Title\nestablish a strong public policy favoring disclosure.

(2)\n\nAn inspector must file a written request\nfor public inspection. Public inspection copies of statements will be provided\nto the inspector in a timely manner determined by the needs of the inspector, the number of statements requested, and the workload of the ethics commission\nstaff at the time of the request. (3)\n\nThe financial disclosure statement of a\ncandidate who has filed a deletion request shall not be available for public\ninspection pending a decision on the request. The fact that a deletion request\nhas been made will be confidential; all documents pertaining to the request, including the decision, will also be confidential and not available for public\ninspection. (4)\n\nIf the commission\nhas denied a deletion request, the financial disclosure statement of the\ncandidate who made the request shall not be available for public inspection for\nthree days from the date on which notice of the denial is mailed to the\ncandidate by the commission.
