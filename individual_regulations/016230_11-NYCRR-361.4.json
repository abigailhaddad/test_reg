  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 361.4 - Pooling of the cost of treating specified medical conditions prior to January 1, 1999\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In each pool area, a specified medical condition pooling fund is established. Each pool operates independently; that is, all calculations and payments described below are made for each pool independently of any other pool. (b) Each carrier shall pay to the pooling fund each quarter, beginning with the second quarter of 1993, and ending December 31, 1998, an amount determined as the product of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subdivision: (1)\n\nAn amount determined by the superintendent each year by September 1st, with respect to payments required during the subsequent calendar year. For 1993, this amount will be $5. (2)\n\nThe number of family units with coverage of a single individual under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, as of the beginning of the quarter, plus twice the number of family units with dependents coverage by the carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, as of the beginning of the quarter. (3)\nA coverage factor, as follows: Type of Contract\n\nCoverage Factor\n\nBasic Hospital or Basic Hospital/Surgical\n0.75\n\nWraparound or Supplemental Major Medical\n0.25\n\nBasic and Supplemental Major Medical, Comprehensive Major Medical, HMO\n1.0\n(c) Each carrier may collect from the pooling fund in lump sum an amount listed in Table 1, subdivision (e) of this section, for claims incurred prior to January 1, 1997 and in lump sum an amount listed in Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section for claims incurred between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1997 (but in no event more than the carrier is required to pay for the care of the listed medical condition), by submitting a claim in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the claim was incurred except that the deadline for filing 1997 claims is extended from December 31, 1998 to July 31, 2000, upon certification to the superintendent by the carrier that: (1)\nan individual has been diagnosed as having one of the medical conditions listed in Table 1 or Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section as applicable, and the course of medical care identified in Table 1 or Table 3 has been recommended and completed; (2)\nthe identified individual is covered by the carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, for the identified medical care; and\n(3)\nno other carrier or other third-party payor has primary responsibility for the cost of that medical care. In the event that the individual changes carriers or is covered by more than one carrier under pooled insurance contracts or policies, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, during the course of the identified medical care, payment from the pooling fund of the amount listed in Table 1 or Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section, shall be pro-rated among the carriers based upon each carrier's proportionate share of the cost of the identified medical care. Insurers and HMOs may not base decisions as to whether a course of medical care is covered by an insurance or HMO policy or contract on the presence of that course of medical care in Table 1 or Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section, or the absence of that course of medical care from Table 1 or Table 3. Distributions from the pooling fund of the amounts listed in Table 1 or Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section, shall be made based upon the month in which the claim attributable to expenses was incurred by the carrier. Older claims, based on the date the medical service was provided, will be given priority for payment over more recent claims. (d) Each carrier may collect from the pooling fund each month an amount listed in Table 2, subdivision (e) of this section, for claims incurred prior to January 1, 1997 and each month an amount listed in Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section for claims incurred between January 1, 1997 and December 31, 1997, but in no event more than the carrier is required to pay for the care of the listed medical condition, by submitting a claim in the calendar year following the calendar year in which the claim was incurred except that the deadline for filing 1997 claims is extended from December 31, 1998 to July 31, 2000, upon certification to the superintendent by the carrier that: (1)\nan individual has been diagnosed as having one of the medical conditions listed in Table 2 or Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section as applicable; (2)\nthe identified individual is covered by the carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, with respect to medical care for the identified medical condition as of the end of each month for which reimbursement is sought; and\n(3)\nno other carrier or other third-party payor has primary responsibility for the cost of that medical care. In the event that the individual is covered by more than one carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, payments from the pooling fund of the amount listed in Table 2 or Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section, shall be pro-rated among the carriers based upon each carrier's proportionate share of the cost of medical care for the identified medical condition. Distributions from the pooling fund of the amounts listed in Table 2 or Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section, shall be made based upon the month in which the claim attributable to expenses was incurred by the carrier. Older claims, based on the date the medical service was provided, will be given priority for payment over more recent claims. (e) Tables.

No individual can be counted more than once. If an individual has multiple conditions, assign to such individual the condition with the largest dollar amount. This total shall be the carrier's own total maximum specified medical condition claims. (2)\n\nSeparately for each carrier, the total maximum specified medical condition claims from paragraph (1) of this subdivision shall be divided by that carrier's 1998 contributions to the specified medical condition pool (as required by subdivision [b] of this section) to obtain that carrier's specified medical condition index. (3)\n\nThe regional specified medical condition index for all carriers in a specific region shall be subparagraph (i) divided by subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph: (i) The sum for all carriers in the region of the total maximum specified medical condition claims as determined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe sum for all carriers in the region of the 1998 contributions to the specified medical condition pool in that region. (4)\n\nThe carriers participating in the regional specified medical condition pool shall only be entitled to collect from the pool if the carrier's own specified medical condition index, determined by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, is greater than the regional specified medical condition index, determined by paragraph (3) of this subdivision, for that pool as of the end of 1998. Individual specified medical condition claims will no longer be reimbursed by the pool in 1998. (5)\nA carrier entitled to collect from the 1998 specified medical condition pooling fund as determined by paragraph (4) of this subdivision may collect the product of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph: (i) That carrier's percentage of the specified medical condition funds, determined by dividing clause (\na\n) by clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph: (a) the amount by which the carrier's specified medical condition index is greater than the regional specified medical condition index weighted by the carrier's own 1998 specified medical condition contributions to the regional pool (determined by subtracting the regional specified medical condition index from the specified medical condition index for that carrier and then multiplying the result of the subtraction by the carrier's own 1998 specified medical condition contributions to the regional pool); (b) the sum of the amounts determined in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph for all carriers in the regional pool who are entitled to collect from the 1998 specified medical condition pooling fund. (ii)\n\nThe sum of the 1998 specified medical condition funds available for distribution in that region plus the amount of funds for 1998 representing the 55 percent reduction in demographic payments in that region to pools that deal with individual health insurance policies and small group health insurance policies, other than Medicare supplement insurance policies. (6)\nA carrier shall only be entitled to collect from the 1998 specified medical condition pooling fund an amount calculated pursuant to the method established in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision upon certification to the superintendent by the carrier by no later than July 31, 2000, that with respect to the claims reported to the administrator and used in paragraph (1) of this subdivision that: (i) regarding the medical conditions listed in Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section: (a) an individual has been diagnosed as having one of the medical conditions or criteria listed in Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section, and the course of medical care identified in Table 3 has been recommended and completed; (b) the identified individual is covered by the carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, for the identified medical care; and\n(c) no other carrier or other third-party payor has primary responsibility for the cost of that medical care; (ii)\nregarding the medical conditions listed in Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section: (a) an individual has been diagnosed as having one of the medical conditions listed in Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section; (b) the identified individual is covered by the carrier under a pooled insurance contract or policy, other than a Medicare supplement insurance policy, with respect to medical care for the identified medical condition as of the end of each month for which reimbursement is sought; and\n(c) no other carrier or other third-party payor has primary responsibility for the cost of that medical care. (g) A carrier must report the number of claims that have been incurred for 1998 separately for each category listed in Table 3, subdivision (e) of this section and Table 4, subdivision (e) of this section in a manner prescribed by the superintendent.
