  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.6 - Controlling interest\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1401\n(a) In the case of a corporation which has an\ninterest in real property, the transfer or acquisition of a controlling\ninterest in the corporation, as defined in section\n575.1\n(b) of this Part, occurs when a person, or group of persons acting in concert, transfers or acquires a total of 50 percent or more of the voting stock in such\ncorporation. In the case of a partnership, association, trust or other entity\nhaving an interest in real property, the transfer or acquisition occurs when a\nperson, or group of persons acting in concert, transfers or acquires a total of\n50 percent or more of the capital, profits or beneficial interest in such\nentity. (b) Acting in\nconcert. (1)\n\nPersons are acting in\nconcert when they have a relationship such that one person influences or\ncontrols the actions of another. For example, if a parent corporation and a\nwholly-owned subsidiary each sell or purchase a 25 percent interest in an\nentity, the two corporations will be considered to have acted in concert to\ntransfer or acquire a controlling interest (\ni.e., 50 percent)\nin the entity. (2)\n\nWhere the\nindividuals or entities are not commonly controlled or owned, persons will be\ntreated as acting in concert when the unity with which the sellers or\npurchasers have negotiated and will consummate the transfer of ownership\ninterests indicates they are acting as a single entity. If the transfers or\nacquisitions are completely independent, each grantor selling or grantee buying\nwithout regard to the identity of the other grantors or grantees, then the\ntransfers or acquisitions will be treated as separate transfers or\nacquisitions. The grantors or grantees may be required to provide a sworn\nstatement that their transfers or acquisitions are independent of each other. Factors that will indicate whether persons are acting in concert include the\nfollowing: (i) The transfers or acquisitions\nare closely related in time. (ii)\n\nThere are few grantors or grantees. (iii)\n\nThe contracts of sale contain mutual\nterms. (iv)\n\nThe grantors or\ngrantees have entered into an agreement in addition to the sales contract\nbinding themselves to a course of action with respect to the transfer or\nacquisition. Example 1: A owns 100 percent of X corporation, the only asset of\nwhich is real property. B, C, D and E as a group, negotiate to buy all of A's\ninterest with B, C, D and E each buying 25 percent of A's interest. The\ncontracts of B, C, D and E are identical and the purchases are to occur\nsimultaneously. B, C, D and E have also negotiated an agreement binding\nthemselves to a course of action with respect to the acquisition of X\ncorporation and the terms of a shareholders, agreement which would govern their\nrelationship as owners of X Corporation. The acquisitions by B, C, D and E\nwould be treated as a single acquisition which is subject to the real estate\ntransfer tax. Example 2: Partnership X, which owns real property, is composed of\npartners A and B, each having a 50 percent partnership interest. In November, 1989, A and B, decided to raise more capital by agreeing that they each will\nsell a percentage of their partnership interest. On November 20, 1989, A and B\neach sold a 121/2 percent partnership interest to C. On October 11, 1990, A and\nB each sold a 15 percent partnership interest to D. Since A and B have acted in\nconcert and transferred a 55 percent interest (121/2 + 121/2 + 15 + 15) within\na three year period (see subdivision (d) of this section for the three year\naggregation rule), the transfers are subject to the real estate transfer tax. A\nand B would each owe transfer tax on the respective transfers of their 121/2\npercent and 15 percent interests. Example 3: Corporation X has 2 stockholders. Individual A owns 90\nshares of stock (90 percent) and individual B owns 10 shares of stock (10\npercent). Corporation X owns 60 percent of the stock of corporation Y, which\nowns real property. Individual A, by virtue of owning 90 percent of the stock\nof corporation X, has a 54 percent interest in corporation Y (90 percent\ninterest in corporation X multiplied by the 60 percent interest corporation X\nhas in corporation Y equals the 54 percent interest individual A has in\ncorporation Y). Individual A sells his 90 shares of stock in corporation X to\nindividual G. Individual A, by selling his 90 shares of corporation X stock, has transferred a controlling interest (54 percent) in an entity that owns real\nproperty (corporation Y) which transfer is subject to the real estate transfer\ntax. The consideration used to determine the transfer tax due would be equal to\n54 percent of fair market value of the real property owned by corporation\nY. Example 4: Assume the same facts as in example 3 except that\ncorporation X owns 50 percent of the stock of corporation Y. Since A has not\ntransferred nor has G acquired a controlling interest in corporation Y (90\npercent × 50 percent = 45 percent), the tax would not apply. If, however, corporation X had transferred its 50 percent interest in corporation Y, the\ntransfer would be subject to tax. Example 5: Corporation X is a publicly held corporation, the stock of\nwhich is owned by many unrelated shareholders. X owns an interest in real\nproperty. D, E, F and G pursuant to a plan to gain control of X, make a tender\noffer of $100 per share to the public shareholders to acquire such control. As\na result of the tender offer, D, E, F and G acquire, in total, 80 percent of\nthe stock of X with each getting 20 percent. D, E, F, and G would be treated as\nacting in concert to acquire a controlling interest, and the tax would apply to\nthis transaction as an acquisition of a controlling interest. (c) For purposes of\ndetermining whether a controlling interest is transferred or acquired, only\ntransfers or acquisitions of interests occurring on or after July 1, 1989 are\nadded together. A transfer or acquisition made on or after July 1, 1989 does\nnot have to be included, for purposes of determining whether a controlling\ninterest is transferred or acquired, if the transfer or acquisition is made\npursuant to a binding written contract which was entered into on or before\n\nFebruary 16, 1989, the date of which is confirmed by independent evidence such\nas the recording of a contract, payment of a deposit or other facts and\ncircumstances as determined by the commissioner. (See section\n575.5\nof this Part.)\n(d) Where there is a\ntransfer or acquisition of an interest in an entity that has an interest in\nreal property, on or after July 1, 1989, and subsequently there is a transfer\nor acquisition of an additional interest or interests in the same entity, the\ntransfers or acquisitions will be added together to determine if a transfer or\nacquisition of a controlling interest has occurred. Where there is a transfer\nor acquisition of a controlling interest in an entity on or after July 1, 1989, and the real estate transfer tax is paid on that transfer or acquisition and\nthere is a subsequent transfer or acquisition of an additional interest in the\nsame entity, it is considered that a second transfer or acquisition of a\ncontrolling interest has occurred which is subject to the real estate transfer\ntax. No transfer or acquisition of an interest in an entity that has an\ninterest in real property will be added to another transfer or acquisition of a\ninterest in the same entity if they occur more than three years apart, unless\nthe transfers or acquisitions were so timed as part of a plan to avoid the real\nestate transfer tax. An example of this would be if a shareholder acquired 40\npercent of the stock in a corporation and simultaneously contracted for the\npurchase of 20 percent in three years and one day. (e) The tax is only imposed once when there\nis both a transfer and an acquisition of a controlling interest in the same\nconveyance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
