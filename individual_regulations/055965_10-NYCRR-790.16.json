  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 790.16 - Determinations of public need for hospice\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The following methodology will be\nutilized in the evaluation of applications involving the establishment and/or\nconstruction of a hospice and the need for hospice care and services. It is\nintended that this methodology, when used in conjunction with the planning\nstandards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Title, which are\nalso applicable to the determination of need for hospice and which are\nincorporated herein, represent a statement of basic principles and\nplanning/decisionmaking tools for guiding and directing the development and\nexpansion of hospice care and services throughout the State. The methodology is\nconceptually based on the application of uniform planning objectives at the\nhealth systems agency and/or State level. Its purpose is to provide guidance, to permit flexibility and to assist the health systems agencies, the State\n\nHospital Review and Planning Council, the Public Health Council, the\ncommissioner and potential applicants in determining the future need for\nhospice care and services. The objective of the methodology is to ensure that\nan adequate supply of hospice care and services is available and accessible, while at the same time avoiding the proliferation of unneeded hospices and\nhospice services. (b) The\ncommissioner shall designate hospice planning areas within each health systems\nagency region among which the need estimates calculated pursuant to this\nsection will be allocated. Such areas may include a single county or two or\nmore contiguous counties. In developing hospice planning areas, the\ncommissioner shall seek the advice and recommendations of the health systems\nagencies and the State Hospital Review and Planning Council. Factors which\nshall be considered by each health systems agency and the council in making\nrecommendations and by the commissioner in designating hospice planning areas\nshall include, but need not be limited to, the following: (1)\nprovider and patient travel patterns, including driving time and availability of public transportation; (2)\nthe availability of existing hospice care\nand services; and\n(3)\nother factors\nidentified by the health systems agencies. (c) The factors and methodology to be\nutilized by the Public Health Council and/or the commissioner as appropriate, in estimating the public need for hospice, shall include, but need not be\nlimited to, the following: (1)\n\nAn estimate\nshall be made of the number of cancer and noncancer terminally ill patients who\nwould seek and be appropriate for hospice care in each planning area. Estimates\nwill be based on the most current cancer mortality data compiled by the\ndepartment's Bureau of Vital Statistics. (2)\n\nThe department shall estimate the number\nof cancer patients appropriate for hospice, based on the number of annual\ncancer deaths and the projection that 40 percent of such patients would seek\nand be appropriate for hospice. (3)\nA number equal to 10 percent of the number of cancer patients determined\nappropriate for hospice care in paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall be\nadded to such number of cancer patients to determine the total number of\npatients appropriate for hospice for each planning area. This total number will\nthen be projected five years into the future based on the most current New York\n\nState Department of Commerce population projections to estimate the number of\nindividuals who would seek and be appropriate for hospice. For purposes of this\nmethodology, it is assumed that cancer deaths per year per 1,000 population\nwill remain constant for the period of the projection. This number will\nrepresent the number of projected hospice cases. A hospice case is defined as\nan individual admitted to a hospice. (4)\n\nThe total number of projected hospice\ncases shall be multiplied by 63 days to reflect the expected average length of\nstay in a hospice, in order to provide the expected number of patient days of\nhospice care. This number is then divided by 365 (days) to arrive at the\nexpected average daily hospice caseload capacity to meet the need for\nhospice. (5)\n\nThe estimated need for\nhospice inpatient beds or dually certified hospice residence beds shall be\nequal to a number no greater than 20 percent of the expected average daily\nhospice caseload capacity divided by 0.85 to reflect an expected occupancy rate\nfor hospice beds. (d) A\nhealth systems agency may submit a plan to the department which proposes\nadjustments to hospice need estimates within its area. The Public Health\n\nCouncil and/or commissioner, as appropriate, with advice of the State Hospital\n\nReview and Planning Council, may reject or approve and implement all or a\nportion of the proposed adjustments based upon consideration of pertinent\nfactors, including but not necessarily limited to the following: (1)\nwhether the proposed adjustments reflect\nconsistency with the objectives and requirements of this section and section\n709.1\nof this Title; and\n(2)\nwhether the proposed adjustments identify\nspecial populations. (e) (1)\n\nThe hospice need estimates for each\nplanning area, together with any approved adjustments determined under this\nsection, shall constitute the estimate of public need for hospice for the\ndefined area. (2)\n\nPublic need shall\nbe deemed satisfied for a planning area when the daily average caseload\ncapacity of existing and approved hospices is adequate to meet the estimate of\npublic need for hospice for the planning area. (f) In addition to meeting the other\napplicable provisions of this section, an applicant for initial certification\nshall be approved as meeting public need only if the applicant: (1)\nagrees to serve the entire hospice\nplanning area. Pursuant to the procedure set forth in section\n709.1\n(c) of this\n\nTitle, exceptions to serving the entire planning area may be permitted under\nspecial circumstances, including but not limited to those set forth in\nsubparagraphs (i)- (iii) of this paragraph, provided that the hospice agrees to\nserve the entire alternate service area designated for such hospice. Such\ncircumstances include: (i) geographic\nbarriers and/or travel time which may impede service delivery to the entire\nplanning area; (ii)\nproposals in\nwhich an applicant will focus its program of care in specific underserved areas\nwhich form only a portion of a planning area; and\n(iii)\nother factors identified by the local\nhealth systems agency; (2)\nagrees to serve population groups in the\nplanning area that have difficulty gaining access to appropriate hospice care\ndue to minority status, age, medical history, case complexity or payment\nsource; and\n(3)\nagrees to provide\ncharity care to medically indigent persons. For the purpose of this paragraph, charity care to the medically indigent shall mean the provision of hospice care\nand services at no charge or reduced charge to patients who are unable to pay\nfull charges or any charges, are not eligible for covered benefits under title\nXVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act, are not covered by private insurance\nand whose household income is less than 200 percent of the Federal poverty\nlevel. (g) For initial\ncertification of proposed hospices and when public need is established herein, priority consideration will be given to applicants who demonstrate that they\nwill maximize the use of appropriate hospice home care, outpatient and other\ncommunity-based services.
