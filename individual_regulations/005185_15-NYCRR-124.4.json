Tit. 15 § 124.4 - Conduct of hearing; procedure; recusal\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The administrative law judge will call\nthe police officer, the motorist, and the attorney or other representative, if\nany, to the dais. After the charge is read, the police officer will testify. The burden of proving the charge rests with the police officer, who has the\nobligation to present evidence which is sufficient to establish each material\nelement of the charge by clear and convincing evidence. Other testimony in\nsupport of the charge may then be given. (b) The administrative law judge may question\nthe police officer for the purpose of clarifying evidence already presented; leading questions addressed to material elements of the charge which have been\nomitted from the police officer's testimony may not be asked. (c) After the people's case has been\npresented, the motorist may then testify on his or her own behalf and call\nwitnesses. Any person who testifies may be examined by the administrative law\njudge and cross- examined by the adverse party. All testimony shall be given\nunder oath or affirmation. The administrative law judge may exclude any\nwitness, except the motorist or police officer, during the testimony of another\nperson. Documentary evidence may be introduced by any party. (d) When the administrative law judge has\nreceived all of the evidence, the police officer and motorist or his or her\nrepresentative may make a closing statement. The administrative law judge will\nthen consider all the evidence in the record and announce whether or not the\ncharge has been sustained by clear and convincing evidence. (e) The motorist may request recusal of a\npresiding administrative law judge. The request and the reason for it must be\nstated to the presiding administrative law judge at the commencement of the\nhearing or as soon after the beginning as the motorist receives information\nwhich forms the basis for such request. An administrative law judge's denial of\na request for recusal is appealable provided a hearing determination is\nsubsequently made which is appealable by the requestor to the Traffic\n\nViolations Appeals Board pursuant to article 2-A of the Vehicle and Traffic\n\nLaw.
