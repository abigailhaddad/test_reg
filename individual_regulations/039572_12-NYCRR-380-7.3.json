  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 380-7.3 - Health insurance during paid family leave\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn accordance with the Family and Medical Leave Act\n(29 U.S.C. sections\n2601\n-\n2654\n): (a) An employee who is provided\nhealth insurance by his or her employer is entitled to the continuation of that\ngroup health insurance coverage during paid family leave on the same terms as\nif he or she had continued to work. The employee must continue to make any\nnormal contributions to the cost of the health insurance premiums. (b) If an employer provides a new health plan\nor benefits, or changes health plans or benefits while an employee is on paid\nfamily leave, the employee is entitled to the new or changed plan or benefits\nto the same extent as if the employee was not on leave. (c) Any share of health plan premiums which\nhad been paid by the employee prior to paid family leave shall continue to be\npaid by the employee during the paid family leave period. If the premiums are\nraised or lowered, the employee is required to pay the new premium\nrates. (d) (1)\nA covered employer's obligations to\nmaintain health insurance coverage cease under PFL if an employee's premium\npayment during a period of family leave is more than 30 days late. In order to\ndrop the coverage for an employee whose premium payment is late, the employer\nmust provide written notice to the employee that the payment has not been\nreceived. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least 15 days before\ncoverage is to cease, advising that coverage will be dropped on a specified\ndate at least 15 days after the date of the letter unless payment has been\nreceived by that date. (2)\n\nIf the\nemployer has established policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that\nprovide for the employer to cease coverage retroactively to the date the unpaid\npremium payment was due, the employer may drop the employee retroactively in\naccordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was given. In the\nabsence of such a policy, coverage for the employee may be terminated at the\nend of the 30 day grace period, where the required 15-day notice has been\nprovided. (e) If health\ninsurance coverage lapses because an employee has not made the required premium\npayments, upon the employee's return from paid family leave the covered\nemployer must restore the employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the\nemployee would have had if paid family leave had not been taken and premium\npayment(s) had not been missed, including family or dependent\ncoverage. (f) If an employee\nchooses not to retain health plan coverage during paid family leave, upon the\nemployee's return from paid family leave, the employee shall be reinstated into\nthe health plan on the same terms the employee had prior to taking\nleave. (g) A covered employer shall\nprovide notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits to an employee on\npaid family leave. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
