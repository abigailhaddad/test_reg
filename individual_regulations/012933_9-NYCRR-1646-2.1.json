  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-2.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Development Cost Budget (form DH-512), provides the\nmeans for controlling the nature and extent of the expenditures in the\ndevelopment of a project. No budget shall, however, be deemed effective or\ncontrolling until it has received the written approval of the division. The\ndevelopment cost budget consists of two sheets and is prepared and submitted by\nthe local agency in the following manner on a form (see Exhibits 1 and 2 of\n\nAppendix S-11), supplied by the division: (a) Preliminary development cost budget. The\npreliminary development cost budget, showing the proposed estimated project\ndevelopment cost, is prepared by the local agency and is included in and made a\npart of its application for financial assistance from the State. The\npreliminary budget controls the development cost expenditures from the date of\nthe loan and subsidy contract to the date of the award of the major\nsuperstructure contracts, i.e. general construction, plumbing, heating and\nelectrical. The preliminary budget may, under certain circumstances, be revised\nfrom time to time, in which case the latest approved budget will be\ncontrolling. (b) Final development\ncost budget. Upon the award of the major superstructure contracts (general\nconstruction, plumbing, heating, electrical) the local agency shall prepare a\nfinal development cost budget reflecting these contract awards and any others, and the latest revised estimate of development costs, and submit it to the\ndivision for approval not later than 15 days after the award and execution of\nthese contracts. This final budget also may, under certain circumstances, be\nrevised, in which case the latest approved budget will be controlling. The\nfinal development cost budget controls the development cost expenditures from\nthe date of its approval to the date of approval of the bond sale\nbudget. (c) Bond sale budget. Prior\nto the sale of bonds by the Comptroller, the division will request the local\nagency to prepare and submit to the division for approval its best estimate as\nto what will be the final development cost of the project to justify the amount\nof bonds to be included in the bond issue. This estimate should be prepared on\nform DH-512. Should further permanent financing be required for a project, the\nlocal agency will be requested to prepare and submit for the division's\napproval a supplementary bond sale budget, also on form DH-512. The bond sale\nbudgets will control expenditures from the date of approval until final\ndevelopment cost is determined. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
