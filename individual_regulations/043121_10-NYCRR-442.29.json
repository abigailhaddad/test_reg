  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.29 - Periodic interim payments\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1690 ]\n(a) Periodic interim payments are made\nbiweekly to a hospital on the PIP program and are based on the hospital's\nestimate of applicable Medicare reimbursement for the current cost report\nperiod. When such payments are received, a cash account in the Unrestricted\n\nFund is debited and a-PIP Clearing Account (account 1051) is credited for the\namount of the payment. When applicable Medicare charges are billed to the\nintermediary, the PIP Clearing Account is debited and patient accounts\nreceivable is credited. At year-end, adjustments must be made to eliminate any\nremaining balance in the PIP Clearing Account and to reflect the amount\nreceivable from, or due to, the Medicare intermediary. (b) To illustrate these entries, assume the\nfollowing facts: (1)\nPIP payments during the\nyear totaled $100,000, and applicable Medicare charges billed during the year\nwere as follows: Total charges\n$98,000\n\nNoncovered charges\n4,000\n\nDeductibles and coinsurance\n8,000\nand\n(2)\n\nApplicable unbilled Medicare charges and\nin-house patient balances were as follows at year-end: Total charges\n$10,000\n\nNoncovered charges\n500\n\nDeductibles and coinsurance\n1,200\nand\n(3)\n\nApplicable reimbursable costs per the\n\nMedicare cost report prepared for the year were $92,000. (c) In summary form, the accounting entries\nnecessary to properly reflect the above transactions would be: Account\n\nDr. Cr. (1) Cash\n1010\n$100,000\nPIP Clearing Account\n1051\n$100,000\n\nTo record the receipt of PIP payments during\nthe year. (2) Inpatient Receivables- Discharged &\nUnbilled\n1032\n108,000\n\nVarious Revenue Accounts\n108,000\n\nTo record applicable Medicare revenue for the\nyear. (3) PIP Clearing Account\n1051\n86,000\n\nInpatient Receivables-Other\n1035\n12,000\n\nInpatient Receivables- Discharged &\nUnbilled\n1032\n98,000\n\nTo record the billing of Medicare charges to\nthe intermediary ($86,000) and to Medicare patients for noncovered charges and\ndeductibles and coinsurance ($12,000). (4) PIP Clearing Account\n1051\n8,300\n\nInpatient Receivables- Discharged &\nUnbilled\n1032\n8,300\n\nTo transfer the amount of applicable unbilled\n\nMedicare receivables at year-end to the PIP Clearing Account ($10,000 - $500 -\n$1,200). (5) PIP Clearing Account-Medicare\n1051\n5,700\n\nContractual Adjustments- Medicare\n5910\n5,700\n\nTo transfer the balance in the PIP Clearing\n\nAccount at year-end to the Contractual Adjustments account (the PIP Clearing\n\nAccount must be zero at year-end). (6) Contractual Adjustments\n\nMedicare\n5910\n17,200\n\nReimbursement Settlement\n2071\n\nDue-Medicare\n$17,200\n\nTo record the amount of cost report\nreimbursement settlement due, based upon cost report filed (total PIP payments\nof $100,000 and deductibles/coinsurance in the amount of $9,200, less $92,000\nreimbursable inpatient costs per the cost report). (d) Although the preceding illustration\nreflects year-end adjustments, similar entries should be made at the end of\neach month in order to properly reflect the amount of contractual adjustment\nduring the year. In order to do this, cost reimbursement settlement must be\nestimated. When done at month-end, entries 4 - 6 would be reversed at the\nbeginning of the next month. (e) The above example adheres to the principle that, at year-end, the entire amount\nreceivable from or payable to the intermediary by a provider under the PIP\nprogram must be reflected in account 1052.00 or 2061.00. There are no\nreceivables \"in-transit\" under the PIP program. Although more complex systems\nof accounting for periodic interim payments and related billings are\npermissible-such as establishing separate subaccounts for: (1)\nPIP cash received; (2)\n\nMedicare PIP billings, including amounts\nunbilled at year-end; and\n(3)\nPIP\ncontractual allowances-this basic principle must be followed.
