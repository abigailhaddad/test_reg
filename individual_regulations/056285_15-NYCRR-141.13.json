  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 141.13 - Course advertising\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any form of advertising (including verbal\nor written statements, promotional materials, brochures, leaflets, newspaper\nand magazine ads, yellow page ads, radio and television publicity, receipts, internet web pages, pop up ads or any other medium which makes reference to the\naccident prevention course or point and insurance reduction benefits) by a\nsponsoring agency and/or delivery agency must conform with the following\nstandards: (1)\nadvertising shall reflect the\nserious nature of the motor vehicle accident prevention course and, in no\nmanner, either through the text of the advertisement or through the name of the\ncourse, diminish the subject matter or serious nature of the course. Advertising shall not refer to gimmicks or enticements, such as comedy or free\ngifts, or to any benefits other than point and insurance reduction. (2)\n\nThe only acceptable reference to the\ndepartment is that the sponsoring agency's course is approved by the New York\n\nState Department of Motor Vehicles. Words which convey partnership, such as \"in\ncooperation with,\" \"supervised by,\" \"recommended by,\" or \"endorsed by\" the\n\nDepartment of Motor Vehicles may not be used. No sponsoring agency may\nadvertise or imply that it is associated with or is an agent or employee of the\ndepartment. No representative of the ADM sponsoring agency shall knowingly\nallow the use of advertising that could lead the public to believe that they or\ntheir sponsor are an employee, representative or agent of the\ndepartment. (3)\n\nNo sponsoring\nagency course shall be permitted to conduct business or advertise under any\nname that has not been approved by the department, pursuant to articles 12-B\nand 12-C of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. No sponsoring agency or delivery\nagency may use the words \"driving school\" in its name in advertising unless it\nis licensed in accordance with part 76 of the Commissioner's\n\nRegulations. (4)\n\nNo sponsoring\nagency may advertise in any manner until approved by the department. No\norganization shall advertise point or insurance reduction benefits in any\nmanner until such time as the course has been approved by the\ndepartment. (5)\nA sponsoring agency\nis responsible for the content of the advertising of its delivery agencies with\nregard to the point and insurance reduction program. Sponsoring agencies shall\nreview and approve all delivery agency advertising to ensure compliance with\nthis Part or provide pre-approved advertising materials for delivery agencies\nto use. (6)\n\nAll advertising must\nindicate that the course is a minimum of 320 minutes in length. (7)\n\nPoint/Insurance Reduction Program\nadvertising shall not be combined with any other advertising, such as driving\nschool or insurance agency advertising, unless it has been approved by the\nsponsoring agency, in accordance with this section, in order to protect the\npublic from potentially confusing or misleading information. (8)\n\nNo sponsoring agency may publish, advertise or imply that the completion of the course conducted for point\nreduction will result in \"erasing\", \"masking\" or deleting any information from\na motorist's driving record. Communication with course participants must\nclearly indicate that while certain departmental administrative actions based\nupon a motorist's point accumulation may be prevented, all traffic convictions, as well as the points designated for such convictions, will continue to be\ndisplayed on the motorist's driving record. Sponsors shall inform students\nabout the New York State Driver Responsibility Assessment (DRA) and indicate\nthat completing a course will not affect mandatory fines or assessments such as\nthe DRA. (9)\n\nNo sponsoring agency\nor employee may make false or misleading claims or statements in any of its\nadvertisements. (10)\n\nAll course\nadvertising must identify the sponsoring agency and the ADM method. (11)\n\nAny material contained in literature\nproduced by the department may be quoted without attribution, provided the\nquote retains its original meaning. Any presentation of departmental material\nwhich implies or creates a meaning other than the meaning intended by the\ndepartment is prohibited. (12)\n\nNo\nsponsoring agency, delivery agency, or employee shall falsely advertise or\nrepresent itself to be an agent or employee of New York State unless the\nsponsoring agency is a State agency offering a DMV approved course to its\nemployees. (13)\n\nNo sponsoring\nagency or delivery agency shall conduct business or display or distribute any\nadvertising material within a building owned or leased by the State or county\nin which motor vehicle registrations or licensees are issued to the\npublic. (14)\nA copy, recording or\nvideotape of any advertisement shall be kept on file by a sponsoring agency or\ndelivery agency for five years along with a record of when and where it was\nused or distributed. (15)\n\nPermission to re-publish any content of the department's website shall be\nobtained from the department's internet office. The department will provide an\nimage to use as a link to the site. The department's website may not be placed\nwithin any other website frames. (16)\n\nComparative statistics or claims that\nstate or imply that one sponsoring agency is more effective than another are\nnot to be used. The effectiveness of one sponsoring agency's approved course\nmay not be statistically compared to another approved course for advertising\nand promotional purposes. (17)\n\nNo\nimplicit or explicit claims that are not supported by documentation are\npermissible. Such documentation and the proposed advertising must be reviewed\nand approved by the sponsoring agency in accordance with the standards of this\nsection before they may be used. (18)\n\nThe commissioner may, in his or her\ndiscretion, require a sponsoring agency or its delivery agency to modify or\ndiscontinue advertising that is deemed inappropriate, false or\nmisleading. (19)\n\nSponsoring\nagencies or delivery agencies should consider including the following topic\nguidelines in their advertising: (i) persons\nare eligible to receive point reduction once in 18 months. Points which are\nreduced remain on a motorist's record, but are not counted by the department in\ndetermining further administrative actions against the license. (ii)\n\nPoint reduction does not affect actions\nmandated by statute, such as license revocation for three speeding convictions\nwithin 18 months. (iii)\n\nPoint\nreduction does not affect suspensions or revocations already in\nplace. (iv)\n\nThe only acceptable\nreference to insurance reduction is that successful completion of the course\nprovides a 10 percent reduction, for three years, in the base rate of the\nmotorist's current automobile liability, no-fault and collision\npremiums. (v) Quotes or references\nto specific dollar amounts saved are not acceptable. (vi)\n\nImplicit or explicit claims that\nreduction may be less than or greater than 10 percent annually are not\nacceptable. (vii)\n\nNo implicit or\nexplicit claim may be made that repeating the course more frequently than once\nevery three years yields an improvement over the 10 percent reduction in\nliability and collision insurance rates for each three consecutive\nyears. (viii)\n\nAny statement must\ninclude the requirement that the person completing a course must be the\nprincipal operator of the insured vehicle in order to be eligible for\nreduction. Notes\nN.Y.
