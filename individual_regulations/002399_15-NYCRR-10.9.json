The internet pre-licensing\ncourse must include built-in timers to ensure that two hundred seventy (270)\nminutes of instruction have been attended and completed by the student. Timers\nmust be built into online and interactive courses in order to prevent a\nmotorist from advancing to the next page or section in less than the amount of\ntime it would take the average person to read or be exposed to that page or\nsection. Timers must be incorporated into the verification process so that if a\ntelephone verification system is used, the student cannot complete the\nvalidation piece of each section until the amount of time that it would take an\naverage person to complete such section has passed. (b) Each sponsor application, submitted in\naccordance with this Part, must include a specific plan for how instruction\ntime will be calculated. In addition, the sponsor must record and store a\nrecord of such calculations, including all instruction time, and such record\nmust be made available by the sponsor to the third-party monitor and the\n\nDepartment for monitoring and quality control purposes. Instruction time\ncalculations, included as part of each student's completion record, must\nclearly differentiate actual interactive instruction time from non-instruction\ntime, such as log-in procedures, administrative tasks, help functions, validation processes, audio/visual media download times and time spent\nreading/responding to content questions. This information must also be used by\nthe sponsor in fulfilling its monitoring responsibilities as defined in this\n\nPart. The sponsor must store this data for a minimum of five (5) years from the\ndate it was created, or the date the course was completed, whichever is\nlater. (c) Customer service and\nsupport. (1)\n\nSponsors must provide toll free\ntelephone lines staffed by knowledgeable customer service staff that can assist\nwith routine questions. Staff must be knowledgeable about policy, procedural, technical, and content matters. (2)\n\nSponsors must also provide online assistance, in addition to telephone support, through the use of frequently asked questions and/or online chat access or\nequivalent real-time communication. (d) The course must meet all of the technical\nspecifications as prescribed by the Commissioner. (e) Sponsors must validate a student's\nidentity as part of the internet pre-licensing course. Sponsors must choose a\nminimum combination of validation techniques in designing their internet\npre-licensing course, subject to approval by the Department. The Department\nwill assign relative point values to each technique to assess the security and\nintegrity of each sponsor's validation solution. (f) Sponsors must prominently identify for\npotential students on informational pages of the sponsor's website all\nvalidation methods that will be used during the course, and sponsors must\nnotify potential students during the registration process of all validation\nmethods that will be used during the course. Sponsors must not accept payment\nprior to the student agreeing to the validation methods. (g) In the event sponsors have alternate\nvalidation techniques, the Department may review such alternates to determine\nif they are acceptable. (h) Internet/interactive delivery specific requirements. (1)\n\nReceipt. All students who have paid for\nthe course must be provided a receipt of such payment. The receipt is not proof\nof official course completion. The receipt must indicate thereon that it is\nevidence of course payment. Such receipt must be displayed online and available\nfor printing and must, in addition, be e-mailed to the student. (2)\n\nStudents must complete the internet\npre-licensing course within 30 calendar days of registration. Sponsors must\nexclude from the program, students who do not successfully complete the course, and those students shall forfeit course fees. Sponsors may, in their\ndiscretion, choose to waive a fee or allow the student to enroll in a new\ncourse without paying an additional course fee. Students who have been excluded\nfrom the course and are allowed to enroll in a new course must complete the\nentire course. (3)\n\nSponsors must\nmaintain an escrow account with the Department to pay fees required to be paid\nto the Department. Sponsors must ensure that such account has sufficient funds\nto pay such fees at all times. (4)\n\nSponsors must comply with all state and federal laws requiring that electronic\nand information technology be accessible to people with disabilities. In\nparticular, whenever video or audio is playing, sponsors must ensure that a\ntext stream of the spoken word will be visible where appropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
