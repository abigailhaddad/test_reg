  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 212-1.5 - Determining applicable emission standards for process operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In instances\nwhere air contaminants from two or more process emission sources may be\nsimultaneously emitted to the outdoor atmosphere through a single emission\npoint, the permissible emission rate or degree of air cleaning required is\ndetermined by using the sum of the process weights or emission rate potentials\nfor all process emission sources. (b) In instances where air contaminants from\na single process emission source are emitted to the outdoor atmosphere through\nmore than one emission point, the sum of the emissions from all such emission\npoints shall not exceed the quantity that would be authorized through a single\nemission point. (c) In instances\nwhere air contaminants from two or more process emission sources are emitted to\nthe outdoor atmosphere through a single emission point and the applicable\nemission standard for one or more process emission sources, if vented\nseparately to the outdoor atmosphere, is a concentration standard (grains per\nstandard cubic foot), the permissible emission rate through such emission point\nshall not exceed the quantity that would be authorized if the emissions were\nthrough separate emission points. (d) In instances where a facility owner or\noperator can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the department that the\nfacility owner or operator will apply BACT for criteria air contaminants or\nT-BACT for non-criteria air contaminants, the department may specify a less\nrestrictive permissible emission rate or degree of air cleaning for the process\nemission source or emission point than required under Subpart 212-2 of this\n\nPart. (e) (1)\nA process emission source subject to a\n\nFederal NSPS under 40 CFR Part\n60\n(see Table 1, Section\n200.9\nof this Title) satisfies the\nrequirements of this Part for the respective air contaminant regulated by the\n\nFederal standard if the facility owner or operator can demonstrate that the\nfacility is in compliance with the relevant Federal regulation. (2)\nA process emission source subject to the\n\nFederal National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) under\n40 CFR Part\n61\nor Part 63 (see Table 1 of Section\n200.9\nof this Title) satisfies the\nrequirements of this Part for the respective air contaminant regulated by the\n\nFederal standard if the facility owner or operator can demonstrate that the\nprocess emission source is in compliance with the relevant Federal regulation\nand, for those NESHAPs regulating HTACs found in Section\n212-2.2, Table 2 - High Toxicity\n\nAir Contaminant List, of this Part, provide a TIA demonstrating that the\nmaximum offsite ambient air concentration is less than the AGC/SGC or meeting\nthe mass emission limit identified in Section\n212-2.2, Table 2. Either compliance\noption must have actual emissions less than the PB trigger for the respective\nair contaminant. Facility owners or operators required to submit a TIA\nshall submit a protocol describing the procedures to be used to predict the\nmaximum offsite ambient air concentration. Once the protocol is approved by the\ndepartment and the TIA is conducted, the facility owner or operator shall\nsubmit a final report to the department along with the air dispersion modeling\nresults for approval. The department requires the use of an EPA approved air\ndispersion model for all screening a n d /or refined air dispersion modeling\nassessments; however, screen dispersion models do not require an approved\nmodeling protocol. (f) Facility owners or operators whose\nprocess operations emit NOx or VOCs and meet the applicability requirements of\n\nSubpart 212-3 or Subpart 212-4 of this Part are not subject to the control\nprovisions in Subpart 212-2 of this Part for NOx or VOCs. However, if an\nindividual air contaminant, as a component of total VOCs, is assigned an\nenvironmental rating of A, that individual air contaminant must meet the\ncontrol requirements o f Subpart 212-2 of this Part. (g) At all times, the facility owner or\noperator must operate and maintain all process emission sources, including the\nassociated air pollution control and monitoring equipment, in a manner\nconsistent with safety, good air pollution control practices, good engineering\npractices and manufacturers' recommendations for minimizing\nemissions.
