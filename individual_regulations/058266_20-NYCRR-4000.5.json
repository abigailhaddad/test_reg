  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 4000.5 - Conciliation conference and review of request\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Acknowledgment of receipt of request; review of documents. The Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services shall\nacknowledge the receipt of a request. The request and other documents\nconcerning the controversy shall then be reviewed to ascertain that the request\nis timely filed. Where review indicates that the request is not timely filed, the conciliation conferee will issue a conciliation order to that\neffect. (b) Notice of conciliation\nconference; location; attendance requirements. (1)\n(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, a conciliation\nconference will be scheduled at an office of the department which is within the\n\nState and, where possible, which is most convenient to the requester. Written\nnotice of the time and place of the first conciliation conference shall be\nmailed to all parties at least 30 days prior to the date of such conference. Written notice of the time and place of any adjourned or continued conciliation\nconference shall be mailed to the parties at least 10 days prior to the date of\nsuch adjourned or continued conference. A request by any party for a preference\nin scheduling will be honored to the extent possible, and the requester may\nwaive, in writing, the 30-day notice requirement for this purpose. (ii)\nA conciliation conference regarding the\ndenial of an application for a license, permit or registration, or the\ncancellation, suspension or revocation of a license, permit or registration, shall be held, within 20 business days after receipt of the request (determined\nwith regard to any postponements of any scheduled conference or other delay\nmade at the request of the requester), at an office of the department which is\nwithin the State and, where possible, which is most convenient to the\nrequester. The Bureau of Conciliation and Mediation Services shall attempt to\ncontact the requester or his or her representative by telephone within the time\nlimitations set forth in this subparagraph. When possible, written confirmation\nof the date, time and location of the conference shall be mailed to the\napplicant or his representative. A request for conciliation conference\nregarding the denial of an application for a license, permit or registration\nshall be considered to be a postponement or delay of a hearing made at the\nrequest of the applicant for such license, permit or registration. (2)\n\nAt the written request of\neither party, received 15 days in advance of the scheduled conciliation\nconference date, except for conferences scheduled pursuant to subparagraph\n(1)(ii) of this subdivision, an adjournment may be granted by the conciliation\nconferee where good cause is shown. In the event of an emergency, an\nadjournment in any case may be granted on less notice. (3)\n\nWhere a requester fails to appear\npersonally or by representative and where an adjournment has not been granted, the conciliation conferee may issue a conciliation order dismissing the request\nfor nonappearance. Upon written application filed within 30 days after the\nissuance of a conciliation order dismissing the timely request, such order may\nbe vacated and a conciliation conference scheduled where the requester shows a\nreasonable excuse for the nonappearance. In the alternative, the requester may\nfile a petition with the Division of Tax Appeals (see Part 3000 of this Title)\nwithin the time limitations prescribed by section 170.3 -a(e) of the Tax\n\nLaw. (4)\n\nWhere the operating\ndivision or bureau is the absent party, the conciliation conferee may receive\nthe requester's evidence without the presence of the operating division or\nbureau, and issue a conciliation order based on the record. The record made by\nthe conciliation conferee shall consist of the statutory notice, any other\ncorrespondence or written information given by the operating division or bureau\nto the requester prior to the conciliation conference, the request, and any\nother evidence submitted by the requester at or after the conciliation\nconference. (c) Conciliation conference scope and procedure. (1)\n(i) The\nconciliation conference is intended to afford the parties an opportunity to\nresolve disagreements. With the cooperation of the parties, the conciliation\nconferee will endeavor to develop those facts and issues on which there is no\ndisagreement and those facts and issues which are in dispute. The goal of the\nconciliation conferee will be, where possible, in whole or in part, to resolve\nthe controversy between the parties within the framework of the Tax Law, thereby narrowing the scope of or eliminating the need for a hearing in the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals. (ii)\nA\nconciliation conference is not available for distributors, importing\ntransporters, terminal operators or petroleum businesses where the issue is an\nincrease in the amount of a bond or other security, requested by the\ncommissioner, under section\n283, 283-a, 283-b\nor\n302\nof the Tax Law. In this situation, the\ntaxpayer should petition for a hearing in the Division of Tax Appeals in\naccordance with the provisions of Part 3000 of this Title. (2)\n\nThe conciliation conferee shall conduct\nthe conciliation conference in an informal manner and shall hear or receive\ntestimony and evidence deemed necessary or desirable for a just and equitable\nresult. To accomplish the expeditious resolution of controversies, the\ncommissioner may delegate to the conferee the right to waive or modify penalty, interest and additions to tax in accordance with the commissioner's authority\nto waive or modify penalty, interest and additions to tax under the Tax\n\nLaw. (3)\n(i) After reviewing the testimony, evidence\nand comments, the conciliation conferee will serve on the requester a proposed\nresolution in the form of a consent. In developing this proposed resolution, the conciliation conferee may contact either party to clarify any issues or\nfacts in dispute. (ii)\n\nWhere the\nproposal is acceptable to the requester, the requester shall have 15 days to\nexecute the consent and agree to waive any right to petition for hearing in the\n\nDivision of Tax Appeals concerning the statutory notice. (iii)\n\nWhere the requester fails to agree with\nthe proposed resolution and does not execute the consent within 15 days, the\nconciliation conference proceeding will be deemed concluded. The conciliation\nconferee shall render a conciliation order within 30 days after the\nconciliation conference proceeding is concluded. (4)\n\nIn the absence of a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact, such order will be binding\non the Division of Taxation and the requester. However, a conciliation order\nwill not be binding on the requester if such person petitions for a hearing\nconcerning the statutory notice within the time limitations prescribed by\nsection 170.3 -a(e) of the Tax Law. The petition must be filed in accordance\nwith section\n3000.3\nof this Title. (5)\n\nConciliation\norders are not required to be published. Such orders are not considered\nprecedent, nor are they given any force or effect in any subsequent\nconciliation conference with respect to the requester or any other\nperson. (6)\n\nIf the consent or\nconciliation order entails a refund, approval of the Comptroller is\nnecessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
