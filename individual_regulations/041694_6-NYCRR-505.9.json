  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.9 - Erosion protection structures\n\nState Regulations\n\nConstruction of erosion protection structures is\nexpensive, often only partially effective over time, and may even be harmful to\nadjacent or nearby properties. In some areas of the coastline, major erosion\nprotection structures of great length would be required to effectively reduce\nfuture damages due to erosion. However, in those instances where properly\ndesigned and constructed erosion protection structures will be likely to\nminimize or prevent damage or destruction to manmade property, private and\npublic property, natural protective features, and other natural resources, construction of erosion protection structures may be allowed. In such cases, the construction, modification or restoration of erosion protection structures\nis subject to the following requirements: (a) A coastal erosion management permit is\nrequired for construction, modification or restoration of erosion protection\nstructures, including the modification or restoration of erosion protection\nstructures that were constructed without a coastal erosion management permit. Normal maintenance of an erosion protection structure does not require a\ncoastal erosion management permit. (b) All erosion protection structures must be\ndesigned and constructed according to generally accepted engineering principles\nwhich have demonstrated success or, where sufficient data is not currently\navailable, a likelihood of success in controlling long-term erosion. The\nprotective measures must have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion\non the immediate site for at least 30 years. (c) A long-term maintenance program must be\nincluded with every permit application for construction, modification or\nrestoration of an erosion protection structure. That program must include\nspecifications for normal maintenance of degradable materials and the periodic\nreplacement of removable materials. (d) All materials used in such structures\nmust be durable and capable of withstanding inundation, wave impacts, weathering, and other effects of storm conditions. Individual component\nmaterials may have a working life of less than 30 years only when a maintenance\nprogram ensures that they will be regularly maintained and replaced as\nnecessary to attain the required 30 years of erosion protection. (e) The construction, modification or\nrestoration of erosion protection structures must: (1)\nnot be likely to cause any measurable\nincrease in erosion at the development site or other locations; and\n(2)\nminimize, and if possible prevent, adverse effects to natural protective features, existing erosion protection\nstructures, and natural resources such as significant fish and wildlife\nhabitats. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n505.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
