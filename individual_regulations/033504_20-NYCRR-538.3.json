Tit. 20 § 538.3 - Issuance of tickets or other documentation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1142-A(b)\n(a) Section\n1142-A (b)\nof the Tax Law\nrequires, with certain exceptions described in subdivision (c) of this section, each parking facility operator to furnish a ticket or other documentation to\neach purchaser of parking services at the time of the initiation of the\nservice. The parking facility operator is required to keep each original ticket\nor other documentation issued, or a true copy of each such ticket or other\ndocumentation, containing all the information required in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, separated by day, as part of the additional records required to\nbe kept by this Part and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law. (b) The ticket or other documentation\n(hereafter referred to collectively as the ticket) required to be furnished to\nthe purchaser must conform to the following requirements. (1)\n\nTickets must be consecutively numbered in\na manner approved by the department. A ticket number may not be used more than\nonce in a calendar year at a parking facility unless the number has a letter\nprefix or suffix which readily distinguishes a ticket on which the number\nappears from any other ticket with the same number or unless the ticket on\nwhich the number appears can be readily distinguished from any other ticket\nwith the same number by being printed on a distinctly different color paper or\nwith a distinctly different color ink. In the alternative, the ticket may be\nissued by a computer in a manner approved by the department. The proposed\nnumbering scheme or the alternative computer issuance procedure must be\nsubmitted by the parking facility operator for approval by the department to\nthe Audit Division -Sales Tax Bureau, Building 9, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227, at least 20 days prior to use by the parking facility operator of the\nnumbering scheme or computer issuance procedure. The operator is required to\nkeep for a period of at least three years, as described in section\n538.4\n(g) of this Part, a copy of the submissions to the department and the department's\napproval or denial, as part of the additional records required to be kept by\nthis Part and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law. Provided, however, where an operator uses only one form and type of ticket at a facility and the\nconsecutive numbers of such tickets do not repeat for that facility in a\ncalendar year (taking into account different letter prefixes and suffixes and\ndifferent paper or ink colors), the operator is not required to submit the\nnumbering scheme to the department for approval. (2)\n\nThe part of every ticket given to a\ncustomer and the part of every ticket required to be kept by the operator must\neach indicate the complete address of the parking facility issuing the ticket\nand the operator's full name. (3)\n\nThe part of every ticket given to a customer and the part of every ticket\nrequired to be kept by the operator must each indicate the date and time of\nentry of the motor vehicle. (4)\n\nThe\npart of every ticket given to a customer and the part of every ticket required\nto be kept by the operator must each also indicate the date and time of exit of\nthe motor vehicle, unless the parking facility operator charges a flat fee for\nthe parking service to which the ticket relates and the following conditions\nare met: (i) the charge for flat fee parking\nis based on time elapsed; (ii)\nthe\namount of such charge is indicated on the ticket and is clearly indicated to be\na flat fee; and\n(iii)\nit is not the\npractice of the parking facility operator to date and time-stamp the ticket\nwhen the purchaser pays for the parking service for which a flat fee is\ncharged. (5)\n\nIn the case\nof a monthly or longer term purchaser to whom a ticket is issued, the ticket\nmust also include the purchaser's printed name and signature. In lieu of the\npurchaser's printed name and signature being set forth on such a ticket, an\nidentification number assigned to the monthly or longer term purchaser by the\nparking facility operator must be indicated on the ticket. (c) (1)\n\nWhere a parking facility operator sells parking services on a monthly or longer\nterm basis and issues a computer access card or a prenumbered decal or tag to\nthe purchaser, the parking facility operator will not be required to give the\nticket described in subdivision (b) of this section to a purchaser to whom such\na card, decal or tag has been issued, or to keep a copy of such ticket. However, the operator is required to obtain approval from the department to use\nsuch a numbering scheme on such access card, decal or tag by submitting the\nscheme at least 20 days prior to use, to the address set forth in paragraph\n(b)(1) of this section. The operator shall keep a copy of such submission to\nthe department and the department's denial or approval, for a period of at\nleast three years, as described in section\n538.4\n(g) of this Part, as part of the additional records required to be kept by this\n\nPart and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law. Provided, however, where an operator uses only one form and type of access card, decal or tag at a\nfacility and the consecutive numbers of such cards, decals or tags do not\nrepeat for that facility in a calendar year (taking into account different\nletter prefixes and suffixes and different color cards, decals or tags or\ndifferent ink colors), the operator is not required to submit the numbering\nscheme to the department for approval. (2)\n\nEvery parking facility operator which\nsells parking services on a monthly or longer term basis must, whether or not a\nticket is issued to the purchaser, keep as part of the additional records\nrequired to be kept by this Part and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law a list containing\nthe following: (i) the name, address and\nsignature of each purchaser of any parking service on a monthly or longer term\nbasis; (ii)\nany identification\nnumber assigned to any such purchaser, as described in paragraph (b)(5) of this\nsection, or the number of any access card, decal or tag described in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision; (iii)\nthe\nvalid period during which such monthly or longer term service is provided to\neach such purchaser (\ne.g., one month, six months, one year, etc.); (iv)\nthe number of\nauthorized vehicles entitled to any such monthly or longer term\nservice; (v) the address of the\nparking facility where such purchaser parks, garages or stores the purchaser's\nvehicle; (vi)\nthe rate charged each\nsuch purchaser for monthly or longer term service as well as the time period\n(day only, night only, weekend only, etc.) such purchaser is permitted to park, garage or store the purchaser's vehicle; and\n(vii)\nwhether such purchaser is wholly tax\nexempt, exempt only from the additional eight percent Manhattan parking tax or\nfully taxable. (3)\n\nProvided, however, where a purchaser of parking services on a monthly or longer\nterm basis submits an application for such services to the parking facility\noperator and each such application from every such purchaser contains all of\nthe information required in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such\napplications together will be deemed to constitute the list required in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. The parking facility operator is required to\nkeep every such application for a period of at least three years from the later\nof the due date or date of filing of the latest sales and use tax return to\nwhich an application relates, as part of the additional records required to be\nkept by this Part and section\n1142-A\nof the Tax Law.
