  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 6-3.19 - Water quality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sample collection and analysis. Microbiological samples shall be collected from spray pad treatment tanks when determined by the permit-issuing official to be necessary to evaluate water quality, and be examined in laboratories approved by the New York State Department of Health. (b) Microbiological quality. Total coliform bacteria levels should not exceed 4 per 100 milliliters in more than one sample examined each month. When the membrane filter technique is used, or when the fermentation tube method is used, coliform bacteria shall not be present in more than 10 percent of portions analyzed in any month; also, total bacteria (heterotrophic plate count or standard plate count) shall not exceed 200 per milliliter. (c) Chemical quality. (1)\n\nThe chemical quality of the spray feature water shall not cause irritation to the eyes or skin of the patrons or have other objectionable physiological effects on patrons. (2)\n\nThe total alkalinity of the spray pad treatment tank water shall be maintained within the range of 80 to 120 mg/l. (3)\n\nThe spray pad treatment tank water shall be chemically balanced. The permit-issuing official may require that the operator determine the saturation index monthly or at any other frequency required to maintain water clarity, proper disinfection, alkalinity, and pH levels. (d) Cleanliness. The spray pad and features shall be kept free of sediment and visible soil, and the treatment tank water surface shall be kept free of visible floating matter. (e) Turbidity. The turbidity in the spray pad treatment tank shall not exceed three nephelometric turbidity units (NTU) at any time during use. If this turbidity level is exceeded, the spray pad shall be closed for use until the spray pad treatment system reduces the turbidity to less than three NTU. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n6-3.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
