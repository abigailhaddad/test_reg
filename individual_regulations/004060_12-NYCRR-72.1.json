(b) Section 200, subdivision\n2, provides: \"2. If the commissioner finds that any machinery, equipment, or device in any place to which this chapter applies is in a\ndangerous condition, or finds that any area to which this chapter applies is in\na dangerous condition, he may attach a notice to such machinery, equipment, or\ndevice, or post a notice in such area warning all persons of the danger. Such\nnotice shall prohibit the use of such machinery, equipment, or device or\nprohibit further work in or occupancy of such area until the dangerous\ncondition is corrected and the notice is removed by the commissioner. Upon\nreceipt of a written notification from the employer that the dangerous\ncondition has been corrected, the commissioner shall make a reinspection within\nten working days, and if the commissioner finds that the dangerous condition\nhas been corrected, he shall remove the notice. The filing with the board of a\npetition for a review of the validity and reasonableness of the commissioner's\norder pursuant to section one hundred one of this chapter, shall not stay\nfurther proceedings; provided, however, that the board, in its discretion, may\nupon application of the petitioner stay further proceedings. The board shall\ngrant or deny such application for a stay within seventy-two hours after the\nfiling of the application.\"\n(c) The foregoing procedure for tagging\nunsafe an object or an area referred to in section 200, subdivision 2, is\ninvoked when an enforcement representative of the Commissioner of Labor finds\nthat the condition of any machinery, equipment, device or area to which the\n\nLabor Law applies, or that the circumstances under which any of the aforesaid\nitems or areas are or may be used, evinces or is likely to occasion a degree of\ndanger or a severity of hazard, justifying summary prohibition of the use of\nthe tagged object or area. (d) An\n\"unsafe notice\" which is affixed to an object or which is posted in an area\npursuant to the above-quoted Labor Law provision customarily is accompanied\nwith a Notice of Violation and Order to Comply, which includes: (1)\nan order forbidding the use of the tagged\nobject or area until the \"unsafe notice\" is officially removed or otherwise\nlawfully terminated; and\n(2)\nif not\npreviously issued, an order directing that the alleged dangerous condition be\ncorrected. (e) If a\nparty deems that an \"unsafe notice\" or Notice of Violation and Order to Comply\nis unreasonable or invalid, a petition to revoke, amend or modify the same may\nbe filed as provided in Part 6 5 of this Subchapter. If a party desires to\ncontinue to use the tagged machinery, equipment, device or area pending the\nresolution of that proceeding, an application therefor must be made under this\n\nPart. Such an application should be made either contemporaneously with or after\nthe filing of a petition pursuant to Part 65. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
