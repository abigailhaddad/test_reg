  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 382.22 - Additional siting criteria for aboveground and belowground disposal\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to the requirements of section\n382.21\nof this Part, any site used\nfor aboveground or belowground disposal of waste must meet the requirements of\nthis section. (a) Surface waters and\nhydrology. (1)\n\nThe disposal site must not be\nin a 100-year flood plain, coastal hazard area or wetland, as defined in\n\nExecutive Order 11988, Floodplain Management Guidelines, 42 Fed. Reg. 26951\n(1977) (see section\n382.99\nof this Part). (2)\n\nThe disposal site must not be located in\na freshwater wetland designated pursuant to ECL article 24, a tidal wetland\ndesignated pursuant to ECL article 25, a coastal erosion hazard area identified\npursuant to ECL article 34, or a flood hazard area as determined by the Federal\n\nEmergency Management Agency pursuant to\n42 USC\n4001\net seq. (see section 382.99 of this\n\nPart). (3)\n\nThe surface contours and\ndrainage systems of the disposal site must ensure that the site is well-drained\nand free of areas of flooding or frequent ponding at all times. (4)\n\nThe site must not be located in areas\nwhere the surface runoff could expose, erode or inundate the disposal\nunits. (b) Groundwater\nand hydrogeology. (1)\n\nThe disposal site must\nhave sufficient depth to the water table that groundwater intrusion, perennial\nor otherwise, will not contact the disposal units. An exception to this\nrequirement that would allow disposal below the water table may be approved by\nthe department if it can be conclusively shown that disposal site\ncharacteristics will result in molecular diffusion being the predominant means\nof radionuclide movement and the rate of movement will result in compliance\nwith the performance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part. In no\ncase will the waste disposal units be permitted in the zone of fluctuation of\nthe water table. (2)\n\nThe site must\nnot be located immediately above the Long Island aquifer, any primary public\nwater supply aquifer, or a principal aquifer designated by the\ndepartment. (c) Geology\nand soils. The site must not be located where surface and subsurface geologic\nconditions or processes such as mass wasting, subsidence, erosion, solutioning, slumping, landsliding or weathering occur with such frequency and extent to\nadversely affect the ability of the land disposal facility to meet the\nperformance objectives of sections\n382.10\n-382.15 of this Part or to\npreclude defensible modeling and prediction of long-term impacts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n382.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
