  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 315.5 - Reporting requirements for service credit involving public safety overtime\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Background. The Retirement System has long considered certain special duty assignments that\nconsisted primarily of security work performed by public safety professionals\nat the request of a private entity on a voluntary basis, paid or reimbursed by\nthe private entity, performed under the direction of the private entity, or\nprimarily for the benefit of the private entity not to be creditable because\nsuch assignments did not constitute paid public service with a participating\nemployer. Courts have upheld the Retirement System's position that such work, often referred to as \"private entity overtime\" was not allowable service, and\nwas not within the realm of the employee's duties for the participating\nemployer. In recent years, however, the manner in which special duty\nassignments performed at the request of private entities are assigned, supervised, and compensated has changed. Today, special duty assignments a re\noften mandatory and are directed and controlled by the public employer. Compensation to the employee is paid by the public employer, not the private\nentity. In recognition of the changing nature of special duty assignments, the\n\nRetirement System has determined that those special duty assignments that meet\nthe criteria established by the Retirement System, qualify as \"public safety\novertime\" and shall be considered allowable service. (b) Definition. For purposes of the section, \"public safety overtime\" shall mean overtime service for hours worked in excess\nof regularly scheduled hours that is performed by a member as a special duty\nassignment that meets the criteria set forth in subdivision (g) of this\nsection. (c) Applicability. This\nsection applies to the following members: Active members of the New York State\nand Local Police and Fire Retirement System who are engaged in police or fire\nservice as defined in Subdivision 11 of Section\n302\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw; and Active members of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement\n\nSystem who are employed as sheriffs, under-sheriffs or regular deputy sheriffs\nengaged directly in criminal law enforcement activities that aggregate fifty\nper centum of his or her job duties as certified by the county. (d) Reporting. The employer of any member\ncovered by this section shall report all special duty assignments to the\n\nRetirement System at such time and in such manner as prescribed by the\n\nRetirement System. The Retirement System is authorized to audit all such\nreports to confirm that only those special duty assignments that qualify as\npublic safety overtime are treated as allowable service. (e) Information required from employers. The\nemployer shall provide any and all documents requested by the Retirement System\nfor the purpose of confirming that the reported special duty assignment is\nallowable public safety overtime. Examples of the documents that may be\nrequested shall include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. The contract or other written agreement\nbetween the private entity and the employer describing the services to be\nperformed as the special duty assignment; 2. The employer's overtime policy and/or\ncollective bargaining agreement; and\n3. Payroll documents associated with the\nspecial duty assignment. (f) Contributions. Contributions for earnings\nassociated with special duty assignments deemed allowable service shall be made\nby employees and employers in the manner prescribed by the Retirement\n\nSystem. (g) Criteria for allowable\nservice. The following criteria apply to the determination of whether a special\nduty assignment qualifies as public safety overtime and is to be reported to\nthe Retirement System as allowable service: 1. There is a contract for services between\nthe participating employer and the private entity; 2. The services provided are for the benefit\nof the public at large, as opposed to for the exclusive benefit of the private\nentity; 3. The duties performed by\nthe employee for the private entity are police, fire or sheriff department\nduties that are provided for public safety; 4. Payment to the employee for the special\nduty assignment is made by the participating employer, not by the private\nentity; 5. The special duty\nassignment is available to all employees in the public safety title, consistent\nwith the participating employer's policy or practice for the assignment of\novertime; 6. The work performed for\nthe special duty assignment is directed, supervised and controlled by the\nparticipating employer; 7. The\nspecial duty assignment is mandatory, consistent with the participating\nemployer's policy or practice for the assignment of overtime; and\n8. The employee is indemnified by the\nemployer when performing the special duty assignment. (h) Limitations. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this section, the creditability of public safety overtime is\nsubject to the limitations provided for in the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw. Notes\nN.Y.
