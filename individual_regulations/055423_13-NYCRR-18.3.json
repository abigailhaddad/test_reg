This is a very important section, if applicable, and must be on a\nseparate page following the table of contents. All features of a plan which involve significant risk, or are reasonably probable to affect\ndisproportionately or unusually the maintenance charges or obligations of shareholders in future years of cooperative operation, must be\nconspicuously disclosed and highlighted. A brief description of the nature of the risk should be given in this section and a more thorough\ndescription should be given in a referenced later section. Uncertainties as to whether a risk should be described in this section should be resolved\nin favor of inclusion. (1)\n\nDisclose whether sponsor is reserving the right to rent rather than sell units\nappurtenant to its unsold shares (hereinafter \"units\") as they become vacant. If sponsor is retaining such right, without committing itself to sell\nat least 51 percent of the units as they become vacant, to purchasers for personal occupancy, the cover of the plan must state in bold print: BECAUSE SPONSOR IS RETAINING THE RIGHT TO RENT MORE THAN 49 PERCENT\nOF THE UNITS IN THE BUILDING OR BUILDINGS BEING CONVERTED TO COOPERATIVE OWNERSHIP, FUTURE MARKETABILITY OF ALL UNITS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND\nPURCHASERS MAY NEVER GAIN EFFECTIVE CONTROL OF THE COOP BOARD OF DIRECTORS. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION.)\n\nDisclose that a result of sponsor retaining more than 49 percent of the\nunits, marketability of the units may be adversely affected. Explain that certain institutional lenders may be unwilling to make loans for the\npurchase of units in a cooperative in which the sponsor and/or holders of unsold shares retain more than 49 percent of the units and that purchasers\nmay therefore be unable to obtain institutional financing for their own purchase. Disclose that if they do close title and subsequently seek to sell\ntheir apartments, prospective purchasers may be unable to obtain institutional financing solely on the basis of sponsor's holding more than 49\npercent of the units in the cooperative corporations, regardless of the credit worthiness of the prospective purchaser. If the sponsor is able to\ndemonstrate that an institutional lender has approved the project for coop loans to qualified purchasers, a disclosure identifying the lender, the\nterms of the loans to be offered, eligibility criteria and other material aspects of the lender's commitment to the project should be\nincluded. (2)\n\nIf sponsor represents that it will sell 51 percent of the units as they become\nvacant, to purchasers for personal occupancy, disclose whether sponsor further represents that it will endeavor in good faith to sell, in a\nreasonably timely manner, all remaining unsold units as they become vacant, to purchasers for personal occupancy, in the building or buildings being\nconverted to cooperative ownership. If sponsor intends to sell fewer than all of the units, disclose this fact and the number and percentage which\nsponsor does intent to sell, in bold print as the first special risk. Disclose that the units reserved by sponsor may remain unsold indefinitely and\nsponsor may dispose of such units as it chooses, including selling to investors, renting to tenants, permitting occupancy by relatives or others, allowing them to remain vacant or selling to purchasers for personal occupancy. If the sponsor later chooses to sell a greater number and percentage\nof units to the public for personal occupancy than disclosed in the initial offering plan, the plan must be amended to disclose that fact. If sponsor makes a bulk sale of all or some of its unsold shares, the\ntransferee is bound by sponsor's representation regarding its commitment to sell units as they become vacant. (3)\n\nIf the bylaws of the cooperative do not include a provision that after the initial sponsor control period, a\nmajority of the Board of Directors must be owner-occupants or members of owner-occupant's households who are unrelated are unrelated to the sponsor\nand its principals, this fact must be disclosed as a special risk and the following warning must be placed on the cover: THIS PLAN DOES NOT GUARANTEE THAT OWNER-OCCUPANTS WILL EVER\nCONSTITUTE A MAJORITY OF THE COOP BOARD OF DIRECTORS. (SEE SPECIAL RISKS SECTION OF PLAN.)\n\nDisclose that unless and until a majority of the Board are residents of\nthe building unrelated to the sponsor, owner-occupants will not gain effective control and management of the cooperative. Disclose that\nowner-occupants and non-resident shareholders, including sponsor, may have inherent conflicts on how the cooperative should be managed because of\ntheir different reasons for purchasing, i.e. purchase as a home as opposed to as an investment. (d) If the offering plan is submitted to the Department of Law on or after September 1, 2016 subject to G.B.L. section 352-eee, and the sponsor executed a contract of sale for the building or group of buildings or acquired the building or group of buildings on\nor after September 1, 2016, include the eligible senior citizen and eligible disabled person election forms promulgated by the Department of Law, forms SH-5 and SH-2, respectively. If the offering plan is submitted to the Department of Law on or after September 1, 2016 subject to G.B.L. section\n352-e(2-a) or 352-eeee, and the sponsor executed a contract of sale for the building or group of buildings or acquired the building or group of\nbuildings on or after September 1, 2016, include the eligible senior citizen and eligible disabled person election forms promulgated by the\n\nDepartment of Law, forms SH-1 and SH-2, respectively. (e) Introduction. The introduction must: (1)\n\nExplain that the purpose of the offering plan is to set forth all the material terms of the offer. Explain that the plan may be amended from time to\ntime when an amendment is filed with the New York State Department of Law. State that amendments will be served on all offerees, as defined in\nsection\n18.1\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nIdentify the sponsor, state when the sponsor acquired the property or sponsor's interest as a\ncontract vendee. (3)\n\nDisclose sponsor's intent with regard to the sale of apartments offered in the plan. Disclose whether sponsor represents that it will endeavor in good faith to sell, in a reasonably timely manner, all residential units as they become\nvacant, to purchasers for personal occupancy in the building or buildings being converted to cooperative ownership. If sponsor represents an intent\nto sell fewer than all of the units in the building or buildings being converted to cooperative ownership, disclose the number and percentage with\nsponsor does intend to sell. Disclose whether sponsor represents that it will decline to rent apartments, as they become vacant, until has sold at\nleast 51 percent of the units to purchasers for personal occupancy. If sponsor reserves the right to rent rather than sell after reaching the 51\npercent sales level, disclose whether sponsor is limiting its right to rent rather than sell based on objective articulable criteria, such as a\nsignificant decline in market prices of a specific percentage and the condition upon which sponsor would resume sales. If sponsor does not represent\nits good faith intent to sell and to obtain sales of 51 percent of the units prior to renting, include on the cover of the plan the warning set forth\nin paragraph (c)(1) of this section and discuss as a special risk. (4)\n\nDescribe the interest that the\napartment corporation is to acquire in the land and building. (5)\n\nSummarize the number of shares and\nunits being offered in this offering plan, whether the units are residential or otherwise, any parking or recreational facilities, and refer to\n\nSchedule A for prices. Identify any units or property interests that are not being offered, such as commercial space, the superintendent's apartment\nand common areas. If applicable, note any air rights or transferable development rights benefitting or encumbering the property. (6)\n\nOutline the basic aspects of cooperative ownership, including the following: (i) if applicable, the apartment corporation will purchase the property at the closing and will sell shares to\npurchasers to raise funds; (ii)\nthe apartment corporation, as the fee owner of the entire building, is\nassessed for the real estate taxes on the property and may be the mortgagor encumbering the entire property. As a result, shareholders are\nco-dependent on each other and on the sponsor for payment of the mortgage and taxes, default on which will jeopardize each shareholder's equity in\nhis/her shares and unit. Where the sponsor owns a substantial percentage of the units, a default in payment of maintenance by sponsor jeopardizes the\nequity interest of other shareholders; (iii)\neach shareholder will enter into a proprietary\nlease; (iv)\neach shareholder will have the right to vote for members of the board of directors; (v) the conduct of the affairs of the apartment corporation will be in the hands of the board of directors; disclose whether sponsor represents, and provides in the bylaws, that a majority of the apartment corporation board must be owner-occupants of the\nbuilding or members of an owner-occupant's household, who are unrelated to the sponsor or its principals, after the end of the sponsor control\nperiod. If sponsor does not make this representation, include the warning set forth in paragraph (c)(3) of this section and discuss as a special\nrisk; (vi)\neach shareholder will be responsible for the payment of maintenance charges and any\nassessments; (vii)\ndiscuss the transitional phase of the conversion process from rental building to\nowner-occupied cooperative. Disclose that because the plan can be declared effective based on sales of 15 percent of the units to tenants or bona\nfide purchasers for their own occupancy, purchasers may be living a mixed rental/owner-occupied building for an indeterminate period of time, and\nthat purchasers' units may not be marketable and owner-occupants may not control the board or operation of the property during such transition. Further discuss how the existence of rent regulated, non purchasing, tenants, who have a right to continued occupancy, may affect the speed of the\nconversion process. Discuss other aspects of living in a mixed rental/owner-occupied building, including different interests of owners and renters\nand the consequences of sponsor's continuing role in the building. From time to time the Department of Law may promulgate model forms for\nthe description of the basic aspects involved in a cooperative conversion for a non-eviction plan under various laws. The transmittal letter from the\nattorney who prepared the plan shall note if the applicable model forms are used. (7)\n\nIf applicable, state the number of apartments subject to each applicable rent regulatory law. (8)\n\nRefer\nto Schedule A for price information. State the length of any exclusive period(s), that there will be no increase in prices during the exclusive\nperiod for tenant purchasers, and that sponsor will not accept subscriptions from non-tenant purchasers for occupied units during any exclusive\nperiod. (9)\n\nState whether any non-purchasing tenant may be evicted by application of the provisions of\nG.B.L., section 352-eee or section 352-eeee, rent regulatory laws, or after expiration of a lease term. Refer to the sections of the plan that\nexplains the rights of purchasing and non- purchasing tenants. Do not characterize the plan as a \"non-eviction\" plan if non-purchasing tenants are\nentitled to remain only for the balance of a lease term. State whether non-purchasing tenants will remain subject to a rent regulatory law only\nduring the term of tax exemption or abatement benefits. (10)\n\nState that the prices are not subject to\napproval by the Department of Law or any other government agency. (11)\n\nState that the plan delivered to\ntenants and prospective purchasers contains all the detailed terms of the transaction. State that copies of the plan, all documents referred to in\nthe plan and all exhibits submitted to the Department of Law in connection with the filing of the plan will be available for inspection without\ncharge, and for copying at a reasonable charge, to prospective purchasers and their attorneys at the office of the selling agent or\nsponsor. (12)\n\nState any lawful limitations on who may purchase units. (13)\n\nInclude the following paragraph printed in boldface roman type at least as large as eight-point modern type\nand at least two points leaded: THE PURCHASE OF A COOPERATIVE APARTMENT HAS MANY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL\nAND FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL STRONGLY URGES YOU TO READ THIS OFFERING PLAN CAREFULLY AND TO CONSULT WITH AN ATTORNEY BEFORE\nSIGNING A SUBSCRIPTION (OR PURCHASE) AGREEMENT. (f) Purchase prices and\nshare allocation (Schedule A). (1)\n\nSchedule A must appear on a separate page entitled \"Schedule A\" and list\nthe following information for each apartment in columnar form. Column headings may be shortened and abbreviated. Indicate that all projected charges\nare for a stated 12-month period, e.g., January 1, 20__ to December 31, 20__. Totals must be given for subparagraphs (iv)-(viii) of\nthis paragraph: (i) unit identification; (ii)\nrent regulatory status of\neach unit, and which unit(s) is (are) vacant; (iii)\nnumber of rooms (or usable space in square feet) and\nbathrooms; (iv)\nshare allocation; (v) cash purchase price for\neach class of purchasers; (vi)\napproximate amount of mortgage applicable to a block of shares (if\napplicable); (vii)\nprojected maintenance charges for the first year of operation at $__ per share (annual\nand monthly); (viii)\nprojected annual income tax deduction at $__ per share for the first year of\noperation (if applicable). (2)\n\nShares must be allocated in whole shares. (3)\n\nDetailed footnotes must support and explain the information in Schedule A. These footnotes must include, but\nare not limited to the following: (i) For the number of rooms, state the method of calculating the number of rooms\nin each unit. If rooms are calculated in accordance with an industry standard, it is sufficient to refer to the industry standard employed. (ii)\n\nFor the share allocation, explain the basis for the allocation of shares in the particular building. (iii)\n\nFor the cash purchase price, explain any differences in prices to classes of purchasers. Prior to the filing\nof an effectiveness amendment, plans subject to G.B.L. section 352-eee or section 352-eeee may not contain different prices for different classes of\ntenants in occupancy on the filing date. Refer to the portion of the plan that explains price changes. If applicable, state that prices are\nnegotiable. (iv)\n\nFor the cash purchase price, refer to the portion of the plan that explains any closing\ncosts that a purchaser may have to pay. (v) For the approximate amount of mortgage(s) applicable to\nshares, explain that although shareholders will not be personally liable to pay the mortgage(s), the apartment corporation will be responsible, shareholders' maintenance charges include amounts to pay debt service, and a failure of a certain number of tenants to make the maintenance payments\nmay result in a foreclosure and the loss of each individual's equity in his or her apartment. If any mortgage encumbers the property and will\nencumber the property after the closing, explain that the approximate amount of the mortgage applicable to shares is based on the assumption that a\nclosing will occur on a specified date. (vi)\n\nFor the projected maintenance charges, disclose that if the\npurchaser obtains financing, the purchaser's debt service will be an additional expense. Disclose that projected maintenance charges do not include\ncertain costs for which the shareholder is responsible, such as (where applicable) repairs to the interior of the unit, separately metered gas, electricity, hot water, heat, air conditioning and cable television service. If shareholders individually pay for heat and hot water costs, or for\ncosts usually paid by a cooperative apartment corporation, refer to Schedule B-1 for individual maintenance costs; see subdivision (g)(4) of this\nsection. (vii)\n\nState the aggregate of the monthly rents currently payable from tenants of all occupied\nunits, or a reasonable approximation thereof. (viii)\n\nFor the projected income tax deduction, explain that\nthe projected tax deduction may vary in future years (where applicable) due to changes in the mortgage principle balance or in the interest rate on\nthe existing mortgage (if any) or on a refinanced mortgage, or from changes in the allocation of constant debt service payments between interest and\nprinciple, or due to the allocation of constant debt service payments to interest and principal, or due to changes in real property taxes resulting\nfrom the expiration of real estate tax benefits, or from changes in the assessed value, the tax rate or the method of assessing real property. Explain that the projected tax deductions do not include interest paid by purchasers who finance the purchase of their units, which may also be\ndeductible. (ix)\n\nIf the initial interest rate on any mortgage that will encumber the property after\nclosing will be the rate prevailing at closing, state the predicted rate on which the projected maintenance charges and projected income tax\ndeductions are based, that the actual rate at the time of closing may be higher or lower, and that the sponsor will amend the plan, as required by\nlaw, to disclose the rate prevailing at the closing. (g) Budget for first\nyear of cooperative operation (Schedule B). The plan must describe all projected income and expenses for the first\nyear of cooperative operation in Schedule B. (1)\n\nThe budget must be based upon a specified 12-month period, to commence on the date when it can reasonably be projected that cooperative operations will begin. When calculating the projection, include the\nexpiration of any exclusive period and sufficient time to arrange for the closing. If the actual or anticipated date of commencement of cooperative\noperation is to be delayed from the budget year projected in the offering plan, the plan must be amended to include a revised budget disclosing\ncurrent projections. If such amended projections exceed the original projections by 25 percent or more, the sponsor must offer all purchasers the\nright to rescind and a reasonable period of time that is not less than 15 days after the date of presentation to exercise the right, whether or not\nsponsor offers to guarantee the previous budget projection. Sponsor must return any deposit or downpayment promptly to subscribers who\nrescind. (2)\n\nThe budget for the cooperative must be in the following format. Headings marked with an\nasterisk may be omitted if not applicable to the offering. Additional income, expenses or cost items unique to a building should be added whenever\nappropriate to reflect additional sources of income, expenses, cost or unique circumstances.

The footnotes must set forth the basis or assumptions for each projection. (i) Commercial income. Briefly describe any contracts or leases, other than proprietary leases, that will provide\nincome to the apartment corporation. State whether the apartment corporation is required to provide heat, water, electricity, gas or insurance, and\ndescribe any other specific additional costs under the contract or lease. State the name and business address of each contractor, or lessee, the\nannual income and the expiration of the contract or lease. If applicable, state whether sponsor may rent vacant, nonresidential space, or extend the\nterm of existing leases. State whether the rent to be collected could be less than the rent set forth in Schedule B for the space. Sponsor must amend\nthe plan if any new lease or extension of an existing lease is for a term in excess of two years. (ii)\n\nLabor costs. State the number of full and part-time existing staff, the number of full and part-time staff projected for the cooperative in Schedule\nB, and whether the staff will be union members. If the budget reflects a reduction in the existing staff, disclose what effect this will have on the\nexisting level of services. The labor budget must include benefits required by Federal, State or local law or required by contract such as workers'\ncompensation, disability insurance, welfare and pension contributions by employers, unemployment insurance and payroll taxes. Specify the wages and\nthe cost of each applicable benefit. The budget must reflect current wage rates and reasonably anticipated increases or increases mandated by\ncontract. If applicable, state the expiration dates of all union contracts. If there is nonunion labor in the building, discuss whether their wages\nmeet State minimum wage laws. (iii)\n\nHeating, cooling and hot water costs. State the type and quantity of\nenergy projected to be used during the year and the projected total cost per gallon or other pricing unit, inclusive of sales tax, for all energy\ncosts for providing heat, air conditioning and hot water for the building. State the basis for projecting the quantity of energy to be used. Unless\nit would be misleading for a particular building, base the projected quantity of energy on the average quantity of energy purchased for the prior\nthree years. State the quantity of energy purchased in each of the three prior years, the average cost per gallon or other pricing unit and the total\ncost per year. The Department of Law may, from time to time, issue pricing guidelines to reflect minimum fuel costs. (iv)\n\nUtilities (electricity and gas). State the basis for the projected consumption and projected unit cost for\nutilities. Unit cost should be based on the current tariff plus a reasonably anticipated increase which should be set forth, e.g., estimate based on current tariff plus a 10-percent increase. Unless it would be misleading for a particular building, base the projected quantity of\nthe utilities on the average quantity of the utilities purchased for the prior three years. (v) Water\ncharges and sewer rents. State the present rents and charges and base the projection on reasonably anticipated increases for the first year of\ncooperative operation. If the water charges or sewer rents are metered charges, state the consumption for the prior three years. (vi)\n\nRepairs, maintenance and supplies. Describe the material components of the expense for repairs and\nmaintenance, such as interior repairs, roofing, exterior repairs (including walls, foundations, windows, doors and locks), heating system (fuel\nburner, boiler, pipes, radiators), plumbing, electrical work, exterminating, grounds maintenance (snow removal, gardening and landscaping, where\napplicable), janitor supplies, painting of common areas and such building services and maintenance items not included under service contracts or\nother expenses. (vii)\n\nService contracts. State the name of the contractor, the service, the annual cost\nand the expiration of the contract. Highlight as a special risk any contract with an expiration date more than five years after the anticipated\nclosing date, unless it is customary in the area to enter a long-term contract for the service rendered (\ne.g., cable TV\ncontract). (viii)\n\nInsurance. The budget for insurance must provide, and the apartment corporation must\nhave, at closing, fire and casualty insurance under an agreed amount replacement cost policy or under a policy including at least an 80 percent\ncoinsurance provision so that the insured shall not be a coinsurer. Discuss the adequacy of the insurance to replace the building in the event of\ntotal loss and to avoid being a coinsurer in the event of partial loss. Disclose the items covered, the coverage amount limits, the deductibles and\nthe exposures insured against.

(vii)\n\nEscrow revisions. Before funds are transferred to any new escrow\naccount, or if the escrow agent is replaced, the plan must be amended to provide the same full disclosure with respect to any new account, the escrow\nagent and the escrow agreement as was originally provided. A bond, letter of credit or other security may not be substituted for any escrow account, unless a special exemption under exceptional circumstances is first requested by the sponsor and is granted by the Attorney General, following the\nprocedures of section\n21.3\n(l)(4)\nof this Title. In such event, and only after the Department of Law grants\nsuch exemption in writing, the provisions of section\n21.3\n(l)(5), (6) and (7)\nof this Title are applicable. (viii)\n\nRelease of funds. The escrow agreement and the plan must set forth the requirements and procedures for the\nrelease of the escrowed funds. These shall include: (a) Under no circumstances shall sponsor seek release of the\nescrowed funds of a defaulting purchaser until after consummation of the plan. Consummation of the plan does not relieve the sponsor of its\nobligations pursuant to GBL section 352-h. (b) The escrow agent shall release the funds in escrow if so\ndirected: (1)\npursuant to terms and conditions set forth in the escrow agreement upon closing of the individual\ntransaction; or\n(2)\nin a subsequent writing signed by both sponsor and purchaser; or\n(3)\nby a final, non-appealable order or judgment of a court; or\n(4)\nby\na final, non-reviewable determination of the Attorney General pursuant to subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph, so long as the subscription or\npurchase agreement provides for dispute resolution by the Attorney General and was signed on or before March 1, 2013.

If the escrow agent has not received notice of objection to the release of the funds at the expiration of the 30\nday period, the funds shall be released and the escrow agent shall provide further written notice to both parties informing them of such release. If\nthe escrow agent receives a written notice from either party objecting to the release of the escrowed funds within said 30-day period, the escrow\nagent shall continue to hold said funds until otherwise directed pursuant to clause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. However, the escrow\nagent shall also have the right at any time to deposit the funds contained in the escrow account with the clerk of a court in the county in which the\ninterest offered pursuant to the plan is located and shall give written notice to both parties of such deposit. (d) The sponsor shall not object to the release of the escrowed funds to: (1)\na\npurchaser who timely rescinds in accordance with an offer of rescission contained in the plan or an amendment to the plan; or\n(2)\nall purchasers after an amendment abandoning the plan is accepted for filing by the Department of\n\nLaw. (ix)\n\nDisputes. (a) In the event of a dispute\narising in connection with a subscription or purchase agreement providing for dispute resolution by the Attorney General that was signed on or before\n\nMarch 1, 2013, the sponsor shall apply and the purchaser or the escrow agent holding the down payments in escrow may apply to the Attorney General\nfor a determination on the disposition of the deposit and any interest earned thereon. Forms for this purpose will be available from the Department\nof Law. The party making such application shall contemporaneously send to all other parties a copy of such application. (b) Pending the determination of the Attorney General to grant or deny the application, the sponsor, the purchaser\nand the escrow agent shall abide by any interim directive issued by the Attorney General. (c) If the\napplication permitting release of funds is granted, the deposit and any interest earned thereon shall be disposed of in accordance with a final, non-reviewable determination of the Attorney General.

(e) If the application seeking release of\nfunds is denied, the escrow agent shall continue to hold the deposit and any interest earned thereon until: (1)\nboth\nthe sponsor and purchaser direct payment to a specified party in accordance with a written direction signed by both the sponsor and purchaser; or\n(2)\na final, non-appeable order judgment of a court is served on the escrow agent; or\n(3)\nthe escrow agent deposits the disputed amount into court.

The provisions of this section of the regulations shall prevail over any conflicting or\ninconsistent provision in the plan or in the escrow agreement or subscription or purchase agreement. (xiv)\n\nTrust obligation of sponsor. Nothing herein contained shall diminish or impair the sponsor's statutory\nobligation to each purchaser or subscriber pursuant to GBL section 352-h to hold in trust all deposits, advances or payments made in connection with\nthe offer until consummation of the transaction with such purchaser or subscriber. Consummation of the plan does not relieve sponsor of its\nobligations pursuant to GBL section 352-h. Funds from any escrow account remain the property of the purchaser until employed in connection with the\nconsummation of the transaction. Such funds shall not be part of the estate of the sponsor or the escrow agent upon any bankruptcy, incapacity or\ndeath. (xv)\n\nTransition.
