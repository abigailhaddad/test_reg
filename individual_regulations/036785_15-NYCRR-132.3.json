  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 132.3 - Hearings\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe sole purpose of a hearing scheduled pursuant to this\n\nPart is to determine whether there exist unusual, extenuating and compelling\ncircumstances to warrant a finding that the revocation proposed by the\ncommissioner should not take effect. In making such a determination, the\nadministrative law judge shall take into account a driver's entire driving\nrecord. Unless the administrative law judge finds that such unusual, extenuating and compelling circumstances exist, the judge shall issue an order\nconfirming the revocation proposed by the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n132.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
