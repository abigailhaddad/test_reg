  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 118.2 - Modification for difference in exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 618(1)\n\nEvery estate or trust is allowed a New York personal\nexemption of $600 regardless of the amount of its Federal deduction for a\npersonal exemption. This amount is allowed even though the particular New York\n\nState fiduciary return file may be for a taxable period of less than 12 months. For Federal income tax purposes, the deduction for a personal exemption\nallowable to an estate is also $600, so that, in the case of an estate, the\nmodification of Federal taxable income does not affect the final result. In the\ncase of trusts, however, the Federal deduction for a personal exemption may be\neither $100 or $300, depending on the provisions of the particular trust\ninstrument. Therefore, in the case of a trust, Federal taxable income must be\nmodified for this difference between the Federal deduction for a personal\nexemption and the New York personal exemption. This modification is made by\nadding to Federal taxable income the Federal deduction for a personal exemption\nof the trust ($100 or $300, as the case may be), and then subtracting the New\n\nYork personal exemption of $600. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n118.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
