Tit. 10 § 151.3 - Village of saugerties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71, 72 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law) as heretofore set forth shall apply to all natural and artificial reservoirs on the Plattekill Creek and all watercourses tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into said reservoirs, those bodies of water being sources of the public water supply of the village of Saugerties, Ulster County, New York. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to all storage and impounding reservoirs on Plattekill Creek which are tributary to or which serve as sources of this public water supply or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel of every kind, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the water supply of the village of Saugerties. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n(i) No privy, privy vault, pit or receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 75 feet of any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Saugerties, except the properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter set forth in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d), provided, however, that the property on which the privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle intended for the deposit of human excreta is built or to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (ii)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle used or intended for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta and built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance named in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph cannot be obtained within the limits of such property shall be placed as far as possible from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Saugerties and especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight vessels or receptacles are provided, they shall be placed in watertight concrete or masonry receptacles and shall be located as far as practicable from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Saugerties. All receptacles referred to in this subparagarph shall be constructed only with the approval of and under the supervision of the board of water commissioners of the village of Saugerties and so located that the tops of such receptacles shall be above the highest known water level of the reservoirs or tributary watercourses. (iii)\n\nWhenever a privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or permanent deposit of human excreta is especially constructed and made watertight and located nearer any reservoir or tributary watercourse than the distance named in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, such receptacle shall be emptied at regular intervals and disinfected as often as may be necessary to maintain them in a proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow and in the case of the properties occupied by the owners during the summer, the said receptacles shall be emptied at least once every fall at the end of the summer season, disinfected with lime and left empty during the winter. The work of emptying and disinfecting these receptacles shall be done under the supervision of or in accordance with direction of the board of water commissioners of the village of Saugerties and in such a manner as to effectually prevent any pollution of the public water supply of the village of Saugerties. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any reservoir or any watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Saugerties. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle or place, used for the temporary storage of human excreta which is constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, from which privy or other receptacle the excreta are not at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, shall be arranged in such manner that all such excreta shall be received temporarily in suitable vessels or receptacles which shall be at all times maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and which will permit of convenient removal to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid temporary receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundations or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Department of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid temporary receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth of not less than 18 inches below the surface and at a distance not less than 300 feet from any reservoir or watercourse tributary to the public water supply of the village of Saugerties. (6)\n\nWhenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacles or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacles for excreta or the trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
