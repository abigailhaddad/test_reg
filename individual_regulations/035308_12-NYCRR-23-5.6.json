  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 23-5.6 - Pole scaffolds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Poles. The foot end of any pole used in a pole scaffold shall\nrest on firm footing and shall be secured against lateral movement by nailing, the use of cleats or by any other effective means. Where wood poles are\nspliced, the ends shall be square and the upper sections shall rest squarely on\nthe lower sections. Wood splicing pieces shall be provided on at least two\nadjacent sides and shall be not less than three feet in length. They shall\noverlap the abutting ends by an equal distance and shall have a combined\ncross-sectional area of not less than 50 percent of the cross-sectional area of\nthe pole. (b) Putlogs. Every wood putlog shall be reinforced with a substantial\nsteel strip secured to the lower edge of the putlog throughout the entire\nlength of such putlog. (c) Bracing. Every pole scaffold shall be braced or attached to the\nbuilding or other structure to prevent movement of the scaffold away from such\nbuilding or other structure. Diagonal bracing shall be provided to prevent the\npoles from moving in a direction parallel to the wall of the building or other\nstructure. Diagonal bracing shall be so installed that every spliced section of\nevery pole is connected with the adjacent poles. (d) Connections. (1)\n\nThe ends of all horizontal wood\nsupporting members and of all braces shall overlap the nail fastenings a\nsufficient amount to prevent the ends of such members from splitting. (2)\n\nWhere bearers rest on a wall of a\nbuilding or other structure, the length of the bearing surfaces on such wall\nshall be at least four inches. Such bearers shall rest on firm and level\nsurfaces. (3)\n\nWhere ledgers lap\neach other, bearing blocks or other effective means attached to the poles shall\nbe provided to support such ledgers. Ledgers shall not be spliced between\npoles, but shall be continuous from pole to pole. (e) Planking. Where planking is lapped on a pole scaffold, each plank\nshall lap its end supports at least 12 inches. Where the ends of planks on a\npole scaffold abut each other to form a flush floor the butt joints shall be at\nthe center lines of the poles. The abutted ends shall rest on separate bearers. Intermediate beams shall be provided where necessary to prevent the dislodgment\nof planks because of deflection and the ends of the planks shall be secured to\nprevent their dislodgment. (f) Pole scaffold erection and\nremoval. When a new working level is desired, the existing\nplatform shall be left undisturbed until the new working level is framed. As\nthe scaffold is abandoned with the progress of the work, all supporting members\nshall be left intact. When a pole scaffold is dismantled the sequence of the\nremoval of members shall be in reverse of that used in the erection of such\nscaffold. (g) Specification requirements for pole scaffolds. Any wood pole scaffold over 80 feet in height above the\nground, grade or equivalent surface shall be designed by a professional\nengineer licensed to practice in the State of New York and shall be constructed\nand maintained in accordance with such design. A copy of the drawings and\nspecifications for such scaffold shall be kept at the job site available for\nexamination by the commissioner. The wood of any such scaffold shall be treated\nto make it incombustible as defined in Industrial Code Part (rule) 7. Wood pole\nscaffolds 80 feet or less in height above the ground, grade or equivalent\nsurface shall be constructed in conformity with Tables V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, and X of this Subpart.
