  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.27 - Blowoff piping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\nA blowoff as required herein is defined\nas a pipe connection provided with valves through which the water in the boiler\nmay be blown out under pressure, excepting drains such as are used on water\ncolumns, gage glasses, or piping to feedwater regulators, etc., used for the\npurpose of determining the operating condition of such equipment. Piping\nconnections used primarily for continuous operation, such as deconcentrators on\ncontinuous blowdown systems, are not classed as blowoffs but the pipe\nconnections and all fittings up to and including the first shutoff valve shall\nbe equal at least to the pressure requirements for the lowest set pressure of\nany safety valve on the boiler drum and with the corresponding saturated steam\ntemperature. (2)\nA surface blowoff\nshall not exceed 21/2 inch pipe size, and the internal and external pipes, when\nused, shall form a continuous passage, but with clearance between their ends\nand arranged so that the removal of either will not disturb the other. A\nproperly designed steel bushing, similar to or the equivalent of those shown in\n\nFigure P-42, or a flanged connection shall be used. Image\n(3)\n\nBlowoff piping shall conform to the\nrequirements of ASME, except that galvanized wrought iron or steel, brass or\ncopper pipe shall not be used. (b) (1)\n\nEach boiler except forced-flow steam generators with no fixed steam 2nd water\nline and high-temperature water boilers shall have a bottom blowoff outlet in\ndirect connection with the lowest water space practicable for external piping\nconforming to ASME. (2)\n\nExcept as\npermitted for miniature boilers, the minimum size of pipe and fittings shall be\none inch, and the maximum size shall be 21/2 inches, except that for boilers\nwith 100 square feet of heating surface or less, the minimum size of pipe and\nfittings may be 3/4 inch. (3)\n\nStraight-run globe valves of the ordinary type as shown in Figure P-43(a), or\nvalves of such type that dams or pockets can exist for the collection of\nsediment, shall not be used on such connections. (4)\n\nStraightway \"Y\" type globe valves as\nshown in Figure P-43(b), or angle valves, may be used in vertical pipes, or\nthey may be used in horizontal runs of piping provided they are so constructed\nor installed that the lowest edge of the opening through the seat shall be at\nleast 25 percent of the inside diameter below the center line of the\nvalve. (5)\n\nCondensate return\nconnections of the same size or larger than the size herein specified may be\nused, and the blowoff may be connected to them. In such case the blowoff must\nnot be so located that the connection may be completely drained. (6)\n\nAll integral economizers, water walls, or\nwater screens forming parts of a steam boiler shall be equipped with drain or\nblowoff valves conforming to the requirements of this subdivision and\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of section 14- 9.29 of this Subpart for boilers.

Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
