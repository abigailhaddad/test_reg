  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.60 - Tax assessment review proceedings in counties within the City of New York; special rules\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. This section shall\napply to every tax assessment review proceeding brought pursuant to title 1 of\narticle 7 of the real Property Tax Law in a county within the City of New\n\nYork. (b) Preliminary\nconference. (1)\n\nAny party to a\ntax assessment review proceeding may demand, by application served on all other\nparties and filed with the court, together with proof of such service, a\npreliminary conference, or the court on its own motion may direct a preliminary\nconference. The court, in its notice to the parties setting the date for the\nconference, shall direct the petitioner to serve upon the respondent by a date\ncertain before the date of the conference, the completed statement of income\nand expenses required by this section, together with any ancillary papers or\ndocuments that may be necessary. No note of issue may be filed until a\npreliminary conference has been held. (2)\n\nThe judge presiding at the\npreliminary conference shall take whatever action is warranted to expedite\nfinal disposition of the case, including but not limited to: (i) directing any party to\nutilize or comply by a date certain with any pretrial disclosure or bill of\nparticulars procedure authorized by the Civil Practice Law and Rules; (ii)\ndirecting the parties to\nobtain appraisals and sales reports, and to exchange and file appraisal reports\nand sales reports by dates certain before the trial; (iii)\ndirecting the filing of a\nnote of issue and certificate of readiness; (iv)\nfixing a date for trial, or by which\nthe parties must be ready for trial; (v) signing any order required; (vi)\nconducting conferences for\nthe purpose of facilitating settlement; and\n(vii)\nlimiting issues and recording\nstipulations of counsel. (3)\n\nFailure to comply with any order or\ndirective of the court authorized by this subdivision shall be subject to\nappropriate sanctions. (4)\n\nWhere parties are represented by\ncounsel, only attorneys fully familiar with the action and authorized to make\nbinding stipulations or commitments, or accompanied by a person empowered to\nact on behalf of the party represented, shall appear at the\nconference. (c) Statement of income and expenses. Before the note of issue and certificate of readiness may be filed, the\npetitioner shall have served on the respondent, in triplicate, a statement that\nthe property is not income-producing or a copy of a verified or certified\nstatement of the income and expenses of the property for each tax year under\nreview. If the property is income-producing, the petitioner must serve the\nstatement of income and expenses on forms provided by the Tax Certiorari\n\nDivision of the Office of the Corporation Counsel of the City of New York. The\npetitioner shall complete all items listed on such form. A copy of such\ncompleted form shall also be filed with the note of issue and certificate of\nreadiness. For the purposes of this section, a cooperative or condominium\napartment building shall be considered income-producing property; an\nowner-occupied business property shall be considered income-producing as\ndetermined by the amount reasonably allocable for rent, but the petitioner is\nnot required to make an estimate of rental income. (d) Audit. Within 60 days after\nthe first preliminary conference, the respondent, for the purpose of\nsubstantiating petitioner's completed statement of income and expenses, as\nrequired by subdivision (c) of this section, may request in writing an audit of\nthe petitioner's books and records for the tax years under review. If\nrequested, the audit must be completed within 120 days after the request has\nbeen made unless the court, upon good cause shown, extends the time for the\naudit. Failure of the respondent to request or complete the audit within the\ntime limits shall be deemed a waiver of such privilege. If an audit is\nrequested and the petitioner fails to furnish its books and records within a\nreasonable time after receipt of the request, or otherwise unreasonably impedes\nor delays the audit, the court, on motion of the respondent, may dismiss the\npetition or petitions or make such other order as the interest of justice\nrequires. (e) Filing\nnote of issue and certificate of readiness; additional requirements. (1)\nA note of issue and\ncertificate of readiness shall not be filed unless all disclosure proceedings\nhave been completed and the statement of income and expenses has been served\nand filed. A note of issue and certificate of readiness may not be filed in any\naction where a preliminary conference was requested or was directed by the\ncourt until the conference has been held and there has been compliance with any\norders or directives of the court or stipulations of counsel made at such\nconference. (2)\nA\nseparate note of issue shall be filed for each property for each tax\nyear. (f) Consolidation or joint trial. Consolidation or joint trial of real property tax\nassessment review proceedings in the discretion of the court shall be\nconditioned upon service having been made of the verified or certified income\nand expense statement, or a statement that the property is not\nincome-producing, for each of the tax years under review. (g) Exchange and filing of\nappraisal reports. (1)\n\nUpon the\nfiling of the note of issue and certificate of readiness, the court, if it has\nnot previously so directed, shall direct that appraisal reports and sales\nreports be obtained and that appraisal reports and sales reports be exchanged\nand filed by a date certain a specified time before the date scheduled for\ntrial. (2)\n\nThe\nexchange and filing of appraisal reports shall be accomplished by the following\nprocedure: (i) the respective\nparties shall file with the clerk of the trial court one copy, or in the event\nthat there are two or more adversaries, a copy for each adversary, of all\nappraisal reports intended to be used at the trial. (ii)\n\nWhen the clerk shall have\nreceived all such reports, the clerk forthwith shall distribute simultaneously\nto each of the other parties a copy of the reports filed. (iii)\n\nWhere multiple parties or\nmore than one parcel is involved, each appraisal report need be served only\nupon the taxing authority and the party or parties contesting the value of the\nproperty which is the subject of the report. Each party shall provide an\nappraisal report copy for the court. (3)\n\nThe appraisal reports shall contain a\nstatement of the method of appraisal relied on and the conclusions as to value\nreached by the expert, together with the facts, figures and calculations by\nwhich the conclusions were reached. If sales, leases or other transactions\ninvolving comparable properties are to be relied on, they shall be set forth\nwith sufficient particularity as to permit the transaction to be readily\nidentified, and the report shall contain a clear and concise statement of every\nfact that a party will seek to prove in relation to those comparable\nproperties. The appraisal reports also shall contain photographs of the\nproperty under review and of any comparable property that specifically is\nrelied upon by the appraiser, unless the court otherwise directs. (4)\n\nWhere an appraiser appraises\nmore than one parcel in any proceeding, those parts of the separate appraisal\nreports for each parcel that would be repetitious may be included in one\ngeneral appraisal report to which reference may be made in the separate\nappraisal reports. Such general appraisal reports shall be served and filed as\nprovided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (5)\n\nAppraisal reports shall comply with\nany official form for appraisal reports that may be prescribed by the Chief\n\nAdministrator of the Courts. (h) Use of appraisal reports at trial. Upon the trial, expert witnesses shall be limited in their proof of appraised\nvalue to details set forth in their respective appraisal reports. Any party who\nfails to serve an appraisal report as required by this section shall be\nprecluded from offering any expert testimony on value; provided, however, upon\nthe application of any party on such notice as the court shall direct, the\ncourt may, upon good cause shown, relieve a party of a default in the service\nof a report, extend the time for exchanging reports, or allow an amended or\nsupplemental report to be served upon such conditions as the court may direct. After the trial of the issues has begun, any such application must be made to\nthe trial judge and shall be entertained only in unusual and extraordinary\ncircumstances. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
