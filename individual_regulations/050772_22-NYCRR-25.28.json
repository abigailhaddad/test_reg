  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.28 - Resignations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Resignation in writing. Except as otherwise provided in this section, every\nresignation shall be in writing. (b) Effective date. If no effective date\nis specified in a resignation, it shall take effect upon delivery to or filing\nin the office of the appointing authority. If an effective date is specified in\na resignation, it shall take effect on such specified date. However, if a\nresignation is submitted while the employee is on leave of absence without pay, such resignation, for the purpose of determining eligibility for reinstatement, shall be deemed to be effective as of the date of the commencement of such\nabsence. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, when charges of\nincompetency or misconduct have been or are about to be filed against an\nemployee, the appointing authority may elect to disregard a resignation filed\nby such employee and to prosecute such charges; and, in the event that such\nemployee is found guilty of such charges and dismissed from the service, his or\nher termination shall be recorded as a dismissal rather than as a\nresignation. (c) Withdrawal or amendment. A resignation may not be withdrawn, cancelled or\namended after it is delivered to the appointing authority, without the consent\nof the appointing authority. (d) Reinstatement following resignation. (1)\nA permanent employee who\nhas resigned from his or her position may be reinstated, without examination, within one year from the date of such resignation in the position from which he\nor she resigned, if then vacant, or in any vacant position to which such\nemployee was eligible for transfer or reassignment. In computing the one-year\nperiod within which a person may be reinstated after resignation, the day the\nresignation takes effect, any time spent in active service in the military or\nnaval forces of the United States or of the State of New York, and any time\nserved in another position in the civil service of the same governmental\njurisdiction shall not be counted. (2)\n\nIn an exceptional case, the\nappointing authority may, for good cause shown and where the interests of the\ngovernment would be served, waive the provisions of this subdivision to permit\nthe reinstatement of a person more than one year after resignation. For the\npurpose of this subdivision, where an employee on leave of absence resigns, such resignation shall be deemed effective as of the date of the commencement\nof such leave. (e) Job abandonment. When an employee to\nwhom the procedures of section\n25.29\nof this Part apply has been\nabsent from work without notice for 15 consecutive workdays, he or she shall be\ndeemed to have resigned from his or her position if he or she (or, if medically\nunable, a member of his or her family) has not provided a satisfactory written\nexplanation for such absence, to the court or court-related agency to which he\nor she is assigned, on or before the 15th consecutive workday following the\ncommencement of such unauthorized absence. Prior to the conclusion of the\n15-workday period, or at any time thereafter, the court or court-related agency\nshall send the affected employee notice, to the employee's last known address, by certified mail, return receipt requested, that his or her absence is\nconsidered unauthorized and that, as a result of such absence, he or she will\nbe deemed to have resigned from service, effective the 15th workday following\nthe commencement of the unauthorized absence or any specified time thereafter. An employee who has been deemed to have resigned pursuant to this section (or, if medically unable, a member of his or her family) shall have 20 workdays from\nthe date the notice was mailed within which to submit a written explanation\nconcerning his or her absence to the deputy chief administrator for management\nsupport. Upon receipt of such explanation, the deputy chief administrator for\nmanagement support shall reinstate the employee, without examination, to the\nposition from which he or she was deemed to have resigned, if vacant, or to any\nvacant position to which he or she was eligible for transfer or reassignment, and shall have 20 workdays within which to initiate charges against the\nemployee pursuant to section\n25.29\nof this Part.
