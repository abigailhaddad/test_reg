  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 383-8.6 - Disposal activities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\ndisposal requirements. (1)\n\nUnless otherwise\nauthorized by the department, Class B and Class C waste must be disposed of in\nseparate disposal units from those containing Class A waste. The department may\nauthorize the disposal of Class A waste with Class B and C waste if the Class A\nmeets the stability requirements of section\n382.81\n(b) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nThe permittee must\nmaintain a computer-based tracking system for the waste packages at the land\ndisposal facility. The tracking system must be indexed on the unique\nidentification number assigned to the waste package as required by section\n383-8.4\n(c)(6)\nof\nthis Subpart and must record the movement and location of each waste package\nfrom the time it is accepted for disposal through its final placement in the\ndisposal unit. The tracking system must record the position of each waste\npackage within the disposal unit. (3)\n\nWaste must be protected from the\nelements, including wind, rain, snow, ice, and flooding during disposal\noperations. (4)\n\nThe permittee must\noperate the land disposal facility in a manner that will minimize the amount of\ntime that elapses between the receipt and disposal of waste. Unless otherwise\nauthorized by the department, waste that is accepted for disposal must be\nemplaced in disposal units no later than 90 days after it was received at the\nland disposal facility. (5)\n\nThe\ntotal quantity of special nuclear material present on the disposal site outside\nof the disposal units must not, at any time, be sufficient to form a critical\nmass. Special nuclear material in quantities not sufficient to form a critical\nmass means: (i) uranium enriched in the\nisotope uranium-235 in quantities not exceeding 350 grams of contained\nuranium-235; (ii)\nuranium-233 in\nquantities not exceeding 200 grams; (iii)\nplutonium in quantities not exceeding\n200 grams; or\n(iv)\nany combination\nof uranium-233, plutonium, or uranium enriched in uranium-235 that meets this\ncriterion: For each type of special nuclear material present, the ratio between\nthe amount of that special nuclear material present and the limit for that\nspecial nuclear material set in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this\nparagraph must be calculated. The sum of those ratios must not exceed\none. (6)\n\nDisposal units\nthat have been filled to their design capacity must be closed as required by\nsection\n383-9.3\nof this Part. Unless\notherwise approved by the department, all disposal unit closure measures must\nbe completed no later than one year after the disposal unit is\nfilled. (7)\n\nOngoing disposal\noperations must not have an adverse impact on closed disposal units. (8)\n\nWaste generated from on-site activities\nmust be disposed of in accordance with the requirements of this Part. (9)\n\nWaste must not be placed in disposal\nunits unless it meets the requirements of section\n383-8.4\n(c)(1) and\n(2)\nof this Subpart. (10)\n\nNo waste may be placed in a new disposal\nunit until: (i) the department receives from\nthe permittee the construction certification report for the new disposal unit\nas required by section\n383-7.2\n(f) of this\n\nPart; and\n(ii)\nthe department\ninspects the new disposal unit, finds it to be in conformance with the permit, and so notifies the permittee in writing. (11)\n\nWaste must be placed in the disposal\nunit in a manner that maintains the waste package integrity during emplacement, minimizes the void spaces between packages, permits the void spaces to be\nfilled, and is consistent with the facility's design goals for recovery or\nretrieval of waste, if applicable. (12)\n\nVoid spaces between waste packages must\nbe filled with free-draining material to reduce subsidence of the disposal unit\nafter disposal unit closure. (b) Disposal of mixed waste. (1)\n\nThe disposal of mixed waste must comply\nwith Part 373 of this Title and with this Part. (2)\n\nOnly mixed waste and filler material\nauthorized by the department, if any, may be disposed of in disposal units\ndesigned and constructed for mixed waste. (3)\n\nMixed waste must be placed in disposal\nunits that are located a sufficient distance from disposal units that are used\nfor other types of wastes so that the monitoring, operation, closure and\npost-closure requirements for hazardous waste disposal facilities in this Part\nand Part 373 of this Title are met. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n383-8.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
