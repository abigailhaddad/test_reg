  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 189.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nAs used in this Part: (a) The words closed package mean a crate, box, carton or other container, the contents of which cannot be adequately\ninspected without opening. (b) The\nword lettuce means iceberg type lettuce. (c) The words good delivery standards mean, in connection with the use of the official lettuce grades, shipments of lettuce\nenroute or at destination of lettuce and at retail sale may contain an average\nof not more than three percent condition defects, including not more than two\npercent decay affecting any portion of the head exclusive of wrapper leaves in\nexcess of the destination tolerances provided for the applicable grade in the\nofficial New York or U. S. standards for grades of lettuce. (For example, the\n\nNo. 1 grade provides a 12 percent tolerance for damage at destination. If a lot\ncontains five percent damage by permanent grade factors, seven percent of the\ntolerance can be applied to damage by condition factors. The additional three\npercent tolerance would then allow a total of 10 percent damage by condition\nfactors in this shipment at retail destination and at retail sale.)\n(d) The words fairly uniform in size mean\nthat not more than 10 percent, by count, of the heads in any container may vary\nappreciably in size from the standard size head for the count pack. (e) The words excessively tightly packed mean\nthat heads are packed so tightly as to cause distortion or crushing of the\nheads or breaking of the midribs. The packing of 24 heads of 18 size in a\nstandard cardboard lettuce container would result in an excessively tight\npack. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n189.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
