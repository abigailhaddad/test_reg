  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 40.4 - Net fishery limits-mesh sizes and gear restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Trawl descriptions and\ndefinitions. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis section, the\ncod end of a trawl net used in a directed fishery for\nsummer flounder, or black sea bass\nis defined as either 75 continuous\nmeshes forward of the terminus of the net or the terminal one third of the net, measured from the center of the chain line at the mouth of the net to the\nterminus of the net. (2)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this section, the\ncod end of a trawl net used in a directed\nfishery for winter flounder and weakfish\nis defined as either 50\ncontinuous meshes forward of the terminus of the net or the terminal one fourth\nof the net, measured from the center of the chain line at the mouth of the net\nto the terminus of the net. (3)\n\nThe\nminimum mesh size is the maximum opening of any single mesh, measured when wet\nafter use and is represented by the median value of 11 consecutive meshes taken\nat least five meshes from the lacings parallel to the longitudinal axis of the\nnet. (4)\n\nThe minimum mesh size is\nmeasured by a wedge-shaped gauge having a taper of two centimeters (0.78 inch)\nin eight centimeters (3.14 inches) and a thickness of 3.2 millimeters (0.125\ninch) inserted into the meshes under a pressure or pull of five kilograms (11\npounds). The department may approve the use of other equivalent mesh\nmeasurement gauges or methods of measurement. (5)\n\nTaper gauges as prescribed in this\nsubdivision will be available on loan from the department upon written\nrequest. (6)\n\nFor the purposes of\nthis section, a net that conforms to one of the following specifications and\nhas not been in recent use is considered to be not available for immediate use: (i) a net stowed below deck, provided: (a) it is located below the main working deck\nfrom which the net is deployed and retrieved; and\n(b) the towing wires, including the leg\nwires, are detached from the net; and\n(c) it is fan-folded (flaked) and bound\naround its circumference; (ii)\na net stowed and lashed down on deck, provided: (a) it is fan-folded (flaked) and\nbound around its circumference; and\n(b) it is securely fastened to the deck or\nrail of the vessel; and\n(c) the\ntowing wires, including the leg wires, are detached from the\nnet; (iii)\na net that is\non a reel and is covered and secured, provided: (a) the entire surface of the net is covered\nwith canvas or other similar material that is securely bound; (b) the towing wires, including the leg wires\nare detached from the net; and\n(c) the cod end is removed from the net and stowed below\ndeck. (7)\n\nNo\nfishing vessel may use any means or device, including but not limited to\nchafing gear, liners, double nets, net strengtheners, ropes, lines, or chafing\ngear on the top of the regulated portion of a trawl net; except that, one\nsplitting strap and one bull rope, consisting of line or rope not more than two\ninches in diameter, may be used if such splitting strap or bull rope does not\nconstrict, in any manner, the top of the regulated portion of the net. However, canvas, netting, or other material may be attached to the underside of the cod\nend to reduce wear and prevent damage. For the purposes of this section, the\ntop of the regulated portion of the net\nis defined as the 50\npercent of the entire regulated portion of the net that will not be in contact\nwith the ocean bottom during a tow if the regulated portion of the net were\nlaid flat on the ocean floor. (b) Summer flounder. (1)\n\nOnly nets with cod ends having a minimum\nmesh size of at least five and one-half inches diamond, or six inches square, inside measure, may be used in a directed trawl fishery for summer flounder. Effective upon adoption of equivalent Federal regulations applicable to nets\nused to take summer flounder in the United States Exclusive Economic Zone\n(EEZ), only nets having a minimum mesh size of at least five and one-half\ninches diamond, or six inches square, inside measure, in the body, extension(s)\nand cod end portion of the net may be used in a directed trawl fishery for\nsummer flounder. Diamond mesh nets may have cod ends using square mesh, provided that the size for such mesh is at least six inches square. Any trawl\nvessel that has on board more than 100 pounds of summer flounder between May\n1st and October 31st or more than 200 pounds of summer flounder between\n\nNovember 1st and April 30th will be presumed to be engaged in a directed\nfishery for summer flounder. (2)\n\nIt\nis unlawful to use or have available for immediate use any combination of mesh\nor liners on a vessel engaged in a directed trawl fishery that effectively\ndecreases the mesh below the minimum size except as permitted in paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision. (3)\n\nIt is\nunlawful for operators of trawl vessels that have on board more than 100 pounds\nof summer flounder between May 1st and October 31st or more than 200 pounds of\nsummer flounder between November 1st and April 30th to use or have available\nfor immediate use any net, or any piece of net, that does not meet the mesh\nrequirements contained in this subdivision except for the following: vessels\nthat possess a valid small mesh exemption certificate issued by the United\n\nStates Department of Commerce. (4)\n\nAll summer flounder on vessels fishing with mesh smaller than the legal minimum\nsize described in this subdivision shall be kept separate from other\nfish. (c) Winter\nflounder. (1)\n\nOnly nets with cod ends\nhaving a minimum mesh size of at least six and one-half inches diamond, or six\nand one half inches square mesh, inside measure, may be used in a directed\ntrawl fishery for winter flounder. Diamond mesh nets may have cod ends using\nsquare mesh, provided that the minimum size for such mesh is at least six and\none half inches square. Any trawl vessel that has on board more than 100 pounds\nof winter flounder will be presumed to be engaged in a directed fishery for\nwinter flounder. (2)\n\nIt is unlawful\nto possess or land more than 100 pounds of winter flounder unless nets with cod\nends that are less than six and one-half inches diamond, or six and one half\ninches square mesh, inside measure, are not in use or available for immediate\nuse. It is unlawful for operators participating in a directed fishery to have\nany net, or any piece of net, on board having a minimum mesh size less than\nfour and one-half inches diamond or nets with cod ends greater than four and\none-half inches but less than five and one-half inches available for immediate\nuse. (3)\n\nIt is unlawful to use or\nhave available for immediate use any combination of mesh or liners that\neffectively decreases the mesh below the minimum size when more than 100 pounds\nof winter flounder are possessed or landed. (4)\n\nAll winter flounder on vessels fishing\nwith a mesh cod end smaller than the legal minimum size must be kept separate\nfrom other fish. (d) Weakfish, trawls and gill nets. (1)\n\nTrawls. Effective January 1, 1998. Only\nnets having a minimum cod end mesh size of at least four and one-half inches\ndiamond mesh, or four inches square mesh, inside measure, may be used in a\ndirected trawl fishery for weakfish. Any trawl vessel that has on board more\nthan 150 pounds of weakfish will be presumed to be engaged in a directed\nfishery for weakfish. (2)\n\nIt is\nunlawful for operators of trawl vessels that have on board more than 150 pounds\nof weakfish to use or have available for immediate use any net, or any piece of\nnet, that does not meet the minimum mesh regulations contained in paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision on board. (3)\n\nIt is unlawful to use or have available for immediate use any combination of\nmesh or liners on board a vessel engaged in a directed trawl fishery that\neffectively decreases the mesh below the minimum size. (4)\n\nAll weakfish on vessels fishing with a\nnet mesh smaller than the legal minimum size must be kept separate from other\nfish. (5)\n\nGill nets. Effective\n\nJanuary 1, 1998.

Any\ngill net or trammel net vessel that has on board more than 150 pounds of\nweakfish will be presumed to be engaged in a directed fishery for\nweakfish. (6)\n\nOperators of gill or\ntrammel vessels that have on board more than 150 pounds of weakfish may not\nhave any net, or any piece of net that does not meet the minimum mesh\nrequirement contained in paragraph (5) of this subdivision on board. (7)\n\nAll weakfish on vessels fishing with a\nnet mesh smaller than the legal minimum size must be kept separate from other\nfish. (e) Striped\nbass, gill nets. (1)\n\nGill nets. Only\ngill nets having a minimum mesh size of at least six inches stretched mesh to a\nmaximum of eight inches stretched mesh, inside measure, throughout the net, may\nbe used in the directed fishery for striped bass.
