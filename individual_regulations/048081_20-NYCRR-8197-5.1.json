  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8197-5.1 - Annual charge to special franchise owners\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each year a charge shall be computed for\neach owner of special franchise property for which a tentative assessment is\ndetermined. (b) The charge shall be\ncomputed as follows: (1)\nORPTS shall\nestablish a dollar amount for the direct and indirect costs and expenses for\ncomputing and establishing assessments of special franchise property. In\nestablishing this amount, ORPTS shall include the costs of obtaining valuation\ninformation, processing that information, calculating values, establishing\nassessments and complying with all statutory and regulatory notice and hearing\nrequirements for establishing those assessments. ORPTS shall not include the\ncost of any contractual expenses incurred in defense of any special franchise\nassessment. (2)\n\nThe value of all\nspecial franchise property for which final assessments were established on the\nprior year's assessment roll shall be divided into the dollar amount determined\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision. This shall be the charge rate. These\nvalues shall be determined at the same full value standard as the State\nequalization rate for the prior year's assessment roll. (3)\n\nThe charge rate shall be multiplied by\nthe value of special franchise property for which final assessments were\nestablished on the prior year's assessment roll for each special franchise\nowner. In the first year a special franchise owner receives an assessment on\nspecial franchise property, the charge rate shall be multiplied by the value\nused to determine the tentative assessment of that special franchise\nproperty. (4)\n\nWhere a charge of\nless than $25 is computed, no charge shall be imposed. Annual charges unpaid\nmore than 60 days after the billing date shall be considered past\ndue. (c) Charges shall\nbe computed and billed annually on or about July 1st, or within 45 days of the\nadoption of the State Operations Budget, whichever is later. If the total\namount computed and billed is more than the amount previously estimated and\nsent to special franchise owners in the preceding calendar year after\nsubmission of the budget request, the bill should be accompanied by a detailed\nexplanation of the difference. (d) All revenue collected pursuant to this Subpart shall be deposited in the\nindustrial and utility service account of the special revenue fund. (e) In no event may the amount computed and\nbilled for the special franchise assessment program exceed the funds\nappropriated for this program in the State Operations Budget. The amount\ncomputed shall be reduced prior to billing by the amount of any funds remaining\nunexpended in the industrial and utility service account for the special\nrevenue fund that are identifiable to the special franchise program. (f) No later than 30 days prior to the\nsubmission of the next fiscal year's budget request, ORPTS shall notify special\nfranchise owners of prospective program changes, if any, and the preliminary\nestimated cost for administration of the special franchise program for the next\nfiscal year. Special franchise owners may submit comments regarding these\nchanges and costs up to 15 days after issuance of the notice. These comments\nshall be considered by ORPTS in finalizing the budget request. After submission\nof the budget request, ORPTS shall notify special franchise owners of the final\nestimated cost for administration of the program for the next fiscal\nyear. (g) Within 10 days of receipt\nof the notice of any prospective program changes and the preliminary estimated\ncost of administration of the program for the next fiscal year, any special\nfranchise owner may request that a meeting be scheduled for special franchise\nowners to discuss these proposed program changes and preliminary estimated\ncosts with ORPTS. Upon receipt of any such request, ORPTS shall schedule such a\nmeeting and shall provide all special franchise owners with notice of the time\nand place that such meeting will be held. (h) At the same time that ORPTS notifies\nspecial franchise owners of prospective program changes for the next fiscal\nyear, an accounting of the costs of administering the special franchise program\nfor the preceding fiscal year shall be available upon request. (i) (1)\n\nCosts and expenses incurred in the assessment of special franchise property\nwhich shall be paid from the collection of the annual charge shall include\ndirect personal services, nonpersonal services, and indirect costs. (2)\n\nDirect personal services shall be\ncalculated in the following manner. The deputy commissioner director shall\nidentify those job titles that directly perform tasks required by the special\nfranchise program and shall enumerate the percent of time each particular job\ntitle is expected to spend on the program. (3)\n\nNonpersonal services include travel, supplies, equipment, contractual obligations, and mandated fringe benefit\ncharges as published annually by the Office of the State Comptroller and\nexpressed as a percentage of estimated personal services costs. (4)\n\nIndirect costs, or overhead, include\nspace rental, heat, utilities, security, computing and data processing costs, training and staff development costs, and the cost of executive direction and\nadministration. (5)\n\nIn computing\nindirect costs, the amount of time individual employees spend in the\nestablishment of special franchise assessments, as enumerated pursuant to\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be expressed as full-time employee\nequivalents. This number shall be divided by the number of full-time employee\nequivalents of ORPTS whose official station is the Albany office of ORPTS on\nthe first day of the fiscal year for which the annual charge is determined. This percentage shall be computed to the third decimal place. The resulting\npercentage shall be applied to total costs for Albany space, heat, utilities, security, computing and data processing, and training and staff development to\ndetermine indirect costs other than the cost of executive direction and\nadministration. (6)\n\nThe cost of\nexecutive direction and administration required for the establishment of\nspecial franchise assessments, which includes the costs of legal services, fiscal and administrative services, human resource management and development, and the deputy commissioner's office, shall be determined by dividing the total\npersonal services appropriation of ORPTS for the fiscal year for which the\nannual charge is being computed into the salary equivalents of the sum of those\nindividuals responsible for providing these services. The resulting percentage, computed to the third decimal place, shall be applied to the amount determined\nfor the cost of direct personal services pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision to determine the indirect cost of executive direction and\nadministration.
