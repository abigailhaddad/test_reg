  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 166-1.5 - Excess profit threshold\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The excess profit threshold shall be 21 percent. (b) The department has followed the general approach of its consultant's statistical analysis but, on a judgment basis, has modified the excess profit threshold of 22.4 percent that was recommended by the consultant. As explained below, the department has selected a lower excess profit threshold of 21 percent, rounded to the nearest full percentage, which is based on net worth, the assumption of the normal distribution, and a probability level which differs from that selected by the consultant. (c) See section\n166-2.5\nof this Part for discussion of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n166-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
