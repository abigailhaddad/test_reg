  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 190.9 - Terms descriptive of the white\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Clear. A white that is free from\ndiscolorations or from any foreign bodies floating in it. (Prominent chalazas\nshould not be confused with foreign bodies such as spots or blood\nclots.)\n(b) Firm (AA quality). A\nwhite that is sufficiently thick or viscous to prevent the yolk outline from\nbeing more than slightly defined or indistinctly indicated when the egg is\ntwirled. With respect to a broken-out egg, a firm white has a haugh unit value\nof 72 or higher when measured at a temperature between 45° and 60° F. (c) Reasonably firm (A quality). A white that\nis somewhat less thick or viscous than a firm white. A reasonable firm white\npermits the yolk to approach the shell more closely which results in a fairly\nwell defined yolk outline when the egg is twirled. With respect to a broken-out\negg, a reasonably firm white has a haugh unit value of 60 to 72 when measured\nat a temperature between 45° and 60° F. (d) Weak and watery (B quality). A white that\nis weak, thin and generally lacking in viscosity. A weak and watery white\npermits the yolk to approach the shell closely, thus causing yolk outline to\nappear plainly visible and dark when the egg is twirled. With respect to a\nbroken- out egg, a weak and watery white has a haugh unit value lower than 60\nwhen measured at a temperature between 45° and 60° F. (e) Blood spots or meat spots. Small blood\nspots or meat spots (aggregating not more than 1/8 inch in diameter) may be\nclassified as B quality. If larger, or showing diffusion of blood into the\nwhite surrounding a blood spot, the egg shall be classified as loss. Blood\nspots shall not be due to germ development. They may be on the yolk or in the\nwhite. Meat spots may be blood spots which have lost their characteristic red\ncolor or tissue from the reproductive organs. (f) Bloody white. An egg, the white of which\nhas blood diffused through it. Such condition may be present in new-laid eggs. Eggs with bloody whites are classed as loss. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n190.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
