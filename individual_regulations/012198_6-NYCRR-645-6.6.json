The function of the conference is, as far as possible, to narrow or\nresolve issues raised by the parties concerning the permit application and to\ndefine and limit the scope of issues remaining as subjects for the adjudicatory\nhearing sessions. At the issues conference, the hearing officer may rule on\nparty status, direct disclosure between the parties, and outline the conduct of\nthe hearing. (b) Where a DEIS\naccompanies an application, the conference shall also focus on whether and to\nwhat extent significant impact, alternatives, mitigation measure or social and\neconomic considerations identified in the DEIS, or raised in comments on the\nDEIS, should be addressed in the adjudicatory session of the hearing, particularly where there is a reasonable likelihood that the issues arising\nfrom the DEIS might lead to the denial of the permit or the issuance of\nsignificant permit conditions. (c) Following the conference, the hearing officer will determine and advise the\nparties of the issues to which testimony and other evidence in the adjudicatory\nsession will be limited or will determine that the hearing is to be adjourned\nor cancelled.

The hearing officer will\nenter his determination on the record. (d) The ruling of the hearing officer setting\nforth the issues for the hearing may, within seven days of the ruling, be\nappealed in writing to the commission, which shall decide the appeal at its\nnext regular meeting following the receipt of all papers filed in connection\nwith the appeal.
