  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 122.7 - Specific deduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 662(c)\n(a) Resident individuals. The specific deduction of a resident individual or\nmarried individuals filing a joint return is $5,000. In the case of married\nindividuals filing separate returns, regardless of whether on separate forms or\non one form, the specific deduction is $2,500 for each spouse. (b) Resident estates or trusts. (1)\n\nThe specific deduction of a resident\nestate or trust is an amount, not to exceed $5,000, which bears the same ratio\nto $5,000 as the sum of the New York items of tax preference of the estate or\ntrust (determined as explained in section\n122.1\n[b]\n[1]\nof this Part) bears to the sum of the\n\nFederal items of tax preference of the estate or trust (including the portion\nthereof allocated to the beneficiaries of such estate or trust) with the\nmodifications described in sections\n122.3\nand\n122.6\nof this Part and increased by any net operating loss used to reduce the sum of\nthe New York items of tax preference in a previous year (see section\n122.1\n[c][2]\nof this Part). Example: For the calendar year 1994, a trust reports rental income\nfor which accelerated depreciation was used for property placed in service\nbefore 1987. The trust distributes 60 percent of such income to the\nbeneficiaries. The total Federal items of tax preference (including the portion\nthereof allocable to the beneficiaries) is $10,000 (excess of depreciation\nclaimed for regular tax purposes over depreciation refigured using the straight\nline method), and the New York and Federal items of tax preference allocable to\nthe trust would be $4,000 (40 percent of $10,000). The specific deduction\nallowable under this paragraph would be computed as follows: Amount for Federal (without\nallocation)\n\nAmount for New York (without\nallocation)\n\nItems of tax preference\n$10,000\n$4,000\n\nSpecific deduction: $4,000/ $10,000 × $5,000 = $2,000\n(2)\n\nReduction of the specific deduction is\nrequired only in cases where the fiduciary has allocated items of tax\npreference to the beneficiaries of the estate or trust during the taxable\nyear. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n122.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
