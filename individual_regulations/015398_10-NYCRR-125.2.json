  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 125.2 - Village of Churchville\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application. The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (the Public Health Law) as heretofore set forth shall apply to the Pathfinder Spring and to all the natural and artificial reservoirs used for the collection or storage of the flow from the Pathfinder Spring, which are tributary to or which serve as sources of the public water supply of the Village of Churchville, Monroe County, or to any additional reservoir which may be constructed or used for the purpose of this public water supply. (b) Interpretation. Wherever a linear distance of a structure or object from the spring or from a reservoir is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to spring or reservoir. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or spring. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 100 feet of any reservoir or within 200 feet of any spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, 1ocated, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 150 feet of any reservoir or within 300 feet of any spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind or place, used for the temporary storage of human excreta, located between the limiting distances prescribed by paragraph (1) of this subdivision and the limiting distance prescribed by paragraph (2) of this subdivision, shall be arranged in such a manner that all such excreta shall be received in suitable watertight receptacles which shall at all times be disposed of as hereinafter set forth in paragraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleansed and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain these receptacles or the privy or the place in which they are kept in a proper, sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon foundation or floor of the privy or other place. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape in being transferred from the privy or place of temporary storage to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to the occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted in writing by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid watertight receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or pits at a depth not less than 18 inches below the surface, in such place and manner as to effectually prevent the excreta being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at a distance of not less than 500 feet from any reservoir or spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville. (6)\n\nWhenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into the reservoir or spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health. (d) Sewage, house slops, sink wastes, etc. (1)\n\nNo house slops, bath water, sewage or other excremental matter from any water closet, privy, cesspool or other source shall be thrown, placed, led, discharged or allowed to escape or flow on the surface of the ground or into the ground beneath the surface except into watertight vessels or receptacles, the contents of which are to be removed as provided by paragraph (4) of subdivision (c), within 150 feet of any reservoir or within 300 feet of any spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville. (2)\n\nNo garbage, putrescible matter, kitchen or sink wastes, refuse or waste matter from any creamery, cheese factory or laundry nor water in which milk cans, utensils, clothing, bedding, carpets or harness have been washed or rinsed nor any polluted water or liquid of any kind shall be thrown or discharged directly or indirectly into any reservoir or spring nor shall any such liquid or solid refuse or waste be thrown, discharged or allowed to escape or remain upon the surface of the ground or to percolate into or through the ground below the surface within a distance of 100 feet of any reservoir or within 200 feet of any spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville.

(2)\n\nNo human excreta and no compost or other matter containing human excreta shall be thrown, placed or allowed to escape into the reservoir or spring tributary to the public water supply nor to be placed, piled or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville, nor shall such human excreta or compost or other matter containing human excreta be buried in the soil at a less depth than 18 inches below the surface nor within the prohibited distance of 500 feet of the reservoir or spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville, and no manure or compost of any kind shall be thrown, placed, piled or spread upon the ground within a distance of 100 feet of any reservoir or 200 feet of any spring tributary to the public water supply of the Village of Churchville.
