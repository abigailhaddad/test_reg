Accordingly, a domestic corporation is subject to\ntax for each fiscal or calendar year, or part thereof, during which it is in\nexistence, regardless of whether it does any business, employs any capital, owns or leases any property, maintains any office, derives any receipts from\nany activity in this state or engages in any activity, within or without New\n\nYork State. A domestic corporation is subject to tax even though it carries on\nits business or derives its receipts entirely outside New York State. (1)\n\nExample. A corporation is incorporated under the laws of New York\n\nState on July 1, 2021. It begins to do business on February 1, 2022, setting up\nits books on the basis of a calendar year. The corporation is subject to tax\nfrom July 1, 2021, to December 31, 2021, since it had the privilege of\nexercising its corporate franchise for that period. It is also subject to tax\nfor the period beginning January 1, 2022.

(2)\nA domestic corporation that meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision: (i) will no longer need to file\nany additional article 9-A franchise tax returns for taxable years or periods\noccurring after the period covered by its final article 9-A tax return; and\n(ii)\nafter filing its final\narticle 9-A tax return, may seek consent to be dissolved.

(4)\nA domestic corporation that does not meet\nthe requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision and that ceases to file\narticle 9-A franchise tax returns: (i) will\nnot qualify for the exemption from the fixed dollar minimum tax; and\n(ii)\nmay be issued assessments, including\npenalties and interest for failure to file an article 9-A franchise tax return\nor to pay the article 9-A franchise tax, or for failure to do both. (5)\nA domestic corporation that is\nno longer doing business, employing capital, owning or leasing property in a\ncorporate or organized capacity, or deriving receipts from activity in this\nstate, as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, but that wishes to\nretain its certificate of incorporation must: (i) continue to file article 9-A franchise\ntax returns; (ii)\ncontinue to pay\nall applicable tax; and\n(iii)\nnot\nfile a final return, that is, not file a return marked final.
