  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16§ 603.6 - Major service provider emergency contingency plans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This section\napplies only to Major Service Providers as defined in this section. Major\n\nService Providers are required to incorporate the requirements of this section\ninto their emergency contingency plans pursuant to section\n603.5\n(b)(1). These requirements are primarily intended to ensure adequate response for storm\nand storm-like emergencies; however, some aspects of these additional\nrequirements will have application to virtually all events noted in section\n603.5\n(a) and\nshould be used accordingly. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nMajor Service Provider. A\nMajor Service Provider is defined as (i) any service provider that is an\nincumbent local exchange provider, or (ii) any facilities-based service\nprovider with over 500,000 access lines, or (iii) a certificated 911 service\nprovider as defined in section (b)(2). (2)\n911 Service Provider. A 911 service\nprovider is any entity that is certified under the Public Service Law that\nprovides 911, E911, or NG911 capabilities such as 911 call or information\ntransport, selective routing, ALI, ANI, or the functional equivalent of any of\nthose capabilities, NG911 core services, directly or indirectly intended for or\nto a Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), statewide default answering point, or appropriate state, regional or local 911 authority, or that operates\nfacilities that directly serve a PSAP or state, regional or local 911\nauthority. For the purpose of these rules, a provider \"directly serves a PSAP\"\nif it: hosts a selective router or ALI/ANI database; provides functionally\nequivalent NG911 capabilities and core services; or, is the last service-\nprovider facility through which a 911 trunk, SIP connection, or administrative\nline passes before connecting to a PSAP. (3)\n\nStorm Drill. A storm drill is a training\nexercise conducted by the Major Service Provider, or that the Major Service\n\nProvider participates in if conducted by an electric utility (or utilities) or\na government agency (or agencies), to test the adequacy and effectiveness of\nits regularly assigned personnel and personnel performing job functions outside\nof their normal areas of responsibility in implementing the Major Service\n\nProvider's service restoration procedures in the wake of a storm classified at\nthe highest or next highest level of severity by the Major Service Provider. Drills shall simulate the involvement of a majority of a Major Service\n\nProvider's customer base. The drill can be achieved through the mobilization of\npersonnel with specific storm response and/or service restoration assignments\nunder simulated storm conditions or participation in a multientity drill or a\ngovernment sponsored drill or through the actual preparation for an advancing\nstorm, which may or may not cause damage to the network. However, in either\ncase, to qualify as a drill, the participants must have carried out all their\nstorm response assignments under either an impending storm scenario or a\nsimulated storm scenario. The drill must also involve contacts with outside\nagencies, local governments and others who would normally be included in\nservice restoration responses. For actual preparations, in lieu of a drill, the\ncompany shall certify in section (c) of this Part that all requirements of this\ndefinition were met. (c) Submission of Major Service Provider emergency contingency plans. (1)\n\nInitial and Amended Annual Filing. On or\nbefore January 31st of each year or on such other date as the commission may\nprescribe, each Major Service Provider shall file with the commission, in\naccordance with the requirements of section\n603.5\n(b)(1)\nan\nupdated emergency contingency plan that meets the requirements of section (d), and any amendments to a filed emergency contingency plan to maintain a high\nlevel of preparedness, or a statement that no amendments are\ncontemplated. (2)\n\nCertification. On\nor before January 31st of each year or on such other date as the commission may\nprescribe, each Major Service Provider shall certify in a report filed with the\n\nSecretary of the commission that within the past 12 months, it has taken the\nfollowing actions: (i) periodically verified\ntelephone contacts with and updated its lists of names of internal and external\ncontact persons identified in section (d)(5); (ii)\nconducted at least one storm drill or\nemergency exercise involving key company personnel assigned service restoration\nresponsibilities; (iii)\nconducted\ntesting of its central office power systems, including generators, transfer\nswitches, alarms, rectifiers, batteries, etc.; (iv)\nattest that the Major Service Provider\nis in compliance with Federal Communications Commission rules and best\npractices adopted or established for back-up power at switching offices and\nthose offices serving PSAPs; and\n(v) for each switching office in its serving\nterritory, report the type of generation deployed at the switching office and\nits automatic start capability, the date and results of testing, and corrective\nactions taken as a result of such testing.

(4)\n\nAny corporation that has regional or\ndivision plans shall make amendments to such operating area plans as are\nnecessary to have those plans conform with any systemwide plan.
