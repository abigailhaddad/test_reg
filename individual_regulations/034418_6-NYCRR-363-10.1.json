  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-10.1 - Corrective measures report\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe owner or operator of a landfill must complete a\ncorrective measures report and implement a corrective measures program\nconsistent with this Subpart if trigger values are exceeded as specified in\nsubparagraph 363-4.6(f)(9)(iii) of this Part. The requirements of this section\ndo not apply to landfills that stopped accepting solid waste prior to October\n9, 1993, or to facilities subject to Part 375 of this Title. (a) Corrective measures assessment. (1)\n\nIf any expanded parameter is detected at\na level which exceeds the groundwater protection standards specified in section\n363-4.6\n(f)(9)(iii)\nof this Part, then the owner or operator must notify the department within 24\nhours of detection, notify appropriate local government officials within seven\ndays of detection, begin a corrective measures assessment within 30 days of\ndetection, and complete the corrective measures assessment within a timeframe\nspecified by the department. The facility owner or operator must continue to\nmonitor the facility in accordance with section\n363-4.6\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe corrective measures assessment must\ninclude a list of possible corrective measures including, but not limited to, closure in accordance with Subpart 363-9 of this Part and landfill reclamation\nin accordance with Subpart 363-11 of this Part, and an assessment of the\neffectiveness of each corrective measure. The assessment of each listed\ncorrective measure must include, at a minimum: (i) the corrective measure's performance, reliability and ease of implementation; (ii)\nthe corrective measure's potential\nimpacts including safety effects, cross-media effects and control of any\nprobable residual contamination; (iii)\nthe time required to begin and complete\neach corrective measure; (iv)\nthe\ncost of each corrective measure; and\n(v) an identification of any state and local\npermits or other public health or environmental requirements that may affect\nthe corrective measure implementation. (3)\n\nThe facility owner or operator must\ndiscuss the corrective measures assessment in a public meeting and with the\ndepartment before the selection of the corrective measure. A responsiveness\nsummary, which addresses comments received at the public meeting, must be\nincluded with the corrective measures report submitted under subdivision (b) of\nthis section. The public meeting must be noticed as follows: (i) publication of the notice in a newspaper\nhaving general circulation in the area within which the facility is located, direct mailing of the notice to property owners within 1,000 feet of the\nlandfill footprint, and publishing of the notice in the environmental notice\nbulletin; (ii)\nthe notice must be\npublished and mailed not less than two weeks nor more than six weeks before the\nmeeting; and\n(iii)\nthe notice must\nindicate the date, time, place and purpose of the meeting, and the name and\naddress of the owner or the owner's representative. (b) Corrective measure selection. (1)\n\nThe facility owner or operator must\nselect a corrective measure based on the results of the corrective measures\nassessment conducted under subdivision (a) of this section. A corrective\nmeasures report must be submitted to the department for approval within 14 days\nafter completion of the proposed corrective measures assessment. The report\nmust address the requirements of this subdivision and include the results of\nthe corrective measures assessment, the proposed corrective measures, and a\nschedule for initiating and completing the corrective measures. (2)\n\nThe selected corrective measure must: (i) protect public health and the\nenvironment; (ii)\nattain the\ngroundwater protection standard established pursuant to section\n363-4.6\nof this Part; (iii)\ncontrol the sources of releases to the\nmaximum extent practical so as to reduce or eliminate further releases of the\ncontaminants into the environment; and\n(iv)\ncomply with other applicable state and\nfederal requirements. (3)\n\nThe facility owner or operator, in\nselecting a corrective measure, must consider the following factors: (i) The probable success of the corrective\nmeasure, including: (a) the reduction of\nexisting risks; (b) the potential\nof residual risks due to waste remaining after implementation of the corrective\nmeasure; (c) the type and extent of\nlong-term management required, including monitoring, operation and\nmaintenance; (d) short-term risks\nthat might be posed to public health and the environment while implementing the\ncorrective measure. This includes any potential impacts to public health and\nthe environment that may be associated with excavation, transportation, and\nredisposal of wastes; (e) time\nuntil full protection is achieved; (f) the potential adverse impacts on public\nhealth and the environment resulting from exposure to remaining wastes compared\nto the potential of adverse impacts associated with further corrective\nmeasures; (g) long-term reliability\nof the engineering and institutional controls; (h) potential need to replace the corrective\nmeasure; and\n(i) the compatibility of the\ncorrective measure with department cleanup and pollution prevention initiatives\nfor nonhazardous wastes. (ii)\n\nThe\ncorrective measure's short-term and long-term effectiveness in preventing the\nrelease of additional contaminants. The probable effectiveness of the\ncorrective measure should consider, at a minimum, the following: (a) the extent to which containment practices\nwill reduce further releases; (b) the time period for reduction of any further releases; and\n(c) the extent to which treatment\ntechnologies, including in situ treatment technologies, may be used. (iii)\n\nThe ease or difficulty of\nimplementing a potential corrective measure, specifically considering the\nfollowing: (a) the difficulty of the\nconstruction; (b) operational\nreliability of the technologies; (c) the need to coordinate with and obtain\nnecessary approvals and permits from other agencies; (d) the availability of necessary equipment\nand specialists; and\n(e) available\ncapacity and location of needed treatment, storage, and disposal\nservices. (iv)\n\nThe\ntechnical and economic resources available to the facility owner or\noperator. (v) The degree to which\ncommunity concerns are addressed by a potential corrective measure. (4)\n\nWithin\n90 days after the selection of a department-approved corrective measure, the\nfacility owner or operator must complete and submit to the department a\ncorrective measures work plan that includes an implementation schedule. Any\nrevisions to the work plan based on department comments must be submitted\nwithin 30 days. The owner or operator must consider the following factors in\ndetermining the schedule of corrective activities: (i) the extent and nature of contamination\nand level of adverse impact to public health and the environment; (ii)\nthe objectives of the corrective measure\nand the practical capabilities of corrective technologies in remediating\ncontamination and leading to compliance with the groundwater protection\nstandards; (iii)\navailability of\ntreatment or disposal capacity for wastes managed during implementation of the\ncorrective measure; (iv)\nan\nevaluation of the use of experimental technologies that are not currently\ncommercially available, which may offer significant advantages over already\navailable technologies in terms of effectiveness, reliability, safety, or\nability to achieve corrective objectives; (v) potential risks to public health and the\nenvironment resulting from exposure to contamination prior to completion of the\ncorrective measure; (vi)\nresource\nvalue of the contaminated aquifer, including: (a) whether the aquifer is a primary or\nprincipal aquifer or is within a public water supply stabilized cone of\ndepression area or within a regulated wetland, special flood hazard area or\nother applicable prohibited or restricted siting area as defined in this\n\nPart; (b) current and future\nuses; (c) proximity and withdrawal\nrate of users; (d) groundwater\nquantity and quality; (e) potential\ndamage to wildlife, crops, vegetation, and physical structures that may be\ncaused by exposure to the waste constituent; (f) hydrogeologic characteristics of the\nfacility and surrounding land; (g) groundwater removal and treatment costs; and\n(h) cost and availability of alternative\nwater supplies; (vii)\npractical capability of the facility owner or operator; (viii)\nan evaluation of any interim measures\nnecessary to ensure the protection of public health and the environment. The\ninterim measures must be consistent with the objectives of and contribute to\nthe performance of any corrective measure that may be required under\nsubdivision (b) of this section. The interim measures evaluation must be\nsubmitted to the department to determine if interim measures are needed. An\ninterim measures evaluation must consider the following factors: (a) time required to develop and implement a\nfinal corrective measure; (b) actual or potential exposure of contaminants to nearby populations or\nenvironmental receptors; (c) actual\nor potential contamination of drinking water supplies, primary or principal\naquifers, or sensitive ecosystems or environments; (d) further degradation of the groundwater\nthat may occur if a corrective measure is not initiated expeditiously\nincluding, but not limited to, direction and rate of contaminant movement in\nthe groundwater flow system; (e) weather conditions that may cause contaminants to migrate or be released or\notherwise aid in their transmission; (f) risks of fire or explosion, or potential\nfor exposure to contaminants as a result of an accident or failure of a\ncontainer or handling system; and\n(g) other situations that may pose threats to\npublic health and the environment; and\n(ix)\nother relevant factors. (5)\n\nThe department may determine\nthat the proposed corrective measure for a contaminant parameter is not\nnecessary if the facility owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of\nthe department that: (i) the groundwater is\nadditionally contaminated by substances that have originated from a source\nother than the landfill and that the concentrations of those substances are\npresent at levels where implementation of the corrective measures would provide\nno significant reduction in risk to public health and the\nenvironment; (ii)\nthe remediation\nof the release is technically impractical; or\n(iii)\nthe remediation will result in\nunacceptable cross media impacts. (6)\nA determination by the department under\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision does not affect the authority of the\ndepartment to require the facility owner or operator to undertake source\ncontrol measures or other measures that may be necessary to eliminate or\nminimize further contamination of groundwater or to mitigate the groundwater\ncontamination to concentrations that are technically practical and\nsignificantly reduce threats to public health and the environment, nor does it\ndiminish the department's authority to seek civil or criminal penalties or\nother damages or relief as part of an enforcement action under state or federal\nlaw. (c) Corrective\nmeasure implementation. (1)\n\nOnce the\ncorrective measure work plan is approved by the department, the facility owner\nor operator must: (i) establish and implement\na corrective measure groundwater monitoring program, that: (a) meets the requirements of this section\n363-4.6\nof this Part and any\nadditional condition imposed by the department as part of a permit, administrative order, or court order; (b) indicates the effectiveness of the\ncorrective measure; and\n(c) evaluates compliance with the groundwater protection standard specified in\nsection\n363-4.6\nof this Part; (ii)\nimplement the corrective\nmeasure selected under subdivision (b) of this section in accordance with the\nterms, conditions and schedule set forth in an approved corrective measures\nwork plan; and\n(iii)\ntake any\ninterim measures necessary to protect public health and the\nenvironment. (2)\n\nThe\ndepartment may determine that compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of this section\nis not being achieved through the selected corrective measure. In these cases, the department may require the facility owner or operator to implement other\nmethods or techniques that could achieve compliance with paragraph (b)(2) of\nthis section, unless the department makes a determination under paragraph (3)\nof this subdivision. (3)\n\nIf the\nfacility owner or operator determines that they cannot achieve the requirements\nof paragraph (b)(2) of this section with any currently available methods, then\nthe owner or operator must: (i) submit a\njustification for the department's approval, which indicates that the\nrequirements under paragraph (b)(2) of this section cannot be achieved with any\ncurrently available methods; (ii)\nimplement alternate measures acceptable to the department, to control exposure\nto humans, wildlife, the environment or other receptors to residual\ncontamination; (iii)\nimplement\nmeasures acceptable to the department, for control of the sources of\ncontamination, or for removal or decontamination of equipment, units, devices, or structures that are consistent with the overall objective of the corrective\nmeasure; and\n(iv)\nnotify the\ndepartment that the report justifying the alternative measures has been placed\nin the operating record. The department must be notified within 14 days prior\nto implementing the alternative measures. (4)\n\nAll wastes that are managed according to\na corrective measure required under this section must be managed in a manner\nthat: (i) protects public health and the\nenvironment; and\n(ii)\ncomplies with\napplicable state and federal requirements. (5)\n\nCorrective measures selected according to\nsubdivision (b) of this section are considered complete when: (i) the facility owner or operator complies, to the satisfaction of the department, with the groundwater protection\nstandards specified in this section at all points within the plume of\ncontamination. Compliance with the groundwater protection standards is\ndemonstrated when concentrations of contaminants required to be measured have\nnot exceeded the groundwater protection standard for three consecutive years\nusing the procedures and performance standards in the environmental monitoring\nplan under section\n363-4.6\nof this Part. The\ndepartment may specify an alternative length of time during which the facility\nowner or operator must demonstrate that concentrations of baseline and expanded\nparameters have not exceeded groundwater protection standard(s) taking into\nconsideration: (a) extent and concentration\nof the release; (b) behavior\ncharacteristics of the contaminants in the groundwater; (c) accuracy of monitoring or modeling\ntechniques, including any seasonal, meteorological, or other environmental\nvariabilities that may affect the accuracy; and\n(d) characteristics of the groundwater; and\n(ii)\nall actions\nrequired to complete the corrective measure have been satisfied. (6)\n\nWithin 14 days of the\ncompletion of the corrective measure, the facility owner or operator must\ncertify to the department that the corrective measure has been completed\naccording to the requirements of paragraph (5) of this subdivision. The\ncertification must be signed by the facility owner or operator and submitted to\nthe department for approval. (7)\n\nWhen, upon review of the certification, the department determines that the\ncorrective measure has been completed in accordance with the requirements under\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision, the department will approve the\ncertification and may allow the facility owner or operator to be released from\nthe requirements for financial assurance for corrective measures.
