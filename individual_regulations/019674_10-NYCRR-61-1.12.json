  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 61-1.12 - Physical containment levels; p2 level\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Laboratory practices. (1)\n\nLaboratory doors shall be kept closed while experiments are in progress. (2)\n\nWork surfaces shall be decontaminated daily, and immediately following spills of organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules. (3)\n\nAll laboratory wastes shall be steam-sterilized (autoclaved) before disposal. Other contaminated materials, such as glassware, animal cages, laboratory equipment and radioactive wastes, shall be decontaminated by a means demonstrated to be effective before washing, reuse or disposal. (4)\n\nMechanical pipetting devices shall be used; pipetting by mouth is prohibited. (5)\n\nEating, drinking, smoking, and storage of food are not permitted in the laboratory area in which recombinant DNA materials are handled. (6)\n\nPersons shall wash their hands after handling organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules, and when they leave the laboratory. (7)\n\nCare shall be exercised to minimize the creation of aerosols. For example, manipulations such as inserting a hot inoculating loop or needle into a culture, flaming an inoculation loop or needle so that it splatters, and forceful ejection of fluids from pipettes or syringes shall be avoided. (8)\n\nContaminated materials that are to be steam-sterilized (autoclaved) or decontaminated at a site away from the laboratory shall be placed in a durable leak-proof container, which is closed before removal from the laboratory. (9)\n\nOnly persons who have been advised of the nature of the research being conducted shall enter the laboratory. (10)\n\nThe universal biohazard sign shall be posted on all laboratory access doors when experiments requiring P2 containment are in progress. Freezers and refrigerators or other units used to store organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules shall also be posted with the universal biohazard sign. (11)\n\nAn insect and rodent control program shall be instituted. (12)\n\nThe use of laboratory gowns, coats, or uniforms is required. Laboratory clothing shall not be worn to the lunch room or outside of the building in which the laboratory is located. (13)\n\nAnimals not related to the experiment shall not be permitted in the laboratory. (14)\n\nUse of the hypodermic needle and syringe shall be avoided when alternative methods are available. (15)\n\nThe laboratory shall be kept neat and clean. (16)\n\nExperiments of lesser biohazard potential can be carried out concurrently in carefully demarcated areas of the same laboratory. (b) Containment equipment. Biological safety cabinets shall be used to contain aerosol-producing equipment, such as blenders, lyophilizers, sonicators, and centrifuges, when used to process organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules, except where equipment design provides for containment of the potential aerosol. For example, a centrifuge may be operated in the open if a sealed head or safety centrifuge cups are used. (c) Special laboratory design. An autoclave for sterilization of wastes and contaminated materials shall be available in the same building in which organisms containing recombinant DNA molecules are used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n61-1.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
