  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 25.23 - Temporary and emergency appointments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Temporary appointments authorized; duration. A temporary appointment may be made for a period not exceeding three\nmonths when the need for such service is important and urgent. A temporary\nappointment may be made for a period exceeding three months under the following\ncircumstances only: (1)\n\nWhen an\nemployee is on leave of absence from his or her position, a temporary\nappointment to such position may be made for a period not exceeding the\nauthorized duration of such leave of absence as prescribed by statute or\nrule. (2)\nA temporary\nappointment may be made for a period not exceeding six months when it is found\nby the appointing authority, upon due inquiry, that the position to which such\nappointment is proposed will not continue in existence for a longer period; provided, however, that where a temporary appointment is made to a position\noriginally expected to exist for no longer than six months and it subsequently\ndevelops that such position will remain in existence beyond such six-month\nperiod, such temporary appointment may be extended for a further period not to\nexceed an additional six months. (b) Temporary appointments upon\nabolition of positions. When a reduction or abolition of positions in the\n\nUnified Court System is planned or imminent and such reduction or abolition of\npositions will probably result in the suspension or demotion of permanent\nemployees, the appointing authority may make temporary instead of permanent\nappointments for a period not exceeding one year in positions in the Unified\n\nCourt System to which permanent employees to be affected by such abolition or\nreduction of positions will be eligible for transfer or reassignment. Successive temporary appointments shall not be made to the same position after\nthe expiration of the authorized period of the original temporary appointment\nto such position. (c) Temporary appointments from eligible lists. (1)\nA temporary appointment for a period\nnot exceeding three months may be made without regard to existing eligible\nlists. (2)\nA\ntemporary appointment for a period exceeding three months, but not exceeding\nsix months may be made by the selection of a person from an appropriate\neligible list, without regard to the relative standing of such person on such\nlist. (3)\n\nAny further\ntemporary appointment beyond such six-month period, or any temporary\nappointment originally made for a period exceeding six months shall be made by\nthe selection of an appointee from among those graded highest on an appropriate\neligible list in accordance with section\n25.20\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (d) Temporary appointments without examination in exceptional cases. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the appointing authority\nmay authorize a temporary appointment, without examination, when the person\nappointed will render professional, scientific, technical or other expert\nservices on an occasional basis or on a full-time or regular part-time basis in\na temporary position established to conduct a special study or project for a\nperiod not exceeding 18 months. Such appointment may be authorized only in a\ncase where, because of the nature of the services to be rendered and the\ntemporary or occasional character of such services, it would not be practicable\nto hold an examination of any kind. (e) Emergency appointments. When an\nemergency requires that a position be filled pending appointment from a list or\nafter noncompetitive examination, the appointing authority may fill the\nvacancy. Such appointment shall not continue longer than one month without a\ncontinuance by the appointing authority. (f) Effect of temporary appointment on\neligibility for permanent appointment. The acceptance by an eligible of a\ntemporary appointment shall not affect his or her standing on the eligible list\nfor a permanent appointment, nor shall the period of temporary service be\ncounted as part of the probationary service in that position in the event of\nsubsequent permanent appointment. (g) Temporary or provisional appointment\nor promotion of permanent employee. When a permanent competitive class employee\nis given a temporary or provisional appointment or promotion to another\ncompetitive class position, he or she shall be deemed to be on leave of absence\nfrom his or her permanent position for the period of his or her service under\nsuch temporary or provisional appointment or promotion. He or she shall be\nentitled to return to his or her permanent position upon the termination of\nsuch temporary or provisional service. An employee who voluntarily elects to\nrelinquish his or her temporary or provisional status and return to his or her\npermanent position shall give reasonable notice thereof to the appointing\nauthority.
