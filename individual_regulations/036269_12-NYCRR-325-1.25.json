Medical Care means\nsymptomatic, palliative, maintenance treatment, services, or supplies. When the\n\nMedical Care is to or for a part of the body or condition covered by the\n\nMedical Treatment Guidelines as set forth in section\n324.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle, the employer or insurance carrier (or third-party administrator) is\nrequired to provide such Medical Care which is consistent with the Medical\n\nTreatment Guidelines or, if applicable, an approved variance from such\nguidelines. (2)\n\nThe employer or\ninsurance carrier (or third-party administrator) is liable for the payment of\nmedically necessary care, services, and supplies to the claimant when it has\naccepted the claim or the claim has been established as compensable by the\n\nBoard. When the Medical Care is to or for a part of the body covered by the\n\nMedical Treatment Guidelines and the claim has been accepted or established as\ncompensable, the employer or insurance carrier (or third-party administrator)\nshall be obligated to pay for all Medical Care, in the amount set forth in the\napplicable fee schedule, or in any other amount as agreed to by the Treating\n\nMedical Provider and payor, that is: (i) within the criteria of the medical treatment guidelines incorporated by\nreference pursuant to section\n324.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle and is based on correct application of such guidelines; (ii)\nwithin a proper variance from the\n\nMedical Treatment Guidelines in accordance with the requirements of section\n324.3\n(a) (2), or\nhas been authorized pursuant to section\n325-1.4\nor Part 441of this\n\nTitle; (iii)\nagreed to by the\nemployer or insurance carrier (or third-party administrator); or\n(iv)\nas ordered by the Board pursuant to\nstatute or regulation.

Bills\nshall be submitted to the employer or insurance carrier (or third-party\nadministrator) within 120 days from the day the Medical Care was rendered. Bills submitted in any other format or outside this time requirement shall not\nbe eligible for an award by the Chair under the provisions of the Workers'\nCompensation Law as described herein. When Medical Care was rendered prior to\n\nJanuary 1, 2020, the bill for such care shall be submitted within 120 days from\n\nJanuary 1, 2020 (April 30, 2020). (2)\n\nHospitals shall submit bills for\nout-patient hospital services to the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) using the New York State Universal Data Set\nspecification as described in 10 NYCRR section 400.18 and Appendices C-2 and\nC-3 and such additional specifications as are approved by the Commissioner of\n\nHealth. Bills shall be submitted within 120 days from the last day of Medical\n\nCare. Bills submitted in any other format or outside this time requirement\nshall not be eligible for an award by the Chair under the provisions of the\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law as described herein. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, upon an\napplication in writing to the Chair, the Chair may for good cause shown excuse\na delay in the submission of the bill to the insurance carrier or employer (or\nthird-party administrator). (c) Payment of bills for Medical Care. (1)\n\nThe employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator), within 45 days after the bill has been received\nshall pay the bill or shall notify the physician, occupational or physical\ntherapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social worker, acupuncturist, hospital, or other provider of Medical Care, the claimant and claimant's attorney if\napplicable, and the Board in the format prescribed by the Chair (which may be\nelectronic) for such purpose that the bill is not being paid and the reasons\nfor non-payment. If the employer or insurance carrier (or third-party\nadministrator) objects to payment of all or part of the bill for reasons\nconcerning its legal liability for payment, the legal objections shall be made\nin the format prescribed by the Chair for such purpose and submitted to the\nphysician, occupational or physical therapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social\nworker, acupuncturist, hospital, or other provider of Medical Care, the\nclaimant and claimant's attorney if applicable, and the Board simultaneously\nwith any other objections to the bill. If the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) objects to payment of all or part of the bill for\nreasons concerning the value of the treatment performed or the amount billed, the valuation objections shall be made in the format prescribed by the Chair\nfor that purpose and submitted to the physician, occupational or physical\ntherapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social worker, acupuncturist, hospital, or other provider of Medical Care, the claimant and claimant's attorney if\napplicable, and the Board simultaneously with any other objections to the bill. However, if the only objection is that the amount billed for the particular\n\nCurrent Procedural Terminology (CPT) code is in excess of the appropriate fee\nschedule for the region where the services were provided, the insurance carrier\nor employer (or third-party administrator) may instead file its explanation of\nbenefits form. If the employer or insurance carrier (or third-party\nadministrator) objects to payment of all or part of the bill for one or more of\nthe Medical Treatment Guidelines objections set forth in paragraph (7) of this\nsubdivision, the objections shall be placed in the format prescribed by the\n\nChair (which may be electronic), along with the basis for the objection, and\nsubmitted to the physician, occupational or physical therapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, or psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social worker, acupuncturist, hospital, or other provider of\n\nMedical Care, the claimant and claimant's attorney if applicable, and the Board\nsimultaneously with any other objections to the bill. (2)\n\nIf the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) objects to only a portion of the bill submitted, it\nshall pay the uncontested portion within 45 days and file objections to the\nremaining portion as indicated herein. (3)\n\nIf the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) has not objected in the manner described herein to\nthe payment of the bill within 45 days of submission, it shall be liable for\npayment of the full amount billed up to the maximum amount established in the\napplicable fee schedule. The Board shall not review any objection made\nthereafter. (4)\n\nLegal, valuation, and Medical Treatment Guidelines objections shall be made simultaneously in the\nformat prescribed by the Chair (which may be electronic). (5)\n\nValuation objections as to the amount of\nthe bill include, but are not limited to, contentions that the bill is\nexcessive and not in accordance with the pertinent fee schedule; has not been\nproperly pro-rated or apportioned between providers; involves concurrent, duplicative, or overlapping services; uses improper current procedural\nterminology codes; is not in accordance with the Ground Rules limitation in the\nappropriate official workers' compensation fee schedule; is rendered too\nfrequently; involves unnecessary or excessive hospitalization; or involves a\nphysician, occupational or physical therapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social\nworker or acupuncturist treating outside the scope of practice. (6)\n\nLegal objections as to the liability of\nthe employer or insurance carrier (or third-party administrator) to pay\ninclude, but are not limited to, contentions that the claim has been\ncontroverted and liability has not been resolved; prior authorization for the\nspecial medical service was not granted; treatment was not causally related to\nthe compensable injury; treatment provided was outside of the preferred\nprovider organization; the medical report was not timely filed or was legally\ndefective; the medical appliance, program, or provider is not authorized under\nthe Workers' Compensation Law; or the bill is for evidentiary purposes and not\nfor treatment. Pursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 13(a), raising the\nissue of liability under Workers' Compensation Law section 25-a is not a valid\nlegal objection to payment of a bill for treatment. A legal objection that was\nnot properly raised in response to any applicable prior authorization request\nwill be denied. The employer or insurance carrier (or third-party\nadministrator) shall attach or identify the denial made to any applicable prior\nauthorization request to its legal objection. (7)\n\nThe Medical Treatment Guidelines\nobjections as to the liability of the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) to pay are: (i) the\ntreatment is not consistent with the Medical Treatment Guidelines and a\nvariance was not requested or approved by the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator), or the Board before the Medical Care was\nrendered; (ii)\nthe physician, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, licensed clinical\nsocial worker, or hospital varied from the Medical Treatment Guidelines, the\nphysician, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, licensed\nclinical social worker, hospital, or other provider of Medical Care, requested\nand received approval for a variance from the employer or insurance carrier (or\nthird-party administrator) or the Board before the Medical Care was rendered\nbut provided Medical Care other than what was covered by the variance; or\n(iii)\nthe physician, occupational or physical therapist, podiatrist, chiropractor, psychologist, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, licensed clinical social worker, acupuncturist, hospital or other legally permitted Medical Care provider\nmisapplied the Medical Treatment Guidelines. (iv)\nA Medical Treatment Guideline objection\nthat was not properly raised in response to any applicable prior authorization\nrequest will be denied. The employer or insurance carrier (or third-party\nadministrator) shall attach or identify the denial made to any applicable prior\nauthorization request to its legal objection. (d) Administrative award: a remedy for\nnon-payment of bills when no timely valuation objections are raised.
