(c) It shall be the responsibility of each\ntrack licensee to prevent any person not holding an occupational license from\ndoing or performing any act or acts at its track. (d) No person requiring a license from the\ncommission shall carry on any activities whatsoever upon the premises of a\nlicensed racing association unless and until he has been so duly licensed, except that any such person may apply for and receive a temporary license\npending action on his application for a license. (e) The application for a license shall be in\nwriting in such form as the commission may prescribe and contain such\ninformation as the commission may require and it shall be duly sworn to before\na notary public or commissioner of deeds. It shall be accompanied by the amount\nof the license fee therefor in such form as may be acceptable to the\ncommission. When so instructed by the commission or if it may be required by\nthe commission, the applicant shall file with such application, fingerprints\nand photographs. The fingerprints so obtained shall be transmitted by the\ncommission to any governmental agency, Federal or State, selected by the\ncommission for the purposes of establishing identity and previous criminal\nrecord, if any, of the applicant. (f) Upon the commission's request, an\napplicant for an occupational license shall furnish to the commission such\nrecords or information whether relating to service in the armed services, treatment for any physical or mental condition, confinement in any institution\nor any other information or records which may be deemed necessary by the\ncommission.

For the purposes of this rule, the\nstockholders or members who bear to each other the relationship of persons\nmarried to each other, parent and child, or any other blood relationship with\neither of such parents shall be regarded collectively as one stockholder or\nmember, as the case may be.

If the commission shall find that the\napplicant fails to meet any of said conditions, it shall not grant such license\nand it shall notify the applicant of the denial.
