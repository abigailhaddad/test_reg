Tit. 20 § 541.6 - Production machinery and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1105(b) and (c)(3), (5); 1115 (a)(12)\n(a) Machinery and equipment which\nbecomes realty. If a contractor, in the performance of a contract, is\nrequired to purchase and install production machinery and equipment that\nqualifies for the manufacturer's exemption provided for in section\n1115 (a)(12)\nof the Tax Law\nand such machinery and equipment subsequently becomes part of the real\nproperty, the contractor is required to obtain from the customer a properly\ncompleted certificate of capital improvement and an exempt use certificate\nwhich identifies the machinery and equipment that qualifies for the\nmanufacturer's exemption and which, upon installation, becomes part of the real\nproperty. The contractor then may purchase such machinery or equipment exempt\nfrom the New York State and local taxes, including the sales and use taxes in\n\nNew York City, upon issuance of a properly completed contractor exempt purchase\ncertificate to his supplier. (b) Machinery and equipment which\nremains tangible personal property. If a contractor purchases production machinery and\nequipment which qualifies for the manufacturer's exemption provided for in\nsection\n1115 (a)(12)\nof the Tax Law\nand such machinery and equipment retains its identity after installation as\ntangible personal property, the contractor must obtain from his customer a\nproperly completed exempt use certificate which identifies the machinery and\nequipment that qualifies for the manufacturer's exemption. The contractor then\nmay purchase such machinery and equipment exempt from all state and local sales\ntaxes upon issuance of a properly completed contractor exempt purchase\ncertificate.

The cost of such assembly becomes\npart of the selling price of the machinery and equipment. However in order for\nthe charge by the contractor to the manufacturer to be exempt as a service to\nproperty being resold, the contractor must obtain a resale certificate from the\nmanufacturer.

When a contract is on a lump-sum basis to furnish and install machinery and\nequipment involving on-site assembly and installation charges, reasonable\nengineering estimates may be used to determine the amount of the price relating\nto the taxable installation after on-site assembly has been\ncompleted. (2)\n\nOn-site assembly is\ncompleted at the point where the machinery and equipment is assembled into a\ncompleted unit. Any further charges are charges for installing, maintaining and\nservicing machinery and equipment and may be subject to local sales and use\ntaxes including the sales and use tax applicable in New York City in accordance\nwith subdivision (c) of this section. Such charges with respect to production\nmachinery and equipment are exempt from the State tax.

Such charges with respect to production machinery and equipment are\nexempt from the State tax. (e) Charges for repairing, servicing, or maintaining.
