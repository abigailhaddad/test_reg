Such plans must be submitted to and approved\nby this office before a social services district's mailout process can be\nimplemented. Concurrently with the submission of the plan, or anytime\nthereafter, a social services district may request, and the office may approve, a waiver of the provisions set forth in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision. The office may rescind the approval of any eligibility\nmailout plan or suspend such process when circumstances make such action\nappropriate.

When the verified data indicates\nan increase in need, action shall be taken immediately to increase the grant\nfor the next payment period possible under the existing payment procedure. An\nappropriate entry shall be made in the case record of any such change in grant, and the basis for it. Such reduction or increase in grant involves a\nreauthorization for a continuing grant in a different amount, while a\ndiscontinued grant may involve the following action: (1)\n\nCase closed. This is a final terminal\naction, signifying that the case is no longer eligible for financial assistance\nin that public assistance program.
