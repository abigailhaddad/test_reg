A horse to be driven by a full-time employee of\nanother driver in the race shall be considered as racing from the same stable. If a race is divided into two or more divisions, such starters shall be seeded\ninto separate divisions where possible, first on the basis of ownership and by\nstable, then on the basis of training. The divisions in which they compete and\ntheir post positions shall be drawn by lot. Whenever such horses are coupled in\nthe same race, the presiding judge shall approve the second and additional\ndrivers. (1)\n\nExcept for stakes races with a\npurse of $25,000 or more, horses trained by the same trainer but owned by\ndifferent, separate owners may be uncoupled. The presiding judge has the\ndiscretion to couple such horses, however, to protect the interests of the\nwagering public. Trainers with an ownership interest in more than one horse\nmust have their horses coupled. (2)\n\nExcept for stakes races with a purse of $100,000 or more, horses with common\nownership may be uncoupled. The presiding judge has the discretion to couple\nsuch horses, however, to protect the interests of the wagering\npublic. (b) Except by\nexpress permission of the commission, coupled entries are prohibited in\novernight events. (c) After post\npositions have been drawn, horses may be coupled as an entry (or uncoupled, if\nerroneously coupled) but such race, as divided and as post positions have been\ndrawn, shall be final.
