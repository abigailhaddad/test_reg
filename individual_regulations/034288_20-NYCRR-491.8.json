  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.8 - Surrender of licenses and decals and requisite destruction of decals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 509(5), 528(a), (b)\n(a) Significant changes in the circumstances\nsurrounding the original issuance of a New York State fuel use tax license and\ndecal or an IFTA license and decals may result in the need to surrender the\nlicense to the department for cancellation and/or destroy any reproductions of\nsuch license and all applicable decals. Generally, the surrender of licenses\nand/or the destruction of all reproductions of such license and of decals shall\nbe at the direction of the department, as in the case of the issuance of\ncorrected licenses or the suspension or revocation of licenses and decals. However, where any change in circumstances significantly alters the nature of\nthe qualified motor vehicle for which a New York State fuel use tax decal or\nIFTA decals were issued, such decal(s) must be immediately destroyed without a\nspecific request by the department to do so. Additionally, where any change in\ncircumstances significantly alters the nature of the carrier to whom the\nlicense and decal(s) were issued, such license must be immediately surrendered\nand all reproductions of such license and the decal(s) destroyed or, in the\ncase of unused IFTA decals, returned to the department, without a specific\nrequest by the department to do so. Any transfers of licenses and decals that\nare not specifically authorized by this Article are invalid and immediately\nresult in the revocation of the New York State fuel use tax license and decal\nor IFTA license and decals issued to the carrier, or carriers that are parties\nto such transfer. (b) A New York\n\nState fuel use tax decal or IFTA decals must be destroyed within five days\nafter: (1)\nany change in ownership of the\nqualified motor vehicle or if the qualified motor vehicle is in any manner\nretired from service; (2)\nthe\nqualified motor vehicle for which they were issued becomes no longer subject to\nthe provisions of article 21-A of the Tax Law; or\n(3)\nthe activities of the qualified motor\nvehicle for which they were issued change in such a manner as to render the\ndecal(s) unnecessary. Thus, for example, decal(s) must be destroyed when a\nqualified motor vehicle is sold, retired from service, no longer operated on\nthe public highways of this State (or, in the case of IFTA decals, any other\nIFTA jurisdiction), modified so that such vehicle no longer meets the\ndefinition of a qualified motor vehicle, or will now be used in all operating\njurisdictions exclusively for exempt purposes. (c) (1)\n\nThe\n\nNew York State fuel use tax license and decal or IFTA license and decals are\npersonal to the carrier to whom they are issued and are not transferable among\ncarriers. Thus, except as provided herein, within five days after the carrier\nceases to operate qualified motor vehicles, or reorganizes its business in a\ndifferent form (other than a mere change of identity), the New York State fuel\nuse tax license or IFTA license issued to the carrier must be surrendered for\ncancellation and all reproductions of such license and the decal(s) must be\ndestroyed (or in the case of unused IFTA decals, returned to the department). In addition to any other meaning, a New York State fuel use tax license and\ndecal or an IFTA license and decals will be deemed transferred, if any change\nin partnership interest occurs, or if shares of stock in a corporate carrier\nare acquired by any person such that the person owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent (25 percent or more in the case of a carrier having four\nor fewer shareholders) of the number of shares of voting stock of such\ncarrier. (2)\n\nThe bequest or\ninheritance of a New York State fuel use tax license and decal or an IFTA\nlicense and decals from a deceased carrier directly to: (i) an ancestor of the decedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the decedent; (iii)\na lineal descendant of the decedent, of\nthe decedent's spouse, or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal descendant\ndescribed in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, will not, of itself, be\nconsidered a transfer of such a license and decal(s) that will operate as\ngrounds to immediately revoke such license and decal(s), provided the\ndepartment is promptly notified. However, such bequest or inheritance will\ncause such revocation 90 days after the death of the carrier. At such time, the\n\nNew York State fuel use tax license or IFTA license must be immediately\nsurrendered to the department and the decal(s) issued in conjunction with such\nlicense must be immediately destroyed or, in the case of unused IFTA decals, returned to the department. (d) (1)\nA\ncarrier operating a qualified motor vehicle pursuant to a lease or other\nagreement may, or must, depending upon the provisions of the leasing agreement\nand the terms of that agreement (as set forth in detail in section\n491.2\n[a]\nof this Part), operate such qualified motor vehicle under the New York State\nfuel use tax license and decal or IFTA license and decals issued to the owner\nof the qualified motor vehicle. This activity will not be considered a transfer\nof licenses and decals or grounds for revocation. In a case where a carrier\nother than the owner obtains a New York State fuel use tax license and decal or\nan IFTA license and decals for the qualified motor vehicle, that carrier must\ndestroy its decal(s) within five days after the termination of the lease or\nother agreement that authorizes the use or control of the qualified motor\nvehicle. In the event that the lease or other agreement is immediately renewed\nor extended and the same carrier continues to operate the qualified motor\nvehicle at issue, the decal(s) need not be destroyed until five days after the\nend of the renewal or extension. Further, in the case of an IFTA licensee, where such carrier is operating other qualified motor vehicles pursuant to such\nlicense, the carrier must retain such license. If such carrier is not operating\nany qualified motor vehicles pursuant to such license, the carrier may\nsurrender the license to the department or retain the license until such\nlicense expires or is suspended or revoked. However, if the carrier retains\nsuch license, the carrier is responsible for filing fuel use tax returns even\nwhere the carrier has no activity during a return period. (2)\n(i) Where the owner of a qualified motor vehicle has obtained a New York State fuel\nuse tax license and decal or an IFTA license and decals for the qualified motor\nvehicle and the use or control of the qualified motor vehicle is subsequently\nconveyed to another carrier who also obtains a New York State fuel use tax\nlicense and decal or an IFTA license and decals, as the case may be, for the\nqualified motor vehicle, the owner is not required to surrender its license to\nthe department or to destroy its decal(s). In such a case, the owner's license\nmust be held in abeyance by the owner and the decal(s) must remain affixed to\nthe qualified motor vehicle even though the decal(s) that have been issued to\nthe carrier operating the qualified motor vehicle will also be affixed to such\nqualified motor vehicle. (ii)\n\nIn\nthe alternative, where the owner has no qualified motor vehicles on which the\nowner must report and pay the fuel use tax, the New York State fuel use tax\nlicense or IFTA license issued to the owner of the qualified motor vehicle may\nbe surrendered to the department and all reproductions of such license and any\ndecals issued to the owner may be destroyed or, in the case of unused IFTA\ndecals, returned to the department in order to relieve the owner from having to\nfile fuel use tax returns. (3)\n\nPursuant to the joint administration\nprovisions of section 528(a) of article 21-A of the Tax Law, where a carrier\noperating qualified motor vehicles exclusively in New York State or a carrier\nengaged in interstate commerce not required to obtain an IFTA license must\nobtain a New York State fuel use tax license in accordance with the provisions\nof section\n491.3\n(c) of this Part (combined highway use tax permit/fuel use tax license), the\nhighway use tax provisions with respect to surrender of permits and stickers\nand requisite destruction of stickers for carriers operating under a lease or\nother agreement (see section\n474.6\nof this Title) shall be applicable to such carrier. (e) A New York-based IFTA carrier, in good\nstanding with the department, whose base jurisdiction changes during the\ncalendar year, is allowed to maintain such carrier's New York IFTA license and\ndecals for the remainder of the calendar period, but shall not be eligible to\nrenew such carrier's New York IFTA license in the succeeding calendar\nyear. (f) The Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance may take possession, and a carrier shall surrender such\ncarrier's New York State fuel use tax license and decal or IFTA license and\ndecals that have been suspended or revoked and any license and decal(s) that\nare being fraudulently carried in or displayed on, as the case may be, a\nqualified motor vehicle. The department may also take possession, and a carrier\nshall surrender any New York State fuel use tax license and decal or IFTA\nlicense and decals unlawfully carried or displayed by a carrier other than the\ncarrier to whom the license and decal(s) were issued. The department may direct\nany peace officer, acting pursuant to the officer's special duties, any police\nofficer, any employee of the Department of Taxation and Finance or of the\n\nDepartment of Transportation, or any person designated by any other\njurisdiction to enforce the provisions of the IFTA to take possession of such\nlicense and decal(s).
