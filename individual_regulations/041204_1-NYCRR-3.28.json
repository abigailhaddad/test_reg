  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 3.28 - Cooling of milk, milk products, whey, condensed milk products and condensed whey-item 17p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All raw milk\nand milk products shall be maintained at a temperature of 45° F (7° C) or less\nuntil processed. (b) All whey for\ncondensing shall be maintained at a temperature of 45° F (7° C) or less; or\n145° F (63° C) or greater until processed. (c) All pasteurized milk and milk products, pasteurized whey and condensed milk products except those to be dried\nimmediately, shall be cooled immediately in approved equipment to a temperature\nof 45° F (7° C) or less. All pasteurized milk and milk products, pasteurized\nwhey and condensed milk products shall be stored at a temperature of 45° F (7°\nC) or less until further processing. If surge tanks or balance tanks are used\nbetween the evaporator and the drier, such tanks shall hold the product at a\ntemperature of 150° F (66° C) or more, or shall be completely emptied and\ncleaned after each four hours of operation. (d) During the crystallization process, all\ncondensed whey shall be cooled to 45° F (7° C) or less within 18 hours of\ncondensing. (e) Each refrigerator\nroom in which milk, milk products or whey are stored shall be equipped with an\nindicating thermometer which complies with the specifications of Appendix 9 of\nthis Title. Such thermometer shall be located in the warmest zone of the\nrefrigerator room. (f) Each storage\ntank shall be equipped with an indicating thermometer, the sensor of which\nshall be located to permit the registering of the temperature of the contents\nwhen the tank contains no more than 20 percent of its calibrated capacity. Such\nthermometer shall comply with the specifications of Appendix 9 of this\n\nTitle. (g) All surface coolers\nshall comply with the following: (1)\n\nThe\nsections of open-surface coolers shall be installed so as to leave a gap of at\nleast 0.25 inch between the header sections to permit easy cleaning. (2)\n\nWhere header ends are not completely\nenclosed within the cooler covers, condensation or leakage from the headers\nshall be prevented from entering the product by so shaping the exposed header\nfaces, above and below all gaps, that condensation is directed away from the\ntubes, and by using deflectors at the bottom of the headers, or by shortening\nthe bottom trough. (3)\n\nThe location\nof supports of cooler sections shall prevent drip from entering the milk, milk\nproducts, whey, condensed milk products and condensed whey. (4)\n\nAll open-surface coolers shall be\nprovided with tightfitting shields which protect the product from contamination\nby flies, dust, drip, splash or manual contact. (h) Recirculated cold water which is used in\ncoolers and exchangers, including those systems in which a freezing point\ndepressant is used, shall be from a safe source and protected from\ncontamination. Such water shall be tested semiannually and shall be potable. Recirculated water systems which become contaminated through repair work or\notherwise shall be properly treated and tested before being returned to use. Freezing point depressants, when used in recirculating systems, shall be\nnontoxic. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n3.28\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
