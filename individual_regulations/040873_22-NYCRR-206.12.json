Where a party is\nprevented from filing a note of issue and certificate of readiness because a\npretrial proceeding has not been completed for any reason beyond the control of\nthe party, the court, upon motion supported by affidavit, may permit the party\nto file a note of issue upon such conditions as the court deems appropriate. Where unusual or unanticipated circumstances develop subsequent to the filing\nof a note of issue and certificate of readiness which require additional\npretrial proceedings to prevent substantial prejudice, the court, upon motion\nsupported by affidavit, may grant permission to conduct such necessary\nproceedings. (d) Striking note of\nissue. Within 20 days after service of a note of issue and certificate of\nreadiness, any party to the action may move to strike the note of issue, upon\naffidavit showing in what respects the action is not ready for trial, and the\ncourt may strike the note of issue if it appears that a material fact in the\ncertificate of readiness is incorrect, or that the certificate of readiness\nfails to comply with the requirements of this section in some material respect. After such period, no such motion shall be allowed except for good cause shown. At any time, the court on its own motion may strike a note of issue if it\nappears that a material fact in the certificate of readiness is incorrect, or\nthat the certificate of readiness fails to comply with the requirements of this\nsection in some material respect. (e) Restoration of note of issue. A motion to\nrestore a note of issue struck pursuant to this section shall be supported by a\nproper and sufficient certificate of readiness and by an affidavit by a person\nhaving first-hand knowledge showing that there is merit to the action, satisfactorily showing the reasons for the acts or omissions which led to the\nnote of issue being struck from the calendar, stating meritorious reasons for\nits restoration and showing that the action is presently ready for\ntrial.
