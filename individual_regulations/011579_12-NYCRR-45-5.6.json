Open air\nlocations are those locations where the viewing stand is not in a tent or an\nentirely enclosed building. (3)\n\nThe\ncapacity of doorways, gateways, corridors, passageways, ramps and stairways in\nopen air viewing stands shall be at the rate of 50 persons per 12 inches of\nclear width. The minimum width of any doorway or gateway used by the public\nshall be three feet, and of any corridor, passageway, ramp, or stairway, four\nfeet (for a capacity of 150 and 200 persons respectively). Every such means of\nexit shall be increased in width cumulatively towards the outside exit doorways\nor gateways so that a clear width will be provided at the rate of 12 inches for\neach 50 persons served.

All seats and footboard members\nshall be designed for live loads of not less than 120 pounds per linear\nfoot. (2)\n\nViewing stands shall be\ndesigned, constructed and maintained to resist, with or without live load, a\nhorizontal wind load of 30 pounds per square foot of all vertical projections\nof the stand. (3)\n\nViewing stands\nshall be designed, constructed and maintained to resist a horizontal swaying\nforce applied to the seats in a direction parallel to the length of the seats, of 24 pounds per linear foot of seats, and in a direction perpendicular to the\nlength of the seats, of 10 pounds per linear foot of seats. (d) Limit on combustible\nconstruction. (1)\n\nAny viewing stand of wood\nframe construction located in the open air shall be separated from other\nstructures of combustible construction by an open space at least 15 feet\nwide. (2)\n\nNo permanent viewing\nstand of wood frame construction shall have more than one tier of\nseats. (3)\n\nThe highest level of any\nseating in a viewing stand of wood frame construction shall not exceed 12 feet\nabove the ground or other surface below it if such viewing stand is within a\ntent, nor 20 feet above the ground or other surface below it if such viewing\nstand is otherwise located. (4)\n\nIf\nthe space beneath any viewing stand is used for any purpose except exitways, the portion of the space so used shall be fully enclosed by ceilings and\npartitions having a fire- resistance rating of at least one hour.

(3)\n\nSeats not permanently\nfixed in a viewing stand shall be used only when arranged in rigid units of\nfive or more and secured against displacement. Such seats shall not exceed 15\nin any row between aisles nor 10 in any row between an aisle and a railing or\nwall. (4)\n\nStep-type continuous\nseats with or without backs shall not exceed 30 in any row between aisles nor\n15 between an aisle and a railing or wall. (5)\n\nIn a viewing stand of wood frame\nconstruction, step-type continuous seats with or without backs shall not exceed\n20 in any row between aisles nor 10 between an aisle and a railing or\nwall. (6)\n\nRows of seats with backs\nshall be at least 27 inches back to back, if without backs, 22 inches.

No crossaisles\nshall be required between rows of seats located between an aisle and a railing\nor wall. (3)\n\nBoxes do not\nconstitute banks of seats but their capacity shall be included in the\ncalculation of aisle and exit widths. Boxes shall have direct access to a\ncrossaisle. (4)\n\nThe distance\nbetween exits from a crossaisle shall not exceed 100 feet, except that where\nthe length of a crossaisle does not exceed 50 feet it may be served by only one\nexit.
