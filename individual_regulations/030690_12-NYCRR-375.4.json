  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 375.4 - Wages to be used in determining benefit rate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In determining benefit rate for plan\nevaluation, the normal weekly earnings paid under regular employment practices\nwill generally be used as \"wages.\" However, if for any extended period of time\nemployees regularly receive extra wages, including, without limitation, overtime or premium pay, it may be required that benefits be determined on the\ntotal of normal and such extra wages. (b) If, under a plan, benefits are to be\nprovided in accordance with wage classifications, the maximum of each wage\nclassification will generally be used as the weekly wage in determining the\nbenefit rate for plan evaluation. For those employees whose average weekly wage\nis $20 or more and less than $40 per week, the benefit rate for plan evaluation\nwill be computed by dividing the actual cash benefit to which the employee is\nentitled by $40. If the employer submits a wage schedule showing for each wage\nclassification a distribution of employees by wages (up to weekly wages equal\nto twice the maximum weekly benefit payable under section\n204\nof the Workers' Compensation Law), the weekly wage to be used for plan\nevaluation will be the average wage of the employees included in the\nclassification, but not less than $5 under the maximum wage of the\nclassification. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n375.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
