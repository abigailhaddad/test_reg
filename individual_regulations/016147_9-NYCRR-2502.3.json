  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2502.3 - Application for adjustment of initial legal regulated rent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Fair market rent appeals. (1)\n(i) The\ntenant of a housing accommodation for which the initial legal regulated rent\nwas established under section\n2501.1\nof this Title based upon the\nrent reserved in a lease or other rental agreement which became effective on or\nafter January 1, 1974 may file within 90 days after notice has been received\npursuant to section\n2503.1\nof this Title, an\napplication on forms prescribed by the division for adjustment of the initial\nlegal regulated rent on the allegation that such rent is in excess of the fair\nmarket rent. This right is limited to the first tenant taking occupancy on or\nafter January 1, 1974, except where such tenant had vacated the housing\naccommodation prior to the service by the owner of the notice required by\nsection\n2503.1\nof this Title. In such\nevent, any subsequent tenant shall also have a right to file an application for\nadjustment of the legal regulated rent until the owner mails the required\nnotice and 90 days shall have elapsed without the filing of an application by a\ntenant continuing in occupancy during said 90-day period. However, no fair\nmarket rent appeal may be filed after six years from the date of initial\noccupancy of the housing accommodation. Once a fair market rent appeal has been\nfiled, no subsequent tenant may file such appeal. (ii)\n\nThe tenant must allege in such appeal: (a) that the initial rent is in excess of the\nfair market rent; and\n(b) facts\nwhich, to the best of his or her information and belief, support such\nallegation. (iii)\n\nSuch\nappeal shall be dismissed where: (a) it is\nfiled more than 90 days after the certified mailing to the tenant of the form\nrequired by section\n2503.1\nof this Title; or\n(b) it is filed more than six years from the\ndate of the initial stabilized tenancy. (2)\n\nThe division shall be guided by\nguidelines promulgated by the Rent Guidelines Board with jurisdiction over the\nhousing accommodation for the determination of fair market rents and, upon a\ndetermination that the initial legal regulated rent is in excess of the fair\nmarket rent, the division shall establish by order a new legal regulated rent, and further order a refund of any excess rent paid since the base date or the\ndate of the commencement of the tenancy, whichever is later, provided that no\nrefund order shall relate to a period more than two years prior to the local\neffective date as defined in section\n2500.4\nof this Title. The order\nshall direct the affected owner to make the refund of any excess rent to the\ntenant in cash, check or money order, or as a credit against future rents over\na period not in excess of six months, and that if the landlord does not make\nthe refund, that the order may be enforced or the rent offset by the tenant in\nthe same manner as a division order awarding penalties pursuant to section\n2506.1\n(h)(5)\nof\nthis Title. In the absence of collusion between the present owner and any prior\nowner, where no records sufficient to establish the fair market rent were\nprovided at a judicial sale, or such other sale effected in connection with, or\nto resolve, in whole or in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage foreclosure\naction or other judicial proceeding, an owner who purchases upon such sale or\nsubsequent to such sale shall not be liable for excess rent collected by any\nowner prior to such sale. An owner who did not purchase at such sale, but who\npurchased subsequent to such sale shall also not be liable for excess rent\ncollected by any prior owner subsequent to such sale to the extent that such\nexcess rent is the result of excess rent collected prior to such\nsale. (3)\n\nCourt-appointed\n\nReceivers. A Receiver who is appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to\nreceive rent for the use or occupation of a housing accommodation shall not, in\nthe absence of collusion or any relationship between such Receiver and any\nowner or other Receiver, be liable for excess rent collected by any owner or\nother Receiver, where records sufficient to establish the fair market rent have\nnot been made available to such Receiver. (b) Unique or peculiar circumstances. (1)\n\nThe landlord or tenant of a housing\naccommodation described in section\n2501.1\nof this Title may, within 60\ndays of the local effective date of the act or the commencement of the first\ntenancy thereafter, file an application on forms prescribed by the division to\nadjust the initial legal regulated rent on the grounds that the presence of\nunique or peculiar circumstances materially affecting the legal regulated rent\nhas resulted in a rent which is substantially different from the rents\ngenerally prevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing\naccommodations. (2)\n\nThe division\nmay grant an appropriate adjustment of the initial legal regulated rent upon\nfinding that such grounds do exist, provided that the adjustment shall not\nresult in a legal regulated rent substantially different from the rents\ngenerally prevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing\naccommodations. (3)\n\nAny such\nadjustment shall consider in addition to the factors contained in paragraph (2)\nof this subdivision, the equities involved and the general limitation that such\nadjustment can be put into effect without dislocation and hardship inconsistent\nwith the purposes of the act and with due regard for preserving the regulated\nrental housing market. (4)\nregulation of the rent for the housing accommodation under the PHFL or any\nother State or Federal law shall not in and of itself constitute a unique and\npeculiar circumstance within the meaning of this subdivision. Any change in\neconomic circumstances arising as a consequence of the termination of such\nprior regulation of rent may only bead dressed in a proceeding for adjustment\nof the legal regulated rent under subdivisions (e) and (f) of section\n2502.4\nof this Part.
