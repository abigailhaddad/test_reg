Tit. 7 § 305.2 - Deprivation order\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nprovision of an essential service to an incarcerated individual shall not be\ndenied, restricted, or limited unless the facility deputy superintendent for\nsecurity, officer of the day (O.D.), or higher-ranking authority determines\nthat providing such an essential service would cause a threat to the safety or\nsecurity of the facility, or the safety, security, or health of the\nincarcerated individual, staff or other incarcerated individuals. Initial\nauthorization may be given verbally but must be confirmed in writing within 24\nhours with a copy to the superintendent, and one copy to the incarcerated\nindividual. The writing shall state specific facts and reasons underlying the\ndetermination. (b) Each deprivation\norder must be reviewed on a daily basis by the deputy superintendent for\nsecurity or, in his or her absence, the O.D. or higher-ranking authority. If\nthe O.D. is not present at the facility (weekends or holidays), the watch\ncommander will personally review the deprivation order and sign the form\nindicating approval or discontinuance. This review shall be documented by the\nreviewing officer, who shall initial and date the order, adding any comments\nthat are appropriate. (c) Any\ndetermination made pursuant to this Part shall be reviewed by the facility\nsuperintendent at intervals not to exceed seven days. If a deprivation order\nhas been in effect for seven days, the superintendent and incarcerated\nindividual shall receive a written notice of renewal on the seventh day and, thereafter, every seventh day that the order remains in effect. (d) The written order and any notice of\nrenewal thereafter must briefly state the reason(s) for the deprivation and\ncontain the following notice to the incarcerated individual: \"You may write to\nthe deputy superintendent for security or his/her designee to make a statement\non the need for continuing the deprivation order.\"\n(e) A review conducted by the facility\nsuperintendent pursuant to this Part which may impact an incarcerated\nindividual's health shall include consultation with qualified facility health\nstaff who shall record, in writing, any determination that continuing the\ndeprivation would not risk significantly compromising the health of the\nincarcerated individual. Following each such review, the facility\nsuperintendent shall document, in writing, whether such determination shall\ncontinue or cease, and state the specific facts and reasons underlying the\ncontinuance or termination. (f) Any\ndeprivation order depriving an incarcerated individual of minimum standard\nitems (e.g., bedding, clothing, etc.) for \"mental health\" or \"psychiatric\"\nreasons must be approved by an appropriate clinical professional or, in their\nabsence, by the ranking facility health service professional. (g) If there is an order depriving an\nincarcerated individual of in-cell water, the incarcerated individual's cell\nwater shall be turned on for at least 10 minutes, five times per day, as\nfollows: approximately 30 minutes prior to the service of each meal, once at\nthe beginning of tour I (nights), and once during tour III (evenings) in\naccordance with a schedule established by the superintendent. Staff shall\nnotify the incarcerated individual prior to turning on the water and record the\ntimes that the water is turned on and off in the unit activity log. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
