  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 451.2 - Consumer deposits-residential\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Deposit. (1)\nA municipality or cooperative in the\n\nState of New York which purchases power from the authority may require, subject\nto the restrictions set forth in this section, a new or current residential\ncustomer to whom such municipality or cooperative shall supply electricity to\ndeposit a sum of money, which shall be in the amount specified in paragraph (9)\nof this subdivision, to secure payment for such electricity or for the rental\nof fixtures, instruments and facilities actually supplied. (2)\n\nFor the purposes of this section, a new\nresidential customeris an applicant for electric service to a dwelling unit\nwhich such customer uses for his or her residential purposes and where business\nrates do not apply to the service, and who does not qualify as a current\nresidential customer. A current residential customer is a customer who receives\nelectric service to a dwelling unit which such customer uses for his or her\nresidential purposes and where business rates do not apply to the service. A\ncurrent residential customer includes an applicant for electric service who has\ntransferred dwelling units within a municipality's or cooperative's service\nterritory and for whom there is a recent payment history. A seasonal customer\nis a person who applies for and receives electric service periodically each\nyear, intermittently during the year, or at other irregular intervals. A\nshort-term customer is a person who requires electric service for a specified\nperiod of time that does not exceed one year. A customer who receives\ncontinuous electric service for more than one year shall not be considered a\nseasonal or short-term customer. (3)\n\nUnless authorized by the authority under\nparagraph (6) of this subdivision, no municipality or cooperative shall require\nany new residential customer to post a security deposit as a condition of\nreceiving electric service, unless such new customer is a seasonal or\nshort-term customer as defined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nAs of December 1, 1985, no municipality\nor cooperative shall, unless authorized by the authority under paragraph (6) of\nthis subdivision, require a current residential customer, other than a\ndelinquent customer, to post a security deposit, and deposits held on September\n1, 1986 shall be returned promptly to nondelinquent residential customers, and\nin no event later than the next bill for service thereafter. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements of\nparagraph (4) of this subdivision: (i) A\nmunicipality or cooperative may continue to demand deposits as a condition of\nreceiving electric service from customers who are seasonal customers or\nshort-term customers as defined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (ii)\nA municipality or cooperative may\nrequire a deposit from a current residential customer as a condition of service\nif that customer is delinquent in payment of his or her electric\nbills. (iii)\nA customer is\ndelinquent for the purpose of a deposit assessment if such customer: (a) accumulates two consecutive months of\narrears without making reasonable payment, defined as one half of the total\narrears, of such charges before the time that a late payment charge would\nbecome applicable, or fails to make a reasonable payment on a bimonthly bill\nwithin 50 days after the bill is due, provided that the municipality or\ncooperative requests such deposit within two months of such failure to pay; or\n(b) had electric service\nterminated for nonpayment during the preceding six months. A municipality or cooperative intending to require a deposit\nunder clause (a) of this subparagraph shall provide a customer with written\nnotice, at least 20 days before it may assess a deposit, that the failure to\nmake timely payment will permit the municipality or cooperative to require a\ndeposit from such customer. (iv)\n\nIf a municipality or cooperative\nrequires a deposit from a current residential customer who is delinquent by\nvirtue of his or her failure to make a reasonable payment of arrears, as\nprovided in this paragraph, it shall permit such customer to pay the deposit in\ninstallments over a period not to exceed 12 months. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the requirements of\nparagraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision, a municipality or cooperative may\ndemand and hold deposits from new or current residential customers as a\ncondition of electric service if the authority, after investigation and\nhearing, so authorizes such practice, upon a finding that the collection and\nmaintenance of such deposits is cost-effective for the municipality or\ncooperative as a whole without regard to the municipality's or cooperative's\ncash flow and the availability of capital to the municipality or\ncooperative. (7)\n\nNo municipality or\ncooperative shall require any person it knows to be a recipient of public\nassistance, supplemental security income benefits or additional State payments, to post a security deposit after November 30, 1985, nor shall any municipality\nor cooperative hold such deposit from such known recipient after January 31, 1986. (8)\n\nNo municipality or\ncooperative shall demand after November 30, 1985, or hold after January 31, 1986, a deposit from any new or current residential customer it knows is 62\nyears of age or older unless such customer has had service terminated by the\nmunicipality or cooperative for nonpayment of bills within the preceding six\nmonths. (9)\n\nIn any case where\ncustomer deposits are authorized by this section, a municipality or cooperative\nmay require a new or current residential customer to deposit a reasonable\namount of money, not greater than twice the average monthly bill for a calendar\nyear, except in the case of electric space-heating customers, where deposits\nmay not exceed twice the estimated average monthly bill for the heating season, in order to secure payment for services actually rendered or for the rental of\nfixtures, instruments and facilities actually supplied. (b) Calculation and crediting of interest. Every municipality or cooperative shall allow every residential customer, from\nwhom a deposit is required, interest on the amount deposited at a rate\nprescribed quarterly by the municipality or cooperative. Each quarter, the\nmunicipality or cooperative shall select the lowest interest rate available\nfrom a pool of local area bank savings accounts. The selected rate shall be\nused to accrue interest on consumer deposits each quarter. A weighted average\ninterest rate shall be calculated using the quarterly interest rates over the\nperiod a customer's deposit is held; and shall be paid to the customer upon the\nreturn of the deposit. (c) Return of\ndeposit. If any customer is not delinquent in the payment of bills, as defined\nin paragraph (a)(5) of this section, during the one-year period from the\npayment of the deposit by the customer, the deposit shall be refunded promptly\nwithout prejudice to the municipality's or cooperative's right to require a\nfuture deposit in the event that the customer thereafter becomes\ndelinquent.
