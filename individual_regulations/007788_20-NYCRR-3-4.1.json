  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 3-4.1 - Definition of investment capital\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 208(4) and (5))\n(a) The term \"investment capital\" means\ninvestments described in paragraphs (1), (2) or (3) of this subdivision, as\nfurther described in this Subpart. (1)\n\nStocks\nthat satisfy the criteria in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph\nshall be referred to as \"actual investment capital\". (i) The stocks satisfy the definition of a\ncapital asset under IRC section 1221 at all times during the taxable year in\nwhich the taxpayer owned the stocks. (ii)\n\nThe stocks are held for investment by\nthe corporation for more than one year. For purposes of determining the length\nof the holding period, the principles of IRC section 1223 shall be followed\nunder the circumstances described in that section. (iii)\n\nThe dispositions of the stocks are, or\nwould be, treated by the corporation as generating long-term capital gains or\nlosses under the IRC. (iv)\n\nIf the\nstocks are acquired on or after January 1, 2015, the stocks have never been\nheld for sale to customers in the regular course of business at any time after\nthe close of the day on which they were acquired. (v) The stocks are clearly identified in the\ncorporation's records as held for investment in the manner described in section\n3-4.3\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nStocks acquired during the\ntaxable year that meet the criteria in subparagraphs (i), (iii), (iv), and (v)\nof paragraph (1) of this subdivision that have been held as investment by the\ncorporation for one year or less at the time the corporation files its original\nreport for the taxable year and are still held at such time shall be referred\nto as \"presumed investment capital\". (3)\n\nIn the case of a corporation incorporated\nand commercially domiciled outside of New York State, stocks not described in\nparagraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, debt obligations, and other\nsecurities shall be \"constitutionally protected investment capital\" if the\nincome or gain from such stocks, debt obligations, and other securities cannot\nbe apportioned to New York State as the result of United States constitutional\nprinciples. In the case of a combined report, commercial domicile shall be\ndetermined on an entity by entity basis. (b) Stock in a corporation that is conducting\na unitary business with the taxpayer or any corporation included in a combined\nreport with the taxpayer, stock in a corporation included in a combined report\nwith the taxpayer pursuant to the commonly owned group election, and stock\nissued by the taxpayer or any corporation included in a combined report with\nthe taxpayer will not constitute investment capital. For purposes of this\nsection, if one corporation owns or controls, directly or indirectly, less than\n20% of the voting power of the stock of a second corporation, that second\ncorporation will be presumed to not be conducting a unitary business with the\nfirst corporation. (c) If a\ncorporation is a partner in a partnership and the corporation is using the\naggregate method to compute its tax, the corporation's proportional part of the\nstock owned by the partnership may qualify as investment capital if\nrequirements for investment capital specified in subdivision (a) of this\nsection are satisfied at the partnership level and the partnership and\ncorporate partner are not unitary with the corporation that issued the\nstock. (d) The amount of investment\ncapital is determined as follows: (1)\nascertain the average value of each item of investment capital; (2)\nascertain the net value of each such item\nby subtracting from the average value of each such item the average liabilities\nthat are directly or indirectly attributable to that item; and\n(3)\nadd the net values so arrived\nat. (4)\n\nProvided, if the sum\ndetermined in paragraph (3) is less than zero, then the amount of investment\ncapital is deemed to be zero. (e) Investment capital does not include any\ninvestments in stock the income from which is excluded from entire net income\npursuant to the provisions of section 208(9)(c-1). Investment capital will be\ncomputed without regard to liabilities directly or indirectly attributable to\nsuch investments, but only if air carriers organized in the United States and\noperating in the foreign country or countries in which the corporation has its\nmajor base of operations and in which it is organized, resident or\nheadquartered (if not in the same country as its major base of operations) are\nnot subject to any tax based on or measured by capital imposed by such foreign\ncountry or countries, or any political subdivision thereof, or, if taxed, are\nprovided an exemption, equivalent to that provided for herein, from any tax\nbased on or measured by capital imposed by such foreign country or countries\nand from any such tax imposed by any political subdivision\nthereof.
