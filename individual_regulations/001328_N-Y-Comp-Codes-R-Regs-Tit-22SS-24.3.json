  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22§ 24.3 - Annual leave\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An employee shall be entitled to\ncombined vacation, personal business and religious holiday leave of 20 workdays\nannually and, unless otherwise provided in this Part, shall be entitled on his\nor her anniversary date to one additional day for each completed year of\ncontinuous service in the Unified Court System up to a maximum of 27 workdays\nannually. Thereafter, such employee shall earn annual leave for completed\nbiweekly pay periods at a rate equal to 26 days for 26 such pay periods, and\nalso shall earn one additional day of annual leave on his or her anniversary\ndate. (b) An employee\nwho has completed 25 years of service in the Unified Court System or the State\nshall be entitled on his or her anniversary date to one additional annual leave\nday each year. (c) An\nemployee who has completed 30 years of service in the Unified Court System or\nthe State shall be entitled on his or her anniversary date to one additional\nannual leave day each year, in addition to the one additional annual leave day\nprovided in subdivision (b) of this section. (d) Employees who were officially\nentitled prior to April 1, 1977 to receive additional annual leave days and\nreligious holiday leave days, and who have received such additional leave days\ncontinuously thereafter, may continue to receive such leave, provided that such\nleave is limited to a maximum of 30 annual leave days and three religious\nholiday leave days per year. Religious holiday leave days shall be credited on\na calendar-year basis. Such days may be used only in the calendar year in which\nthey are credited and may not be carried over from one calendar year to the\nnext. Religious holiday leave days may be used only for recognized days of\nreligious observance for which the faith requires its members to make religious\nobservance. (e) Employees entering the service of the Unified Court System shall be entitled to\naccrue annual leave from their initial date of hire. An employee shall not earn\nannual leave credits for any biweekly pay period unless he or she is in\nfull-pay status for at least seven workdays during such biweekly pay\nperiod. (f) A\npart-time, per diem or hourly paid employee eligible to earn annual leave\ncredits pursuant to this Part shall earn annual leave credits as provided\nherein, but such employee's total pay when absent on such leave shall be the\namount which would have been due if the employee had worked his or her usual\nnumber of hours or days during such period. (g) The time at which annual leave may\nbe drawn by an employee shall be subject to the prior approval of the\nadministrative authority. (h) Annual leave credits shall be used\nin units of not less than 15 minutes. (i) No accumulation of annual leave\ncredits in excess of 54 days may be carried over from one fiscal year to the\nnext. Any such accumulation in excess of 54 days at the end of a fiscal year\nshall be converted into sick leave. The administrative authority may grant an\nemployee specific permission to exceed the 54-day maximum for a period of no\nlonger than one year where the needs of the court or agency require that the\nemployee postpone his or her vacation. (j) A leave of absence without pay, or a\nresignation followed by reemployment in the Unified Court System within one\nyear following such leave of absence or resignation, shall not constitute an\ninterruption of continuous service for the purposes of this Part; provided, however, that leave without pay for more than six months or the period between\nresignation and reemployment during which the employee is not in the service of\nthe Unified Court System, shall not be counted in determining eligibility for\nadditional annual leave credits under this Part. (k) To the extent practicable, annual leave credits shall be used prior to appointment, promotion, reassignment or transfer to a different court or agency. The court or agency to\nwhich an employee is appointed, promoted, reassigned or transferred shall\ncredit him with all of his accumulated annual leave credits not used prior to\nsuch appointment, promotion, reassignment or transfer. (l) In the event the\nadministrative authority determines that operations in a particular court or\ncourts will be recessed for at least four consecutive workdays, the\nadministrative authority may require employees during such recess to charge up\nto four days' annual leave in each fiscal year.
