  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 7.1 - Certain activities with respect to credit cards\n\nState Regulations\nA company wished to engage in the business of gathering\ncredit card purchase slips from a number of small merchants and presenting the\nsame for payment to the bank having issued the cards. By such presentment in\nbulk the company obtained a more favorable purchase rate from the card issuer\nthan would have been available to each merchant making smaller individual\npresentments. Part of the saving was to be retained by the company, and the\nrest to be passed on to the participating merchants. The department was asked\nwhether this activity required licensing under the Banking Law. In response the department indicated that article XI-B of the\n\nBanking Law would only require licensing of the activity described if the\ncompany was in the business of \"purchasing or otherwise acquiring\" the\ncredit-card obligation involved. If title to the obligations at no time vested\nin the company and its activity was solely in the nature of providing\nbookkeeping and bailment services to the merchants as their agent, neither\narticle XI-B nor any other Banking Law provision would require licensing. The\ndepartment understood that payment arrangements between issuing banks and\nmerchants were not such as to constitute the company as one which receives\nmoney for transmission or transmits the same, an activity which would require\nlicensing under article XIII of the Banking Law. DATED: June 1, 1974\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 7.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
