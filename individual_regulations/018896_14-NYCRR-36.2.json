Tit. 14 § 36.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Discharge means\nthe act of ending an inpatient facility's legal responsibility for a patient\nunder articles 29, 31, 33, or 35 of the Mental Hygiene Law. Such act shall not\nprevent the continuation of a discharged patient in treatment as an\noutpatient. (b) Conditional release\nmeans the act of ending the inpatient period of service to a patient without\nending the facility's legal tie to the patient under articles 29, and 31 or 33\nor 35 of the Mental Hygiene Law. The conditions involved in the conditional\nrelease are ordinarily that the facility will provide or arrange for the\nprovision of continuing services on an outpatient basis and that the patient\nwill accept such services. Normally, it is preferable for a patient receiving\noutpatient services to be discharged and treated on only outpatient status. Conditional release includes \"convalescent care\", \"community status\" and\n\"family care\" as those terms are used in the Social Services Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n36.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
