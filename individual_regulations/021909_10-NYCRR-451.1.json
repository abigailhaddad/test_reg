Tit. 10 § 451.1 - Accelerated depreciation\n\nState Regulations\n\nMethod of depreciation which generates a greater amount\nof expense in the earlier life of an asset, and less expense in the later\nyears, than the straight-line method. The purposes for adopting such a method\nwould be: (a) operation of plant or\nequipment at more than normal speed, use or capacity; (b) a useful or economic life materially less\nthan physical life; (c) an\nexcessive cost being written off during what is estimated to be the high-price\nperiod; and\n(d) tax advantages\narising from the use of declining-balance and sum-of-the-years\nmethods. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n451.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
