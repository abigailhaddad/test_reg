  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1200.1.13 - Organization as client\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When a lawyer employed or retained\nby an organization is dealing with the organization's directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, and it appears that the\norganization's interests may differ from those of the constituents with whom\nthe lawyer is dealing, the lawyer shall explain that the lawyer is the lawyer\nfor the organization and not for any of the constituents. (b) If a lawyer for an\norganization knows that an officer, employee or other person associated with\nthe organization is engaged in action or intends to act or refuses to act in a\nmatter related to the representation that (i) is a violation of a legal\nobligation to the organization or a violation of law that reasonably might be\nimputed to the organization, and (ii) is likely to result in substantial injury\nto the organization, then the lawyer shall proceed as is reasonably necessary\nin the best interest of the organization. In determining how to proceed, the\nlawyer shall give due consideration to the seriousness of the violation and its\nconsequences, the scope and nature of the lawyer's representation, the\nresponsibility in the organization and the apparent motivation of the person\ninvolved, the policies of the organization concerning such matters and any\nother relevant considerations. Any measures taken shall be designed to minimize\ndisruption of the organization and the risk of revealing information relating\nto the representation to persons outside the organization. Such measures may\ninclude, among others: (1)\nasking reconsideration of the matter; (2)\nadvising that a separate legal\nopinion on the matter be sought for presentation to an appropriate authority in\nthe organization; and\n(3)\nreferring the matter to higher\nauthority in the organization, including, if warranted by the seriousness of\nthe matter, referral to the highest authority that can act in behalf of the\norganization as determined by applicable law. (c) If, despite the lawyer's\nefforts in accordance with paragraph (b), the highest authority that can act on\nbehalf of the organization insists upon action, or a refusal to act, that is\nclearly in violation of law and is likely to result in a substantial injury to\nthe organization, the lawyer may reveal confidential information only if\npermitted by Rule 1.6, and may resign in accordance with Rule 1.16. (d) A lawyer representing an\norganization may also represent any of its directors, officers, employees, members, shareholders or other constituents, subject to the provisions of Rule\n1.7. If the organization's consent to the concurrent representation is required\nby Rule 1.7, the consent shall be given by an appropriate official of the\norganization other than the individual who is to be represented, or by the\nshareholders.
