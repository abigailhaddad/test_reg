(1)\n\nRemedy selection and implementation of\nremedial actions under department approved work plans set forth in ECL article\n56, title 5 are not subject to review set forth in ECL article 8 and its\nimplementing regulation (6 NYCRR Part\n617\n), provided that design and\nimplementation of the remedy do not: (i) commit the department or any other agency to specific future uses or actions; and\n(ii)\nprevent evaluation of a\nreasonable range of alternative future uses of or actions on the remediation\nsite. (2)\n\nIn the event\nthat the use of the site, as set forth in the record of decision for the site, changes during the implementation of the remedial program, the department may\nmake a new determination whether such remedial action remains protective of\npublic health and the environment and, if the department makes such a finding, it will require that the remedial action be modified to be protective of public\nhealth and the environment. (3)\n\nThe\nexemption set forth in this subdivision is in addition to, and not in place of, other exemptions that apply as set forth in Parts 617 or 618 of this Title\n(e.g., the enforcement exemption).
