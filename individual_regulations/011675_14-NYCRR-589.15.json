  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 589.15 - Determination of Self-Preservation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nevacuation capacity of recipients is a function of both the ability of the\nrecipients to evacuate and the assistance provided by staff. Determination of\nsatisfactory ability to evacuate should be made prior to admission to a\nresidential program. Such a determination may be reached by review of the\napplicant's history and a face-to-face interview which shows a capacity to\nevacuate equivalent to that of the general public. When uncertainty exists, a\ntime drill may be used for a more objective measurement. (b) Subsequent to admission; for a crisis\nresidence, timed drills should be used to regularly evaluate the level of\nevacuation capability of program recipients. Translation of drill times to\nevacuation capability may be determined as: (1)\nthree minutes or less, prompt; (2)\nover three minutes but not in excess of\n13 minutes, slow. (3)\n\nEvacuation\ncapability is based on the time of day or night when evacuation of the facility\nwould be the most difficult (i.e., sleeping residents or fewer staff present). Recipients needing assistance in evacuating should be assisted by staff to the\nextent that assistance would be available at the time of day or night in an\nactual emergency. (c) Fire exit drills shall be conducted in a crisis residence at least monthly at\nvarying times of the day and night. Some drills may be announced in advance to\nthe recipients. The drills shall involve the actual evacuation of all residents\nto an assembly point as specified in the emergency plan and shall provide\nresidents with experience in exiting through all exits. Actual exiting from\nwindows shall not be necessary to meet the requirements of this section. Opening the window and signaling for help shall be an acceptable alternative. Records should indicate the time to evacuate, date and times of day, location\nof simulated fire origin, the escape paths used and comments relating to\nresidents who did not evacuate within the required time. (d) Recipients and prospective individuals\nshall only reside in or be admitted to a type of residential program\nappropriate to the individual's evacuation capability. (1)\n\nIf a recipient or prospective individual\nis clearly capable of prompt evacuation, that individual may be admitted to or\nremain in any residential program of a type appropriate to their functional\nlevel. (2)\n\nIf a recipient or\nprospective individual fails to demonstrate a capability for prompt evacuation\nduring a fire drill, the matter should be completely documented in the fire\ndrill log and in the recipient's record. Immediate steps should be taken to\nrelocate the recipient to a location within the residence which will allow for\neasier egress for such time as is necessary until another fire drill can be\nconducted (no more than 14 days) and the recipient's behavior observed\nagain. (3)\n\nIf any recipient or\nprospective individual would be excluded from a residential program because of\ninability to evacuate within the time limits above, an evaluation shall be\nconducted as described in the most current recognized edition of the National\n\nFire Protection Association 101A, Alternative Approaches to Life Safety. Said\ncodes are published by the National Fire Protection Association, One\n\nBatterymarch Park, Quincy, MA 02269 and are available for review at the\n\nDepartment of State, Division of Administrative Rules, One Commerce Plaza, 99\n\nWashington Avenue, Albany, NY 12231 and the Office of Mental Health, Bureau of\n\nInspection and Certification, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY 12229. If the\nresultant E-score yields an evacuation difficulty level of prompt, the\napplicant or resident shall not be excluded for failure to evacuate within the\nrequired time limit. If the resultant E-score yields an evacuation difficulty\nlevel of slow, the applicant or resident shall not be excluded solely for\nfailure to evacuate within the required time frame from a facility that is\nconstructed to meet the slow evacuator standards of the current recognized\nedition of the Life Safety Code.
