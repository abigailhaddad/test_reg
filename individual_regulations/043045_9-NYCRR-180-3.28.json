  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 180-3.28 - Loss of Good Behavior Allowance for Sentenced Youth\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The potential loss of good behavior\nallowance is a specific disciplinary sanction that may impact a sentenced\nyouth's release date, based on a serious violation while in detention. This\nsanction, when applied reasonably and with fairness, can be an essential\nelement in promoting safety and protecting the health and security of all\npersons within a specialized secure detention facility. This sanction works in\ntandem with section\n180-3.14, by providing an\nadditional response for a sentenced youth who has a serious infraction. It does\nnot take the place of the Behavioral Intervention Policies of the facility, as\nrequired by section\n180-3.14\nof this subpart. (b) Limitations on the loss of good behavior\nallowance: (1)\n\nThis sanction shall only be\napplied to the degree necessary to maintain the youth's behavior within\nacceptable limits and reinforce a commitment to maintain the overall standards\nof behavior for the facility. (2)\n\nWhen evaluating a loss of good behavior allowance, the behavior of the youth\nshall be viewed in light of his or her capacity and the efforts made by the\nyouth within the limits of his or her capacity. (3)\n\nThis sanction must be administered in a\nfair, impartial and expeditious manner, and must be consistent. A sound program\nrelies upon certainty and promptness of action, not upon severity of the\nmeasures. (4)\n\nThe loss of good\nbehavior allowance must never be arbitrary or capricious or administered for\nretaliation or revenge. (c) A commission of any Penal Law offense is\nprohibited and may be referred to law enforcement agencies for prosecution, in\naddition to the sanction of loss of good behavior allowance. (d) A specialized secure detention facility's\nrules, established pursuant to section\n180-3.14, \"Behavioral Intervention\n\nPolicies,\" shall apply to the loss of good behavior allowance. Such rules\nshould have varying levels and consequences. For example: (1)\n\nLevel I rules - basic standards of\nconduct for all areas of program\n(2)\n\nLevel II rules - prohibited acts that\nconstitute serious misbehaviors\n(3)\n\nLevel III rules - prohibited acts that constitute very serious\nmisbehaviors\n(e) A\nspecialized secure detention facility shall establish procedures for\ndetermining a loss of good behavior allowance which shall include: (1)\n\nSteps to review an incident, dismiss the\ncharges, refer the matter back to the behavioral support system, or approve the\ncharges to go forward for review. (2)\n\nTimeframes, criteria for review, appeal\nprocedures, and the facility director's appointment of staff to implement the\nprocess. (3)\nA requirement for\nyouth assistants, who are staff designated by the facility director, to assist\nthe youth through the process. If the youth assistant is waived by the youth, a\nyouth assistant may still be assigned, particularly in cases where such\nassistance would enable the youth to adequately comprehend the case and respond\nto the charge(s). (4)\nA requirement\nfor assistance for non-English speaking or hearing-impaired youth. In the case\nof a non-English speaking youth, a translator shall be provided to assist the\nyouth. A deaf or hearing-impaired youth who uses sign language to communicate\nshall receive the assistance of a qualified sign language interpreter. A\nhearing-impaired youth who uses an amplifier or other device, as a reasonable\naccommodation, shall have the opportunity to use such device. (5)\n\nEducation of all facility staff and\nsentenced youth on the established facility rules and the consequences of rule\nviolations as soon as possible after admission on a sentence. (6)\nA requirement that all processes\nregarding loss of good time, including charges, hearings, decisions, appeals\nand any other outcomes be fully documented. (f) Consistent with the requirements of this\nsection, a specialized secure detention facility shall develop written policies\nand procedures, which shall be submitted to OCFS for approval.
