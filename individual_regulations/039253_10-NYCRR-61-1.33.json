Tit. 10 §§ 61-1.33 - Principal investigator; responsibilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nOn behalf of the institution, the PI is responsible for complying fully with this Subpart in conducting any recombinant DNA activity. (a) PI: general. As part of this general responsibility, the PI shall: (1)\ninitiate or modify no recombinant DNA activity requiring approval by the IBC prior to initiation (section\n61-1.20\nof this Subpart: class III-A or III-B) until that activity, or the proposed modification thereof, has been approved by the institutional biosafety committee (IBC) and has met all other requirements of this Subpart; (2)\ndetermine whether recombinant DNA activity is covered by section\n61-1.20\nof this Subpart: class III-C; (3)\nreport within 30 days to the IBC and the commissioner all significant problems with and violations of this Subpart and all significant recombinant DNA activity-related accidents and illnesses; (4)\nreport to the IBC and to the commissioner new information bearing on provisions of this Subpart; (5)\nbe adequately trained in good microbiological techniques; (6)\nadhere to IBC-approved emergency plans for dealing with accidental spills and personnel contamination; and\n(7)\ncomply with shipping requirements for recombinant DNA molecules. (b) Submissions by the PI to NIH. The PI shall: (1)\nsubmit information to NIH (ORDA) in order to have new host-vector systems certified; (2)\npetition NIH, with notice to the IBC, for exemptions to the NIH guidelines (see section\n61-1.20\nof this Subpart: class III-D); (3)\npetition NIH, with concurrence of the IBC, for approval to conduct experiments specified in section\n61-1.20\nof this Subpart: class III-A; (4)\npetition NIH for determination of containment for experiments requiring case-by-case review; and\n(5)\npetition NIH for determination of containment for experiments not covered by this Subpart or the NIH guidelines. (c) Submissions by the PI to the IBC. The PI shall; (1)\nmake the initial determination of the required levels of physical and biological containment in accordance with this Subpart or the NIH guidelines; (2)\nselect appropriate microbiological practices and laboratory techniques to be used in the recombinant DNA activity; (3)\nsubmit the initial recombinant DNA activity protocol if covered under section\n61-1.20\nof this Subpart: class III-A, III-B or III-C (and also subsequent changes--e.g.,changes in the source of DNA or host-vector system) to the IBC for review and approval or disapproval; and\n(4)\nremain in communication with the IBC throughout the conduct of the recombinant DNA activity. (d) PI responsibilities prior to initiating the activity. The PI is responsible for: (1)\nmaking available to the laboratory staff copies of the protocols that describe the potential biohazards and the precautions to be taken; (2)\ninstructing and training staff in the practices and techniques required to ensure safety and in the procedures for dealing with accidents; and\n(3)\ninforming the staff of the reasons and provisions for any precautionary medical practices advised or requested, such as vaccinations or serum collection. (e) PI responsibilities during the conduct of the activity. The PI is responsible for: (1)\nsupervising the safety performance of the staff to ensure that the required safety practices and techniques are employed; (2)\ninvestigating and reporting in writing to the commissioner, the biological safety officer (where applicable) and the IBC any significant problems pertaining to the operation and implementation of containment practices and procedures; (3)\ncorrecting work errors and conditions that may result in the release of recombinant DNA materials; and\n(4)\nensuring the integrity of the physical containment (e.g.,biological safety cabinets) and the biological containment (e.g., purity, and genotypic and phenotypic characteristics). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n61-1.33\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
