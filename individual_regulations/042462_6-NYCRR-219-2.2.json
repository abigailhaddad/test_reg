  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 219-2.2 - Emission limitations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Particulate\nemissions. No person may cause or allow an emission into the outdoor atmosphere\nof particulates from any incinerator at a facility subject to this Subpart in\nexcess of 0.010 grains per dry standard cubic foot of exhaust gas, corrected to\nseven percent oxygen. (b) Hydrogen\nchloride emissions. No person may cause or allow a running eight-hour average\nemission of hydrogen chloride from any incinerator at a facility subject to\nthis Subpart in excess of 10 percent by weight of the uncontrolled emissions\n(90 percent reduction) unless it is demonstrated that the stack concentration\nis less than 50 parts per million by volume (dry corrected to seven percent\noxygen). (c) Nitrogen oxides (NO\nx\n) emissions. (1)\n\nExcept as provided by paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, any facility\nsubject to this Subpart must apply best available control technology (BACT) to\nlimit emissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO\nx\n). (2)\n\nIf the facility is in a nonattainment\narea for nitrogen dioxide, or causes an increase in the ambient concentration\nin any nonattainment area for nitrogen dioxide which exceeds 1.0 microgram per\ncubic meter on an annual basis, it must comply with Part 231 of this Title and\nthe applicable State implementation plan. (3)\n\nIf the facility is in a nonattainment\narea for ozone, it must apply lowest achievable emission rate technology (LAER)\nto limit NO\nx\nemissions as may be required by either the\napplicable State implementation plan or a cumulative impact assessment of the\nproposed facility in combination with all existing and proposed NO\nx\nsources. The cumulative impact assessment will be\nconducted to evaluate the impact of NO\nx\nemissions on\nthe ambient ozone levels in accordance with the State Environmental Quality\n\nReview Act or article 3 of the ECL. (d) Dioxin emissions. (1)\n\nAny person who owns or operates a\nfacility subject to this Subpart must submit, as part of an application for a\npermit to construct a new facility and for each application to renew a\ncertificate to operate, a plan demonstrating to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner that all reasonable efforts and best management practices have\nbeen implemented to achieve reasonable progress toward minimization of dioxin\nequivalent emissions to a target value of 0.2 nanograms per dry standard cubic\nmeter (ng/dscm), corrected to seven percent oxygen. This plan will be used as\npart of the evaluation by the commissioner to establish the dioxin equivalent\nemission limit in the initial permit to construct and certificate to\noperate. (2)\n\nUpon completion of the\nemission tests required by section\n219-2.6\nof this Subpart, and\nfollowing review and acceptance of this test data, the commissioner will\nestablish a facility specific dioxin equivalent emission limit for the affected\nfacility. (i) This limit will reflect the\nupper boundary of a 95 percent confidence interval derived from the emission\ntest data. (ii)\n\nThis derivation\nwill be based on a minimum of 12 separate stack samples. (iii)\n\nThe upper boundary value of the 95\npercent confidence interval will be included as a dioxin equivalent emission\nlimit for the affected facility as a special condition in a modified\ncertificate to operate. (3)\n\nNo person may cause or allow a dioxin\nequivalent emission concentration in excess of 2 ng/dscm, corrected to seven\npercent oxygen, to be emitted from any affected emission source at a facility\nsubject to this Subpart based on emission testing. (4)\n\nIn addition to the above, the certificate\nto operate any emission source subject to these requirements will be\nconditioned to limit emissions of dioxin equivalents in accordance with section\n200.6\nof this Title. (e) Mercury emission limitations. In addition to the mercury requirements contained in 40 CFR Part\n60, Subpart\n\nEb, incorporated by reference in Part 200 of this Title (see Table 2, section\n200.10\n), the emission limitation\nfor mercury is 28 ug/dscm (corrected to seven percent oxygen) or 85 percent\nremoval, whichever is less stringent. (f) Compliance with mercury emission\nlimitations. Annual compliance is based on the average of the annual stack\ntests on each incinerator at the facility using the stack test procedures\ncontained in\n40 CFR\n60.58b(d)(2)\nincorporated by\nreference in 6 NYCRR Part\n200\n(see Table 1, section 200.9 of this Title). This\naverage of all the facility's incinerators must be in compliance with the\nemission limit of 28 ug/dscm (corrected to seven percent oxygen) or 85 percent\nremoval, whichever is less stringent. However, the average of annual stack\ntests on each incinerator at the facility must be in compliance with the\n\nFederal limit of 80 ug/dscm (corrected to seven percent oxygen) or 85 percent\nremoval, whichever is less stringent. Four years after the effective date of\nthis Subpart the averaging of the annual stack tests across all incinerators at\nthe facility will end and each of the facility's incinerators must be in\ncompliance with the emission limit of 28 ug/dscm (corrected to seven percent\noxygen) or 85 percent removal, whichever is less stringent. Emission control\ndevices must be kept in a satisfactory state of maintenance and repair in\naccordance with ordinary and necessary practices, standards and procedures, inclusive of manufacturer's specifications, required to operate such devices\neffectively. (g) Other emissions. In\nthe absence of a contaminant specific emission limitation or ambient air\nquality standard, the certificate to operate for any source subject to these\nrequirements will be conditioned to limit emissions in accordance with section\n200.6\nof this\n\nTitle. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n219-2.2\n\nThe environmental impacts of any proposed facility\nsubject to this Subpart must be identified and evaluated in accordance with\nsection\n617.14\n(f)(3)\nof\nthis Title with respect to the reasonably related short- and long-term effects, cumulative effects, and other associated environmental\neffects. State regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
