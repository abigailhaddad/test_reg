Tit. 6 §§ 365-2.3 - Registered facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnless otherwise exempt or required to obtain a permit\nunder Subpart 365-2 of this Part, facilities of the following types are subject\nto the registration provision of section\n360.15\nof this title. Each facility\nidentified in this section must obtain a registration from the Department but\nis not required to comply with section\n360.19\nof this Title. (a) A storage facility for radiological RMW, including used sharps or other used medical devices, at a radiopharmacy, provided the sharps or other medical devices were dispensed by the\nradiopharmacy, and the following conditions are satisfied. (1)\n\nIn addition to the container requirements\nprovided in Subpart 365-1 of this Part, radiological RMW must be stored at the\nradiopharmacy until radioisotopes have decayed to a background radiation level. Once decayed, the RMW can be stored for a maximum of 30 days. (2)\n\nThe radiopharmacy must have written\npolicies and procedures for the safe handling and storage of the waste within\nthe facility. (3)\n\nStorage areas for\nradiological RMW must be adequately sized for the volume of RMW generated\nbetween scheduled waste pick-ups by a transporter. (4)\n\nStorage areas for radiological RMW must: (i) display prominent signage indicating the\narea is used to store RMW; (ii)\nbe\ndesigned or equipped to prevent unauthorized access; (iii)\nbe designed or located to protect waste\nfrom the elements, and prevent access by vectors; (iv)\nhold the waste at a temperature that\nprevents rapid decomposition and resultant odor generation, if\nnecessary; (v) be appropriately\nventilated; (vi)\nbe of sufficient\nsize to allow clear separation of RMW from any other waste, if waste other than\nRMW is stored in the same area; and\n(vii)\nthe top of the stacked containers must\nnot be more than six feet above the level of the floor. The integrity of the\ncontainers must not be compromised by the manner of storage. (5)\n\nDecayed radiological RMW that\nleaves the radiopharmacy must be accompanied by an RMW tracking\ndocument. (b) Healthcare\nfacilities licensed pursuant to the Public Health Law that treat, store or\ndispose of RMW from other generators (pursuant to written agreements with or\namong other generators filed with the NYSDOH and the department) for treatment, or are not operated by the healthcare facility. The operator of the facility\nmust have and adhere to an operation plan for the handling and disposal of RMW. The operation plan is subject to department approval and must include the\nfollowing: (1)\nA method of receiving wastes\nwhich ensures that RMW is handled separately from other wastes until treatment\nor disposal is accomplished and which prevents unauthorized persons from having\naccess to or contact with the waste. (2)\nA method of unloading and processing of\nRMW which limits the number of persons handling the waste and minimizes the\npossibility of exposure of employees and the public using or visiting the\nfacility to RMW. (3)\nA method of\ndecontaminating emptied reusable RMW containers, transport vehicles or facility\nequipment which are known or believed to be contaminated with regulated medical\nwaste. (4)\n\nThe provision and\nrequired use of gloves and other protective clothing to protect any facility\nemployee who handles RMW. (5)\n\nThe\nmeans of decontamination of any person having had bodily contact with RMW while\ntransporting the waste to the treatment or disposal site or while handling or\ndisposing of the waste at the site. (6)\nA quantification of the maximum amount of\nRMW to be treated, stored, or disposed of per month. (7)\nA new or revised operation plan for\ntreatment, storage or disposal of RMW must be prepared whenever there is an\nincrease of more than 25 percent in the maximum quantity of RMW receiving\ntreatment, storage or disposal per month by the facility or when changes are\notherwise made in an existing operation plan. (8)\n\nThe treatment of RMW must comply with\nsections\n365-2.5, 2.6, and 2.7 of this\n\nSubpart. (9)\n\nThe facility must have\nprocedures to segregate RMW to be treated from other waste. (10)\n\nEach facility employee who will operate\ntreatment equipment must be trained in the proper use of the treatment\nequipment. (11)\n\nThe facility must\nmaintain records for the operation of the treatment unit. A log must be\nmaintained that includes the date, time, name of the employee operating the\nunit, the type and amount of RMW treated, and the dates and results of\ncalibration, validation and bio-challenge testing. (12)\n\nThe facility must maintain a contingency\nplan for emergencies and spill cleanup, which includes provisions for RMW\nstorage during emergency situations. All spills and emergency situations must\nbe immediately reported to the department. (13)\n\nApproval for acceptance of RMW at a\ntreatment, storage or disposal facility may be withdrawn by the department for\nnoncompliance with the operation plan. (c) As part of approval of a registration, any person who operates a facility for the treatment, storage and disposal of\nRMW must provide proof of liability insurance or other form of financial\nsecurity deemed sufficient by the department to meet all responsibilities in\ncase of release of RMW causing contamination.
