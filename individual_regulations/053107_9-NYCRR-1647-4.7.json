  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1647-4.7 - Use of reserve\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe reserve accumulated shall be available to make\nreplacements required to maintain or restore the utility, function or\nrevenue-producing capacity of the project. The classification of expenditures\nas \"replacements\" has been described in section\n1647-4.2\nas being predetermined by\n(a) the schedule of replacement reserve requirements and (b) the annual\noperating budget. The division, however, reserves the right to direct the\nclassification or reclassification of expenditures as \"replacements\". All\ncharges for replacements shall be made directly to account 2510, Replacement\n\nReserve. No charges for replacements shall be made to account 2511, Interest\n\nEarned on Reserve Fund Investments, or to account 2512, Gain or Loss on\n\nDisposition of Reserve Fund Investments, but balances available in the latter\naccounts may be transferred to account 2510 at the direction of the division or\nwith its prior authorization and approval. No charge shall be made to account\n2510 in excess of the credit balance therein or after said balance has been\nexhausted. Anticipated expenditures or commitments for replacements in excess\nof the balance available in account 2510 shall be submitted to the division for\nreview and approval before being made. Careful planning, budgeting and\nclassification, together with periodical review of replacement requirements\nshould, however, result in a reserve adequate to meet all requirements as and\nwhen they occur. No charges shall be made to account 2510, Replacement Reserve, unless it appears in an approved operating budget or has been approved by the\n\nDivision of Housing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1647-4.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
