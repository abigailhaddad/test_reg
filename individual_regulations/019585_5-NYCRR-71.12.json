  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 5 § 71.12 - Technical feasibility studies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A technical feasibility study must have been performed or updated within one\nyear of the date of submission of a program application to the department. Updates must include a recalculation of the paybacks of the original technical\nfeasibility study's proposed energy conservation improvements, based on current\nfuel costs. (b) Technical\nfeasibility studies with respect to a construction project must be prepared\nunder the supervision of and stamped with the seal and signature of a\nregistered architect or professional engineer. (c) A technical feasibility study must\ncontain the following information regarding the wastewater treatment project\nfor which program assistance is being requested: (1)\na detailed description of the improvement\nto be implemented, including the daily volume of wastewater to be treated, the\nimprovement in water quality projected to result from the project, and any\nnecessary sketches or diagrams; (2)\na detailed breakdown of project costs; (3)\nfor projects involving construction, the\nproposed construction-to-occupancy schedule and copies of the preliminary\narchitectural drawings, scope of work and schematics; (4)\nenergy calculations for the proposed\nwastewater treatment project, including: (i) simple payback, calculated by dividing the total installed cost of the project\npresented in the selected contractor's bid, or in the applicant's schedules and\nselected estimate in the case of an in-house project, by the projected annual\nenergy cost savings. Ongoing operation and maintenance costs, finance charges, and the cost of preparing and updating technical feasibility studies shall not\nbe included in the total installed cost; (ii)\na full explanation of the methodology\nused in calculating energy savings. The department may provide standard\ncalculation sheets, which must be used whenever provided. If standard\ncalculation sheets have not been provided by the department, the methodology\nused to calculate energy savings will be reviewed for adequacy and\nreasonableness by the department; (iii)\nall calculations, including units of\nmeasurement and formulae, of annual fuel use, and annual Btu and energy cost\nsavings, with all assumptions and parameters clearly presented. The annual Btu\nand energy cost savings shall be based on actual consumption records for the\napplicant's existing wastewater treatment system for the prior 12-month period, and shall not include savings from taxes, dollar savings due to switching to\nlower cost fuels, and other savings which may be deemed inappropriate by the\ndepartment. All formulae and calculations shall be based on generally accepted\nengineering standards and practices, and shall be reviewed for completeness and\nreasonableness by the department; and\n(5)\nevidence satisfactory to the department\nthat all applicable Federal, State and local permits, certificates and\napprovals have been applied for. (d) Conflict of interest prohibited. A person\nperforming a technical feasibility study is permitted to provide construction\nmanagement services to a program recipient, but such person may not be involved\nin the sale or installation of the proposed wastewater treatment\nproject. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 5\n§\n71.12\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
