An eligible rollover distribution is any distribution of\nall or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that\nan eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is\none of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently\nthan annually) made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the\njoint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the\ndistributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or\nmore; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under\nsection\n401(a)(9)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in\ngross income; and any other distribution(s) that is reasonably expected to\ntotal less than $200 during a year (determined without regard to the exclusion\nfor net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities). A portion\nof a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover distribution merely\nbecause the portion consists of after-tax employee contributions which are not\nincludible in gross income. However, such portion may be transferred only to an\neligible plan if the plan provides for separate accounting for amounts so\ntransferred (including interest thereon) including separately accounting for\nthe portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the\nportion of such distribution which is not so includible. (b) Eligible retirement plan.

Effective April 1, 2010, a distributee also\nincludes the member's non-spouse designated beneficiary. In the case of a\nnon-spouse beneficiary, the direct rollover may be made only to an individual\nretirement account or annuity described in section 480(a) or (b) of the\n\nInternal Revenue Code (\"IRA\"), that is established on behalf of the designated\nbeneficiary and that will be treated as an inherited IRA pursuant to the\nprovisions of section\n402(c)(11)\nof the Internal\n\nRevenue Code, as added by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. (d) Direct rollover. A direct rollover is a\npayment by the New York State and Local Retirement Systems to an eligible\nretirement plan specified by the distributee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
