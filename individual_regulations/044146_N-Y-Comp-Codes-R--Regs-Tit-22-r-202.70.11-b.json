  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.11-b - Privilege Logs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Meet and Confer: General. Parties\nshall meet and confer at the outset of the case, and from time to time\nthereafter, to discuss the scope of the privilege review, the amount of\ninformation to be set out in the privilege log, the use of categories to reduce\ndocument-bydocument logging, whether any categories of information may be\nexcluded from the logging requirement, and any other issues pertinent to\nprivilege review, including the entry of an appropriate non-\nwaiver\norder. To\nthe extent that the collection process and parameters are disclosed to the\nother parties and those parties do not object, that fact may be relevant to the\n\nCourt when addressing later discovery disputes. (b) Categorical Approach or\n\nDocument-By-Document Review. (1)\n\nThe preference in the Commercial\n\nDivision is for the parties to use categorical designations, where appropriate, to reduce the time and costs associated with preparing privilege logs. The\nparties are expected to address such considerations in good faith as part of\nthe meet and confer process (see paragraph (a) above) and to agree, where\npossible, to employ a categorical approach to privilege designations. The\nparties are encouraged to utilize any reasoned method of organizing the\ndocuments that will facilitate an orderly assessment as to the appropriateness\nof withholding documents in the specified category. For each category of\ndocuments that may be established, the producing party shall provide a\ncertification, pursuant to 22 NYCRR §\n130-1.1a, setting forth with\nspecificity those facts supporting the privileged or protected status of the\ninformation included within the category. The certification shall also describe\nthe steps taken to identify the documents so categorized, including but not\nlimited to whether each document was reviewed or some form of sampling was\nemployed, and if the latter, how the sampling was conducted. The certification\nshall be signed by the Responsible Attorney, as defined below, or by the party, through an authorized and knowledgeable representative. (2)\n\nIn the event the\nrequesting party refuses to permit a categorical approach, and instead insists\non a document-by-document listing on the privilege log, then unless the Court\ndeems it appropriate to issue a protective order pursuant to CPLR 3103 based\nupon the facts and circumstances before it, the requirements set forth in CPLR\n3122 shall be followed. In that circumstance, however, the producing party, upon a showing of good cause, may apply to the court for the allocation of\ncosts, including attorneys' fees, incurred with respect to preparing the\ndocument-by-document log. Upon good cause shown, the court may allocate the\ncosts to the requesting party. (3)\n\nTo the extent that a party insists\nupon a document-by- document privilege log as contemplated by CPLR 3122, and\nabsent an order to the contrary, each uninterrupted e-mail chain shall\nconstitute a single entry, and the description accompanying the entry shall\ninclude the following: (i) an\nindication that the e-mails represent an uninterrupted dialogue; (ii)\nthe beginning and ending\ndates and times (as noted on the e-mails) of the dialogue; (iii)\nthe number of e-mails\nwithin the dialogue; and\n(iv)\nthe names of all authors and recipients - together with\nsufficient identifying information about each person (e.g., name of employer, job title, role in the case) to allow for a considered assessment of privilege\nissues. (c) Special Master. In complex matters likely to raise significant\nis- sues regarding privileged and protected material, parties are encouraged to\nhire a Special Master to help the parties efficiently generate privilege logs, with costs to be shared. (d) Responsible Attorney. The attorney\nhaving supervisory responsibility over the privilege review shall be actively\ninvolved in establishing and monitoring the procedures used to collect and\nreview documents to determine that reasonable, good faith efforts are\nundertaken to ensure that responsive, non-privileged documents are timely\nproduced. (e) Court\n\nOrder. Agreements and protocols agreed upon by parties should be memorialized\nin a court order. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
