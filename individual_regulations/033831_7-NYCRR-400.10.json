  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 400.10 - Supplemental relocation payments, loss of favorable mortgage financing, incidental expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn addition to other payments and benefits authorized by\n\nState law, individuals and families displaced from dwellings on real property\nacquired by the Department of Correctional Services, who were in occupancy on\nor after July 1, 1971 are entitled to supplemental relocation payments, payment\nfor loss of favorable mortgage financing, and incidental expenses, in\naccordance with the following criteria and eligibility standards. (a) General requirements to receive\nreplacement housing payments. (1)\n\nIn addition\nto the occupancy requirements as specifically enumerated herein, a displaced\nperson is otherwise eligible for the appropriate payments when he relocates and\noccupies a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling within one year, beginning on the\nlatter of the following dates: the date on which the owner receives final\npayment from the State for legal damages directly connected with the\nacquisition of the dwelling unit in negotiated settlements; or in the event an\namicable settlement is not reached, the date on which the full amount of the\noffered fair market value is made available to the owner; or the date required\nto move from the dwelling acquired, or the date on which the eligible occupant\nactually moves from the dwelling acquired; if in fact this latter date is\nearlier than the date required to move. The date required to move is here\ndefined and elsewhere in this section as that date specified in writing by the\n\nState, by which the property must be vacated. (2)\n\nApplication for payments under this\nsection shall be in writing on forms prescribed by the commissioner. The\napplication must be filed no later than six months after the expiration of the\none-year period specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except that in\ncases litigated in the Court of Claims, the six month period shall start from\nthe date of final judgment of that court. (3)\n\nIf two or more eligible families occupy\nthe same family dwelling unit, each family is eligible for a replacement\nhousing payment if they relocate to separate dwelling units. (4)\n\nIf two or more eligible individuals with\nno identifiable head of household occupy the same single family dwelling unit\nthey are considered as one \"family\" for replacement housing payment purposes. When all individuals do not relocate to decent, safe and sanitary housing the\ndepartment shall determine and pay those individuals who do not relocate into\ndecent, safe and sanitary housing a pro-rata share of the amount that would\nhave been received if all of the individuals had relocated together in the same\nownership or rental status they had at the time of initiation of\nnegotiations. (b) Supplemental payments; owner-occupants over 180 days who repurchase. (1)\nA displaced owner-occupant of a dwelling\nmay receive additional payments, the combined total of which may not exceed\n$15,000, for the additional cost necessary to purchase replacement housing; to\ncompensate the owner for the loss of favorable financing on his existing\nmortgage in the financing of replacement housing; and to reimburse the owner\nfor incidental expenses incident to the purchase of replacement housing when\nsuch costs are incurred as specified herein. (2)\n\nThe owner-occupant is eligible for such\npayments when: (i) he is in occupancy at the\ninitiation of negotiations for the acquisition of the real property, in whole\nor in part; or\n(ii)\nhe is in\noccupancy at the time he is given a written notice by the State that it is\ntheir intent to acquire the property by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least\n180 consecutive days immediately prior to the date of vacation of initiation of\nnegotiations whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe purchases and occupies a decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in paragraph (a)(1) of\nthis section. (3)\n\nThe\nreplacement housing payment is the amount, if any, which when added to the\namount for which the State acquired his dwelling, equals the actual cost which\nthe owner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling, or the\namount determined by the department as necessary to purchase a comparable\ndwelling, whichever is less. The State's determination of the amount necessary\nto purchase a comparable dwelling may be made on the basis of either of the two\nfollowing methods: (i) The State may\nestablish a schedule of probable selling prices of comparable dwellings in the\nvarious types of dwellings being acquired. Such schedule may be prepared from\nan analysis of the current probable selling prices of dwellings available on\nthe market. (ii)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the probable selling price of a comparable dwelling by analyzing\nthose selected comparable dwellings available for sale which are most nearly\ncomparable to the property being acquired by the State. All calculations or\nsupplemental relocation payments are to be predicated on the basis of the\nprobable selling price of the available comparable housing, not the asking\nprices. (4)\n\nAn\nowner-occupant desiring to retain his acquired dwelling may be paid a\nreplacement housing payment according to the following computations: (i) If the dwelling to be moved is decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be the amount by which the cost to\nrelocate the dwelling exceeds the acquisition price of the dwelling. The costs\nto relocate may include the reasonable costs of acquiring the dwelling, acquiring a new site and other expenses incident to retaining, moving the\ndwelling and restoring it to a condition comparable to that before the\nmove. (ii)\n\nIf the dwelling to be\nmoved is not decent, safe and sanitary, the payment shall be computed as above\nexcept that the costs to cure the decent, safe and sanitary deficiencies shall\nbe included in the costs to relocate. (iii)\n\nThe payments computed under\nsubparagraphs (i) or (ii) of this paragraph may not exceed the amount which the\nowner would have obtained had he purchased a replacement dwelling and his\npayment computed as per paragraph (b) (3) of this section. (c) Owner-occupant over 180 days; who rents replacement housing. An owner-occupant eligible for a replacement\nhousing payment under subdivision (b) of this section who elects to rent a\nreplacement dwelling is eligible for a rental replacement housing payment not\nto exceed $4,000. The payment shall be computed and disbursed according to the\nfollowing criteria: (1)\n\nThe payment shall be\ndetermined by subtracting from the amount necessary to rent a comparable\ndwelling for the next four years, 48 times the economic rental of the dwelling\nunit occupied as computed by the State. (2)\n\nIn cases where the economic rental of the\nacquired dwelling exceeds 25 percent of the owner's gross monthly income, and\nhe elects to relocate into public subsidized rental housing the computation of\nbenefits will be in accordance with paragraph (f) (3) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual\nanalysis of comparable available rentals. (4)\n\nThe payment under this section may not\nexceed the maximum amount the owner would have received had he elected to\nrepurchase a dwelling unit under the provisions of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) Owner-occupant less than 180 days but more than 90 days; who purchases. A\ndisplaced owner-occupant otherwise eligible under subdivision (b) of this\nsection except that he has owned and occupied the dwelling for less than 180\ndays but more than 90 days may receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to\nenable him to make a downpayment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling and\nreimbursement for actual expenses incident to such purchase; or for additional\ncosts to relocate his retained dwelling in accordance with the following\nregulations: (1)\n\nThe amount of the\ndownpayment shall be determined by the State as the amount required as a\ndownpayment on a comparable dwelling if such purchase was financed with a\nconventional loan. (2)\n\nThe expenses\nincident to the purchase of replacement housing as described in subdivision (j)\nof this section. (3)\n\nUpon purchase\nand occupancy of a decent, safe and sanitary dwelling by the relocatee within\nthe time limits specified in paragraph (a) (1) of this section, the relocatee\nmay be reimbursed: (i) The full amount of the\ndownpayment determined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision if such total\namount does not exceed $2,000; or, if more than $2,000. (ii)\n$2,000, plus 50 percent of the amount in\nexcess of $2,000 providing the relocatee contributes 50 percent of the amount\nin excess of $2,000. (4)\n\nThe full amount of the downpayment must be applied to the purchase price of the\nreplacement property and any downpayment and incidental costs claimed must be\nshown in the closing statement. To process for payment, the State must be\nfurnished a copy of the closing statement. If the owner elects to retain his\ndwelling, the replacement housing payment will be determined in accordance with\nparagraph (b) (4) of this section, except that such payment shall not exceed\n$4,000. If the owner first elects to rent a replacement property, but later\ndecides to apply for a downpayment on a purchase of a replacement property, any\npayments made under the rental provisions are to be deducted from the payments\nauthorized under this paragraph. (e) Owner-occupant less than 180 days but\nmore than 90 days; who rents.

(1)\nA displaced tenant is\neligible for a rental replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, when: (i) he is in occupancy at the beginning of\nnegotiations for the acquisition of the real property; or\n(ii)\nhe is in occupancy at the time he is\ngiven a written notice by the State that it is their intent to acquire the\nproperty by a given date; and\n(iii)\nsuch occupancy has been for at least 90 consecutive days immediately prior to\nthe date of vacation or initiation of negotiations, whichever is earlier; and\n(iv)\nhe rented and occupied a\ndecent, safe and sanitary dwelling within the time period specified in\nparagraph (a) (1) of this section. (2)\n\nThe payment not to exceed $4,000, shall\nbe determined by subtracting from the amount necessary to rent a comparable\ndwelling for the next four years the following amount: (i) 48 times the average monthly rental paid\nby the relocated individual or family during the last three months; or\n(ii)\nif such average monthly\nrental is not reasonably equal to market rentals for similar dwellings, the\neconomic rent as established by the State shall be used. (iii)\n\nThe \"rent being paid\" shall include any\nrent supplements supplied by others except when, by law, such supplement is to\nbe discontinued upon vacation of the property. (3)\n\nWhen the average monthly rental being\npaid by the relocatee, not including supplemental rent by public agencies, exceeds 25 percent of the monthly gross income of such individual or family, the payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be determined by subtracting 12 times\nthe average monthly income of the relocatee from: (i) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling if the relocatee\nmoves into private housing; or\n(ii)\nif the relocatee moves into public subsidized housing, the lessor of: (a) 48 times the monthly rental determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a private comparable dwelling; or\n(b) 48 times the monthly rental the relocatee\nis required to pay if he relocates in the subsidized housing. (4)\n\nThe State may\ndetermine the rental rates of comparable housing by a schedule or an individual\nanalysis of comparable rentals. (g) Tenant-occupant over 90 days; downpayment\nfor purchase. A tenant-occupant eligible for a rental replacement payment under\nsubdivision (f) of this section who elects to purchase a replacement dwelling\nis eligible to receive an amount, not to exceed $4,000, to enable him to make a\ndownpayment on the purchase of a replacement dwelling, including the incidental\nexpenses incident to such purchase.

(2)\n\nThe State may determine the rental rates\nof comparable housing by a schedule or an individual analysis of comparable\navailable rentals. (3)\n\nThe\ndownpayment amount, including the expenses incident to purchase of the\nreplacement dwelling are to be computed in accordance with the provisions of\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (i) Increased interest payments; owner-occupant over 180 days who purchases. (1)\n\nAn owner-occupant, otherwise eligible\nunder subdivision (b) of this section, is entitled to a payment for the loss of\nfavorable financing on his existing mortgage in the financing of replacement\nhousing, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 limit established in\nsubdivision (b) of this section, and further providing that the following\nconditions are met: (i) the dwelling acquired\nwas encumbered by a bona fide mortgage which was a valid lien on such dwelling\nfor not less than 180 days prior to the established eligibility date as\nspecified in subdivision (b) of this section, and\n(ii)\nthe mortgage on the replacement dwelling\nbears a higher rate of interest than the mortgage interest rate on the acquired\ndwelling. (2)\n\nThe\nincreased interest payment will be based on and limited to the lesser of the\nfollowing amounts: (i) the present worth of\nthe right to receive the monthly difference in mortgage payments on the\nexisting mortgage using the old and new interest rates; or\n(ii)\nthe present worth of the right to\nreceive the monthly difference in mortgage payments on the new mortgage using\nthe old and new interest rates. (3)\n\nPayment computation. The amount of\nincreased interest payment will be computed in accordance with the following\nprocedures: (i) The monthly principal and\ninterest payment differences caused by the change in interest rates is computed\nfor both the existing mortgage and new mortgage for their respective remaining\nterms and amounts. The old and new interest rates are used in each\ncase. (ii)\n\nThe present worth of the\nmonthly interest difference found in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is\ncomputed for each mortgage by discounting the annual difference (the sum of the\nmonthly difference for one year) at the savings deposit interest rate for the\nremaining term of each mortgage. The lesser of the amounts so derived is the\nincreased interest payment. (4)\n\nInterest rate of replacement dwelling\nmortgage. (i) The interest rate shall be the\nactual rate but may not exceed the prevailing interest rate currently charged\nby mortgage lending institutions in the vicinity. (ii)\n\nWhen the lending agency imposes debt\nservice charges as an incident to the extension of credit, and such charges are\nnormal to the market, the annual percentage rate shown in the truth in lending\nstatement shall be used in lieu of the mortgage interest rate in computing the\nmonthly principal and interest payments. (5)\n\nDiscount rate. The discount rate shall be\nthe prevailing rate of interest paid on passbook savings account deposits by\ncommercial banks in the general area in which the replacement dwelling is\nlocated. (6)\n\nTo whom payment made. The payment described in this paragraph may be made directly to the relocated\nindividual or family, or upon written instruction from the relocated individual\nor family, directly to the mortgagee of the replacement dwelling. (7)\n\nPartial acquisition. (i) Where the dwelling is located on a tract\nnormal for residential use in the area, the interest payment shall be reduced\nto the percentage ratio that the acquisition price bears to the before value; except, the reduction shall not apply when the mortgagee requires the entire\nmortgage balance to be paid because of acquisition and it is necessary to\nrefinance. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract larger than normal for residential use in the area, the\ninterest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the value of the\nresidential portion bears to the before value. This reduction shall apply\nwhether or not it is required that the entire mortgage balance be\npaid. (8)\n\nMulti-use\nproperties. The interest payment on multi-use properties shall be reduced to\nthe percentage ratio that the residential value of the multi-use property bears\nto the before value. (9)\n\nOther\nhighest and best use. If a dwelling is located on a tract where the fair market\nvalue is established on a higher and better than residential use, and if the\nmortgage is based on residential value, the interest payment shall be computed\nas provided above. If the mortgage is obviously based on the higher use, however, the interest payment shall be reduced to the percentage ratio that the\nestimated residential value of the parcel bears to the before value. (j) Incidental expenses. (1)\n\nAn otherwise eligible owner-occupant or\ntenant who purchases a replacement dwelling, is entitled to a payment for the\nincidental expenses incident to the purchase of the replacement dwelling, providing such payment falls within the $15,000 and $4,000 limits as otherwise\nestablished in this section. The following expenses, insofar as they do not\nconstitute prepaid expenses, are eligible for reimbursement on an actual cost\nbasis: (i) Legal closing and related costs\nincluding title search, preparing conveyance contracts, notary fees, surveys, preparing drawings or plats, and charges paid incident to\nrecordation; (ii)\n\nLenders, FHA or\nVA appraisal fees; (iii)\nFHA or VA\napplication fee; (iv)\n\nCertification\nof structural soundness; (v) Credit\nreport; (vi)\n\nOwner's title policy\nor abstract of title; (vii)\n\nEscrow\nagent's fee; (viii)\n\nState revenue\nstamps; (ix)\n\nSales or transfer of\ntaxes. (2)\n\nNo fee, cost, charge or expense is reimbursable as an incidental expense which is part of the\ndebt service, or finance, charge under the Federal Truth in Lending\n\nAct. (3)\n\nReimbursement for these\neligible incidental expenses shall be contingent upon showing the actual\nexpense and shall be accompanied by a copy of the closing statement for the\nreplacement dwelling. (k) Mobile homes; replacement housing\npayments; general provisions. (1)\nA mobile\nhome is considered to be decent, safe and sanitary if it meets the defined\nstandards in this Part. (2)\n\nWhere\nthe department determines that a sufficient portion of a mobile home park is\ntaken to justify the operator of such park to move his business or go out of\nbusiness and the operator does in fact move or go out of business, the owners\nand occupants of the mobile home dwellings not within the actual taking but who\nare forced to move are eligible to receive the same payments as though their\ndwellings were within the actual taking. (3)\n\nWhen a comparable mobile home dwelling is\nnot available, the supplemental relocation payment is to be calculated on the\nbasis of the next higher type dwelling that is available and meets the\napplicable requirements and standards i.e., a higher type mobile home or a\nconventional dwelling. (4)\n\nWhen a\nmobile home park entrance fee, as distinguished from a security deposit is\nrequired to relocate a mobile home, such fee may be considered in the\ncomputation of a rental replacement housing payment if the park with the\nentrance fee is only comparable park available and the fee is not refundable or\nreturnable to the tenant. (l) Mobile homes; owner-occupants over 180\ndays. A displaced owner of a mobile home who has occupied, for a least 180\ndays, the mobile home on the site from which he is being displaced and is\notherwise eligible under the provisions of paragraph (b) (2) of this section, is eligible for payments, the total of which may not exceed $15,000, for the\nadditional costs necessary to purchase replacement housing under the following\ncircumstances: (1)\n\nWhen owner-occupant owns\nboth mobile home and site, the replacement housing payment will be the amount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his mobile home\nand site equals the lesser of\n(i) the amount\nthe owner is required to pay for a decent, safe and sanitary conventional\ndwelling or a decent, safe and sanitary replacement mobile home and site; or\n(ii)\n\nThe amount determined by\nthe State as necessary to purchase a comparable mobile home and site. If the\nowner-occupant decides to rent, the rental replacement payment shall be the\ndifference between the State's determination of the amount necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for a period of four years and 48 times the\neconomic rent of the existing mobile home and site. The calculated rental\nreplacement payment may not exceed the amount determined by the State in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, or $4,000 whichever is lesser. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of\nsite only. (i) Upon acquisition of an owned\nsite, but not the home situated upon the site and the mobile home is required\nto be moved, the replacement housing payment will be determined as follows: The\namount, if any, when added to the amount for which the State acquired his\nmobile homesite equals the lesser of: (a) the\namount the owner is required to pay for a comparable homesite, or\n(b) the amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile homesite. If the owner elects to\nrent, the rental replacement payment shall be the difference in the amount\ndetermined by the State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile homesite for a\nperiod of four years and 48 times the economic rent of the site acquired. The\ncalculated rental replacement payment may not exceed the amount determined by\nthe State as necessary to purchase a comparable mobile homesite, or $4,000, whichever is lesser. (ii)\n\nUpon acquisition of a rented site, but\nnot the home situated upon the site and the mobile home is required to be\nmoved, the replacement housing payment, not to exceed $4,000, will be the\namount as determined by the State as the amount required as a downpayment on\nthe purchase of a comparable mobile homesite. If the owner elects to rent, the\nrental replacement payment shall be the difference in the amount determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile homesite for a period of\nfour years and 48 times the rent being paid on the site acquired. (3)\n\nWhen owner-occupant owns\nmobile home; rents site. The replacement housing payment will be the amount, if\nany when added to the amount for which the State acquired his mobile home\nequals the lesser of: (i) the amount the\nowner is required to pay for a replacement dwelling; or\n(ii)\nthe amount determined by the State as\nnecessary to purchase a comparable mobile home, plus either the amount\ndetermined by the State as the amount required as a downpayment on the purchase\nof a comparable mobile homesite, or the difference in the amount determined by\nthe State as necessary to rent a comparable mobile homesite for a period of\nfour years and 48 times the rent being paid on the site acquired.

(4)\n\nIn addition to the replacement housing payments specified above, the\nowner-occupant is entitled to a payment to compensate him for the loss of\nfavorable financing on his existing mortgage in the financing of replacement\nhousing and payment for incidental expenses incident to the purchase of\nreplacement housing. These payments will be calculated and paid in accordance\nwith subdivisions (i) and (j) of this section. (m) Mobile homes; owner-occupants less than\n180 days, but more than 90 days. A displaced owner of a mobile home who has\noccupied, for less than 180 days but more than 90 days, the mobile home on the\nsite from which he is displaced and who is otherwise eligible under the\nprovisions of paragraph (b) (2) of this section, is eligible for an amount, not\nto exceed $4,000, to enable him to make a downpayment on the purchase of\nreplacement housing and to reimburse him for the actual expenses incident\nthereto in accordance with the following provisions: (1)\n\nOwner-occupant owning both mobile home\nand site. If the owner purchases a replacement dwelling, the replacement\nhousing payment will be determined in accordance with the heretofore defined\nprovisions relating to downpayment calculations, except that the amount of the\ndownpayment shall be determined by the State as the amount required on the\npurchase of a comparable mobile home and site. If the owner-occupant elects to\nrent, the rental replacement payment, not to exceed $4,000, shall be the\ndifference in the amount determined by the State as necessary to rent a\ncomparable mobile home and site for a period of four years and 48 times the\neconomic rental of the mobile home and site. (2)\n\nOwner-occupant; acquisition of site only. If the owner purchases conventional housing or a site to which the mobile home\nis moved, the replacement housing payment will be in an amount determined in\naccordance with the provisions relating to downpayment calculations except that\nthe amount of the downpayment shall be determined by the State as the amount\nrequired as a downpayment on the purchase of a comparable site.

(o) Supplemental replacement housing\npayments; miscellaneous provisions. (1)\n\nInspection of replacement dwelling. In order to be eligible for and receive\nsupplemental relocation payments, the State must inspect the replacement\ndwelling and determine that it meets the decent, safe and sanitary standards as\ndefined in section\n400.2\nof this Part. In any application for payment, the individual or family must indicate that to\nthe best of their knowledge and belief, the replacement dwelling meets the\ndefined standards for decent, safe and sanitary housing. (2)\n\nAdvanced replacement housing payments in\nlitigated cases. An advance replacement housing payment can be authorized and\npaid to a property owner if the determination of the State's acquisition price\nwill be delayed pending the outcome of a trial in the Court of Claims. A\nprovisional replacement housing payment may be calculated by deeming the\n\nState's maximum offer for the property as the acquisition price. Payment of\nsuch amount may be made upon owner-occupant's agreement that: (i) Upon final judgment of the Court of\n\nClaims the replacement housing payment will be recomputed using the acquisition\nprice determined by the court as compared to the actual price paid or the\namount determined by the State necessary to acquire a comparable decent, safe\nand sanitary dwelling, and\n(ii)\n\nIf\nthe amount awarded by the court as the fair market value of the property\nacquired plus the amount of the recomputed replacement housing payment exceeds\nthe price paid for, or the State's determined cost of a comparable dwelling, the owner will refund to the State from the judgment amount, an amount equal to\nthe excess. In no event, however, shall he be required to refund more than the\namount of the replacement housing payment advanced, and\n(iii)\n\nIf the property owner does not agree to\nsuch adjustment, the replacement housing payment shall be deferred until the\ncase is finally adjudicated and computed on the basis of the final\ndetermination, using the award as the acquisition price. (3)\n\nOwnership of replacement dwelling prior\nto displacement.

(4)\n\nPartial\ntaking situations. (i) Where a dwelling is\nlocated on a tract normal for residential use in the area, the maximum\nreplacement housing payment shall be determined by subtracting the \"before\nvalue\" of the property from the estimated selling price of a comparable\ndwelling on a lot typical for the area. (ii)\n\nWhere a dwelling is located on a tract\nlarger than normal for residential use in the area, the maximum replacement\nhousing payment shall be determined by estimating the value of the dwelling at\nthe present location on a homesite typical in size for the area and deducting\nthis amount from the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a site typical\nfor the area. (5)\n\nDwelling on land with higher and better use. Where a dwelling is located on a\ntract where the fair market value is established on a higher and better than\nresidential use, the maximum replacement housing payment shall be determined by\nestimating the value of the dwelling at the present location on a homesite\ntypical for the area and zoned for residential use and deducting this amount\nfrom the selling price of a comparable dwelling on a typical residential\nhomesite for the area. (6)\n\nJoint\nresidential and business use. Where displaced individuals or families occupy\nliving quarters on the same premises as a displaced business, farm or nonprofit\norganization, such individuals or families are separate displaced persons for\npurposes of determining entitlement to payments. (7)\n\nPayments on assignments.
