Tit. 6 §§ 374-4.2 - Requirements for the management of elemental mercury and dental amalgam waste at dental facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Amalgam separators. (1)\n\nAll\ndental facility waters likely to come into contact with dental amalgam waste\nmust be treated prior to discharge by an amalgam separator which is certified\nto ISO 11143 Standards (Dental equipment - amalgam separators) as incorporated\nby reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. The amalgam separator must achieve a minimum of 99 percent removal\nefficiency of dental amalgam, by weight, in accordance with ISO 11143 test\nprocedures. (2)\n\nAmalgam separators\nin service at dental facilities prior to the effective date of this Subpart, must be certified, but only need to achieve a minimum 95 percent removal\nefficiency of dental amalgam, by weight, in accordance with ISO 11143 test\nprocedures. (3)\n\nFor large dental\nfacilities, the amalgam separator must meet or exceed the applicable ISO 11143\n\nStandards set forth in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, but is not\nrequired to be ISO certified. If such a separator is not ISO certified, then\nthe minimum removal efficiency certification must be made by a person or firm\nlicensed to practice professional engineering in the State of New\n\nYork. (4)\n\nAll amalgam separators\nmust be properly sized for the volume and flow of the dental facility amalgam\nwastewater in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications and\nrecommendations. The maximum allowable flow rate through the amalgam separator\nat the dental facility may not exceed the maximum flow rate capacity that the\nseparator was tested at and passed in meeting the ISO standards. (5)\n\nThe amalgam separator must be installed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications\nand recommendations. Amalgam separators must also be installed in accordance\nwith any applicable State and local building code requirements. (6)\n\nThe amalgam separator must be placed in\nservice in accordance with the requirements of this Subpart as follows: (i) for dental facilities that begin\noperations after the effective date of this Subpart, the amalgam separator must\nbe placed in service prior to beginning operation; or\n(ii)\nfor dental facilities operating on the\neffective date of this Subpart, the amalgam separator must be placed in service\nno later than two years after the effective date of this Subpart. (7)\n\nDental facilities where dental\namalgam is not placed or removed, including facilities where the specialties of\northodontics, periodontics, prosthodontics and oral and maxillofacial surgery\nare exclusively performed, are exempt from the requirements to install an\namalgam separator. (b) Dental amalgam waste storage. (1)\n\nAll dental amalgam wastes must be\ncollected and stored in air-tight, leak-proof and structurally sound\ncontainers. (2)\n\nThe containers\nholding the dental amalgam waste must have a label that includes, at a minimum, the type of the dental amalgam waste contained therein and the date waste was\ninitially placed in the container. (3)\n\nThe containers holding the dental amalgam\nwaste must be tightly closed except when adding or removing dental amalgam\nwaste. (4)\n\nLength of storage of\ndental amalgam waste within the dental facility must not exceed one year from\nthe date waste was initially placed in the container. (c) Recycling of dental amalgam waste\nand elemental mercury. (1)\n\nAll dental\namalgam waste and elemental mercury generated by the dental facility must be\nsent for mercury recycling. (2)\n\nWritten or electronic certification from the collection service or recycler\nmust be obtained by the dental facility, documenting: (i) the name and address of the collection\nservice; (ii)\nthe amount, by\nweight, of dental amalgam waste and elemental mercury collected and the date it\nwas collected; and\n(iii)\nthe name\nand address of the facility where the dental amalgam waste and elemental\nmercury will ultimately be recycled, and certification that the mercury\ncontained in the waste was destined for recycling. (d) Recordkeeping and\ninspection. (1)\n\nRecords must be\nmaintained at the dental facility documenting: (i) the type of amalgam separator(s)\ninstalled, manufacturer's model number, unit specifications, date the unit was\nplaced in service and number of chair units serviced by the\nseparator; (ii)\na description of\nall maintenance performed on the amalgam separator(s) and the date of\ncompletion of such maintenance; (iii)\nthe amount, by weight, of dental\namalgam waste sent for recycling of mercury, on an annual basis; and\n(iv)\ncopies of the correspondence required by\nparagraph (c)(2) of this section. (2)\n\nThe records required under subparagraph\n(1)(i) of this subdivision must be maintained as long as the amalgam separator\nis in use at the dental facility. The records required under subparagraphs\n(1)(ii) through (iv) of this subdivision must be maintained for a minimum of\nthree years. (3)\n\nWritten\nnotification when an amalgam separator is installed must be provided to the\nsewage treatment works or sewer authority that the wastewater discharge is\ntributary to, if applicable. Such notification must be submitted no later than\n30 days following the applicable deadline specified under paragraph (a)(6) of\nthis section and must contain the dental facility name; facility location\nincluding street address and municipal subdivision, i.e., city, town, or village; telephone number; and the information specified in\nsubparagraph (1)(i) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe records specified in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, the amalgam separator(s) and any related equipment must be\nreadily available for inspection by the department, or its authorized\nrepresentative, upon written or verbal request. (e) Prohibitions. (1)\n\nThe use or possession of elemental\nmercury in the practice of dentistry is prohibited in a dental facility unless\nsuch elemental mercury is contained in appropriate pre-encapsulated capsules\nspecifically designed for the mixing of dental amalgam. (2)\n\nElemental mercury must not be rinsed down\nthe drain, disposed with municipal solid waste or disposed as regulated medical\nwaste as defined in section\n1389-aa\nof Public Health Law and section\n27-1501\nof Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw. (3)\n\nChair-side traps, screens, vacuum pump filters or other amalgam collection devices containing dental\namalgam must not be rinsed over drains or sinks that are not equipped with an\namalgam separator as required under subdivision (a) of this section. (4)\n\nDental amalgam waste must not be managed\nas a regulated medical waste as defined in section\n1389-aa\nof Public Health Law and section\n27-1501\nof Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw and must not be disposed of in containers destined for treatment or\ndisposal as regulated medical waste. (5)\n\nDental amalgam waste and collection\nequipment must not be disinfected by any method that utilizes heat. (6)\n\nDental amalgam waste must not be disposed\nof as municipal solid waste.
