Subject to the\nrequirements of this section, in the case of any application for credit by a\nbusiness to a banking institution which has originated at least 25 credit\ntransactions for businesses in each of the two preceding calendar years, the\nbanking institution shall: (1)\ninquire\nwhether the business is a minority- or women-owned business, without regard to\nwhether such application is received in person, by mail, by telephone, by\nelectronic mail or other form of electronic transmission, or by any other\nmeans, and whether or not such application is in response to a solicitation by\nthe banking institution; (2)\nat the\ntime of application, notify such applicants in writing, or orally for\napplications made by telephone or another medium that does not involve\nproviding any paper or electronic documents, that: (i) any applicant for credit may refuse to\nprovide any information requested pursuant to this subdivision (b) in\nconnection with any application for credit; and\n(ii)\nthat the banking institution is\nprohibited from discriminating on the basis of any information provided in\nresponse to an inquiry made pursuant to this subdivision or on whether the\napplicant provides this information; and\n(3)\nmaintain a record of the responses to\nsuch inquiry, separate from the application and accompanying\ninformation. (c) A\nbanking institution may inform the applicant that New York State law requires\nit to ask for the principal owners' ethnicity and race to help ensure that all\napplicants for credit are treated fairly and that communities' credit needs are\nbeing fulfilled. (d) A banking\ninstitution is neither required nor permitted to verify the minority-owned\nbusiness status or women-owned business status that the applicant provides, or\nreport any information on an applicant's principal owners based on visual\nobservation and/or surname of any individual associated with the\napplicant. (e) No access by\nunderwriters. (1)\n\nLimitation. Where feasible, no loan underwriter or other officer or employee of a banking institution, or\nany affiliate of a banking institution, involved in making any determination\nconcerning an application for credit shall have access to any information\nprovided by the applicant pursuant to a request under subdivision (b) of this\nsection in connection with such application. (2)\n\nLimited access. If a banking institution\ndetermines that a loan underwriter or other officer or employee of a banking\ninstitution, or any affiliate of a banking institution, involved in making any\ndetermination concerning an application for credit should have access to any\ninformation provided by the applicant pursuant to a request under subdivision\n(b) of this section, the banking institution shall provide written notice to\nthe applicant, at the time of application or as reasonably practicable\nthereafter, of the access of the underwriter to such information.

As applicable, each banking institution shall compile and maintain a record of the information\nprovided by any applicant pursuant to a request under subdivision (b) of this\nsection, or a record that an applicant declined to provide such information. The Department will issue a sample data collection form that banking\ninstitutions may use to collect information provided by applicants pursuant to\nthis section and may update such form from time to time as the Department deems\nnecessary. (2)\n\nItemization.

(4)\n\nPreviously collected\ndata. A banking institution is permitted, but not required, to reuse previously\ncollected data to satisfy paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and not required\nto restate the disclosures otherwise required by paragraph (2) of subdivision\n(b) of this section, if: (i) The data were\ncollected within the same calendar year as the current application; and\n(ii)\n\nThe banking institution\nhas no reason to believe the data are inaccurate. (5)\n\nRace and ethnicity of the applicant's\nprincipal owners. (i) When asking for a\nprincipal owner's ethnicity and race, a banking institution shall allow the\napplicant to respond using aggregate and disaggregated ethnicity and race\ncategories and subcategories. The disaggregated subcategories shall include the\n\"other\" disaggregated subcategories that provide the option to self-identify\nusing free-form text on a paper or electronic data collection form or using\nlanguage that informs the applicant of the opportunity to self-identify when\ntaking the application by means other than a paper or electronic data\ncollection form, such as by telephone. (ii)\n\nWhen asking for a principal owner's\nethnicity and race, a banking institution may, but is not obligated to, use the\nsample data collection form in Appendix A to Part 76.

(iv)\nA banking institution shall offer the\napplicant the option of selecting more than one ethnicity and race for each\nprincipal owner. If an applicant selects more than one ethnicity or race for a\nprincipal owner, the banking institution shall report each selected\ndesignation. The banking institution shall also report any additional\ninformation that the applicant has provided as free-form text in the\nappropriate data reporting field. (v) If an applicant provides ethnicity or\nrace information for one or more principal owners, the banking institution\nshall report the ethnicity and race as provided by the applicant. (vi)\n\nIf the applicant declines to provide a\nprincipal owner's ethnicity or race, the banking institution shall report that\nthe applicant declined to provide this information. The banking institution\nshall report that the applicant declined to provide information only if the\napplicant specifically declines to provide that information. If the applicant\ndoes not respond to a request about a principal owner's ethnicity or race, the\nbanking institution shall report that the information was not provided by the\napplicant. If an applicant provides some but not all of the requested ethnicity\nand race information, the banking institution shall report the information that\nwas provided by the applicant and shall report that the applicant declined to\nprovide or did not provide (as applicable) the remainder of the\ninformation. (vii)\n\nIf an applicant\nprovides information in response to the question requesting a given principal\nowner's ethnicity or race and also indicates that the applicant does not wish\nto provide the information, the banking institution shall report the\ninformation on ethnicity or race that was provided by the applicant (rather\nthan reporting that the applicant declined to provide the\ninformation). (viii)\n\nIf a banking\ninstitution reports ethnicity or race information based on previously collected\ndata, the banking institution shall also report that it is providing that\ninformation based on previously collected data. (ix)\n\nIf a banking institution reports one or\nmore principal owner's ethnicity or race information based on previously\ncollected data, the banking institution does not need to collect any additional\nethnicity or race information. However, the banking institution may need to\nreport that the applicant did not provide or declined to provide information\nwhen the banking institution previously collected the data, as\napplicable. (6)\n\nJoint\napplications from multiple entities. In the event of a single application from\nmultiple entities operating pursuant to a joint venture agreement or other form\nof business combination, the banking institution shall obtain information\npursuant to this section for all entities participating in the\napplication. (g) Availability of information. (1)\n\nSubmission\nto Department. (i) The data required to be\ncompiled and maintained under this section by any banking institution shall be\nsubmitted to the Department upon the Department's request. (ii)\n\nEach banking institution shall submit to\nthe Department a copy of each report and document which it is required to\nprepare and file with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and/or another\n\nFederal agency by Section 704B of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, codified at\n15 USC §\n1691c-2, as implemented by regulation, upon\nthe Department's request. (2)\n\nRetention of information. Information\ncompiled and maintained under this section shall be retained by the banking\ninstitution for not less than six years after the date of\npreparation; (3)\n\nAvailability of\ninformation. The Department and banking institutions will maintain any\ninformation compiled under this section that could be used to identify any\napplicant or their associated business as confidential, except as required by\nfederal law. (h) Alternative forms of compliance. (1)\n\nThe\n\nDepartment may, at its discretion, determine that a banking institution's or\ngroup of banking institutions' compliance with the requirements of Section 704B\nof the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, codified at\n15 USC §\n1691c-2, as implemented by regulation, shall\nconstitute compliance with the data collection requirements of this\nsection. (i) Application\ndefined. For the purposes of this section only, the term \"application\" means an\noral or written request by a business for a loan or other extension of credit\nthat is made in accordance with procedures used by a banking institution for\nthe type of credit requested, including such requests received by the banking\ninstitution that are incomplete or subsequently withdrawn, and shall not mean\n(i) reevaluation, extension, or renewal\nrequests on an existing business credit account, unless the request seeks\nadditional credit amounts, or\n(ii)\ninquiries and prequalification requests. (j) Compliance Date and Transitional Period. (1)\n\nThe compliance date for Section\n76.16\nof this Part is six months\nafter the date of publication of the Notice of Adoption in the State\n\nRegister. (2)\n\nBanking institutions\nshall have an additional transition period of three months from the compliance\ndate of Section\n76.16\nto comply with the\nrequirements set forth in Section\n76.16\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Part to limit, where feasible, underwriter access to any information\nprovided by the applicant pursuant to a request under subdivision (b) of this\nsection. During this transition period, banking institutions that can feasibly\nlimit access, but need to make technological and process adjustments to do so, may rely on Section\n76.16\n(d)(2)\nof\nthis Part.
