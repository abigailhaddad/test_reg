Tit. 20 § 105.11 - Change of accounting methods\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 605(a)(4)(A)\n(a) Except where a taxpayer does not have a\nmethod of accounting for Federal income tax purposes, a taxpayer may not change\nsuch taxpayer's method of accounting for New York State personal income tax\npurposes unless a similar change has been made for Federal income tax\npurposes. (b) Where a taxpayer's\nmethod of accounting is changed for Federal income tax purposes, such\ntaxpayer's method of accounting for New York State personal income tax purposes\nmust be similarly changed. A copy of the consent of the Commissioner of\n\nInternal Revenue to the change must be attached to the taxpayer's first New\n\nYork State personal income tax return filed under the new method or, if no\nconsent is required, a statement to that effect referring to the particular\nprovision of the Internal Revenue Code or regulations thereunder authorizing\nthe change. Also see sections\n105.12\nand\n105.13\nof this Part with regard to other information required to be submitted where a\ntaxpayer's method of accounting is changed. (c) Where a taxpayer does not have a method\nof accounting for Federal income tax purposes, an application for permission to\nchange a method of accounting for New York State personal income tax purposes\nmust be made within 180 days after the beginning of the taxable period to which\nthe proposed change will relate. Such application must be accompanied by a\nstatement specifying the nature of the taxpayer's business, such taxpayer's\npresent method of accounting, the method to which such taxpayer desires to\nchange, the taxable year in which the change is to be effected, the classes of\nitems to receive different treatment under the new system, and all items which\nwould be duplicated or omitted as a result of the proposed change. If such\ntaxpayer must later choose a method of accounting for Federal income tax\npurposes and such method differs from the taxpayer's method used for New York\n\nState personal income tax purposes, the taxpayer must conform such taxpayer's\n\nNew York State method of accounting to the method of accounting chosen for\n\nFederal income tax purposes.
