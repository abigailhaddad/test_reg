  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 451.112 - Fixed asset\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A tangible\nasset held for the services it yields in the production of goods and services; any item of plant. (b) A balance\nsheet classification denoting capital assets other than intangibles and\ninvestments in affiliated companies or other long-term investments. Included in\nthe usual fixed-asset categories are land (from which the flow of services is\nseemingly permanent), buildings, building equipment, fixtures, machinery, tools\n(large and small), furniture, office devices, patterns, drawings, dies, and\noften containers; generally excluded are goodwill, patents and other\nintangibles. The characteristic fixed asset has a limited life (land is the one\nimportant exception), and, in organizations where expenses are accounted for, its cost, less estimated salvage at the end of its useful life, is distributed\nover the periods it benefits by means of provisions of depreciation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n451.112\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
