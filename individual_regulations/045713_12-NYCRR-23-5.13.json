Each supporting\nbracket of a carpenters' portable bracket scaffold shall consist of a\ntriangular portable frame constructed of wood not less than two inches by three\ninches in cross-section or shall be constructed of metal of equivalent\nstrength. The members of such brackets shall be properly fitted and securely\njoined. (b) Bracket installation. Each such bracket shall be attached to the wall of a building or other\nstructure by means of a bolt not less than five-eighths inch in diameter. Such\nbolt shall extend through such wall and shall be secured to develop the\nrequired strength. The brackets shall be spaced not to exceed eight feet, center to center. Where the use of five-eighths inch diameter bolts for such\ninstallations is impractical, such brackets shall be secured by whaler cleats\nor metal ties equivalent in strength to five-eighths inch diameter\nbolts. (c) Loading. No more than\ntwo persons shall occupy any given 16 feet of a carpenters' portable bracket\nscaffold at any one time.

Where the working platform of any carpenters' portable bracket\nscaffold is elevated more than seven feet above the ground, grade, floor or\nequivalent surface, such platform shall be provided with a safety railing\nconstructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule).
