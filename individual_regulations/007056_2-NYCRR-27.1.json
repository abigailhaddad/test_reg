By providing standards for the presentation of\ninformation in official statements, the regulations will assist investors, provide guidance of such municipalities, school districts and district\ncorporations, and facilitate the creation in the State Comptroller's office of\na central repository of comparable information for statistical and analytical\npurposes. These standards of disclosure will also enhance government\naccountability through increased availability of information to the public\nabout the financial condition of their government. This Part is not intended to\nsupersede other applicable disclosure requirements, nor to excuse an issuer\nfrom the requirement that all material information be disclosed. Issuers should\nin preparing an official statement consider any principles of Federal or State\nlaw that may be applicable. The information required by this Part is not\nrequired to be presented in any specific form or order in official statements\nand no reference need be made to inapplicable items. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
