All applications, unless withdrawn, will be processed according to the\nprocedures set forth in New York Correction Law. III. The pardons following this executive\norder, and all future restorations of voting rights, shall not include rights\nwith respect to the receipt, transportation, or possession of firearms as\nprovided by New York State Penal Law Section 400, nor shall it relieve an\nindividual of any unpaid restitution, fine, or other financial obligation\nresulting from a conviction, nor shall it restore the right to hold public\noffice, nor shall the order cause the underlying conviction to be\nsealed. IV. This executive order, and all future restorations of voting rights, shall not be construed as a\nremission of guilt or forgiveness of the offense and shall not function as a\nbar to greater penalties for future offenses. Nothing in the executive order\nshall be construed to contravene any applicable state or federal law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
