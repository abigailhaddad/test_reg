  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.11 - Surface impoundments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The regulations in this section apply to owners and\noperators of facilities that use surface impoundments to treat, store or\ndispose of hazardous waste, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (b) Design and operating\nrequirements. (1)\n\nAny surface\nimpoundment that is not covered by paragraph (3) of this subdivision or section\n373-3.11\n(i) of\nthis Part must have a liner for all portions of the impoundment (except for\nexisting portions of such impoundments). The liner must be designed, constructed and installed to prevent any migration of wastes out of the\nimpoundment to the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water at\nany time during the active life (including the closure period) of the\nimpoundment. The liner may be constructed of materials that may allow wastes to\nmigrate into the liner (but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground\nwater or surface water) during the active life of the facility, provided that\nthe impoundment is closed in accordance with subparagraph (f)(1)(i) of this\nsection. For impoundments that will be closed in accordance with subparagraph\n(f)(1)(ii) of this section, the liner must be constructed of materials that can\nprevent wastes from migrating into the liner during the active life of the\nfacility. The liner must be: (i) constructed\nof materials that have appropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength\nand thickness to prevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static\nhead and external hydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the wastes or\nleachate to which they are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of\ninstallation, and the stress of daily operations; (ii)\nplaced upon a foundation or base capable\nof providing support to the liner and resistance to pressure gradients above\nand below the liner to prevent failure of the liner due to settlement, compression or uplift; and\n(iii)\ninstalled to cover all surrounding earth likely to be in contact with the waste\nor leachate. (2)\n\nThe\nowner or operator will be exempted from the requirements of paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision if the commissioner finds, based on a demonstration by the\nowner or operator, that alternate design and operating practices, together with\nlocation characteristics, will prevent the migration of any hazardous\nconstituents (see section\n373-2.6\n[d]\nof this\n\nSubpart) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding\nwhether to grant an exception, the commissioner will consider: (i) the nature and quantity of the\nwastes; (ii)\nthe proposed alternate\ndesign and operation; (iii)\nthe\nhydrogeologic setting of the facility, including the attenuative capacity and\nthickness of the liners and soils present between the impoundment and ground\nwater or surface water; and\n(iv)\nall other factors which would influence the quality and mobility of the\nleachate produced and the potential for it to migrate to ground water or\nsurface water. (3)\n\nThe\nowner or operator of each new surface impoundment unit on which construction\ncommences after January 29, 1992, each lateral expansion of a surface\nimpoundment unit on which construction commences after July 29, 1992, and each\nreplacement of an existing surface impoundment unit that is to commence reuse\nafter July 29, 1992, must install two or more liners and a leachate collection\nand removal system between such liners. Construction commences is defined in\nsection\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle under \"existing facility.\"\n(i) (a) The liner system must include: (1)\na top liner designed and constructed of\nmaterials (\ne.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of\nhazardous constituents into such liner during the active life and post-closure\ncare period; and\n(2)\na composite\nbottom liner, consisting of at least two components. The upper component must\nbe designed and constructed of materials (\ne.g., a geomembrane)\nto prevent the migration of hazardous constituents into this component during\nthe active life and post-closure care period. The lower component must be\ndesigned and constructed of materials to minimize the migration of hazardous\nconstituents if a breach in the upper component were to occur. The lower\ncomponent must be constructed of at least three feet (91 cm) of compacted soil\nmaterial with a hydraulic conductivity of no more than 1 ×-\n10\n-7\ncm/sec. (b) The liners must comply with subparagraphs\n(1)(i)-(iii) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe leachate collection and removal\nsystem between the liners, and immediately above the bottom composite liner in\nthe case of multiple leachate collection and removal systems, is also a leak\ndetection system. This leak detection system must be capable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the earliest\npracticable time through all areas of the top liner likely to be exposed to\nwaste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care period. The\nrequirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are satisfied by\ninstallation of a system that is, at a minimum: (a) constructed with a bottom slope or one\npercent or more; (b) constructed of\ngranular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 ×-\n10\n-1\ncm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches\n(30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials\nwith a transmissivity of 3 ×- 10\n-4\nm\n2\n/sec or more; (c) constructed of materials that are\nchemically resistant to the waste managed in the surface impoundment and the\nleachate expected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent collapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes and any waste\ncover materials or equipment used at the surface impoundment; (d) designed and operated to minimize\nclogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(e) constructed with sumps and liquid removal\nmethods (e.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove liquids from the\nsump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage layer. Each unit\nmust have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal system must\nprovide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids present in\nthe sump and of liquids removed. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator shall collect and\nremove pumpable liquids in the sumps to minimize the head on the bottom\nliner. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator\nof a leak detection system that is not located completely above the seasonal\nhigh water table must demonstrate that the operation of the leak detection\nsystem will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground\nwater. (4)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may approve alternative design or operating practices to those\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision if the owner or operator\ndemonstrates to the commissioner that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics: (i) will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water\nor surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection\nand removal system specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nwill allow detection of\nleaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as\neffectively. (5)\n\nThe\ndouble liner requirement set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision may be\nwaived by the commissioner for any monofill, if: (i) the monofill contains only hazardous\nwastes from foundry furnace emission controls or metal casting molding sand, and such wastes do not contain constituents which would render the wastes\nhazardous for reasons other than the toxicity characteristics in section\n371.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle with EPA hazardous waste numbers D004 through D017; and\n(a) (1)\nthe\nmonofill has at least one liner for which there is no evidence of leaking. For\nthe purposes of this paragraph, the term liner means a liner designed, constructed, installed, and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing\ninto the liner at any time during the active life of the facility, or a liner\ndesigned, constructed, installed and operated to prevent hazardous waste from\nmigrating beyond the liner to adjacent subsurface soil, ground water or surface\nwater at any time during the active life of the facility. At the closure of any\nsurface impoundment which has been exempted from the requirements of paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision on the basis of a liner designed, constructed, installed and operated to prevent hazardous waste from passing beyond the\nliner, owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste residues, all\ncontaminated liner material, and contaminated soil to the extent practicable. If all contaminated soil is not removed or decontaminated, the owner or\noperator of such impoundment will comply with appropriate post-closure\nrequirements, including but not limited to ground-water monitoring and\ncorrective action; (2)\nthe monofill\nis located more than one-quarter mile from an underground source of drinking\nwater (as that term is defined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(3)\nthe monofill is in\ncompliance with generally applicable ground-water monitoring requirements for\nfacilities with Part 373 permits; or\n(b) the owner or operator demonstrates that\nthe monofill is located, designed and operated to assure that there will be no\nmigration of any hazardous constituent into ground water or surface water at\nany future time. (6)\n\nThe owner or operator of any replacement\nsurface impoundment unit is exempt from paragraph (3) of this subdivision if: (i) the existing unit was constructed in\ncompliance with the design standards of section 3004(0)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of\nthe Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(ii)\nthere is no reason\nto believe that the liner is not functioning as designed. (7)\nA surface impoundment must be designed, constructed, maintained and operated to prevent overtopping resulting from\nnormal or abnormal operations, overfilling, wind and wave action, rainfall, run-on, malfunctions of level controllers, alarms, other equipment and human\nerror. (8)\nA surface impoundment\nmust have dikes that are designed, constructed and maintained with sufficient\nstructural integrity to prevent massive failure of the dikes. In ensuring\nstructural integrity, it must not be presumed that the liner system will\nfunction without leakage during the active life of the unit. (9)\n\nThe commissioner will specify in the\npermit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the\nrequirements of this subdivision are satisfied. (c) double-lined surface impoundments are not\nexempt from section\n373-2.6, ground water protection\nrequirements. (d) Monitoring\nand inspection. (1)\n\nDuring\nconstruction and installation, liners (except in the case of existing portions\nof surface impoundments exempt from paragraph [b][1] of this section) and cover\nsystems (\ne.g., membranes, sheets or coatings) must be\ninspected for uniformity, damage and imperfections (\ne.g., holes, cracks, thin spots or foreign materials). Immediately after construction\nor installation: (i) synthetic liners and\ncovers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of\ntears, punctures or blisters; and\n(ii)\nsoil-based and admixed liners and covers\nmust be inspected for imperfections, including lenses, cracks, channels, root\nholes or other structural nonuniformities that may cause an increase in the\npermeability of the liner or cover. (2)\n\nWhile a surface impoundment is in\noperation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect evidence of\nany of the following: (i) deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of overtopping control systems; (ii)\nsudden drops in the level of the\nimpoundment's contents; and\n(iii)\nsevere erosion or other signs of deterioration in dikes or other containment\ndevices. (3)\n\nPrior to the\nissuance of a permit, and after any extended period of time (at least six\nmonths) during which the impoundment was not in service, the owner or operator\nmust obtain a certification from a professional engineer, registered in New\n\nYork State, that the impoundment's dike, including that portion of any dike\nwhich provides freeboard, has structural integrity. The certification must\nestablish, in particular, that the dike: (i) will withstand the stress of the pressure exerted by the types and amounts of\nwastes to be placed in the impoundment; and\n(ii)\nwill not fail due to scouring or piping, without dependence on any liner system included in the surface impoundment\nconstruction. (4)\n(i) An owner or operator required to have a\nleak detection system under paragraphs (b)(3) or (4) of this section must\nrecord the amount of liquids removed from each leak detection system sump at\nleast once each week during the active life and closure period. (ii)\n\nAfter the final cover is installed, the\namount of liquid removed from each leak detection system sump must be recorded\nat least monthly. If the liquid level in any sump stays below its pump\noperating level for two consecutive months, the amount of liquids in the sumps\nmust be recorded at least quarterly. If the liquid level in the sump stays\nbelow its pump operating level for two consecutive quarters, the amount of\nliquids in the sumps must be recorded at least semi-annually. If at any time\nduring the post-closure care period the pump operating level is exceeded at\nunits on quarterly or semi-annual recording schedules, the owner or operator\nmust return to monthly recording of the amounts of liquids removed from each\nsump until the liquid level again stays below the pump operating level for two\nconsecutive months. (iii)\n\nPump\noperating level is a liquid level proposed by the owner or operator and\napproved by the commissioner based on pump activation level, sump dimensions, and level that avoids backup into the drainage layer and minimizes head in the\nsump. (e) Emergency repairs; contingency plans. (1)\nA surface impoundment must be removed\nfrom service in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subdivision when: (i) the level of liquids in the impoundment\nsuddenly drops and the drop is not known to be caused by changes in the flow\ninto or out of the impoundment; or\n(ii)\nthe dike leaks. (2)\n\nWhen a surface impoundment must be\nremoved from service as required by paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\nowner or operator must: (i) immediately shut\noff the flow or stop the addition of wastes into the impoundment; (ii)\nimmediately contain any surface leakage\nwhich has occurred or is occurring; (iii)\nimmediately stop the leak; (iv)\ntake any other necessary steps to stop\nor prevent catastrophic failure; (v) if a leak cannot be stopped by any other\nmeans, empty the impoundment; and\n(vi)\nnotify the commissioner of the problem, in writing, within seven days after detecting the problem. (3)\n\nAs part of the contingency plan required\nin section\n373-2.4\nof this Subpart, the owner\nor operator must specify a procedure for complying with the requirements of\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nNo surface impoundment that has been\nremoved from service in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision\nmay be restored to service unless the portion of the impoundment which was\nfailing is repaired and the following steps are taken: (i) If the impoundment was removed from\nservice as a result of the actual or imminent dike failure, the dike's\nstructural integrity must be recertified in accordance with paragraph (d)(3) of\nthis section. (ii)\n\nIf the\nimpoundment was removed from service as a result of sudden drop in the liquid\nlevel, then: (a) for any existing portion of\nthe impoundment, a liner must be installed in compliance with paragraph (b)(1)\nof this section; and\n(b) for any\nother portion of the impoundment, the repaired liner system must be certified\nby a professional engineer, registered in New York State, as meeting the design\nspecifications approved in the permit. (5)\nA surface impoundment that has been\nremoved from service in accordance with the requirements of this subdivision, and that is not being repaired, must be closed in accordance with the\nprovisions of subdivision (f) of this section. (f) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt closure, the owner or\noperator must: (i) remove or decontaminate\nall waste residues, contaminated system components (liners, etc.), contaminated\nsubsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies; or\n(ii)\n(a) eliminate free liquids by removing liquid\nwastes or solidifying the remaining wastes and waste residues; (b) stabilize remaining wastes to a bearing\ncapacity sufficient to support final cover; and\n(c) cover the surface impoundment with a\nfinal cover designed and constructed to: (1)\nprovide long-term minimization of the migration of liquids through the\nimpoundment; (2)\nfunction with\nminimum maintenance; (3)\npromote\ndrainage and minimize erosion or abrasion of the final cover; (4)\naccommodate settling and subsidence so\nthat the cover's integrity is maintained; and\n(5)\nhave a permeability less than or equal to\nthe permeability of any bottom liner system or natural subsoils present. (2)\n\nIf some waste residues or contaminated materials are left in place at final\nclosure, the owner or operator must comply with all post-closure requirements\ncontained in section\n373-2.7\n(g)-(j)\nof\nthis Subpart, including maintenance and monitoring throughout the post-closure\ncare period (specified in the permit under section\n373-2.7\n[g]\n). The\nowner or operator must: (i) maintain the\nintegrity and effectiveness of the final cover, including making repairs to the\ncap as necessary to correct the effects of settling, subsidence, erosion or\nother events; (ii)\nmaintain and\nmonitor the leak detection system in accordance with clause (b)(3)(ii)(d), subparagraph (iii), and paragraph (d)(4) of this section, and comply with all\nother applicable leak detection system requirements of this Subpart; (iii)\nmaintain and monitor the ground-water\nmonitoring system and comply with all other applicable requirements of section\n373-2.6\nof this Subpart; and\n(iv)\nprevent run-on and runoff\nfrom eroding or otherwise damaging the final cover. (3)\n(i) If\nan owner or operator plans to close a surface impoundment in accordance with\nsubparagraph (1)(I) of this subdivision, and the impoundment does not comply\nwith the liner requirements of paragraph (b)(1) of this section and is not\nexempt from them in accordance with paragraph (b)(2), then; (a) the closure plan for the impoundment\nunder section\n373-2.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart must include both a plan for complying with subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision and a contingency plan for complying with subparagraph (1)(ii) in\ncase not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at closure; and\n(b) the owner or operator must\nprepare a contingent post-closure plan under section\n373-2.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in case not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at\nclosure. (ii)\n\nThe cost\nestimates calculated under section\n373-2.8\n(c) and (e)\nof this Subpart for closure and post-closure care of an impoundment subject to\nthis paragraph must include the cost of complying with the contingent closure\nplan and the contingent post-closure plan, but are not required to include the\ncost of expected closure under subparagraph (1)(i) of this\nsubdivision. (g) Special requirements for ignitable\nor reactive waste. Ignitable or reactive waste must not be placed in a\nsurface impoundment, unless the waste and impoundment satisfy all applicable\nrequirements of Part 376 of this Title and: (1)\nthe waste is treated, rendered or mixed\nbefore or immediately after placement in the impoundment so that: (i) the resulting waste, mixture or\ndissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable or reactive\nwaste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(2)\nthe waste is managed in such a way that\nis protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or\nreact; or\n(3)\nthe surface\nimpoundment is used solely for emergencies. (h) Special requirements for\nincompatible wastes. Incompatible wastes, or incompatible wastes and\nmaterials (see Appendix 29 of this Title for examples), must not be placed in\nthe same surface impoundment, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with. (i) Special requirements for hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026\nand F027. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027 must not be placed in a surface impoundment\nunless the owner or operator operates the surface impoundment in accordance\nwith a management plan for these wastes that is approved by the commissioner\npursuant to the standards set out in this paragraph, and in accord with all\nother applicable requirements of this Subpart. The factors to be considered\nare: (i) the volume, physical and chemical\ncharacteristics of the wastes, including their potential to migrate through\nsoil or to volatize or escape into the atmosphere; (ii)\nthe attenuative properties of underlying\nand surrounding soils or other materials; (iii)\nthe mobilizing properties of other\nmaterials codisposed with these wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe effectiveness of additional\ntreatment, design or monitoring techniques. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may determine that\nadditional design, operating and monitoring requirements are necessary for\nsurface impoundments managing hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and\nF027 to reduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to ground water, surface water or air to protect human health and the environment. (j) Action leakage\nrate. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall\napprove an action leakage rate for surface impoundment units subject to\nparagraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section. The action leakage rate is the maximum\ndesign flow rate that the leak detection system (LDS) can remove without the\nfluid head on the bottom liner exceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must\ninclude an adequate safety margin to allow for uncertainties in the design\n(\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage\nmaterial), construction, operation, and location of the LDS waste and leachate\ncharacteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed response actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate\nmust allow for decreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting\nfrom siltation and clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of\nthe system, overburden pressures, etc.). (2)\n\nTo determine if the action leakage rate\nhas been exceeded, the owner or operator must convert the weekly or monthly\nflow rate from the monitoring data obtained under paragraph (d)(4) of this\nsection to an average daily flow rate (gallons per acre per day) for each sump. Unless the commissioner approves a different calculation, the average daily\nflow rate for each sump must be calculated weekly during the active life and\nclosure period, and if the unit is closed in accordance with paragraph (f)(2)\nof this section, monthly during the post-closure care period when monthly\nmonitoring is required under paragraph (d)(4) of this section. (k) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of surface\nimpoundment units subject to paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section must have\nan approved response action plan before receipt of waste. The response action\nplan must set forth the actions to be taken if the action leakage rate has been\nexceeded. At a minimum, the response action plan must describe the actions\nspecified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nIf the flow rate into the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator\nmust: (i) notify the commissioner in writing\nof the exceedance within seven days of the determination; (ii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment\nto the commissioner within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of\nliquids, likely sources of liquids, possible location, size, and cause of any\nleaks, and short-term actions taken and planned; (iii)\ndetermine to the extent practicable the\nlocation, size, and cause of any leak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste receipt should\ncease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from the unit for\ninspection, repairs or controls, and whether or not the unit should be\nclosed; (v) determine any other\nshort-term and longer-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any leaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days after the\nnotification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit to the\ncommissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraphs (iii), (iv), and (v) of this paragraph, the results of actions taken, and actions\nplanned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must submit to\nthe commissioner a report summarizing the results of any remedial actions taken\nand actions planned. (3)\n\nTo make the leak and/or remediation determinations in subparagraphs (2)(iii), (iv), and (v) of this subdivision, the owner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts of liquids by source; (b) conduct a fingerprint, hazardous\nconstituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the leak detection system to\nidentify the source of liquids and possible location of any leaks, and the\nhazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assessments are not\nneeded. (l) Air emission standards. The owner or operator shall manage all hazardous waste\nplaced in a surface impoundment in accordance with the applicable requirements\nof sections 373-2.28 and\n373-2.29\nof this\n\nSubpart.
