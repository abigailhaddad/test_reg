  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5320.9 - Progressive jackpots\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Games\nexcluded. A bonus game where certain circumstances are required to be\nsatisfied, prior to awarding a fixed bonus prize, is not a progressive game and\nis not subject to this section. (b) Swapping progressive levels. For progressives offering multiple levels of\nawards, a player shall always be paid the higher progressive amount, if a\nparticular combination is won that should trigger the higher-paying award. Such\ncircumstance may occur when a winning combination may be evaluated as more than\none of the available pay table combinations (e.g., a flush is a form of a\nstraight flush and a straight flush is a form of a royal flush). (c) Gaming device requirements when any\nprogressive is awarded. When a progressive prize has been awarded, a gaming\ndevice or other commission-approved progressive component shall perform the\nfollowing: (1)\ndisplay a message indicating\nthe progressive award; (2)\nlock-up\nsoftware until the award has been paid by the attendant, unless the prize is\ntransferred to the player's credit meter; (3)\nupdate all progressive-related meters; and\n(4)\nalert a player upon winning\nany jackpot in a manner designed to minimize the possibility of such player\nfrom abandoning an award. (d) Progressive gaming device metering\nrequirements. An electronic gaming device is required to update the electronic\nmeters in such device to reflect the winning progressive jackpot amount\nconsistent with this Part and the electronic accounting meter requirements in\n\nPart 5319 of this Subchapter. Progressives meeting or exceeding income tax\nreporting limits shall require payment by an authorized gaming facility\nemployee. Progressive wins may be added to the credit meter if either: (1)\nthe credit meter is maintained in\nmonetary value or credits; (2)\nthe\nprogressive meter is incremented to whole credit amounts; or\n(3)\nthe prize, in monetary value, is\nconverted to credits on transfer to the player's credit meter in a manner that\ndoes not mislead the player. The conversion from monetary value to credits must\nalways round up. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
