  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 242-5.3 - CO[2] allowance allocations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Energy efficiency and clean energy technology account. The department will allocate the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program adjusted budget to best\nachieve the emissions reduction goals of the CO\n2\n\nBudget\n\nTrading Program by promoting or rewarding investments in energy efficiency, renewable or non-carbon-emitting technologies, and/or innovative carbon\nemissions abatement technologies with significant carbon reduction\npotential. (1)\nNYSERDA will establish\nand administer the energy efficiency and clean energy technology account\npursuant to 21 NYCRR Part\n507. (2)\n\nThe department will allocate most of the CO\n2\n\nBudget\n\nTrading Program base budget or adjusted budget to the energy efficiency and\nclean energy technology account. (3)\nNYSERDA will administer the energy\nefficiency and clean technology account so that allowances will be sold in a\ntransparent allowance auction or auctions. The proceeds of the auction or\nauctions will be used to promote the purposes of the energy efficiency and\nclean energy technology account and for administrative costs associated with\nthe CO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program. The auction will be\ncarried out to achieve the following objectives: achieve fully transparent and\nefficient pricing of allowances; promote a liquid allowance market by making\nentry and trading as easy and low-cost as possible; be open to participation by\nthe categories of bidders determined by NYSERDA or its designee in consultation\nwith the Auction Advisory Committee which meet the minimum financial\nrequirements; monitor for and guard against the exercise of market power and\nmarket manipulation; be held as frequently as is needed to achieve design\nobjectives; avoid interference with existing allowance markets; align well with\nwholesale energy and capacity markets; and be designed to not act as a barrier\nto efficient investment in relatively clean existing or new electricity\ngenerating sources. (i) NYSERDA, or its\nagent, will not be obligated to sell any CO\n2\nallowances\nfor less than the reserve price. (ii)\n\nThe department or its agent may retire\nunsold CO\n2\nallowances at the end of each control\nperiod. (iii)\n\nThe department or its\nagent may retire undistributed CO\n2\nallowances at the end\nof each control period. (b) Cost Containment Reserve (CCR)\nallocation and rules for the sale of CO\n2\nCCR\nallowances. The department shall allocate CO\n2\nCCR allowances, separate from and additional to the CO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program base budget set forth in section\n242-5.1\nof this Subpart, to the\nenergy efficiency and clean energy technology account. The CCR allocation is\nfor the purpose of containing the cost of CO\n2\nallowances. (1)\n\nThe department shall\nallocate CO\n2\nCCR allowances in the following manner: (i) The department shall initially allocate\n1,946,639_CO\n2\nCCR allowances for allocation year\n2014. (ii)\n\nOn or before January 1, 2015 and each calendar year thereafter, the department shall allocate\nCO\n2\nCCR allowances in an amount equal to 3,893,277, minus the number of CO\n2\nCCR allowances that remain in\nthe energy efficiency and clean energy technology account at the end of the\nprior calendar year. (iii)\n\nOn or\nbefore January 1, 2021 and each calendar year thereafter, the department shall\nallocate CO\n2\nCCR allowances in an amount equal to the\nquantity in Table 6, minus the number of CO\n2\nCCR\nallowances that remain in the energy efficiency and clean energy technology\naccount at the end of the prior calendar year. Table 6. CCR Allowance Quantities from\n2021 forward\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030 and each year\n2,905,627\n2,817,577\n2,729,528\n2,641,479\n2,533,429\n2,465,380\n2,377,331\n2,289,281\n2,201,232\n2,113,183\n(2)\n\nAs set forth in 21 NYCRR Part\n507, NYSERDA or its agent shall follow these rules for the sale of\nCO\n2\nCCR allowances: (i) CO\n2\nCCR allowances shall only be sold at an auction in\nwhich total demand for allowances, above the CCR trigger price, exceeds the\nnumber of CO\n2\nallowances available for purchase at the\nauction, not including any CO\n2\nCCR allowances; (ii)\nif the condition of subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph is met at an auction, then the number of\nCO\n2\nCCR allowances offered for sale by NYSERDA or its\nagent at the auction shall be equal to the number of CO\n2\nCCR allowances in the energy efficiency and clean energy technology account at\nthe time of the auction; (iii)\nafter all of the CO\n2\nCCR allowances in the energy\nefficiency and clean energy technology account have been sold in a given\ncalendar year, no additional CO\n2\nCCR allowances will be\nsold at any auction for the remainder of the calendar year, even if the\ncondition in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph is met at an auction; and\n(iv)\nat an auction in which\nCO\n2\nCCR allowances are sold, the reserve price for that\nauction shall be the CCR trigger price; (v) if the condition in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph is not satisfied, no CO\n2\nCCR allowances\nshall be offered for sale at the auction, and the reserve price for the auction\nshall be equal to the minimum reserve price. (3)\nNYSERDA or its agent shall implement the\nreserve price in the following manner: (i) no\nallowances shall be sold at any auction for a price below the reserve price for\nthat auction; and\n(ii)\nif the total\ndemand for allowances at an auction is less than or equal to the number of\nallowances made available for sale in that auction, then the auction clearing\nprice for the auction shall be the reserve price. (c) Emissions containment\nreserve (ECR) withholding. (1)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall convert and transfer any CO\n2\nallowances\nthat have been withheld from any auction(s) by NYSERDA or its agent pursuant to\n21 NYCRR Part\n507\ninto the New York State ECR account. The ECR withholding is\nfor the purpose of additional emissions reductions in the event of lower than\nanticipated emissions reduction costs. (2)\n\nIf the necessary condition in 21 NYCRR\nPart\n507\nis met at an auction, then the maximum number of\nCO\n2\nECR allowances that NYSERDA or its agent will\nwithhold from that auction will be equal to the quantity shown in Table 7 minus\nthe total quantity of CO\n2\nECR allowances that have been\nwithheld from any prior auction(s) in that calendar year. Any\nCO\n2\nECR allowances withheld from an auction by NYSERDA\nor its agent will be transferred into the New York State ECR account. Table 7. ECR Allowance Quantities from\n2021 forward\n2021\n2022\n2023\n2024\n2025\n2026\n2027\n2028\n2029\n2030 and each year\n2,905,627\n2,817,577\n2,729,528\n2,641,479\n2,533,429\n2,465,380\n2,377,331\n2,289,281\n2,201,232\n2,113,183\n(3)\n\nAllowances that have been transferred\ninto the New York State ECR account shall be retired. (4)\nNYSERDA or its agent shall follow these\nrules for the withholding of CO\n2\nECR allowances from an\nauction: (i) CO\n2\nECR\nallowances shall only be withheld from an auction if the demand for allowances\nwould result in an auction clearing price that is less than the ECR trigger\nprice prior to the withholding from the auction of any ECR\nallowances. (d) Voluntary renewable energy market\nand eligible biomass set-aside allocation. The department shall allocate 700,000 tons to the\nvoluntary renewable energy market and eligible biomass set-aside account in\n2020 and 900,000 tons in 2021 and each year thereafter from the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program annual adjusted budget set\nforth in section\n242-5.2\nof this Subpart, as\napplicable. The department shall administer the voluntary renewable energy and\neligible biomass set-aside account in accordance with the following\nprocedures. (1)\n\nThe department will\nopen and manage a general account for the voluntary renewable energy market and\neligible biomass set-aside account. (2)\n\nAll submissions to the department\nrequired for the retirement of an allowance from the voluntary renewable energy\nmarket and eligible biomass set-aside account under this subdivision must be\nfrom the sponsor of a voluntary renewable energy purchase, herein referred to\nas the VREP applicant or the CO\n2\nauthorized account\nrepresentative for a CO\n2\nbudget source co-firing\neligible biomass. (3)\nA VREP\napplicant or a CO\n2\nauthorized account representative for\na CO\n2\nbudget source co-firing eligible biomass may\nsubmit a written request to the department to retire a specified number of\nCO\n2\nallowances in the voluntary renewable energy market\nand eligible biomass set-aside account, herein referred to as a VREEB\napplication. A VREEB application must be submitted by the March 1st, immediately following the allocation year for which it is being made and must\ninclude information to assure that: (i) a\nvoluntary renewable energy purchase demonstrates accreditable\nCO\n2\nemissions reductions or avoidance during the control\nperiod in accordance with department measurement and verification protocol; or\n(ii)\nfor a\nCO\n2\nauthorized account representative of a\nCO\n2\nbudget source co-firing eligible biomass as a\ncompliance mechanism, CO\n2\nemissions from the\nCO\n2\nbudget source are attributable to the burning of\nfuel that the department has determined is eligible biomass. (4)\nA VREEB application regarding\na voluntary renewable energy purchase shall contain data documenting purchases\nof voluntary renewable energy that meet the requirements of this subdivision. Such data must be from reputable sources, which may include retail electricity\nproviders, organizations that certify renewable energy products, and other\nparties as determined by the department. To be considered, data must be\nverifiable and document the following for voluntary renewable energy purchases: (i) documentation of voluntary renewable\nenergy or renewable energy attribute credit purchases by retail customers, by\ncustomer class, in the State during the control period immediately preceding\nthe application date; (ii)\ndocumentation that the renewable energy or renewable energy attributes related\nto voluntary renewable energy or renewable energy attribute credit sales were\nprocured by the retail provider; (iii)\ntime period when the retail purchase(s)\nwas made; (iv)\nstate where the\nelectricity was generated or the renewable energy attribute credit was created, including documentation of facility name, unique generator identification\nnumber, and fuel type; (v) time\nperiod when the electricity was generated or the renewable energy attribute\ncredit was created. (5)\n\nBy the October 31st following the March 1st application deadline established in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the department shall determine the actual\nMWh of voluntary renewable energy market purchases that occurred during the\nallocation year. The department shall retire CO\n2\nallowances in the voluntary renewable energy and eligible biomass set-aside\naccount in an amount up to the number of tons of CO\n2\nrepresented by actual voluntary renewable energy market purchases, based on\nactual MWh purchases demonstrated by each project sponsor as follows: CO\n2\ntons = MP x EF\nwhere: CO\n2\ntons, rounded down to the\nnearest whole ton, is the number of allowances to be placed in the retirement\naccount. MP is the MWh of voluntary renewable energy purchased in\nthe State during the control period that meets the requirements of this\nsubdivision. EF is the CO\n2\nemissions factor for\nthe control area where the electricity represented by the sale was\ngenerated. (6)\nA VREEB\napplication submitted by a CO\n2\nauthorized account\nrepresentative for a CO\n2\nbudget source co-firing\neligible biomass as a compliance mechanism shall contain the following\ninformation: (i) documentation of the\ndepartment\"TMs determination that fuel combusted at the\nCO\n2\nbudget source is eligible biomass; (ii)\nthe number of tons of\nCO\n2\nemissions from the CO\n2\nbudget\nsource attributable to the burning of eligible biomass during the allocation\nyear, as calculated pursuant to section\n242-8.7\nof this Part and any other\ndepartment-approved method; (iii)\nby the October 31st following the March 1st application deadline established in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the department shall determine the actual\nnumber of tons of CO\n2\nemissions from the\nCO\n2\nbudget source attributable to the burning of\neligible biomass during the allocation year. The department shall retire\nCO\n2\nallowances in the voluntary renewable energy and\neligible biomass set-aside account in an amount up to such number of tons of\nCO\n2\nemissions. (7)\n\nIf more than one VREP applicant or\nCO\n2\nauthorized account representative requests the\nretirement of CO\n2\nallowances pursuant to this\nsubdivision, and the number of CO\n2\nallowances that are\nsubject to department approved requests exceeds the number of\nCO\n2\nallowances in the voluntary renewable energy market\nand eligible biomass set-aside account as of December 31st of the previous\ncalendar year, the department will retire CO\n2\nallowances\nfrom the account for the VREP applicants and CO\n2\nauthorized account representatives in the order in which the VREP applicants\nand CO\n2\nauthorized account representatives submitted\napprovable retirement requests. For purposes of this paragraph, VREEB\napplications will be considered simultaneous if they are made in the same\nmonth. Should approvable VREEB applications in excess of the allocation to the\nrelevant voluntary renewable energy market and eligible biomass set-aside\naccount as of December 31st of the previous calendar year be submitted in the\nsame month by different VREP applicants and CO\n2\nauthorized account representatives, the department will retire\nCO\n2\nallowances for those VREP applicants and\nCO\n2\nauthorized account representatives on a basis\nproportional to the number of CO\n2\nallowances requested\nby each VREP applicant and CO\n2\nauthorized account\nrepresentative. (8)\n\nFlow back of\nundistributed CO\n2\nallowances from the voluntary\nrenewable energy market and eligible biomass set-aside account. After retiring\nallowances pursuant to this subdivision for an allocation year, any remaining\nCO\n2\nallowances will either remain in the voluntary\nrenewable energy market and eligible biomass set-aside account or be\ntransferred to the energy efficiency and clean energy technology\naccount. (e) Long\nterm contract set-aside allocation. The department shall allocate 1,500,000 tons to the long\nterm contract set-aside account from the CO\n2\n\nBudget\n\nTrading Program annual adjusted budget set forth in section\n242-5.2\nof this Subpart, as\napplicable. The department shall administer the long term contract set-aside\naccount in accordance with the following procedures. (1)\n\nThe department will open and manage a\ngeneral account for the long term contract set-aside account for each\nallocation year. (2)\n\nThe sponsor\nfor a long term contract hardship demonstration must establish a compliance\naccount under subdivision\n242-6.2\n(a) of this\n\nPart. All submissions to the department required for the reward of allowances\nfrom the long term contract set-aside account under this section must be from\nthe CO\n2\nauthorized account representative for the\ncompliance account, herein referred to as the LTC applicant. (3)\n\nThe LTC applicant may submit a written\nrequest to the department for the reward of a specified number of\nCO\n2\nallowances in the long term contract set-aside\naccount. This request must be submitted by the December 1st, immediately\npreceding the allocation year for which it is being made and must include\ninformation to assure, to the department\"TMs satisfaction, that: (i) the long term contract was entered into\nprior to March 2006; (ii)\nthe LTC\napplicant\"TMs purchase of allowances at auction or in the secondary market\nleads to financial hardship, because the LTC applicant is unable to pass on the\ncost of CO\n2\nallowances to the purchasing party under the\nconditions of the long term contract; and\n(iii)\neach CO\n2\nbudget\nunit at the CO\n2\nbudget source covered by the long term\ncontract uses natural gas as its primary fuel, or the\nCO\n2\nbudget source\"TMs emission rate is no higher than\n1100 lbs/MWhr. (4)\n\nThe\nwritten request submitted pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall\ncontain, at a minimum, the following information: (i) a copy of the long term contract and\nexplanation that the LTC applicant is unable to: (a) pass the cost of allowances on to the\npurchasing party; or\n(b) renegotiate the terms of the contract; (ii)\nfinancial statements from each of the\nprevious five years that clearly demonstrate the revenues and expenses of the\nLTC applicant\"TMs budget source; (iii)\nfuel, total net output and emissions\ndata from the previous three year period; (iv)\nthe portion of emissions from the\nCO\n2\nbudget unit or units covered by the long term\ncontract during the upcoming year; (v) costs associated with the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program compared to all other costs\nassociated with the operation of the CO\n2\nbudget unit or\nunits; and\n(vi)\na demonstration\nthat the LTC applicant will suffer losses in excess of the value of allowances\nsought, supported by projected costs and revenues for the allocation year for\nwhich the LTC application pertains. (5)\n\nExcept as may be modified by paragraph\n(6) or (9) of this subdivision, the department will determine the number of\nCO\n2\nallowances to be allocated to each LTC applicant\nthat the department determines meets the eligibility requirements of paragraph\n(3) of this subdivision, in accordance with the following procedures: LTC Allowances = (((LTCer) x (TO))/2000) -RLTCA; where: \"LTC Allowances\" are the result of the\ncalculation; \"LTCer\" is the applicable emission rate\n\"TO\" is total net output from the LTC facility; \"RLTCA\" is the number of allowances remaining in an LTC\napplicant\"TMs compliance account\n(i) For the purposes of this subdivision, total net output shall be the greatest\ntotal net output experienced by the unit for any single calendar year among the\nthree calendar years, for which data is submitted, proceeding the date by which\nthe department must make the CO\n2\nallocations pursuant to\nthis subdivision. (ii)\n\nFor the\npurposes of this subdivision, the LTCer will be the lesser of the actual\nemission rate included in the application and 1100 lbs/MWhr. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision, there will be no RLTCA for the first application, but for each subsequent\napplication, the department will determine the RLTCA to be the difference\nbetween the allowances allocated to the LTC applicant\"TMs compliance account in\nthe previous allocation year and actual emissions for that allocation\nyear. (6)\n\nThe number of\nCO\n2\nallowances to be allocated to an eligible LTC\napplicant, as determined pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision, shall\nbe discounted by the department as follows, if applicable: (i) by the percentage of\nCO\n2\nallowance cost that the LTC applicant is able to\npass on to the purchasing party; and\n(ii)\nby the percentage of\nCO\n2\nemissions from the CO\n2\nbudget\nsource that are not covered by the long term contract. (7)\n\nAllowances will be allocated to the LTC\napplicant\"TMs compliance account. (8)\n\nAllowances allocated pursuant to this\nsubdivision must only be used for compliance with the\nCO\n2\nbudget emissions limitation for the source. The sale\nor transfer of allowances from the LTC applicant\"TMs compliance account will be\nconsidered a violation of this subdivision. (9)\n\nIf more than one LTC applicant requests\nthe award of CO\n2\nallowances and the number of\nCO\n2\nallowances that are subject to the department\napproved requests exceeds the number of CO\n2\nallowances\nin the relevant long term contract set-side account, the department will award\nCO\n2\nallowances for those LTC applicants on a basis\nproportional to the number of CO\n2\nallowances requested\nby each LTC applicant. (10)\n\nFlow\nback of undistributed CO\n2\nallowances from the long term\ncontract set-aside account. After allocating allowances pursuant to this\nsubdivision for an allocation year, the department will transfer any remaining\nCO\n2\nallowances from the long term contract set-aside\naccount to the energy efficiency and clean energy technology account. (f) 2019 and 2020 program\nreview allowance retirement set-aside account. The department shall transfer 184,237 tons to the program\nreview allowance retirement set-aside account from the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program annual adjusted budget for\n2020 set forth in section\n242-5.2\nof this Subpart, for the\n2019 allocation year. The department shall transfer 179,632 tons to the program\nreview allowance retirement set-aside account from the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program annual adjusted budget for\n2020 set forth in section\n242-5.2\nof this Subpart, for the\n2020 allocation year. The department shall administer the program review\nallowance retirement set-aside account in accordance with the following\nprocedures. (1)\n\nThe department will\nopen and manage a general account for the program review allowance retirement\nset-aside account. (2)\n\nThe\nallowances allocated to the program review allowance retirement set-aside\naccount shall be deemed retired and no longer available for use under the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program.
