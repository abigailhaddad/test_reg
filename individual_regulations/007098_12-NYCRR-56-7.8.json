  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-7.8 - Engineering controls\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Negative air pressure equipment. All OSHA Class I, Class III, and interior\n\nClass II asbestos abatement projects shall employ negative air pressure\nequipment ventilation. (1)\n\nOperation. The\nnegative air pressure equipment shall operate continuously, 24 hours a day, from startup of negative air pressure equipment, through the cleanup operations\nand satisfactory clearance air sampling results being obtained, or the asbestos\nproject is complete. (2)\n\nTiming of\ninstallation. The negative air ventilation units shall be installed and made\noperational after the critical barriers and isolation barriers are\ninstalled. (3)\n\nNegative air\npressure. A negative air pressure, relative to areas outside of the enclosure, shall be maintained at all times in the regulated abatement work area during\nthe asbestos abatement project to ensure that contaminated air in the regulated\nabatement work area does not escape back to an uncontaminated area. (4)\n\nManometer. A manometer shall be used to\ndocument the pressure differential for all OSHA Class I large and small size\nasbestos project regulated abatement work areas. A minimum of -0.02 column inch\nof water pressure differential, relative to pressure outside the regulated\nabatement work area, shall be maintained within the regulated abatement work\narea, as evidenced by manometric measurements. Once installed, on a daily basis\nat least twice per workshift, the asbestos abatement contractor's supervisor\nshall document the manometer reading within the daily project log. The\nmanometer shall be installed and made operational once the negative air has\nbeen established in the regulated abatement work area. Magnahelic manometers\nshall be at a minimum calibrated semi-annually, and a copy of the current\ncalibration certification shall be posted at the work site during Phase II\noperations. (5)\n\nVentilation units. If more than one primary HEPA-filtered ventilation unit is installed, the units\nshall be turned on one at a time and the integrity of temporary hardwall\nisolation barriers checked for secure attachment or the need for additional\nreinforcement shall be checked. A minimum of one additional unit having a\ncapacity of at least equal to that of the primary unit shall be installed, as a\nbackup unit to be used upon primary unit failure, or if necessary during\nprimary unit filter changes. Ventilation unit exhaust ducting shall not exceed\n25 feet in length, due to reduction in volumetric flow rates caused by\nfriction. (6)\n\nPower supply. A GFCI\nprotected temporary power supply shall be available to satisfy the requirements\nof the total of all ventilation units. (7)\n\nPower failure. In the event of electric\npower supply failure, abatement shall stop immediately and shall not resume\nuntil power is restored and exhaust units are operating fully. In the event of\nextended power failure (longer than one hour), after evacuation of all persons\nfrom the regulated abatement work area, the decontamination system enclosure\nfacilities shall be sealed airtight. (8)\n\nAir changes. Negative air pressure\nventilation equipment shall be installed and operated continuously to provide\nat least four air changes in the regulated abatement work area every hour\nincluding during clearance air sampling. (9)\n\nOpenings in enclosure. Openings made in\nthe enclosure system to accommodate these units shall be made airtight with\nduct tape or caulking or both. Where possible, the intake side of the negative\nair ventilation unit shall remain within the regulated abatement work area to\npermit filter changing, while minimizing equipment contamination and the\nlikelihood of contamination of non-work areas. (10)\n\nInstallation and care. Proper\ninstallation procedures, including use of appropriate filters and\nmanufacturer's recommended operating procedures shall be followed. (i) Each HEPA filter should be individually\ntested and certified by the manufacturer to have an efficiency of not less than\n99.97 percent when challenged with 0.3 micron particles. Testing shall be in\naccordance with accepted methodologies, and each filter should bear an\nappropriate UL label to indicate ability to perform under specified\nconditions. (ii)\n\nNegative pressure\nHEPA-filtered ventilation units shall be exhausted to the outside of the\nbuilding or structure and away from public access and to a controllable\narea. (iii)\n\nAir sampling at exhaust\nduct termination locations and daily inspections shall be conducted to insure\nthat procedures are followed to maintain the negative pressure air ventilation\nfiltration systems. (iv)\n\nPre-filters, secondary filters and HEPA-filters shall be replaced when\ndirty. (v) Ducts of at least\nequivalent shape and dimension as those of the negative pressure ventilation\nexhaust shall be used to exhaust to the outside of the building or\nstructure. (vi)\n\nAll fans, ducts and\njoints shall be sealed, braced and supported to maintain an airtight\nsystem. (vii)\n\nOnce installed and\noperational, daily inspections shall be conducted to insure the airtight\nintegrity of the system, and the findings shall be documented by the asbestos\nabatement contractor's supervisor in the daily project log. Inspection, necessary repairs and documenting is required daily, including days when no\n\nPhase II B or 11 C work or support activities are scheduled. (viii)\nA four-foot high construction fence\nwith appropriate signage in compliance with section\n56-7.4\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart shall be constructed at a minimum of 10 feet from the end of the\nexhaust duct tube, or bank of duct tubes, to surround and control this area\nfrom public access. For ground level exhaust duct terminations at the immediate\nexterior of the building/structure, the fence shall be installed at the tube\ndischarge location. (11)\n\nExhaust location. The exhaust shall be vented to the outside of the building or\nstructure, to a controllable area away from public access. Each negative\npressure ventilation unit exhaust duct shall not terminate less than 15 feet\nfrom a receptor or adversely affect the air intake of any building or\nstructure. If the exhaust duct termination location for this section cannot be\nmet due to allowable space restrictions or the regulated abatement work area\nbeing located above the ground floor, the exhaust shall terminate at the\nexterior of the building or structure, and all receptors less then 15 feet from\nthe exterior exhaust duct termination location shall be plasticized with two\nlayers of at least six mil polyethylene. Exhaust tubes may be grouped together\nin banks of no more than five tubes, with each tube exhausting separately and\nthe bank of tubes terminating together at the same controlled area. (i) Exception. HEPA-filtered vacuums used to\nexhaust minor size tent enclosure regulated abatement work areas, do not\nrequire exhausting to the exterior of the building/structure. (b) Exemption from\nventilation and use of negative pressure equipment. (1)\n\nThe use of negative pressure air\nequipment is not required for the following: (i) OSHA class II non-friable ACM exterior\nprojects; (ii)\nasbestos projects\nwhere enclosures (i.e., hard walls, tents, etc.) are not required by this\n\nPart; (iii)\ncontrolled demolition\nasbestos abatement projects. (See section\n56-11.5\nof this Part.)\n(2)\n\nThis exemption does not\nrelieve the asbestos abatement contractor from the negative pressure equipment\nrequirements on other portions of the same project that require the use of\nnegative pressure equipment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n56-7.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
