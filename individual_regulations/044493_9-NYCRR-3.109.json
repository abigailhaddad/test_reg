  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.109 - Executive order no. 109: establishing an executive advisory commission on the administration of justice\n\nState Regulations\n\nAmong the primary responsibilities of government is the\nprotection of our citizens from crime and the prompt and fair administration of\njustice. To achieve these goals, we have in recent years enacted the Violent\n\nFelony Offender and Juvenile Offender Laws, reformed the State's drug laws and\npassed legislation to end the proliferation of illegal handguns in our State. To support these legislative initiatives, we have provided additional court\nfacilities and expanded State prison capacity. In addition, we have pursued, with equal vigor, programs to prevent young people from becoming involved in\ncriminal activities and to rehabilitate criminal offenders. We have also achieved significant judical reform, including\nmerit selection of Court of Appeals judges, streamlined procedures for judicial\ndiscipline, centralized administration of the courts and State takeover of\ncourt costs. Each of these accomplishments has increased the efficiency and\nquality of the administration of justice. However, crime continues to plague our society. I believe\nthat further success in our efforts to control crime will to a large degree\ndepend upon our willingness to reevaluate current programs, embrace new and\ninnovative approaches, and establish comprehensive, long-range criminal justice\nstrategies. And our success depends, most importantly, upon our ability to\naddress the underlying causes of crime with the same determination with which\nwe address the apprehension of criminals. Such an approach requires that we reach out for individuals\nin the private sector who have demonstrated an ability to address and resolve\ncomplex problems. A mechanism must be created to permit such individuals to\nbring their skills to bear on the problem of crime, in a coordinated effort\nwith State and local criminal justice officials. This goal can best be achieved\nby the establishment of an Executive Advisory Commission on the Administration\nof Justice, composed of distinguished citizens representing the various sectors\nof our society, including business, labor, the academic world and experts in\nthe field of criminal justice. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish an Executive Advisory Commission\non the Administration of Justice. I. Powers and Responsibilities\n\nThe Executive Advisory Commission on the Administration of\n\nJustice shall: identify statewide criminal justice objectives and\ngoals; develop and recommend a comprehensive criminal justice\nstrategy to achieve those objectives and goals; review and evaluate existing criminal justice policies and\nprograms and recommend new policies and programs to improve the quality of\njustice in this State; recommend actions to achieve better coordination among the\nvarious State criminal justice agencies and between State and local criminal\njustice programs; recommend actions in other areas which would have a\nsignificant impact on the underlying causes of crime, including programs\nrelated to job training, housing, education, alcohol and drug treatment and\njuvenile delinquency prevention; and review and evaluate specific proposals\nreferred to the commission by the Governor. II. Membership\n\nThe members of the Executive Advisory Commission on the\n\nAdministration of Justice shall be appointed by the Governor, who shall\ndesignate the chairman. The members of the commission shall receive no\ncompensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses\nincurred in connection with the performance of their duties. III. Personnel\n\nThe chairman may employ such staff and assistants as the\nchairman may deem necessary, at a compensation to be fixed by him subject to\nthe approval of the Division of the Budget. Wherever possible, the commission\nshall make use of existing staff and resources in the various State agencies, which are hereby directed to render full cooperation and assistance to the\ncommission. Signed: Hugh L. CareyDated: March 19, 1981\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n3.109\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
