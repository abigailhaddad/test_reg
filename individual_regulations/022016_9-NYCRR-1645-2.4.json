  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1645-2.4 - Interest earned on investments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interest earned on all investments, except investments in U.S. series F, G, J and K bonds, U.S. Treasury bills, savings accounts and State Housing Fund investments, shall be accrued at the\nend of each calendar quarter beginning as of the date of acquisition of the\ninvestment. The accrual of interest earned on investments in U.S. series F, G, J and K bonds and on State Housing Fund investments is separately described in\nsections\n1645-2.6, 1645-2.7, and\n1645-2.8\nand for treasury bills, see section\n1645-2.3, supra. The charge for interest accrued on investments is made to account 1144, Accrued\n\nInterest Receivable on Investments, and the credit is made to the applicable\ninterest earned account, as follows: Funds\ninvested\n\nAccount to be\ncredited for interest earned\n\nDevelopment Funds\n\nAccount 1420.1, Interest-for interest earned\nprior to the date of substantial completion. Account 3610, Interest Earned-for interest earned\nbeginning with, and subsequent to the date of substantial completion. Administration Funds\n\nAccount 3610, Interest Earned. Reserve Funds\n\nAccount 2511, Interest Earned on Reserve Fund\n\nInvestments. Note: Interest earned on reserve fund investments shall not\nbe apportioned among the various reserves, but shall be accumulated in account\n2511 and considered as a part of the replacement reserve. (b) In calculating the interest to be accrued\non U. S. government obligations, the Treasury Department requires that only one\nof the two days of date and due date of an obligation be taken into account in\nstating the time for which interest is to be calculated. With respect to\ninterest on U. S. government obligations for fractional periods, the Treasury\n\nDepartment rule is that the time is the true fraction of that period. For an\nannual rate, the time is the exact number of days for which the interest runs, counting either the initial date or the due date, divided by the number of days\nin the year, 365 or 366; for semiannual or quarterly period, it is the number\nof days for which the interest runs divided by the number of days in the\nparticular half year or quarter year. (c) With respect to obligations other than\nU.S. government obligations, local agencies should be guided by the General\n\nConstruction Law of the State of New York which defines the term year as\nmeaning 365 days, the added day of a leap year and the day immediately\npreceding being counted as one day. Under the New York law, the term year means\n12 months, the term half year, six months, and the term quarter of a year, three months. For investments other than U. S. government obligations, local\nagencies will find it most convenient, however, to state the time in terms of\nmonths and days, rather than in days alone. This is the usual practice for such\ninvestments and has also been adopted by the division for the purpose of\naccruing interest payable on State housing bonds (see Part 1644, Debt Service). Interest for odd days is computed on the basis of so many thirtieths of a\nmonth, assuming a 360-day year. Attention is called to the fact that banks\noperating under the Federal Reserve Banking System employ an entirely different\nbasis for calculating interest on obligations, such as a local agency's\ntemporary loan note, held by them. Such banks calculate interest on the basis\nof 360 days to the year, but the computation of the time the interest runs\nseems to vary among banks. Some banks compute the actual number of days, others\nstate the time in months and days with each month considered as having 30 days. The latter convention has been adopted by the division for the purpose of\naccruing interest on temporary indebtedness of the local agency (see Part 1644, Debt Service). For savings accounts the interest is generally not earned unless\nthe deposit is maintained to the end of the interest period. The interest\nearned will therefore be recorded at the end of the interest period designated\nby the bank by means of a journal voucher. (d) Interest payments, when received, are\ndeposited in the appropriate bank account for the applicable fund and credited, through the cash receipts register, to account 1144, Accrued Interest\n\nReceivable on Investments. See section\n1645-2.9\nfor the allocation of\ninterest earned on development fund investments to the related\nprograms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
