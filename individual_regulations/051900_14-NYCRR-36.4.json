  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 36.4 - Community placement of patients discharged or conditionally released\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The goal of\ncommunity placement shall be to provide the most independent residential\naccommodation which is also physically safe and convenient and appropriate to\nthe needs of the patient. (1)\n\nThe facility, in\ncooperation with county departments of social services and community mental\nhygiene services and other public and private community agencies or individuals\nshall take all necessary steps to obtain an adequate supply of safe, convenient\nand appropriate housing for patients to be discharged or conditionally\nreleased. (2)\n\nIn some cases, this\ngoal can be met by organization and arrangement of physical facilities and\nproperty of the facility when appropriate placement resources in the community\nare inadequate. (b) The\nplacement of choice for many patients is in the home with the family which\npreceded inpatient service. It is recognized that for some patients such a\nsituation never existed, for others no longer exists, and for still others\nwould not be appropriate to the needs of the patient. In these instances, other\nplacements may be appropriate under the following conditions: (1)\n\nIf the place of residence is subject to\nlicensure, certification or approval by the Department of Mental Hygiene or\nother State agency such place of residence shall be currently and validly\nlicensed, certified or approved. (2)\n\nIf groups of patients are placed in homes\nor apartments with no full-time on-site supervision by staff of a provider of\nservices, the placing facility shall consult appropriate local agencies to\ndetermine that the building complies with local zoning, building, fire, and\nsafety codes, ordinances and regulations. (3)\n\nIf a patient is placed alone in a home, apartment, or room the placing facility shall take care that he is capable of\ndaily living without assistance. This care shall include but not be limited to\nregular and frequent visits to the patient by facility staff or staff of\ncooperating agencies to review adjustment during the initial period of\ncommunity placement. (c) The individual service plan of each patient to be placed in the community shall\ninclude plans for placement and placement shall be made in accordance with such\nplans. Such planning shall include, but not be limited to: (1)\nreview of the patient's physical, psychiatric, social and vocational conditions, disabilities and strengths, with\nparticular attention to those related to his or her placement\npotential; (2)\nservices to overcome\ndisabilities and capitalize on strengths to enable the least restrictive\ncommunity placement possible; (3)\nconsideration of post-release supervision of the patient in the placement\nresidence in addition to the plan for outpatient services to overcome mental\ndisability; (4)\nevidence of the\npatient's participation and that of the patient's family and friends, when\nappropriate, in the establishment of the placement plan and selection of the\nplacement residence; and\n(5)\nevidence of participation by staff of other agencies in the establishment of\nthe placement plan, the plan for outpatient services and the means of assuring\ncontinuity of care, if services and supervision are to be provided by another\nagency in whole or in part.
