Tit. 6 §§ 220-2.3 - Gaseous emissions from glass melting furnaces\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a glass melting\nfurnace located at a glass plant that meets the applicability requirements of\nsection\n220-2.1\nof this Subpart must submit\na reasonably available control technology (RACT) analysis to the department for\nemissions of oxides of nitrogen (NO\nx\n) from the furnace\nthat proposes a RACT emission limit(s), and identifies the procedures and\nmonitoring equipment to be used to demonstrate compliance with the proposed\nRACT emission limit(s). The RACT emissions limit(s) shall be expressed in\npounds of NO\nx\nper ton of glass produced. (1)\n\nBy December 1, 2010 the owner or operator\nof a glass melting furnace that was in operation prior to the effective date of\nthis Subpart must submit a RACT analysis, and an application for a permit\nmodification in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 201-6 of this Title\nunless the existing NO\nx\ncontrol equipment and emission\nlimit(s) are determined to be RACT. RACT, as approved by the department, must\nbe implemented by July 1, 2012. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator of a glass melting furnace that was not in operation\nprior to the effective date of this Subpart must submit a RACT analysis prior\nto start up of the furnace. RACT, as approved by the department, must be\nimplemented upon start up. (3)\nRACT\nanalyses must include the available NO\nx\ncontrol\ntechnologies, the projected effectiveness of the technologies considered, the\ncosts for installation and operation for each of the technologies, and the\ntechnology and the appropriate emission limit(s) selected as RACT considering\nthe costs for installation and operation of the technology. For a glass melting\nfurnace that was in operation prior to the effective date of this Subpart and\nfor which the existing NO\nx\ncontrol equipment has been\ndetermined to not be RACT, the RACT analysis must also include a schedule for\ninstallation of control equipment. (4)\n\nApproved RACT determinations will be\nsubmitted by the department to the United States Environmental Protection\n\nAgency for approval as separate State Implementation Plan revisions. (b) The owner or operator of a\nglass melting furnace may opt to comply with subdivision (a) of this section\nand section 220-2.5(b) of this Subpart by shutting down the furnace. An owner\nor operator choosing this option shall submit an application for a federally\nenforceable permit modification by December 1st, 2010 wherein the owner or\noperator commits to permanently shut down the furnace by July 1st, 2012.
