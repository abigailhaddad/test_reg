Tit. 12 §§ 325-6.11 - Hearing of cases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The arbitrator shall determine initially whether the claim is eligible for or\nsubject to mandatory arbitration. If the arbitrator determines that the claim\nis not eligible pursuant to section\n325-6.5\n(b) of\nthis Subpart, the claim shall not be arbitrated and the arbitrator shall notify\nthe parties in writing. Any party aggrieved by the arbitrator's determination\nmay, within 30 days after notification by the arbitrator, serve on the dispute\nforum, upon notice to the other party, a request that the arbitrator issue a\ndecision pursuant to section\n325-6.12\nof this Subpart denying\nthe claim on the basis that the claim is not eligible for or subject to\nmandatory arbitration. Such decision may be appealed pursuant to section\n325-6.13\nof this\n\nSubpart. (b) The arbitrator shall\nnot be bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence or by technical or\nformal rules of procedure but may make such investigation or inquiry and\nconduct the hearing in such manner as he or she deems proper and necessary, and\nshall have the power to issue subpoenas, in accordance with section\n7505\nof the Civil Practice Law and Rules. In any oral hearing, the health insurer may present its case, call witnesses\nand present proofs, and submit to questions thereon. The defending carrier may\npresent its defense, call its witnesses, present its proofs and submit to\nquestions thereon. The arbitrator may, in the event of nonappearance, decide\nthe issue on the basis of the evidence before it. Either party may be\nrepresented by an attorney. (c) Except as provided in sections\n325-6.6\n(c) and\n325-6.7\n(c) of\nthis Subpart, the arbitrator will only consider those objections to requests\nfor reimbursement which have been timely served on the health insurer in\naccordance with section\n325-6.4\nof this Subpart, and\ndocuments supporting objections to requests for reimbursement which have been\ntimely served on the health insurer in accordance with section\n325-6.4\n(a) and\n(f) of this Subpart or supporting the request\nfor reimbursement, which have been timely served on the carrier in accordance\nwith section\n325-6.2\nof this Subpart. Any party\nwishing to serve new or additional objections or documents based solely on\nnewly discovered evidence after the expiration of the time for serving\nobjections or documents must serve such objections or documents on the dispute\nforum within 14 days after the date of acknowledgment of the completed request\nfor arbitration from the dispute forum, in the case of desk hearings, or no\nlater than 14 days prior to the scheduled date of an oral hearing. The new or\nadditional objections or documents must be accompanied by an affidavit\nsubstantiating why such objections or documentation could not have been made or\ndiscovered and served within the prescribed time period, together with proof of\nservice of all additional objections or documents, including the supporting\naffidavit, on the other party. The arbitrator may, in his or her sole\ndiscretion, consent in writing to the service of new or additional objections\nor documentation and consider such new or additional objections or documents\nwhen making his or her decision if he or she determines that special\ncircumstances exist whereby such evidence could not have been previously\ndiscovered and consideration of the new or additional objections or\ndocumentation in the interests of justice is warranted. Where payment is made\nby the carrier after the request for arbitration has been served, the carrier\nmust submit proof of payment. If it is determined by the arbitrator that full\npayment has been made but such payment was not timely, the arbitrator must\naward the health insurer any filing fees paid by it, in accordance with this\nsection. (d) A record of such oral\nhearing shall not be required. Any party requesting a readable, viewable or\naudible record of an oral hearing shall inform the other party and the\narbitrator of such intent, shall make the necessary arrangements and pay the\ncost thereof directly to the person or agency making such record. The\narbitrator and any other party or parties to the arbitration shall be entitled\nto view or hear the record and shall be entitled to a copy of such record upon\npayment of the cost of a copy of such record. (e) The arbitrator may postpone or adjourn\nany hearing upon request of a party or upon the arbitrator's own motion. Each\nparty may cause one adjournment without the payment of an adjournment fee if\nthe adjournment request is received by the dispute forum at least two business\ndays prior to the scheduled arbitration. There shall be an adjournment fee of\n$50 payable to the dispute forum by the party requesting any subsequent\nadjournment if such request is received by the dispute forum at least two\nbusiness days prior to the scheduled arbitration. An adjournment fee of $100\nshall be payable to the dispute forum by the party causing the adjournment\nwithin two business days or less prior to the scheduled hearing. Such fees\nshall be used to defray the cost of administration of the dispute\nforum. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
