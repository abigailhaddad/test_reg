  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 3000.9 - Accelerated determination\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Motion to dismiss. (1)\n\nGrounds. A party may\nmove to dismiss a petition on the grounds that: (i) a defense is founded on documentary\nevidence; (ii)\nthe division of tax\nappeals lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter of the petition; (iii)\nthe petitioner lacks legal capacity to\npetition; (iv)\nthere is an action\npending between the same parties on the same controversy in a court of any\nstate or the United States; the administrative law judge need not dismiss on\nthis ground but may make such order as justice requires; (v) the petition may not be maintained\nbecause of discharge in bankruptcy, infancy or other disability of the moving\nparty, payment, release, or statute of limitations; (vi)\nthe pleading fails to state a cause for\nrelief; (vii)\nthe division of tax\nappeals lacks jurisdiction over the taxpayer; or\n(viii)\nthe division of tax appeals should not\nproceed in the absence of a person who should be a party. Only one such motion shall be made. (2)\n\nProcedure. (i) Either party may submit any evidence that\ncould properly be considered on a motion for summary determination. Whether or\nnot issue has been joined, the administrative law judge, after adequate notice\nto the parties, may treat the motion as a motion for summary determination. The\nadministrative law judge may order immediate hearing of the issues raised on\nthe motion. (ii)\n\nShould it appear\nfrom affidavits submitted in opposition to a motion, that facts essential to\njustify opposition may exist but cannot then be stated, the administrative law\njudge may deny the motion, allowing the moving party to assert the objection in\nhis or her responsive pleading, if any, or may order a continuance to permit\nfurther affidavits to be obtained, or may make such other order as may be\njust. (3)\n\nReview. A\ndetermination of an administrative law judge denying the motion to dismiss is\nnot subject to review by the tribunal. (4)\n\nNotice of intent to dismiss petition. The\nsupervising administrative law judge on his or her own motion may, upon notice\nto the parties, issue a determination dismissing the petition on the ground\nthat: (i) the division of tax appeals lacks\njurisdiction of the subject matter of the petition; or\n(ii)\nthe division of tax appeals lacks\njurisdiction over the taxpayer. The notice of intent to dismiss shall inform the parties of\nthe facts and the reasons providing the basis for the intended dismissal. The\nnotice of intent to dismiss shall also provide the parties with 30 days to\nsubmit written comments on the proposed dismissal. (5)\n\nMotion to dismiss exception. Any party\nmay move to dismiss an exception on the ground that the exception was not filed\nwithin 30 days of the issuance of the administrative law judge determination as\nprovided for in Tax Law, section\n2006(7). (6)\n\nNotice of intent to dismiss exception. The tribunal on its own motion may, upon notice to the parties, issue a\ndecision dismissing the exception on the ground that the tribunal lacks\njurisdiction over the subject matter of the exception. The notice of intent to\ndismiss shall be issued in the same manner as that set forth in paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision. (b) Motion for summary determination. (1)\n\nGeneral. After issue has been joined (see section\n3000.4\n[c]\nof this Part), any party may move for summary determination. Such motion shall\nbe supported by an affidavit, by a copy of the pleadings and by other available\nproof. The affidavit, made by a person having knowledge of the facts, shall\nrecite all the material facts and show that there is no material issue of fact, and that the facts mandate a determination in the moving party's favor. The\nmotion shall be granted if, upon all the papers and proof submitted, the\nadministrative law judge finds that it has been established sufficiently that\nno material and triable issue of fact is presented and that the administrative\nlaw judge can, therefore, as a matter of law, issue a determination in favor of\nany party. The motion shall be denied if any party shows facts sufficient to\nrequire a hearing of any material and triable issue of fact. Where it appears\nthat a party, other than the moving party, is entitled to a summary\ndetermination, the administrative law judge may grant such determination\nwithout the necessity of a cross-motion. Should it appear from affidavits\nsubmitted in opposition to the motion that facts essential to justify\nopposition may exist but cannot be stated, the administrative law judge may\ndeny the motion or may order a continuance to permit affidavits or admissions\nto be obtained and may make such other order as may be just. (2)\n\nReview. A determination of an\nadministrative law judge denying the motion for summary determination is not\nsubject to review by the tribunal (see section\n3000.5\n[f]\nof this Part). (c) Application of CPLR. Where not otherwise in conflict with this Part, a motion\nto dismiss filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to the same\nprovisions as motions filed pursuant to section 3211 of the CPLR and a motion\nfor summary determination filed pursuant to this section shall be subject to\nthe same provisions as motions filed pursuant to section 3212 of the\nCPLR.
