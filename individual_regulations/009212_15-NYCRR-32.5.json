  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 32.5 - Use of ID cards for DMV registration and insurance transactions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Registration transactions. No original registration, reregistration (vehicle change), registration renewal with reregistration (vehicle change), For Hire (FH)\nregistration class renewal, reactivation of registration after plate surrender\nor plate storage, late registration renewal if there is an insurance\ncancellation from the same insurance company in the Insurance Information\n\nEnforcement System (IIES) database or registration renewal with an extension of\nthe registration expiration date (EXTD) shall be processed for any vehicle\nunless an ID card conforming with this Part is submitted to DMV, its agent or\nany party authorized by the department to process registrations along with the\nregistration application and other required documentation. The ID card shall be\nretained by DMV, its agent or any party authorized by the department to process\nregistrations. An ID card is not required for a registration renewal\ntransaction except as prescribed herein. Certification by the applicant that\nfinancial security is in effect made on the application is required from all\napplicants. The commissioner may require the presentation of an ID card for any\nother registration transaction, and where so required the ID card shall be\nreturned to the registrant. (b) Insurance transactions. An ID card conforming to this Part issued by a superseding\ninsurance company is acceptable as proof of insurance, subject to electronic\nverification. An ID card conforming with this Part issued by the same insurance\ncompany is acceptable as proof of insurance, subject to electronic verification\nif the effective date shown on the ID card is the same as or later than the\ncancellation effective date submitted electronically by that company. An ID\ncard issued by or on behalf of an insurance company cannot be used to override\ntransactions electronically submitted to DMV, as required by Part 34 of this\n\nTitle, by that\nsame\ninsurance company. Note: DMV cannot change the effective date of an insurance\ninformation database record (electronically submitted initial load, new\nbusiness or reinstatement transaction) or the cancellation effective date of an\ninsurance information database record (electronically submitted cancellation\ntransaction) with an ID card from the\nsame\ninsurance company. An insurance company shall submit an appropriate electronic transaction(s) with\na corrected date(s). (c) An\nID card shall be rejected on all registration and insurance transactions, as\nrequired by this Part, for the following reasons: (1)\n\nAn ID card does not contain a compliant\nencrypted 2D bar code prescribed by this Part. (2)\n\nAn encrypted 2D bar code is not readable\nby DMV, its agent or any party authorized by DMV to process\nregistrations. (3)\n\nAn encrypted 2D\nbar code is not authentic (security key and PIN number is not verified\nelectronically). (4)\n\nThe ID card\nissuer's New York State Department of Financial Services license was revoked on\nor prior to the effective date or preparation date (FS-75 only) printed on the\nID card. (5)\n\nThe insurance company\nis not in compliance with Part 34 of this Title. (6)\n\nThe ID card, including the data elements\ncontained within the bar code, does not meet the requirements set forth in this\n\nPart. (7)\n\nThe words/symbols AND, &, AND/OR, &/OR and so forth shall not be used except for Trusts and\nDBA organization names due to space limitations. Unacceptable co-registrant\nname examples: (i) MICHAEL & CONSTANCE\nMOTORIST; and\n(ii)\nMOTORIST MICHAEL\nAND CONSTANCE. (8)\n\nAn ID\ncard is issued in the name of an estate, e.g., ESTATE OF\nMICHAEL MOTORIST. A registration generally remains in the name of the deceased, is transferred to a surviving spouse, or the vehicle is registered in the name\nof the executor, executrix, administrator, etc., possibly in care of (%) the\nestate. (9)\n\nThe effective date has\nnot yet occurred, except for a 13-month or 14-month FH registration. In that\ncase two ID cards are required. The first ID card must show insurance coverage\nfor the remainder of the current registration period and the second ID card\nmust show insurance coverage for the entire second registration period. February 5, 2001 livery class registration application example: One ID card\neffective February 5, 2001 for the policy period expiring March 1, 2001 and the\nsecond ID card for the policy period effective March 1, 2001 and expiring on\n\nMarch 1, 2002. (10)\n\nThe expiration\ndate has passed (registration only). (11)\n\nThe effective date is more than 180 days\nprior to the date of registration or the issuance of a temporary 45-day\nregistration. (12)\n\nThe vehicle\ndescribed on the ID card does not match the vehicle to be registered or the\nvehicle described in the DMV inquiry letter, suspension or revocation\norder. (13)\n\nThe vehicle\nidentification number (VIN) on the ID card does not match the VIN on the\nownership document or DMV electronic record. (14)\n\nThe name on the registration\napplication, registration, inquiry letter or suspension/revocation order is not\nthe same name shown on the ID card. (15)\n\nThe name(s) on the ID card or within the\nbar code does not meet the requirements of section\n32.4\nof this Part. (16)\n\nThe ID card is not in conformity with\nthis Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
