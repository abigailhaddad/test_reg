  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 441.339 - Visit\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe physical appearance of an outpatient at a hospital\ncomplex is recognized as contributing one visit regardless of the number of\ndiagnostic and/or therapeutic services the patient receives or the number of\nsections (clinics), operating rooms, laboratories and treatment areas in which\nhe/she receives them. The classification of the visit (i.e., emergency, clinic, etc.) will be determined by the first location where service is rendered. A\npatient referred from a physician's office exclusively for a specific ancillary\nservice or services is classified as one referred ambulatory visit. A\nlaboratory examination of a specimen sent in by a physician for his/her patient\nshall be included as one referred ambulatory visit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n441.339\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
