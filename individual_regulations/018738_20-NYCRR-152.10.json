  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 152.10 - Change of resident status\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the case of a change of residence during the taxable\nyear, requiring the filing of two New York State personal income tax returns\nfor such taxable year as prescribed in Part 154 of this Article, the due date\nfor the filing of the New York State resident and nonresident personal income\ntax returns is the 15th day of the fourth month following the close of the\nentire taxable year covered by both such returns, i.e., the same as though no\nchange of residence had occurred. This rule applies even in cases where no New\n\nYork State personal income tax return need be filed for the part of the year\nsubsequent to the change (where the taxpayer has no New York adjusted gross\nincome during that portion of the year). The provisions of this section also\napply to an individual who, although domiciled in New York State, is filing two\n\nNew York State personal income tax returns for the taxable year because he is a\nresident of New York State for part of the taxable year and he is considered to\nbe a nonresident of New York State for the other part of the same taxable year\npursuant to the provisions of section\n605 (a)(1)(B)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. See Part 157 of this Article for provisions relating to extensions of time\nfor filing New York State personal income tax returns. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n152.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
