  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 14-1.112 - Definition of sanitization; general requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nSanitization is effective bactericidal treatment by heat or chemical means, acceptable to the permit-issuing official, which destroys pathogens on surfaces treated. (a) The following are acceptable methods of sanitizing: (1)\nimmersion for at least one-half minute in clean hot water at a temperature of not less than 170 degrees Fahrenheit (76.7 degrees Celsius); (2)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine at a temperature of at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 degrees Celsius); (3)\nimmersion for at least one minute in a clean solution containing at least 12.5 parts per million of available iodine and having pH not higher than 5.0 and at a temperature of at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 degrees Celsius); (4)\nimmersion in a clean solution containing any other chemical sanitizing agent acceptable to the permit-issuing official that will provide the equivalent bactericidal effect of a solution containing at least 50 parts per million of available chlorine as hypochlorite at a temperature of at least 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23.9 degrees Celsius) for one minute; (5)\ntreatment with culinary-quality steam in the case of equipment too large to sanitize by immersion, but in which steam can be confined; or\n(6)\nswabbing fixed equipment with a solution of at least twice the strength required for that sanitizing solution when used for immersion. (b) When hot water is used for sanitizing, the following is to be provided and used: (1)\na heating device or fixture installed in, on or under the sanitizing compartment of the sink capable of maintaining the water at a temperature of at least 170 degrees Fahrenheit (76.7 degrees Celsius); (2)\na numerically scaled, indicating thermometer accurate to plus or minus two degrees Fahrenheit (1.1 degrees Celsius) convenient to the sink for frequent checks of water temperature; (3)\ndish baskets of such size and design to permit complete immersion of the tableware, kitchenware and equipment in the hot water. (c) Chemicals used for sanitizing are not to have concentrations which will leave toxic residues on surfaces treated. A test kit or other device is to be provided and used that accurately measures the parts per million concentration of the solution used, and the pH when it affects the performance of the chemical sanitizer. (d) Chemicals, heat or other process used for sanitizing is to produce an average plate count per utensil surface examined of not more than 100 colonies, and free from coliform organisms. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n14-1.112\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
