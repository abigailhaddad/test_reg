  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1503.3 - Water supply\n\nState Regulations\n(a) New\nsprinkler systems shall have at least one automatic water supply of adequate\npressure, capacity and reliability meeting all of the requirements for\nlight-hazard conditions of the generally accepted standards listed in the\nappendix to these rules and regulations[FN*]. (b) When primary supply is obtained from\nwater mains and the water pressure is insufficient to maintain 12 pounds per\nsquare inch at the highest sprinkler head, but is sufficient to maintain at\nleast five pounds per square inch at such head, an automatic booster pump shall\nbe used as an auxiliary means of furnishing the required supply. The booster\npump shall be caused to operate when the flow of water through any portion of\nthe sprinkler piping is equal to or greater than that flowing from a single\nsprinkler head. The booster pump shall be capable of supplying sufficient water\nfor a period of at least 20 minutes to at least 25 per cent of the total number\nof sprinkler heads at a pressure of at least 12 pounds per square inch at the\nhighest sprinkler head. Such booster pump shall be so connected as not to\nrestrict the flow of water in the system. (c) Gravity tanks, when used as the primary\nmeans of water supply for new sprinkler systems, shall have a capacity of at\nleast 5,000 gallons and the bottom of the tank shall be not less than 20 feet\nabove the highest sprinkler head supplied from the tank. (d) Where approved by the department, one\ncommon source of water supply of adequate capacity may be acceptable for\nadjacent buildings or contiguous buildings separated by fire walls.
