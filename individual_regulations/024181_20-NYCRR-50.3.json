  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 50.3 - Who must pay the tax\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n270 (3)\nof the Tax Law\nimposes liability for the tax upon the person or persons making or effectuating\nthe sale or transfer, including the person or persons to whom the sale or\ntransfer is made. Thus, both transferor and transferee (and also any agent or\nbroker of either the transferor or the transferee) are liable, and if a\ntransfer is made on the books of the corporation, it is also liable. The\nparties to a transaction may agree which of them shall bear this liability and\npayment of the tax by either discharges the liability of both. However, if the\nparty who has agreed to pay the tax fails to do so, the other party is not\nexonerated from liability by such agreement and in such case payment may be\nenforced against either party. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n50.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
