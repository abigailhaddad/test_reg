  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 1963.3 - Administration\n\nState Regulations\n1. If the petition for letters of administration sets forth a cause of action for\npersonal injury or wrongful death as an asset of the estate, the court follows\nthe common practice of restricting letters to provide that the administrator be\nprohibited from compromising or collecting the proceeds from such cause of\naction without further order of the court. In addition, the court requires that\nthe petitioner and the petitioner's attorney both file separate affidavits\nstating that they will not compromise, or collect proceeds of the cause of\naction without further order of the court. 2. In order to dispense with the\nnecessity of a bond pursuant to SCPA section 805, the petitioner for letters of\nadministration must not only submit the unanimous acknowledged consent of all\ndistributees but also a copy of a paid funeral bill. 3. Absent a showing of special\ncircumstances, the court will not entertain a petition for letters of\nadministration where the sole asset of the estate is title to real property\nwhich in theory passes by operation of law without the necessity of letters of\nadministration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n1963.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
