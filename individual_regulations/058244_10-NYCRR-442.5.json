Tit. 10 § 442.5 - Objective evidence\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1140 ]\n(a) Information produced by the accounting\nprocess should be based, to the extent possible, upon objectively determined\nfacts. Transactions should be supported by properly executed documents such as\ncharge slips, purchase orders, suppliers' invoices, cancelled checks, etc. Such\ndocuments serve as objective evidence of transactions and should be retained as\na source of verification of the data in the accounting records. (b) Certain determinations that enter into\nthe accounting records are based on estimates. The estimates should be based on\npast experience modified by expected future considerations. Examples would\ninclude recognition of estimated provisions for depreciation and bad\ndebts. (c) Books, papers, records\nor other data relevant to matters of hospital ownership, organization and\noperation must be maintained. The data must be maintained in an ongoing\nrecordkeeping system which allows for the data to be readily verified by\nqualified auditors. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
