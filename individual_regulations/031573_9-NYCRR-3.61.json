  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.61 - Executive order no. 61: the new york state securities coordinating committee\n\nState Regulations\n\nThere has been created in the State of New York a number of\npublic authorities and public benefit corporations organized and empowered to\nundertake a wide variety of activities in furtherance of one or more public\npurposes. Many of these agencies exercise the power to incur indebtedness\nthrough the issuance of notes and bonds to the public. During the past few\nyears it has become increasingly apparent that not only the quantity of\nobligations being issued, but the scheduling of the issuance of such\nobligations affects the marketing of such obligations and of those issued by\nthe State of New York and its political subdivisions. It is in the best interests of the State, its authorities\nand public benefit corporations, and municipalities that the demand made upon\nthe financial market from time to time be coordinated so as to avoid a pattern\nof borrowing by the State and such authorities and corporations which is\ninconsistent with the availability of credit. Such coordination will enhance\nthe marketing of such obligations, assist in obtaining more favorable terms, and make more efficient the fulfillment of the public purposes served by these\nentities. It is, therefore, desirable to create a committee whose purpose it is\nto analyze and project market conditions and coordinate and harmonize the\nborrowing patterns of the State and these agencies. I. Definitions\n\nAs used in this Order the following terms shall have the\nfollowing meanings: Committee shall mean the committee created pursuant to\nparagraph II hereof. Issuer shall mean the State or any member agency or\nnon-member agency which issues obligations. Member agency shall mean an authority or public benefit\ncorporation of the State the chairman or chief executive or operating officer\nof which serves as a member of the committee. Non-member agency shall mean an authority or public benefit\ncorporation which has the power to incur indebtedness through the issuance of\nobligations, a majority of the members of which consist of persons either\nappointed by the Governor or who serve as members by virtue of holding a civil\noffice of the State, or a combination thereof. Obligations shall mean notes or bonds issued or to be\nissued by the State, a member agency or non-member agency to finance or fund\none or more activity, program, or project, including obligations issued in\nanticipation of taxes, income or revenues derived from any source or to redeem\nor refinance outstanding obligations. State shall mean the State of New York and where this order\nrefers to any act to be undertaken by the State it shall mean by or through the\n\nState Comptroller or State Director of the Budget. II. The New York State Securities\n\nCoordinating Committee Created--Membership\n\nThere is hereby created within the Executive Department a\ncommittee to be known as the New York State Securities Coordinating Committee.

The Comptroller and the Director of the Budget may\ndesignate an individual to serve in his absence at any meeting of the\ncommittee. The chairman of a member agency may designate the chief executive or\noperating officer to serve in his place at any or all meetings of the\ncommittee. III. Powers and\n\nDuties of the Committee\n\nThe committee shall assist in the coordination of the\nactivities of the State, each member agency and each non-member agency relating\nto the issuance of obligations at either public offerings or private sales. In\ncoordinating these activities the committee shall consider the demand for\nobligations of the types to be issued, the availability of funds for the\npurchase of obligations, the needs of the issuer and such other factors as the\ncommittee deems appropriate. Based upon such factors the committee shall\ndevelop a borrowing schedule recommending the time or times, quantity and type\nof obligations to be issued by the State, member agencies or non-member\nagencies. The borrowing schedule shall relate to obligations to be issued over\nsuch period of time as the committee may determine and may be revised by it\nfrom time to time as it deems appropriate or upon the request of the State, a\nmember agency or non-member agency. To assist the committee in the preparation of a borrowing\nschedule the State, each member agency and each non-member agency shall submit\nto the committee a projection of the approximate dates on which it proposes to\nissue obligations during the fiscal year of the State or such part thereof as\nthe committee may determine from time to time. The type of obligations to be\nissued on such dates, the activity, program, or project to be financed by each\nissue, the proposed maturity date or dates of the obligations, the aggregate\nface value of each type of obligation with similar maturities to be issued on\neach date, and a statement, where appropriate, setting forth the special\ncircumstances or needs of the issuer which would require all or part of one or\nmore issue to occur at the time or times proposed by the issuer, and such other\ninformation as the committee may require. IV. Salaries--Staff\n\nThe members of the committee shall serve without salary or\nother compensation whatsoever other than compensation or other reimbursement\nreceived as a public officer of the State or as the chairman or chief executive\nofficer of a member or non-member agency. Each member agency shall make\navailable to the committee, as required by the chairman, such employees and\nservices as may be necessary to enable it to perform its duties. The committee\nmay retain a financial consultant who is not a public officer or a member or\nemployee of a member or non-member agency. V. Procedures of the Committee\n\nThe committee shall adopt such bylaws as it deems necessary\nand appropriate to regulate the manner in which actions shall be taken by it\nand to establish procedures for the exercise of its powers and for the\nsubmission of such information and data as may be required by it to perform its\nduties. VI. Cooperation of\n\nState Agencies\n\nAll departments, divisions, boards, offices, and public\ncorporations shall cooperate with and provide such assistance as the committee\nmay request. VII. Construction\n\nThe powers and duties of the committee and the exercise\nthereof shall be construed consistently with the powers and duties of the State\nand the governing board of each member agency and non-member agency to make\nfindings and decisions, and otherwise to conduct the business of the State and\nsuch agency, as prescribed by law, and with the powers and duties of the Public\n\nAuthorities Control Board and any applicable Emergency Financial Control Board\nto review and approve submissions to it by any member or non-member agency. The\nfailure of the State, a member agency or non-member agency to comply with the\nprovisions of this order, the bylaws of the committee or the borrowing schedule\nestablished by the committee shall not impair or otherwise affect the validity\nof any obligations issued by the State, a member agency or non-member agency or\nany proceedings authorizing the same.
