  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 7-3.5 - Impact of amendments of declaration on estimated payments\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 213-b(c) and (h))\n\nIf any amendment of a declaration is filed, the remaining\ninstallments, if any, must be ratably increased or decreased (as the case may\nbe) to reflect any increase or decrease in the estimated tax by reason of such\namendment. If an amendment is made after the 15th day of the ninth month of the\ncurrent taxable year, any increase in the estimated tax must be paid at the\ntime of making such amendment. (a) Example. On June 15, 2022, Corporation Y files a declaration of\nestimated tax of $14,000 for the 2022 taxable year. Corporation Y has already\npaid a mandatory first installment of $2,000 on March 15, 2022, and divides the\n$12,000 of remaining estimated tax by three to compute the $4,000 installment\namount to be paid on June 15, on September 15, and on December 15. Corporation\nY paid the required $4,000 installment on June 15, 2022. On September 15, 2022, it files an amended declaration showing an estimated tax of $20,000 for the\n2022 taxable year. The balance of $14,000 ($20,000 minus $2,000 mandatory first\ninstallment and $4,000 June estimated payment) must be paid in two remaining\ninstallments: $7,000 on September 15, 2022, and $7,000 on December 15, 2022. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n7-3.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
