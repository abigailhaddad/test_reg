  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-11.6 - Exterior project removal of non-friable acm roofing, siding, caulking, glazing compound, transite, tars, sealers, coatings, and other nob acms\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following Phase II abatement procedures shall apply\nfor exterior removal of non-friable asbestos-containing roofing, siding, caulking, glazing compound, transite, tars, sealers, coatings, and other NOB\nACMs, currently in a non-friable intact condition, unless the ACM is rendered\nfriable during removal or debris falls within the building/structure. The\nasbestos project shall then be completed in accordance with all requirements of\nthis Part, except special project of this Subpart. (a) Air sampling and analysis. Air sampling\nand analysis on asbestos projects conducted under this section is not required\nunless the ACM is rendered friable during removal or debris falls inside the\nbuilding/structure. Air sampling and analysis shall then be conducted in\naccordance with the requirements of Subpart 56-4 of this Part. (b) Regulated abatement work area\npreparation. (1)\n\nEstablishment and isolation\nof regulated abatement work area. The immediate work area shall be considered\nto be the area from which the asbestos containing materials are actively being\nremoved. The asbestos project regulated abatement work area shall extend 25\nfeet from the perimeter of the immediate work area and shall have signage in\naccordance with section\n56-7.4\nof this Part. An airlock\nshall be required at the entrance to the regulated abatement work area to serve\nas a changing area, if the workers shall have to pass through enclosed publicly\noccupied space, such as from a roof through an interior stairway, to access the\ndecontamination units. (i) Where the asbestos\nproject regulated abatement work area extends outward 25 feet and extends\ndownward one floor to encompass a passage or vehicular door which must be used\nfor either a primary entrance or by an emergency vehicle thereby precluding\nsealing such door, a tunnel structure (with sides and roof) built of plywood\nsheeting, covered with at least two layers of at least six mil plastic, shall\nextend outward 25 feet horizontally from the line of vertical projection of the\nroof edge downward to grade level. (2)\n\nPreliminary preparation. Regulated\nabatement work area preparation shall also comply with sections\n56-7.2, 56-7.3, 56-7.4, 56-7.5, 56-7.6, 56-7.7 and\n56-7.9\nof this Part. (3)\n\nDecontamination system location. The\npersonal decontamination system enclosures can be remote but must be within 50\nfeet of the building/structure entrance used by the asbestos handlers\n(workers), and shall be removed only after obtaining satisfactory clearance air\nresults for the regulated abatement work area or an acceptable visual\ninspection has determined that the abatement is complete, as per section\n56-9.2\n(e) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nCritical barriers. Prior\nto the placement of critical barriers, affected surfaces shall be pre-cleaned\nusing HEPA-filtered vacuum equipment and wet cleaning methods. All openings\nwithin the regulated abatement work area shall be sealed with critical barriers\ninstalled as per section\n56-7.11\n(a) of\nthis Part, prior to beginning Phase II B activity on the project. The critical\nbarriers shall be removed only after satisfactory clearance air sampling\nresults have been obtained or the asbestos project is complete. The\nrequirements of section\n56-7.11\n(b)-(e)\nof\nthis Part do not apply. Additional requirements are as follows: Roofs: (i) All\nopenings (including operable windows, doors, ducts, grilles, communicating\nopenings, etc.) one story above and one story below the roof level of the\nregulated abatement work area (this includes any building/structure within 25\nfeet of the immediate work area), shall be sealed directly with two layers of\nat least six mil flame-retardant plastic sheeting. All vent openings which\ncannot be sealed shall be extended vertically a minimum of eight feet and\nremain in operation. (ii)\nA\npolyethylene drape or curtain may be used instead of plasticizing the windows\nindividually. The drape may be removed after the asbestos project is\ncomplete. (iii)\n\nThe drape or\ncurtain, if used, shall be made of two layers of a continuous 18-foot curtain\n(drape) of at least six mil plastic hung from the top of the wall or parapet. The plastic curtain shall be secured using nailer strips and ram set charges or\nother methods approved by the project supervisor. The bottom of the plastic\ncurtain shall be sufficiently weighted or anchored to prevent lifting due to\nwinds. Curtain seams shall overlap at least 12 inches and be sealed with duct\ntape front and back. The curtain ends and each seal shall be reinforced by\nstapling furring strips to the plastic. The plastic curtain shall extend a\nminimum of 15 feet beyond the last opening within 25 feet of the regulated\nabatement work area. When removed, the plastic curtain shall be disposed of as\nasbestos waste. (iv)\n\nAny windows on\nthe floor below or above and within 25 feet of the immediate work area need to\nbe plasticized, but if safety reasons dictate, they may be plasticized from\ninside the building/structure. (v) Any fixed or non-operable windows on the floor below or above and within 25\nfeet of the immediate work area need not to be plasticized, but shall be sealed\nusing caulking or duct tape. Facades: (vi)\n\nRemovals without tents will require\nplasticizing or sealing of nearby windows within 25 feet of the immediate work\narea, placement of dropcloths, plasticizing of a man-lift or scaffolding and\nother operational safeguards as outlined below. (vii)\n\nFor larger work area removals, any\noperable windows or openings to the building at the work level or on the floor\nbelow within 25 feet of the immediate work area shall be plasticized with two\nlayers of six mil fire-retardant polyethylene sheeting. The windows can be\nplasticized outdoors, or for reasons of safety, from the indoors. Window, door\nand louver units subject to complete removal must have their openings\nplasticized at the interior of the building. Windows that are fixed or\nnon-operable and will remain sealed airtight for the duration of abatement\nactivities, do not require installation of critical barriers. (viii)\n\nUnder areas where non-friable\nmaterials are removed without tents, a dropcloth, made of six mil\nfire-retardant polyethylene sheeting, shall be placed on the ground below the\nwork area to prevent spread of any ACM remnants. This dropcloth shall be a\nminimum of 10 feet wide with an additional 10 feet of width for every floor\nabove a first floor level where removal work will take place, up to a maximum\nof 30 feet of width measured perpendicular to the building/structure. In\naddition, if a straight scaffolding, man-lift, swing scaffolding or similar\nequipment is used for areas above the first floor, the lift/scaffolding unit\nshall be plasticized with two layers of six mil fire-retardant polyethylene on\nthe platform proper, with plastic sheeting extended vertically to waist-high\n(as so equipped) guardrail sides and back of the lift unit. While the\nplatform/lift walking surfaces must be plasticized, the asbestos abatement\ncontractor must provide proper traction surfaces or equipment to assure the\nsafety and comfort of abatement workers while performing abatement activities\non the lift/scaffold equipment. After non-friable ACM is removed from each work\nlocation, the platform and plasticized surfaces toward the building shall be\nwet wiped and/or HEPA vacuumed clean before reuse. The plasticizing on the lift\nor scaffolding shall be periodically inspected during use and repaired as\nneeded. (c) Removal. Removal of ACM shall utilize manual wet methods for all non-friable\nACM removals, and rotating blade roof cutters for roofing removals, as\napplicable. In no event shall methods be used that may render the ACM friable. (1)\n\nResidual non-friable ACM will be wet\nscraped and HEPA vacuumed. Materials removed shall be containerized or\nimmediately wrapped in two layers of six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting\nand secured air tight prior to transport to the waste decontamination\nfacility. (2)\n\nUnder facade areas\nwhere non-friable ACM is to be removed without tents, whenever possible, an\nasbestos handler (worker) with a HEPA vacuum will position the vacuum hose\nwithin four inches of the material being removed to capture small pieces of\nnon-friable ACM and asbestos fines. The hose end will be positioned so that as\nmany smaller pieces of material as possible will fall into the vacuum hose end. Larger pieces of ACM should be immediately bagged or containerized. (3)\n\nAsbestos containing materials will not be\nallowed to accumulate in the work area or on the drop cloth. (4)\n\nIn lieu of using an exterior chute as per\nsection\n56-8.4\n(g) of this\n\nPart, waste bags and containers may be lowered to the waste trailer/dumpster by\ncrane or hoist using a temporary waste transfer container of adequate size and\nstrength. (d) Clean-up\nprocedures during abatement. The following clean-up procedures shall be\nperformed during abatement. (1)\n\nVisible\naccumulations of loose asbestos containing waste material shall be cleaned up\nusing rubber or plastic dustpans and rubber squeegees or HEPA-filtered vacuums. Metal shovels may also be used except in the vicinity of plastic sheeting, critical barriers and isolation barriers, which could be perforated by these\ntools. To pick up excess water and gross wet debris, a wet-dry shop HEPA vacuum\ndedicated to asbestos abatement may be used. This cleaning shall be done\nwhenever there is sufficient asbestos waste material to fill a single leak-\ntight bag/container, or this cleaning shall be done at the end of each work\nshift whichever shall occur first. Visible debris shall be maintained\nadequately wet. (2)\n\nWork shall stop\nwhenever excessive water accumulation or flooding is present in the area and\nshall not resume until the water is collected and disposed of\nproperly. (e) Final\ncleaning and clearance procedures. Final clean-up and clearance procedures for\nabatement shall comply with Subpart 56-9 of this Part, except that only one\nstage of cleaning (final) is to be performed. Lockdown encapsulant use is not\nrequired. (1)\n\nExemption from project monitor\nvisual inspection. Asbestos projects which are exempt from clearance air\nsampling requirements at one- or two-family owner occupied residential\nbuildings/structures, are also allowed an exemption from the project monitor\nvisual inspection requirements. For asbestos projects utilizing this exemption, once final cleaning is complete, a visual inspection shall be completed by the\nsupervisor to confirm that the scope of abatement work for the asbestos project\nis complete, and no visible debris/residue, pools of liquid, or condensation\nremain. The results of this inspection shall be documented by the supervisor in\nthe asbestos abatement contractor daily project log, and once the asbestos\nproject is complete the supervisor shall also obtain the owner's written\nacceptance of the final results of the asbestos project within the daily\nproject log. (f) Final\nwaste removal from the site. The requirements of Subpart 56-10 of this Part\nshall apply, once all asbestos project regulated abatement work areas have been\ncompleted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
