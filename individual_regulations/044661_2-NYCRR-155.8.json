Tit. 2 § 155.8 - Prior service credit and costs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In\nthe event that a State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter\nservice award program provides prior service credit, each volunteer fire\ncompany or volunteer fire department for which the State-administered defined\nbenefit volunteer firefighter service award program is adopted shall identify\non the certified list created pursuant to section\n155.7\nof this Part those\nparticipants who, by virtue of earning such credit, became entitled to one or\nmore years of prior service credit and the number of years of prior service\ncredit to which each such participant is entitled. Any participant who is\ndenied prior service credit for one or more years may appeal to the governing\nboard at the same time, in the same manner, and with like effect as provided in\nsection\n155.7\nof this Part. Except as\nprovided in subdivision (b) or (c) of this section, prior service costs\nattributable to such prior service credit shall be paid to the administrator in\na single lump sum in the year in which a participant is determined to be\nentitled to such credit. Such prior service cost shall be calculated by the\nprogram actuary. (b) In the case of\na State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award\nprogram that is initially established as a State-administered defined benefit\nvolunteer firefighter service award program, the governing board of the sponsor\nmay elect to pay prior service costs over the five-year period beginning with\nthe calendar year in which the program first takes effect; provided, however, that if a volunteer firefighter first qualifies for a year of firefighting\nservice for a calendar year later than the first calendar year in which the\nprogram first takes effect, and thereby becomes a participant entitled to prior\nservice credit, then any prior service cost attributable to such prior service\ncredit shall be paid over the five-year period beginning with the calendar year\nfor which the volunteer firefighter first qualified for a year of firefighting\nservice. (c) In the case of a\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program\nthat was initially established as a locally-administered defined benefit\nvolunteer firefighter service award program, the program actuary shall compute\nthe amount of any unpaid prior service costs at the commencement of State\nadministration. The amount of such unpaid prior service costs shall be paid to\nthe administrator in a single lump sum as a condition precedent to the\ncommencement of State administration, or the governing board of the sponsor may\nelect to pay such prior service costs in annual installments over the five-year\nperiod beginning with the calendar year in which State administration\ncommences. (d) The prior service\ncosts of a State-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service\naward program for the volunteer firefighters of a special fire company or\ndepartment shall be apportioned and paid by the political subdivisions jointly\nsponsoring the program in accordance with the agreement among such political\nsubdivisions; provided, however that unless any such agreement provides\notherwise, the portion of the prior service costs of a State-administered\ndefined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program allocated to a\npolitical subdivision in accordance with such agreement shall be paid in full\nby a political subdivision even if the political subdivision ceases to contract\nwith the volunteer fire company or volunteer fire department after a\n\nState-administered defined benefit volunteer firefighter service award program\nis adopted. (e) Notwithstanding the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of this section, if, as of the effective date of\nthe conversion of the locally-administered defined benefit volunteer\nfirefighter service award program into a State- administered defined benefit\nvolunteer firefighter service award program, the governing board of a sponsor\nhas not approved a certified list of volunteer firefighters qualified for\ncredit for a year of firefighting service rendered during the preceding\ncalendar year which identifies those participants who, by virtue of qualifying\nfor such credit, are entitled to one or more years of prior service credit in\nsubstantial compliance with the procedures referred to in subdivision (a) of\nthis section, the list prepared pursuant to section\n155.7\nof this Part shall identify\nsuch participants and the number of years for which each participant is\nentitled to prior service credit. A participant who is denied prior service\ncredit for one or more years may appeal to the governing board of the sponsor\nat the same time, in the same manner, and with like effect as provided in\nsection\n155.7\nof this Part.
