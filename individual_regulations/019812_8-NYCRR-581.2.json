  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 581.2 - Procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Who may\nregister\n(1)\n\nAny person associated with the\ncollege, including anyone employed by a third party vendor and reports to work\non campus, who operates a motor vehicle on campus must register that vehicle\nwith the college. Vehicle registration entitles a person to drive on campus and\nto park in designated parking lots only; it does not guarantee a parking space. Each vehicle must be registered by the beginning of each academic year. Vehicles may be registered online on the college website. Currently, there is a\ncharge of $16 per year for the first vehicle registered with the college. Up to\ntwo additional vehicles may be added at a cost of $8 per vehicle. These charges\nare subject to change, based upon the costs of operating the vehicle\nregistration program. Vehicles without the appropriate sticker that are subject\nto ticketing for violations of the college's parking rules will be subject to\nimmediate towing from the campus at the owner's expense. (2)\n\nRepealed\n(3)\n\nMultiple registrations. A person may\nregister more than one vehicle if it is for his or her specific use and the\nregistration of the second vehicle bears his or her name or that of his or her\nspouse, domestic partner or parent. If a registrant is disciplined by\nrevocation of campus parking privileges the revocation applies to all cars\nregistered in his or her name. (4)\n\nTransfer and replacement of permits\n(i) A\nparking permit is not transferable. If a permitted vehicle will bear a new\nregistration, or if an existing registration will appear on a replacement\nvehicle, a new permit needs to be purchased following the aforementioned\nprocedure. (ii)\nA registration is\nvalid until the next August 31\nst\nunless the vehicle\nchanges ownership or the registrant severs his or her relationship with the\ncollege. (iii)\n\nIf a vehicle is\nsold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, it is urgent that the registrant\nnotify the University Police Department immediately in writing with proof of\nsame so that there will not be a charge for any violations incurred after the\ntransfer date. Failure to do so may result in liability for violations incurred\nuntil such action is taken. (b) Parking\n(1)\n\nWhere to park. Spaces and parking lot\nsections reserved for persons with special needs, Honors College students, police vehicles, day care drop-off and pick-up, service vehicles and\nconstruction personnel are restricted for use by the aforesaid persons at all\ntimes. Otherwise, registered vehicles may be parked in any unrestricted parking\narea. (2)\n\nPermitted times. Vehicles\nare generally not permitted to be stored on campus. Exceptions may be requested\nin advance in writing to the University Police Department, explaining special\ncircumstance that may exist for consideration. (For example, an international\nstudent returning to his/her country of residence during winter break but\nleaving a registered vehicle behind.)\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
