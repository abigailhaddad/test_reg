  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.12 - Waste piles\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section apply to owners and operators of facilities that\nplace, store or treat hazardous waste in piles, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (2)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section do not apply to owners and operators of waste piles\nthat are closed with wastes left in place. Such waste piles are subject to\nregulation under 373-2.14 of this Subpart (secure landburial\nfacilities). (3)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of any waste pile that is inside or under a structure that provides\nprotection from precipitation, so that neither runoff nor leachate is\ngenerated, is not subject to regulation under subdivision (b) of this section\nor under section\n373-2.6\nof this Subpart, provided\nthat: (i) liquids or materials containing free\nliquids are not placed in the pile; (ii)\nthe pile is protected from surface water\nrun-on by the structure or in some other manner; (iii)\nthe pile is designed and operated to\ncontrol dispersal of waste by wind, where necessary, by means other than\nwetting; and\n(iv)\nthe pile will not\ngenerate leachate through decomposition or other reactions. Note: Operation of a waste pile may be subject to Part 376, Land Disposal Restrictions of this Title. (b) Design and operating\nrequirements. (1)\nA waste pile (except\nfor an existing portion of a waste pile) must have: (i) a liner that is designed, constructed and\ninstalled to prevent any migration of wastes out of the pile into the adjacent\nsubsurface soil or ground water or surface water at any time during the active\nlife (including the closure period) of the waste pile. The liner may be\nconstructed of materials that may allow waste to migrate into the liner itself\n(but not into the adjacent subsurface soil or ground water or surface water)\nduring the active life of the facility. The liner must be: (a) constructed of materials that have\nappropriate chemical properties and sufficient strength and thickness to\nprevent failure due to pressure gradients (including static head and external\nhydrogeologic forces), physical contact with the waste or leachate to which\nthey are exposed, climatic conditions, the stress of installation and the\nstress of daily operations; (b) placed upon a foundation or base capable of providing support to the liner and\nresistance to pressure gradients above and below the liner to prevent failure\nof the liner due to settlement, compression or uplift; and\n(c) installed to cover all surrounding earth\nlikely to be in contact with the waste or leachate; and\n(ii)\na leachate collection and removal system\nimmediately above the liner that is designed, constructed, maintained and\noperated to collect and remove leachate from the pile. The commissioner will\nspecify design and operating conditions in the permit to ensure that the\nleachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm (one foot). The leachate\ncollection and removal system must be: (a) constructed of materials that are: (1)\nchemically resistant to the waste managed in the pile and the leachate expected\nto be generated; and\n(2)\nof\nsufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under the pressure\nexerted by overlying wastes, waste cover materials, and by any equipment used\nat the pile; and\n(b) designed and operated to function without clogging through the scheduled\nclosure of the waste pile. (2)\n\nThe owner or operator will be exempt from\nthe requirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision if the commissioner\nfinds, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator, that alternate design\nand operating practices, together with location characteristics will prevent\nthe migration of any hazardous constituents (see section\n373-2.6\n[d]\nof this\n\nSubpart) into the ground water or surface water at any future time. In deciding\nwhether to grant an exemption, the commissioner will consider: (i) the nature and quantity of the\nwastes; (ii)\nthe proposed alternate\ndesign and operation; (iii)\nthe\nhydrogeologic setting of the facility, including alternative capacity and\nthickness of the liners and soils present between the pile and ground water or\nsurface water; and\n(iv)\nall other\nfactors which would influence the quality and mobility of the leachate produced\nand the potential for it to migrate to ground water or surface water. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of each\nnew waste pile unit, each lateral expansion of a waste pile unit, and each\nreplacement of an existing waste pile unit must install two or more liners and\na leachate collection and removal system above and between such liners. (i) (a) The\nliner system must include: (1)\na top liner\ndesigned and constructed of materials (\ne.g., a geomembrane) to\nprevent the migration of hazardous constituents into such liner during the\nactive life and post-closure care period; and\n(2)\na composite bottom liner, consisting of\nat least two components. The upper component must be designed and constructed\nof materials (\ne.g., a geomembrane) to prevent the migration of\nhazardous constituents into this component during the active life and\npost-closure care period. The lower component must be designed and constructed\nof materials to minimize the migration of hazardous constituents if a breach in\nthe upper component were to occur. The lower component must be constructed of\nat least three feet (91 cm) of compacted soil material with a hydraulic\nconductivity of no more than 1 ×- 10\n-7\ncm/sec. (b) The liners must comply with clauses\n(1)(i)(\na\n), (\nb\n), and (\nc\n) of\nthis subdivision. (ii)\n\nThe leachate collection and removal system immediately above the top liner must\nbe designed, constructed, operated, and maintained to collect and remove\nleachate from the waste pile during the active life and post-closure care\nperiod. The commissioner will specify design and operating conditions in the\npermit to ensure that the leachate depth over the liner does not exceed 30 cm\n(one foot). The leachate collection and removal system must comply with clauses\n(3)(iii)(\nc\n) and (\nd\n) of this\nsubdivision. (iii)\n\nThe leachate\ncollection and removal system between the liners, and immediately above the\nbottom composite liner in the case of multiple leachate collection and removal\nsystems, is also a leak detection system. This leak detection system must be\ncapable of detecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents\nat the earliest practicable time through all areas of the top liner likely to\nbe exposed to waste or leachate during the active life and post-closure care\nperiod. The requirements for a leak detection system in this paragraph are\nsatisfied by installation of a system that is, at a minimum: (a) constructed with a bottom slope of one\npercent or more; (b) constructed of\ngranular drainage materials with a hydraulic conductivity of 1 ×-\n10\n-2\ncm/sec or more and a thickness of 12 inches\n(30.5 cm) or more; or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage materials\nwith a transmissivity of 3 ×- 10\n-5\nm\n2\n/sec or more; (c) constructed of materials that are\nchemically resistant to the waste managed in the waste pile and the leachate\nexpected to be generated, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent\ncollapse under the pressures exerted by overlying wastes, waste cover\nmaterials, and equipment used at the waste pile; (d) designed and operated to minimize\nclogging during the active life and post-closure care period; and\n(e) constructed with sumps and liquid removal\nmethods (\ne.g., pumps) of sufficient size to collect and remove\nliquids from the sump and prevent liquids from backing up into the drainage\nlayer. Each unit must have its own sump(s). The design of each sump and removal\nsystem must provide a method for measuring and recording the volume of liquids\npresent in the sump and of liquids removed. (iv)\n\nThe owner or operator shall collect and\nremove pumpable liquids in the leak detection system sumps to minimize the head\non the bottom liner. (v) The owner\nor operator of a leak detection system that is not located completely above the\nseasonal high water table must demonstrate that the operation of the leak\ndetection system will not be adversely affected by the presence of ground\nwater. (4)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may approve alternative design or operating practices to those\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision if the owner or operator\ndemonstrates to the commissioner that such design and operating practices, together with location characteristics: (i) will prevent the migration of any hazardous constituent into the ground water\nor surface water at least as effectively as the liners and leachate collection\nand removal systems specified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision; and\n(ii)\nwill allow detection of\nleaks of hazardous constituents through the top liner at least as\neffectively. (5)\n\nParagraph (3) of this subdivision does not apply to monofills that are granted\na waiver by the commissioner in accordance with section\n373-2.11\n(b)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. (6)\n\nThe owner or\noperator of any replacement waste pile unit is exempt from paragraph (3) of\nthis subdivision if: (i) the existing unit\nwas constructed in compliance with the design standards of section\n3004(o)(1)(A)(i) and (o)(5) of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (see\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\n(ii)\nthere is no reason\nto believe that the liner is not functioning as designed. (7)\n\nThe owner or operator must design, construct, operate and maintain a run-on control system capable of preventing\nflow onto the active portion of the pile during peak discharge from at lest a\n25-year storm. (8)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must design, operate and maintain a runoff management system to\ncollect and control at least the water volume resulting from a 24-hour, 25-year\nstorm. (9)\n\nCollection and holding\nfacilities (\ne.g., tanks or basins) associated with run-on and\nrunoff control systems must be emptied or otherwise managed expeditiously after\nstorms to maintain design capacity of the system. (10)\n\nIf the pile contains any particulate\nmatter which may be subject to wind dispersal, the owner or operator must cover\nor otherwise manage the pile to control wind dispersal. (11)\n\nThe commissioner will specify in the\npermit all design and operating practices that are necessary to ensure that the\nrequirements of this subdivision are satisfied. (c) Double-lined piles which are not\napplicable to paragraph (a)(3) of this section are not exempt from section\n373-2.6\nground-water protection\nrequirements. (d) [\nReserved\n]\n(e) Monitoring and inspection. (1)\n\nDuring construction or installation, liners (except in the case of existing\nportions of piles exempt from paragraph [b][1] of this section) and cover\nsystems (\ne.g., membranes, sheets or coatings) must be\ninspected for uniformity, damage and imperfections (\ne.g., holes, cracks, thin spots or foreign materials). Immediately after construction\nor installation: (i) synthetic liners and\ncovers must be inspected to ensure tight seams and joints and the absence of\ntears, punctures and blisters; (ii)\nsoil-based and admixed liners and covers must be inspected for imperfections, including lenses, cracks, channels, root holes or other structural\nnonuniformities that may cause an increase in the permeability of the liner or\ncover. (2)\n\nWhile a waste\npile is in operation, it must be inspected weekly and after storms to detect\nevidence of any of the following: (i) deterioration, malfunctions, or improper operation of run-on and runoff control\nsystems; (ii)\nproper functioning of\nwind dispersal control systems, where present; and\n(iii)\nthe presence of leachate in and proper\nfunctioning of leachate collection and removal systems, where\npresent. (3)\n\nAn owner or\noperator required to have a leak detection system under paragraph (b)(3) of\nthis section must record the amounts of liquids removed from each leak\ndetection system sump at least once each week during the active life and\nclosure period. (f) Special requirements for ignitable or reactive waste. Ignitable or reactive waste must not be placed in a waste\npile unless the waste and waste pile satisfy all applicable requirements in\n\nPart 376 of this Title and: (1)\nthe\nwaste is treated, rendered or mixed before or immediately after placement in\nthe pile, so that: (i) the resulting waste, mixture or dissolution of material no longer meets the definition of ignitable\nor reactive waste under section\n371.3\n(b) or (d)\nof\nthis Title; and\n(ii)\nsection\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart is complied with; or\n(2)\nthe waste is managed in such a way that\nit is protected from any material or conditions which may cause it to ignite or\nreact. (g) Special\nrequirements for incompatible wastes. (1)\n\nIncompatible wastes, or incompatible\nwastes and materials (see Appendix 29 of this Title for examples), must not be\nplaced in the same pile, unless section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nif\nthis Subpart is complied with. (2)\nA pile of hazardous waste that is incompatible with any waste or other material\nplaced nearby in containers, other piles, open tanks or surface impoundments\nmust be separated from the other materials, or protected from them by means of\na dike, berm, wall or other device. (3)\n\nHazardous waste must not be plied on the\nsame base where incompatible wastes or materials were previously piled, unless\nthe base has been decontaminated sufficiently to ensure compliance with section\n373-2.2\n(i)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (h) Closure and post-closure care. (1)\n\nAt closure, the owner or operator must\nremove or decontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system\ncomponents (liners, etc.), contaminated subsoils, structures and equipment\ncontaminated with waste and leachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless\nsection\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. (2)\n\nIf, after\nremoving or decontaminating all residues and making all reasonable efforts to\neffect removal or decontamination of contaminated components, subsoild, structures and equipment as required in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, the\nowner or operator finds that not all contaminated subsoils can be practicably\nremoved or decontaminated, the owner or operator must close the facility and\nperform post-closure care in accordance with the closure and post- closure care\nrequirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-2.14\n[f]\nof\nthis Subpart). (3)\n(i) The owner or operator of a waste pile\nthat does not comply with the liner requirements of subparagraph (b)(1)(i) of\nthis section, and is not exempt from them in accordance with paragraph (a)(3)\nor (b)(2) of this section must: (a) include, in the closure plan for the pile under section\n373-2.7\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, both a plan for complying with paragraph (1) of this subdivision and a\ncontingent plan for complying with paragraph (2) in case not all contaminated\nsubsoils can be practicably removed at closure; and\n(b) prepare a contingent post-closure plan\nunder section\n373-2.7\n(h) of this\n\nSubpart for complying with paragraph (2) of this subdivision in case not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed at\nclosure. (ii)\n\nThe cost\nestimates calculated under section\n373-2.8\n(c) and (e)\nof this Subpart for closure and post-closure care of a pile subject to this\nsection must include the costs of complying with the contingent closure plan\nand the contingent post-closure plan, but are not required to include the cost\nof expected closure under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (i) Special requirements for\nhazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027. (1)\n\nHazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 and F027 must not be placed in waste piles that are not enclosed (the\nrequirements for an enclosed waste pile are described in paragraph [a][3] of\nthis section) unless the owner or operator operates the waste pile in\naccordance with a management plan for these wastes that is approved by the\ncommissioner pursuant to the standards set out in this paragraph, and in accord\nwith all other applicable requirements of this Subpart. The factors to be\nconsidered are: (i) the volume and the\nphysical and chemical characteristics of the wastes, including their potential\nto migrate through soil or to volatize or escape into the atmosphere; (ii)\nthe attenuative properties of underlying\nand surrounding soils or other materials; (iii)\nthe mobilizing properties of other\nmaterials codisposed with these wastes; and\n(iv)\nthe effectiveness of additional\ntreatment, design or monitoring techniques. (2)\n\nThe commissioner may determine that\nadditional design, operating and monitoring requirements are necessary for\npiles managing hazardous wastes F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027 to\nreduce the possibility of migration of these wastes to ground water, surface\nwater or air to protect human health and the environment. (j) Action leakage rate. (1)\n\nThe commissioner shall approve an action\nleakage rate for waste pile units subject to paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this\nsection. The action leakage rate is the maximum design flow rate that the leak\ndetection system (LDS) can remove without the fluid head on the bottom liner\nexceeding one foot. The action leakage rate must include an adequate safety\nmargin to allow for uncertainties in the design (\ne.g., slope, hydraulic conductivity, thickness of drainage material), construction, operation, and location of the LDS, waste and leachate characteristics, likelihood and amounts of other sources of liquids in the LDS, and proposed\nresponse actions (\ne.g., the action leakage rate must allow for\ndecreases in the flow capacity of the system over time resulting from siltation\nand clogging, rib layover and creep of synthetic components of the system, overburden pressures, etc.). (2)\n\nTo\ndetermine if the action leakage rate has been exceeded, the owner or operator\nmust convert the weekly flow rate from the monitoring data obtained under\nparagraph (e)(3) of this section to an average daily flow rate (gallons per\nacre per day) for each sump. Unless the commissioner approves a different\ncalculation, the average daily flow rate for each sump must be calculated\nweekly during the active life and closure period. (k) Response actions. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of waste pile units\nsubject to paragraph (b)(3) or (4) of this section must have an approved\nresponse action plan before receipt of waste. The response action plan must set\nforth the actions to be taken if the action leakage rate has been exceeded. At\na minimum, the response action plan must describe the actions specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision: (2)\n\nIf the flow rate into the leak detection\nsystem exceeds the action leakage rate for any sump, the owner or operator\nmust: (i) notify the commissioner in writing\nof the exceedence within seven days of the determination; (ii)\nsubmit a preliminary written assessment\nto the commissioner within 14 days of the determination, as to the amount of\nliquids, possible location, size, and cause of any leaks, and short-term\nactions taken and planned; (iii)\ndetermine to the extent practicable the location, size, and cause of any\nleak; (iv)\ndetermine whether waste\nreceipt should cease or be curtailed, whether any waste should be removed from\nthe unit for inspection, repairs, or controls, and whether or not the unit\nshould be closed; (v) determine any\nother short-term and long-term actions to be taken to mitigate or stop any\nleaks; and\n(vi)\nwithin 30 days\nafter the notification that the action leakage rate has been exceeded, submit\nto the commissioner the results of the analyses specified in subparagraphs\n(iii), (iv), and (v) of this paragraph, the results of actions taken, and\nactions planned. Monthly thereafter, as long as the flow rate in the leak\ndetection system exceeds the action leakage rate, the owner or operator must\nsubmit to the commissioner a report summarizing the results of any remedial\nactions taken and actions planned. (3)\n\nTo make the leak and/or remediation\ndeterminations in subparagraphs (2)(iii), (iv) and (v) of this subdivision, the\nowner or operator must: (i) (a) assess the source of liquids and amounts\nof liquids by source; (b) conduct a\nfingerprint, hazardous constituent, or other analyses of the liquids in the\nleak detection system to identify the source of liquids and possible location\nof any leaks, and the hazard and mobility of the liquid; and\n(c) assess the seriousness of any leaks in\nterms of potential for escaping into the environment; or\n(ii)\ndocument why such assessments are not\nneeded.
