  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 649.1 - Apportionment of principal debt or obligation\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 260\n(a) Where a mortgage covers real property located partly within and partly without\nthe State, the taxes described in Part 642 of this Title are determined based\non an apportionment of the principal debt or obligation which is,or under any\ncontingency may be secured at the date of the execution of the mortgage or at\nany time thereafter. The apportionment is made by multiplying such principal\ndebt obligation by a fraction, the numerator of which is the net value of the\nmortgaged property located within this State, and the denominator of which is\nthe net value of the mortgaged property located within and without the State. For the purpose of this subdivision, net value of the mortgaged property shall\nmean such property's fair market value less the unpaid amount of any prior\nexisting mortgage liens that remain on the property subsequent to the execution\nof such mortgage. Example: Mr. Smith borrows $100,000 from Bank X, and gives the bank\na mortgage on two commercially improved parcels. One of the parcels is located\nin Albany, New York and the other is located in Paterson New Jersey. The parcel\nlocated in Albany has a fair market value of $400,000, and has a prior existing\nmortgage lien totaling $33,000, which remains on the parcel after execution of\nthe mortgage and which represents an amount owed to Bank Z. The parcel located\nin Paterson has a fair market value of $200,000, and has no prior existing\nmortgage liens. Therefore, the net value of the Albany parcel is $367,000\n($400,000 - $33,000) and the net value of both parcels is $567,000 ($367,000 +\n$200,000). The portion of the $100,000 debt secured by the mortgage subject to\nthe taxes described in Part 642 of these regulations is computed as follows: Net value of Albany parcel\n$367,000\n×\n$100,000 = $64,727\n\nNet value of both parcels 567,000\n\nAccordingly, $64,700 ($64,727 rounded to the nearest $100)\nwould be the amount used to compute the mortgage recording taxes. (b) In determining the separate\nnet values of the mortgaged property located within and without this State, the\ncommissioner shall consider only tangible property, both real property and\npersonal property, except that leases of real property shall be deemed to be\ntangible property. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n649.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
