  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 195-4.2 - Authorized by the employee\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ndeduction shall be authorized if it is agreed to in a collective bargaining\nagreement between the representative of the employee and the employer or by a\nwritten agreement between the employer and the employees that is express, written, voluntary, and informed. An authorization is informed when the\nemployee is provided with written notice of all terms and conditions of the\ndeduction, its benefit and the details of the manner in which deductions shall\nbe made. Such written notice shall be provided prior to the execution of the\ninitial authorization and prior to a deduction being made, any change in the\namount of a deduction, or a substantial change in the benefits of a deduction. A substantial change in the benefits includes, but is not limited to, any\nreduction in the benefit received for the deduction or the details in the\nmanner in which deductions shall be made. The employee, or a person selected by\nthe employee, shall be given an opportunity to review such materials, however\nthe employer is not required to pay or provide the means for such review. When\nthe amount of a deduction increases, such increase shall be presumed to be\nsubstantial for purposes of this notice requirement. A single written\nauthorization containing more than one deduction is permissible as long as all\nthe required information is provided. For the purpose of calculating the time\nframes in this regulation, any reference to days shall mean calendar days, not\nbusiness days. Any reference to a week shall mean seven consecutive\ndays. (b) Where the nature of the\ndeduction may fluctuate based upon the purchase, such as meals at a cafeteria\nor merchandise purchased at a gift shop, the notice may provide for deductions\nin a range where the lowest and highest amount that may be deducted are set\nforth in the notice. Any deduction made within the range shall not be\nconsidered changed or increased deduction requiring additional notice and\nauthorization. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n195-4.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
