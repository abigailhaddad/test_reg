In that event, examination after institution of the action may be waived. The waiver, which\nshall recite that medical reports have been exchanged and that all parties\nwaive further physical examination, shall be filed with the note of issue. This\nshall not be a bar, however, to proceeding under subdivision (g) of this\nsection in a proper case. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
