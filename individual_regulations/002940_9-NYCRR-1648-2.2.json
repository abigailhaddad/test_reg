  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1648-2.2 - Tax exemption subsidy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subdivision\n4 of section\n52\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law states that the property included in a project may not, in\nany event, be assessed in excess of the actual cost of the project and further\nexempts from taxation that portion of the assessed valuation of the real\nproperty, both land and improvements, and still retained, in excess of the\nassessed valuation as of the date of the loan and subsidy contract. Section 73\nof the Law states further that all or part of such exemption from local taxes\nmay be applied by a municipality as a credit against the local periodic subsidy\nit has contracted to make to match the State subsidy. (b) The value of the tax exemption subsidy is\ncomputed by applying the current rates of tax to the difference between the\ncurrent assessed valuation of the project and the assessed valuation of the\nretained land, and improvements thereon, as of the date of the loan and subsidy\ncontract. The word \"retained\" refers to the situation where a local agency, subsequent to the acquisition of the site of the project proper, may have ceded\nsome land to the municipality for park, playground or street-widening purposes, etc., or may have sold some of the land originally acquired. For the purpose of\ncomputing the value of the tax exemption subsidy for the first year of project\noperations, however, project development cost may, under certain circumstances, be substituted for current assessed valuation. The division should be consulted\nin this connection as well as in connection with other special cases which may\narise, particularly during the first year of project operations. Further\ninstructions for computing the value of the tax exemption subsidy are contained\nin section\n1648-3.7\nin connection with the\npreparation of the subsidy schedule. See also subdivision (b) of section\n1640-6.3\nfor a fuller discussion of\nthe application of sections\n52\nand\n73\nof the\n\nPublic Housing Law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1648-2.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
