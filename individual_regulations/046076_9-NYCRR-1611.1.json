  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 1611.1 - The site\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Selection. Sites for projects shall be selected with regard to\nmunicipal plans, where such exist. They shall be developed \"in conformity with\na plan or undertaking for the clearance, replanning, reconstruction or\nrehabilitation of a substandard and insanitary area or areas and for\nrecreational and other facilities incidental or appurtenant\nthereto\". (b) Zoning. The project shall comply with all required zoning. (c) Utilities. (1)\n\nInsofar as possible, projects shall make\nuse of existing services and utilities; if these are not adequate, consult the\nprovisions of the application for financial assistance and the loan and subsidy\ncontract. (2)\n\nStorm and sanitary\nsewers or combined sewers shall be accessible to the site, or other acceptable\nprovisions shall be made for the disposition of storm water and\nsewerage. (3)\n\nAn adequate supply of\nwater for drinking, household and fire protection purposes at adequate pressure\nmust be available or must be made available to the project\nsite. (d) Traffic. (1)\n\nIt is not desirable\nthat the site be divided by heavy traffic arteries. It is preferred that roads\nwithin a project site be so laid out as to insure privacy and discourage\nthrough traffic, while adequate for necessary circulation and\nservices. (2)\n\nIt is desirable that\nvehicular access ways be within 200 feet of the entrance to a building or\ndwelling unit. Access for fire-fighting equipment must be provided. Approval of\nthe number and locations of and access to hydrants must be obtained from the\nlocal department having jurisdiction before final site plans are\napproved. (3)\n\nProvide adequate\nparking space in accordance with local laws and ordinances convenient to the\napartments. Provide ramp access from parking areas to adjacent\nsidewalks. (4)\n\nIncinerators shall\nbe provided for apartment buildings three stories or more in height. Row houses\nshall have garbage stations with proper access roads. (e) Access and exterior\nstandards. (1)\n\nAvoid exterior steps as\nmuch as possible; where necessary, provide ramps not exceeding an eight per\ncent grade. (2)\n\nWalks shall have a\nminimum gradient of one per cent and a maximum of eight per cent. (3)\n\nAll walks with a six per cent gradient or\nmore shall be designed with special abrasive finishes and shall be provided\nwith handrails. (4)\n\nAll site\nsurface drainage shall be so designed that the walks shed water quickly and\nthat drainage run-offs shall not cross walks. (5)\n\nWalks constructed on fill shall be of\nasphalt concrete. (6)\n\nWalks shall\nbe designed to permit ready movement and maneuvering of wheelchairs. (7)\n\nSitting areas shall be dispersed\nthroughout the site. They should be properly protected with adequate and\nacceptable shade trees and windbreaks. (8)\n\nEntrance platforms to buildings shall\nhave overhead protection which shall be so designed as to avoid dripping of\nwater on platforms and adjacent walks. (9)\n\nExterior lighting shall be designed to\ninsure full illumination of walks, adequate lighting of driveways and parking\nareas, and must be such as will provide for safety and convenience. (10)\n\nDrying yard areas shall be located and\ndesigned to facilitate their use. (11)\n\nConsideration should be given in row\nhouse projects to provide at the entrance to each apartment a space for limited\nfloral or kitchen gardening. (12)\n\nIn the case of projects having dwelling units for both senior citizens and\nothers, where play areas are installed for children, such play areas shall be\nlocated remote from the apartments for senior citizens. (f) Coverage and density. (1)\n\nBuilding coverage must not exceed 30 per\ncent of the net area within property lines of land acquired for immediate\ndevelopment. (\nNet site area\nis the area of the property\nproposed to be acquired, together with the area of the streets to be closed and\nother public properties incorporated in the project, but excluding streets to\nbe left open, proposed new streets and land to be ceded or reserved for street\nwidening or other purposes.)\n(2)\n\nIn\ndetermining density, consideration should always be given to all factors\naffecting the amenity value of space within or surrounding the project. The\ndensity to which a site may be developed will depend on its relation to\nexisting population densities and the nature of surrounding improvements. The\npreference of the division is for the lowest density compatible with an\neconomical use of land. In the case of a given site, decisions as to how many\nfamilies can best be housed per acre, and as to the use of row houses, flats or\nmultiple dwellings, should be made with reference to the city plan as a whole, as well as with reference to the land cost of the site per dwelling\nunit. (3)\n\nOn inexpensive land, with\ngood topography, and without water or rock conditions, row houses usually are\npreferable; on other sites, multi-story structures are\nrecommended. (g) Minimum distances between buildings. (1)\n\nColumn (A): -Minimum distances between parallel longitudinal\nwalls. Column (B): -Minimum distances between longitudinal walls and end\nwalls; two end walls; corners of adjacent buildings; and between longitudinal\nwalls and interior lot lines. (2)\n\nWhen longitudinal walls are not parallel, the walls nearest to each other shall be required to be separated by the\nminimum distances in column (B), but the average distance between such walls\nshall be not less than column (A). For structures of different heights, these\ndistances shall be averaged. Story height\nA\nB\n1\n46\n31\n2\n50\n34\n3\n54\n36\n4\n58\n39\n5\n62\n41\n6\n66\n44\n7\n70\n47\n8\n74\n50\n9\n78\n52\n10\n82\n55\n11\n86\n58\n12\n90\n60\n13\n94\n63\n14\n98\n66\n15\n102\n68\n16\n106\n71\n17\n110\n74\n18\n114\n76\n19\n118\n79\n20\n122\n82\n21\n126\n84\n(3)\n\nOrientation for sun and prevailing summer\nwinds should be given due consideration. (h) Location of apartments. It is preferable that apartments for senior citizens not\nbe scattered in various buildings, but be concentrated in separate buildings or\nsections of buildings. They should be located so as to have convenient access\nto project community facilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
