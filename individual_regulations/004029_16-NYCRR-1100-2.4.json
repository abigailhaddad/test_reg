(b) Maps clearly showing the location of the facility and all ancillary features\nnot located on the facility site in relation to municipal boundaries and taxing\njurisdictions, at a scale sufficient to determine and demonstrate relation of\nfacilities to those geographic and political features. (c) Written descriptions explaining the\nrelation of the location of the facility site, and all ancillary features not\nlocated on the facility site, to the affected municipalities and taxing\njurisdictions. (d) A map showing\nexisting land uses within the study area. (e) A map of any existing overhead and\nunderground major facilities for electric, gas or telecommunications\ntransmission within the study area and a summary of any consultations with\nowners of major facilities for electric, gas or telecommunications that may be\nimpacted by the facility (crossing existing utilities or otherwise). (f) A map of all properties upon which any\ncomponent of a facility or ancillary feature would be located, and for wind\nfacilities, all properties within two thousand (2,000) feet of such properties, and for solar projects, all properties within one thousand (1,000) feet, that\nshows the current land use, tax parcel number and owner of record of each\nproperty, and any publicly known proposed land use plans for any of these\nproperties. (g) A map of existing\nzoning districts and proposed zoning districts within the study area and a\ndescription of the permitted and the prohibited uses within each zone. For\n\"floating\" or \"overlay\" zones that are not specifically attributable to a\nspecific mapped zoning district, describe the applicable substantive criteria\nthat apply for establishment of the overlay zone. (h) A statement as to whether any applicable\nlocal jurisdiction has an adopted comprehensive plan applicable to lands on\nwhich facility components or ancillary facilities are located and whether the\nproposed facility is consistent with such comprehensive plan. A copy of the\nplan shall be provided in the application, with an indication of plan sections\napplicable to the proposed uses. (i) A map of all publicly known proposed land\nuses within the study area, as determined in consultation with State and local\nplanning officials, from any public involvement process, or from other\nsources. (j) Maps showing\ndesignated NYS coastal areas, inland waterways and local waterfront\nrevitalization program areas (pursuant to 19 NYCRR Part\n600, et seq.), groundwater management zones, designated agricultural districts, flood-prone\nareas, critical environmental areas designated pursuant to article 8 of the\nECL, and coastal erosion hazard areas, that are located within the study\narea. (k) Maps showing recreational\nand other land uses within the study area that might be affected by the sight\nor sound of the construction or operation of the facility, interconnections and\nrelated facilities, including wild, scenic and recreational river corridors, open space, and any known archaeological, geologic, historical or scenic area, park, designated wilderness, forest preserve lands, scenic vistas specifically\nidentified in the Adirondack Park State Land Master Plan, NYS Parks, NYSDEC\nlands, conservation easement lands, federal or state designated scenic byways, nature preserves, designated trails, and public-access fishing areas, major\ncommunication and utility uses and infrastructure, and institutional, community\nand municipal uses and facilities. (l) A qualitative assessment of the\ncompatibility of the facility, including any off-site staging and storage\nareas, with existing, proposed and allowed land uses, and local and regional\nland use plans, located within a one (1)-mile radius of the facility site. The\nassessment shall identify the nearby land uses of particular concern to the\ncommunity and shall address the land use impacts of the facility on residential\nareas, schools, civic facilities, recreational facilities, and commercial\nareas. The assessment and evaluation shall demonstrate that conflicts from\nfacility-generated noise, traffic and visual impacts with current and planned\nuses have been minimized to the extent practicable. (m) A qualitative assessment of the\ncompatibility of proposed above-ground transmission lines, collection lines, and interconnections and related facilities with existing, potential, and\nproposed land uses within the study area. (n) A qualitative assessment of the\ncompatibility of proposed underground transmission lines, collection lines, interconnections and related facilities with existing, potential, and proposed\nland uses within three hundred (300) feet from the centerline of such\ninterconnections or related facilities. (o) For facilities at locations within NYS\ndesignated coastal areas, or in direct proximity of coastal areas or designated\ninland waterways, provide an analysis of conformance with relevant provisions\nof the New York State Coastal Management Program Policies, and proposed or\nadopted Local Waterfront Revitalization Plans (pursuant to 19 NYCRR Part\n600, et seq.). For facilities located within or adjacent to areas mapped by the\n\nNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), mapping of the\nproposed facility's location on the most recent edition of NOAA navigation\ncharts shall be provided. (p) Aerial photographs of all properties within the study area of sufficient scale\nand detail to enable discrimination and identification of all natural and\ncultural features. (q) Overlays on\naerial photographs which clearly identify the facility site and any facility\nlayout, interconnection route, the limits of proposed clearing or other changes\nto the topography, vegetation or human-made structures, and the location of\naccess and maintenance routes. (r) All aerial photographs shall reflect the current uses of the land. All aerial\nphotographs shall indicate the source and the date photographs were\ntaken. (s) A description of\ncommunity character in the area of the facility, an analysis of impacts of\nfacility construction and operation on community character, and identification\nof avoidance or mitigation measures that will minimize adverse impacts on\ncommunity character. For the purposes of this exhibit, community character\nincludes defining features and interactions of the natural, built and social\nenvironment, and how those features are used and appreciated in the\ncommunity. (t) For repurposed sites\nwith a history of environmental contamination only: (1)\n\nFor a site that has not been remediated\nunder the oversight of the NYSDEC: (i) A copy\nof a Phase 1 Environmental Site Assessment (ESA) and, if any Recognized\n\nEnvironmental Conditions were identified, a Phase 2 ESA; and\n(ii)\nA determination by a qualified Licensed\n\nProfessional Engineer, on the basis of the Phase I ESA and/or Phase 2 ESA, that\nit is not anticipated that hazardous substances would be encountered during\nconstruction and/or operation of the facility.

The purpose of the survey is to\ndetermine whether any NYSDEC-regulated wells are present within 500 feet of\nproposed areas to be disturbed, and if so, identification of the wells and\ntype, if known. Unless another method was authorized by the Office, the survey\nshall have been done by the use of magnetometers, including aerial platform\nmagnetometers, that are able to locate wells including those lacking surface\nexpressions and any discovered wells should be recorded in decimal degrees, NAD\n83, with six (6) decimal places of accuracy, and presented on the map\nidentified in subdivision (u)(2) of this section. (2)\nA map based on the survey required in\nsubdivision (u)(1) of this section identifying the location of all wells and\nassociated infrastructure (to the extent known), along with the facility\nboundaries, proposed areas to be disturbed, and proposed facility components. The map should also identify proposed setbacks from permanent structures and\nbuildings of a minimum of one hundred (100) feet from identified well(s) and\nminimum twenty (20) feet in width from nearest reasonable facility property\naccess point to the well to permit inspections and other regulatory work as may\nbe needed. (3)\n\nAn explanation if\nthe applicant cannot meet the setback and access requirements referenced in\nsubdivision (u)(2) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
