INSERT the following paragraph: Standard: 03A In the normal sequence of operation, unless constant\nwarning time detection or other advanced systems requires otherwise, the\nflashing-light signals and the lights on the gate arm (in its normal upright\nposition) shall be activated immediately upon detection of approaching rail\ntraffic. The gate arm shall start its downward motion not less than 3 seconds\nafter the flashing-light signals are activated, and shall reach its horizontal\nposition at least 10 seconds before the arrival of the rail traffic. Exit gate\narm activation and downward motion shall be based on detection or timing\nrequirements established by an engineering study of the individual site. The\ngate shall remain in the down position until the rail traffic has cleared the\ngrade crossing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n8C.06\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
