  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 453.3 - Listing and definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Current\nassets. (1)\n\nCash. (2)\n\nSavings accounts. (3)\n\nCertificates of Deposit. These assets, paragraphs (1)-(3), represent the amount of cash on deposit in banks that is\nimmediately available for use in financing various fund activities, amounts of\ncash that are on hand for minor disbursements, and amounts of cash that are\nheld in savings accounts and certificates of deposits. (4)\n\nInvestments. Current securities, including U.S. government securities, other current investments, share of\npooled investments, cash and investments held in escrow, evidenced by\ncertificates of ownership or indebtedness, should be included in these\nreporting levels. (5)\n\nAccounts and\n\nNotes Receivable. These assets should reflect the amounts due from residential\nhealth care facility patients and their third-party sponsors. (6)\n\nAllowance for Uncollectible Receivables\nand Third-Party Contractuals. These are valuation type (or contra-asset)\nreporting levels. Credit balances represent the estimated amount of\nuncollectible receivables from patients and third-party payors. (7)\n\nReceivables from Third-Party Payors. These assets reflect the estimated amount due from third-party reimbursement\nprograms based on cost reports which will be submitted or have already been\nsubmitted and/or audited. Other levels should be maintained for each year's\nsettlement if more than one year's settlement is included in an estimated\namount, and by program if separately reimbursed. (8)\n\nPledges and Other Receivables\n(Pledges). (9)\n\nDue from\n\nParent/Subsidiary/Affiliate. These assets, paragraphs (8) and (9), reflect\npledges, grants and legacies due the facility as well as miscellaneous\nreceivables due from staff, employees, affiliates, and interest receivable. An\nallowance for the estimated amount of uncollectible pledges should also be\nreported. (10)\n\nDue from Other\n\nFunds. These assets reflect the amounts due between funds. These balances\nshould not be construed as receivables because they do not represent external\nclaims. Instead, these balances should be viewed as representing assets of the\ngeneral funds that are currently accounted for as restricted funds. (11)\n\nInventory. These assets reflect the cost\nof unused supplies. Perpetual inventory records should be maintained and\nadjusted periodically to show actual amounts of supplies on hand. These\nadjustments should be applied to the inventory and distributed to the\nrequisitioning cost centers. The extent of inventory control and detailed\nrecordkeeping will depend on the size and organizational complexity of the\nresidential health care facility. (12)\n\nPrepaid Expenses. These prepaid asset\nand other asset levels represent costs incurred that are properly chargeable to\na future accounting period. Other current assets not included elsewhere can be\nincluded here. (b) Assets whose use is limited. (1)\n\nDepreciation\n\nFunds. (2)\n\nOperating Escrow\n\nFunds. (3)\n\nMortgage Repayment\n\nEscrow. These assets, paragraphs (1)-(3) of this subdivision are provided to\naccount for Board-designated assets, or assets whose use is restricted as to\nwithdrawal or use. (c) Property, Plant and Equipment--Historical Cost. (1)\n\nLand. The balance of this asset reflects\nthe cost of land used in residential health care facility operations. Included\nhere are the costs of offsite sewer and water lines, public utility charges for\nservicing the land, government assessments for street paving and sewers, curbs\nand sidewalks whose replacement is not the responsibility of the facility, and\nother land expenditures of a nondepreciable nature. Unlike buildings and\nequipment, land does not deteriorate with use or with the passage of time; therefore, no depreciation is accumulated. (2)\n\nLand Improvements. All depreciable land\nexpenditures for residential health care facility operations are charged to\nthis asset. This includes the costs of onsite sewer and water lines; paving of\nroadways, parking lots, curbs and sidewalks (if replacement is the\nresponsibility of the facility); and the cost of shrubbery, fences, and\nwalls. (3)\n\nBuildings. The original\ncosts of all buildings and any subsequent additions used in residential health\ncare facility operations are included here. Included are architectural, consulting and legal fees related to the acquisition or construction of\nbuildings, and interest paid on construction loans during the period of\nconstruction. (4)\n\nLeasehold\n\nImprovements. All expenditures for the depreciable improvement of leased land\nand buildings used in residential health care facility operations are to be\nincluded here. (5)\n\nFixed Equipment. Expenditures for fixed equipment are included in this amount. The equipment\nshould fulfill the following requirements: (i) It should be affixed to the building and\nnot be subject to transfer or removal. (ii)\n\nIt should be a depreciable asset with a\nlife less than or equal to that of the building to which it is\naffixed. (iii)\n\nIt should be used in\nresidential health care facility operations. Fixed equipment includes such\nitems as boiler, generators, incinerators, elevators, engines, pumps, air\nconditioning systems and refrigeration machinery. (6)\n\nMajor Movable Equipment. Depreciable\nequipment included in this amount fulfills the following requirements: (i) It should be movable, as distinquished\nfrom fixed equipment. (ii)\n\nIt\nshould have sufficient individuality and size to make control by means of\nidentification tags feasible. (iii)\n\nIt should usually have a minimum life of three years or more. (iv)\n\nIt should be used in residential health\ncare facility operations. Major movable equipment includes such items as\nautomobiles and trucks, desks, beds, chairs, accounting machines, oxygen tents\nand X-ray apparatus. (7)\n\nMinor Equipment. Equipment included here generally fulfills the following\nrequirements: (i) Its location is usually not\nfixed and it is subject to requisition or use by various departments of the\nresidential health care facility. (ii)\n\nIt should be of relatively small\nsize. (iii)\n\nIt should be subject to\nstoreroom control. (iv)\n\nThere\nshould be a fairly large number of pieces in use. (v) It should usually have a useful life of\nthree years or less. (vi)\n\nIt should\nbe used in residential health care facility operations.

Each\nfacility should develop capitalization parameters, in accordance with Medicare\nregulations and in consultation with its independent public\naccountants. (8)\n\nConstruction in Progress. This must include the construction costs of\nuncompleted facilities that will be used for residential health care facility\noperations. Upon completion of the construction program, these amounts would be\ntransferred and the appropriate asset debited. In the case of projects that are\nfinanced through debt agreements that require formal segregation of project\nassets and/or separate accountability, the construction in progress should be\naccounted for in the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund. Upon completion of\nthe construction program, these amounts should be transferred to appropriate\noperating fund assets. (d) Accumulated Depreciation--Historical\n\nCost. (1)\n\nLand Improvements. (2)\n\nBuildings. (3)\n\nLeasehold Improvements. (4)\n\nFixed Equipment. (5)\n\nMajor Movable Equipment. (6)\n\nMinor Equipment. These amounts reflect the depreciation accumulated on the\nlisted assets used in residential health care facility operations. (e) Deferred Charges\nand Other Assets. (1)\n\nCash. (2)\n\nTime Deposits and Equivalents. (3)\n\nPatient Fund Held in Trust (proprietary\nfacilities only). (4)\n\nOther\n\nAssets. (5)\n\nInvestments.

Included in these levels, paragraphs (1)-(7), are the costs (or fair market\nvalue at date of donation) of property, plant, and equipment not used in\nresidential health care facility operations, and the accumulated depreciation\non these assets. Other assets not included elsewhere are also included\nhere. (8)\n\nOther Intangible Assets. This level is required to record intangible assets such as goodwill and\norganization costs. (9)\n\nDue from\n\nPlant Replacement and Expansion Funds (noncurrent). This level reflects the\nreceivables of the operating fund from the plant replacement and expansion\nfunds relative to special restricted funds required by debt agreement. These\namounts would increase as the operating fund transfers assets to these\nrestricted funds. These transfers are considered to give rise to\nreceivables/payables between the funds, rather than reductions or increases to\ntheir fund balances, since the source of the assets are provided either from\noperations or from a portion of the proceeds from the debt financing. These\noperating fund receivables and the corresponding Plant Replacement and\n\nExpansion Fund liabilities will be reduced as the assets are used in these\nrestricted funds to reduce debt, replace assets or pay specified operating\nexpenses. (f) Current\n\nLiabilities. (1)\n\nNotes and Loans\n\nPayable. (2)\n\nCurrent Portion of\n\nLong-Term Debt. These required levels, paragraphs (1) and (2) reflect\nliabilities of the residential health care facility to vendors, banks, and\nother creditors, evidenced by promissory notes due and payable within one\nyear. (3)\n\nAccounts Payable. This\nrequired level reflects the amounts due to trade and other creditors for\nsupplies and services purchased. (4)\n\nAccrued Compensation and Related\n\nLiabilities. This required level reflects the actual or estimated liabilities\nof the residential health care facility for salaries and wages payable and\nliability amounts related to payroll.

(6)\n\nAdvances from Third-Party Payors. Included here are liabilities to third-party payors for current financing and\nother types of advances due and payable within one year. Liabilities to\nthird-party payors arising from reimbursement settlements are not to be\nincluded. Such liabilities must be included in Payable to Third-Party and\n\nPrivate Payors, paragraph (7) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nPayable to Third-Party and Private\n\nPayors. These amounts reflect reimburse ment settlements due to third-party and\nprivate payors. (8)\n\nDue to Other\n\nFunds. Liabilities to other funds are to be recorded here. These liabilities\nshould not be construed as payables because no external obligation\nexists. (9)\n\nIncome Taxes Payable. The amount of income taxes currently payable should be included here. (10)\n\nOther Current Liabilities. (11)\n\nDeferred Revenue--Patient\n\nDeposits. (12)\n\nDeferred\n\nRevenue--Other. (13)\n\nDue to\n\nParent/Subsidiary/Affiliate. (i) Deferred\nrevenue is defined as revenue received or accrued that is applicable to\nservices to be rendered within the next fiscal or calendar accounting period. Deferred revenue applicable to accounting periods extending beyond the next\naccounting period should be included under Deferred Credits and Other\n\nLiabilities, subdivision (g) of this section. Any deferred revenue items, previously classified as noncurrent liabilities, that have become current\nshould be included here. (ii)\n\nAlso\nincluded are unrestricted fund current liabilities which have not been provided\nfor elsewhere. (iii)\n\nIn addition, certain construction project liabilities would be included here, in the Plant\n\nReplacement and Expansion Fund, for those projects that are financed through\ndebt agreements that require final accountability of project activities. These\nliabilities should be reduced as paid or transferred to the operating fund when\nthe project is completed and the assets are transferred to the appropriate\noperating fund assets. (g) Deferred Credits and Other Liabilities. (1)\n\nDeferred Income Taxes. (2)\n\nDeferred Third-Party Revenue. These\nrequired levels, paragraphs (1) and (2), reflect the effects of any timing\ndifferences between book and tax or third-party reimbursement\naccounting. (3)\n\nDue to Operating\n\nFund--Long-Term. This level reflects the liabilities of the plant replacement\nand expansion funds to the operating fund relative to special restricted funds\nrequired by debt agreements. These amounts would increase as the operating fund\ntransfers assets into these funds. The source of such funds could either be\nprovided from operations or a portion of the proceeds from the debt financing. The liabilities in the Plant Replacement and Expansion Fund and the\ncorresponding receivables in the operating fund would be reduced as the assets\nare used to reduce debt, replace assets or pay specified operating\nexpenses. (4)\n\nOther\n\nLiabilities.[FN1]\n(5)\n\nPatient Funds\n\nHeld in Trust[FN1] (proprietary facilities only). (h) Long-Term Debt. (1)\n\nLong-Term Debt. Included here are amounts\nwhich reflect those liabilities that have maturity dates extending more than\none year beyond the current year-end. (2)\n\nLong-term debt liabilities would also be\nincluded in the plant replacement and expansion funds for those projects that\nare financed through debt agreements that require separate accountability of\nproject activities. (3)\n\nThese\nliabilities should be transferred to the operating fund when the project is\ncompleted and the assets are transferred to the appropriate operating fund\nassets. (i) Fund\n\nBalances (Not-for-Profit Residential Health Care Facilities). (1)\n(i) Fund Balances--Each Major Fund Group. (ii)\n\nRestricted Project Fund\n\nBalance.

(vii)\n\nTransfers from Restricted Funds for\n\nCapital Outlays. (viii)\n\nValue of\n\nDonated Property, Plant and Equipment. (ix)\n\nTransfers to Operating Fund for\n\nOperating Purposes. (x) Transfers\nof Amounts Equivalent to Depreciation. (2)\n(i) General fund balances represent the difference between total general fund\nassets and total general fund liabilities; that is, the net assets of the\ngeneral fund. (ii)\n\nThe Transfers\nfrom Restricted Funds for Capital Outlays reporting level should be credited\nfor the cost of capital items purchased with money from the restricted funds. The fair market value at the date of donation of donated property, plant and\nequipment should be credited to value of donated property, plant and equipment. At the end of the year these amounts should be closed out to the fund\nbalance. (iii)\n\nThe credit balances\nof the restricted fund balances represent the net amount of each restricted\nfund's assets that is available for its designated purpose. These fund balances\nmust be credited for all income earned on restricted fund assets and for gains\nfrom the disposal of such assets, and must be debited for all losses from\ndisposal of such assets. (iv)\n\nIf, however, such items are treated as operating fund income (considering legal\nrequirements and donor intent), the restricted fund balance should be charged\nfor such income and due to operating funds should be credited. (j) Equity. (1)\n\nInvestor-Owned Corporation. The level of\ndetail required to report equity amounts reflects the difference between the\ntotal assets and the total liabilities of the investor-owned corporation. (i) Stockholders' Equity. (ii)\n\nPreferred Stock. (iii)\n\nCommon Stock. (iv)\n\nRetained Earnings. (v) Treasury Stock. (vi)\n\nAdditional Paid-In Capital. (2)\n\nInvestor-Owned Partnership.

(ii)\n\nRetained Earnings. (iii)\n\nContributions from Other Funds. This\nreporting level is to be used to record the value of assets contributed to an\nenterprise fund for its unrestricted use and without any liability attached to\nthem. It corresponds, in a general sense, to capital invested by stockholders\nof a private corporation. The most common source is from the general revenues\nof a governmental unit, usually through the general fund, to provide initial\nresources for acquisition of the enterprise. (k) Revenue. The following represent mandated\nreporting levels of revenue. To reiterate, where a reporting level coincides\nwith a functional reporting center, such level is listed only, designated with\nan asterisk(*) and not defined. All functional reporting centers are described\nin detail in Part 455 of this Article. (1)\n\nNursing and Professional Services. (i) Residential Health Care Facility.*\n(ii)\n\nDomiciliary Care Facility.*\n(iii)\n\nAdult Day Health Care.*\n(iv)\n\nHome Health Care.*\n(v) Homemaker.*\n(vi)\n\nOutpatient Clinics.*\n(vii)\n\nMeals on Wheels.*\n(viii)\n\nIntermediate Care Facility--Mental\n\nRetardation.*\n(ix)\n\nIndependent\n\nLiving.*\n(x) Specialty\n\nPediatric.*\n(xi)\n\nHead\n\nInjury.*\n(xii)\n\nAcquired Immune\n\nDeficiency Syndrome.*\n(xiii)\n\nRespite Care.

(i) Transfers from\n\nRestricted Funds for Research. This required level of detail reflects the\namount of money transferred from restricted funds to the unrestricted fund to\nmatch expenses incurred by the unrestricted fund in the current period for\nrestricted fund research activities only. Amounts should be segregated for each\nspecific restricted fund activity or group of activities for which separate\naccounting is required by law, grant or donation agreement. (ii)\n\nTransfers from Restricted Funds for\n\nEducation. Included here is the amount of money transferred from restricted\nfunds to the unrestricted fund to match expenses incurred by the unrestricted\nfund in the current period for restricted fund education activities only. Amounts should be segregated for each specific restricted fund activity or\ngroup of activities for which separate accounting is required by law grant or\ndonation agreement. (iii)\n\nTransfers\nfrom Restricted Funds for Specific Operating Purposes. This level reflects the\namount of money transferred from restricted funds to the unrestricted fund to\nmatch expenses incurred by the unrestricted fund in the current period for\nrestricted fund activities other than research and education. (iv)\n\nSupplies Sold to Other than Patients. This level reflects the income earned by the institution in the sale of medical\nsupplies sold to other than patients. (v) Private Duty Nurses' Fees.

(vi)\n\nBarber and Beauty Shops.*\n(vii)\n\nCafeteria.*\n(viii)\n\nGift Shop.*\n(ix)\n\nPublic Restaurant.*\n(x) Laundry and/or Linen Services. This level\nshould include revenues earned by providing laundry services to employees and\nstudents. See also subparagraph (k)(2)(xxiii) of this section. (xi)\n\nTelephone and Telegraph Services. Money\nreceived from patients, employees and others in payment for residential health\ncare facility telephone and telegraph services should be reported\nhere. (xii)\n\nParking. Money received\nfrom visitors, employees and others in payment for parking privileges should be\nreported here. (xiii)\n\nTelevision\nand Radio Rentals.

This level\nshould be used to report the revenue from sale of miscellaneous scrap and\nwaste. (xvi)\n\nVending Machine\n\nCommissions (net). Commissions earned by the residential health care facility\nfrom coin-operated vending machines and telephones should be reported\nhere. (xvii)\n\nHousing.*\n(xviii)\n\nPhysicians' Offices and Other\n\nRentals.*\n(xix)\n\nCash Discounts on\n\nPurchases. The amounts of cash discounts taken by the residential health care\nfacility on purchases should be reported here. Trade discounts, however, should\nbe treated as reductions in the costs of items purchased. (xx)\n\nRebates and Refunds from Vendors. This\nlevel should be used to report the revenue from rebates and refunds of\nexpenses. (xxi)\n\nDonated\n\nCommodities. This level should be used to report the fair market value of\ndonated commodities. (xxii)\n\nInterest, Finance and Penalty Charges on Accounts Receivable.

(vi)\n\nUnrestricted Income\nfrom Other Restricted Funds. (vii)\n\nTerm Endowment Funds Becoming Unrestricted. (viii)\n\nTransfers from Restricted Funds for\n\nNonoperating Purposes. (ix)\n\nContributions from Other Funds (governmentally operated facilities only). This\nreporting level reflects periodic transfers, from the general fund or special\nrevenue fund to an enterprise fund, that serve as a subsidy for the operation\nof the enterprise. This level is not to be confused with the reporting level\n\nDeficit Financing Grants, paragraph (l)(5) of this section, which relates to\ncontractual arrangements. (x) Extraordinary Gain (Loss). (l) Deductions from Revenue. (1)\n\nBad Debts. (i) This level should contain periodic\nestimates of the amounts of accounts and notes receivable that are likely to be\ncredit losses. The estimated amounts of bad debts can be based on an experience\npercentage applied to the balances of accounts receivable or the amount of\ncharges made to patients' accounts during the period, or it can be based on a\ndetailed aging and analysis of patients' accounts. (ii)\n\nBecause residential health care\nfacilities experience bad debt patterns that vary with classes or types of\npatients, the computation of the estimate or provision should take these\ndifferences into consideration. (2)\n\nContractual Adjustments. (i) These levels of detail must be used to\nreport the differential (if any) between the amount (based on the residential\nhealth care facility's full established rates) of contractual charges to\npatients for services rendered during the period covered by the contract, and\nthe amounts received and due from third-party agencies in payment of such\ncharges, including adjustments estimated at year end. (ii)\n\nShould the facility receive more than\nits established rates from a contractor, the differential will reduce these\namounts. (iii)\n\nIn any instance in\nwhich the difference between the amount of a patient's bill and the payment\nreceived by the residential health care facility from a third-party agency is\nrecoverable from the patient, the differential is retained in Accounts and\n\nNotes Receivable until it is paid or deemed to be a bad debt and is written\noff. (iv)\n\nSpecific required\nsublevels of reporting detail were outlined in section\n453.2\nof this Part. (3)\n\nCharity Services. (i) This level of detail should be used to\nreport the difference between the amount (based on the residential health care\nfacility's full established rates) of bills for services to charity patients\nand the amount (if any) to be received from patients in payment for such\nservices. This difference should be credited directly to Accounts and Notes\n\nReceivable, rather than to an allowance, because charity discounts are readily\ndeterminable. (ii)\n\nIn order to\nproperly distinguish between patients whose uncollectible bills should be\nconsidered charity write-offs and patients whose uncollectible bills should be\nconsidered bad debts, all patients should be classified at the time of\nadmission or as soon after as possible as charity (full or partial) or paying\npatients. There may be some instances in which charges to a patient are\nconsiderably greater than was anticipated because of complications unforeseen\nat the time of admission, and the patient then is unable to pay the full\namount. In such cases the patient should be reclassified as a charity patient, and the charges attributable to the unforeseen complications should be\nconsidered charity service. Uncollectible charges to patients classified as\npaying patients should be treated as credit losses--that is, bad debts--except\nfor contractual adjustments, policy discounts and administrative\nadjustments. (4)\n\nOther\n\nDeductions. Adjustments in charges for services rendered, in the form of\ncourtesy allowances and employee discounts from the residential health care\nfacility's full established rates, should be reported here and credited to\n\nAccounts and Notes Receivable. (5)\n\nDeficit Financing Grants. This level is used to report voluntary and\ngovernmental grants received for the purpose of funding deficits at the\nresidential health care facilities in accordance with contracted arrangements. Reference: subparagraph (k)(3)(ix) of this section. (m) Expenses. The following represents\nmandatory reporting levels of expense. To reiterate, in addition to the\nfollowing, the sublevel of natural classification of expense is also mandated. (1)\n\nAll Functional Reporting Centers, described in Part 455 of this Article, subject to the significance of criteria\noutlined therein. (2)\n\nNonoperating\n\nExpenses. (i) Federal, State and Local Income\n\nTax--Current. (ii)\n\nFederal, State\nand Local Income Tax--Deferred. (n) The following represent mandatory\nreporting levels for statistical information: (1)\n\nStandard Units of Measure, as detailed\nand defined under each Functional Reporting Center in Part 455 of this\n\nArticle. (2)\n\nCost Allocation Basis, as detailed and defined for each Functional Reporting Center in section\n456.3\nof this Article. [FN1] See section\n453.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart.
