(f) Termination of\nadmission agreements. (1)\n\nEvery resident has\nthe right to terminate his/her admission agreement. (2)\n\nVoluntary and mutual termination of the\nadmission agreement. When notice of termination has been given by the operator\nand the resident leaves voluntarily, it is not necessary for the operator to\ncommence a court proceeding pursuant to paragraph (16) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nNo operator may\nterminate an admission agreement and involuntarily discharge a resident except\nfor the following reasons: (i) the resident\nrequires continual medical or nursing care which the residence for adults\ncannot provide. (ii)\nthe resident's\nbehavior poses an imminent risk of death or imminent risk of serious physical\nharm to the resident or anyone else; (iii)\nthe resident fails to make timely\npayment of all authorized charges, expenses, and other assessments, if any, for\nservices including use and occupancy of the premises, materials, equipment and\nfood which the resident has agreed to pay pursuant to the resident's admission\nagreement; (iv)\nthe resident\nrepeatedly behaves in a manner that directly impairs the well-being, care or\nsafety of the resident or any other resident or which substantially interferes\nwith the orderly operation of the facility; (v) the facility has had its operating\ncertificate limited, revoked or temporarily suspended or the operator has\nvoluntarily surrendered the operating certificate of the facility to the\ndepartment; or\n(vi)\na receiver has\nbeen appointed pursuant to the provisions of section\n461-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law and is providing for the orderly transfer of all\nresidents in the facility to other facilities or is making other provision for\nthe residents' continued safety and care. (4)\n\nIf failure to make timely payment\nresulted from an interruption in the receipt by the resident of any public\nbenefits to which he/she is entitled, no admission agreement may be\ninvoluntarily terminated unless the operator, during the 30 day notice period, assists the resident in obtaining such benefits, or any other available\nsupplemental public benefits. Documented failure of the resident to cooperate\nwith such efforts by the operator will be considered evidence of assistance on\nthe part of the operator. (5)\n\nIn\norder to terminate the admission agreement of a resident and discharge him/her\nfrom the facility, the operator must give at least 30 days written notice, on a\nform prescribed by the department, to: (i) the resident; (ii)\nthe resident's\nnext of kin, if known; and\n(iii)\nany person designated in the admission agreement as the responsible party, if\nany. (6)\n\nThe termination\nnotice must indicate: (i) the reason for\ntermination; (ii)\nthe date of\ntermination; (iii)\nthat the\nresident has the right to object to the termination of the agreement and the\nsubsequent discharge; and\n(iv)\nthat, if the resident does object, he/she may remain in the facility while the\noperator commences a court proceeding, and until such time that the court finds\nin favor of the operator. (7)\n\nIn addition to the prescribed termination\nnotice, the operator must furnish to the resident a list of agencies, including\nthe Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program, which provide free legal services, and\nagencies engaged in resident advocacy services within the geographic vicinity\nof the facility. Such lists must be provided or approved by the department and\nmust include names, addresses and telephone numbers of such agencies. (8)\nA copy of the termination notice must be\nfiled by the operator with the appropriate regional office within five days\nafter the notice is served upon the resident. (9)\n\nTransfer of a resident may be arranged\nwithout at least 30 days notice under the following circumstances: (i) when a resident develops a communicable\ndisease, medical or mental condition, or sustains an injury such that continual\nskilled medical and nursing services are required, arrangements must be made by\nthe operator for appropriate professional evaluation and transfer to an\nappropriate facility; (ii)\nin the\nevent that a resident's behavior poses an imminent risk of death or of serious\nphysical harm to himself/herself or others, the operator must arrange for\ntransfer of the individual to an appropriate and safe\nlocation. (10)\n\nIn the\nevent that a resident's behavior poses an imminent risk of death or serious\nphysical harm to himself/herself or others, the operator should, whenever\npossible, seek the assistance of a peace officer, acting pursuant to the\nofficer's special duties, or a police officer, who is a member of an authorized\npolice department or force or a sheriff's department, in transferring the\nresident to a safe location. (11)\n\nWhen the basis for a transfer no longer exists, and the resident is deemed\nappropriate for placement in the facility, the operator must readmit the\nresident, as long as the involuntary termination proceedings have not been\ncompleted. (12)\n\nTransfer of a\nresident without notice of termination may not be deemed a termination of the\nadmission agreement. Such removal does not relieve the operator from the\nrequirement of proceeding, subsequent to the removal of the resident, to\nterminate the admission agreement. (13)\n\nWhen the operator proceeds to terminate\nthe admission agreement of a resident transferred without notice of\ntermination, the operator must arrange for the written notice to be\nhand-delivered to the resident at the location to which he/she has been\nremoved. If such hand delivery is not possible, then notice must be given by\nany of the methods provided by law for personal service upon a natural person\n(pursuant to section 308, Civil Practice Law and Rules). (14)\n\nWhen a receiver has been appointed\npursuant to the provisions of section\n461-f\nof\nthe Social Services Law and is providing for the orderly transfer of all\nresidents in the facility to other facilities or is making other provisions for\nthe residents' continued safety and care, the receiver may terminate admission\nagreements and arrange for the transfer of all residents to appropriate\nsettings without regard to the notice and court review requirements of this\nsubdivision. (15)\n\nExcept as\ndescribed in paragraph (14) of this subdivision, a receiver must adhere to the\nrequirements of this subdivision in any instance when termination of an\nadmission agreement is not directly related to the closure of a\nfacility. (16)\n\nIf the resident\nindicates to the operator within 30 days of receipt of notice that he/she\nobjects to the termination of the agreement or if at the end of the 30 days the\nresident remains in the facility, the operator must institute a special\nproceeding pursuant to section\n461-h\nof\nthe Social Services Law prior to termination and discharge. (17)\n\nWhile legal action is in progress, the\noperator may not: (i) seek to amend the\nadmission agreement in effect as of the date of the notice of\ntermination; (ii)\nfail to provide\nany of the care and services required by department regulations and the\nadmission agreement; or\n(iii)\nengage in any action to intimidate or harass the resident. (18)\n\nBoth the resident and the operator are\nfree to seek any other judicial relief to which they may be entitled. (19)\n\nThe operator must assist any resident\nproposed to be transferred or discharged pursuant to this subdivision, to the\nextent necessary, to assure, whenever practicable, the resident's placement in\na care setting which is adequate, appropriate and consistent with his/her\nwishes.
