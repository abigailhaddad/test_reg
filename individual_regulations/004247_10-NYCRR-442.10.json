  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.10 - Basis of valuation\n\nState Regulations\n[1190]\n(a) Historical cost is the basis used in\naccounting for the valuation of all assets and in recording all expenses\n(except fair market value in the case of donations and imputed value in the\ncase of nonpaid workers). Historical cost, simply defined, is\nthe amount of cash or cash equivalents given in exchange for properties or\nservices at the time of acquisition. It is the basis for the valuation of\nassets and for the recording of most expenses. Cost ordinarily has been the\nbasis for accounting for assets and expenses because it is a permanent and\nobjective measurement that reflects the accountability of management for the\nutilization of hospital funds. (b) Hospitals, however, frequently acquire property, equipment, services and\nsupplies by donation. The property, equipment, service and/or supply is\nconsidered donated when acquired without the hospital making any payment for it\nin the form of cash, property or services. The property, equipment, service\nand/or supply should be valued at the fair market value which is the price that\nthe asset would cost by bona fide bargaining between well-informed buyers and\nsellers at the date of donation (regardless of date of receipt). Failure to\ngive accounting recognition to donated properties and services results in an\nunderstatement of hospital assets, revenues and expenses. (c) Many hospitals receive the services of\nmembers of an organization of nonpaid workers that has arrangements with the\nhospital for the performance of services. The services are in positions\ncustomarily held by full-time employees, and are performed on a regularly\nscheduled basis. The fair value of donated services must be reported when there\nis the equivalent of an employer-employee relationship and an objective basis\nfor valuing such services. The value of services donated by organizations must\nbe evidenced by a contractual relationship which provides the basis for\nvaluation. The amounts reported are not to exceed those paid others for similar\nwork. (d) The value of services of\na type of which hospitals generally do not remunerate individual's performances\nare not included as operating cost (\ne.g., donated services of\nindividuals such as volunteers and trustees). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n442.10\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
