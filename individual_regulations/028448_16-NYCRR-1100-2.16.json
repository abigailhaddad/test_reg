Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.16 - Exhibit 15: Agricultural Resources\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 15 shall contain: (a) An assessment within the study area, which shall include the following data sets and illustrations: (1)\n\nLand in NYS Certified Agricultural\n\nDistricts by tax parcel; (2)\n\nLand\nreceiving Real Property Agricultural Value Assessment by tax parcel; (3)\n\nMunicipal zoning districts or overlay\nzones including those designated for renewable energy; (4)\n\nMost recent United States Department of\n\nAgriculture (USDA) National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) Cropland\n\nData Layer (CDL), National Landcover Data Base (NLCD) data and/or the results\nof on-site surveys and mapping identifying plant communities and calculating\npercentages of agricultural land use compared to non-agricultural land uses\n(e.g., disturbed, developed, woodland/forested areas, successional\nnon-agricultural areas, wetlands, etc.); (5)\n\nExisting energy infrastructure and\ncompleted renewable energy facilities; (6)\n\nActive agricultural businesses and/or\nfacilities and all related infrastructure; (7)\n\nPotential construction impacts and the\nmethods available to facilitate farming activity during construction; and\n(8)\n\nTemporary and/or permanent\nimpacts to agricultural production areas within the proposed facility footprint\n(including all planned structures, fenced facility areas, etc.), and areas not\nfeasible to continue farming. (b) Maps showing the following within the\nstudy area: (1)\n\nField-verified active\nagriculture land use (including all lands involved in the production of crops, livestock and livestock products for three (3) of the last five (5)\nyears); (2)\n\nAll agricultural\nproduction acreage proposed to remain in agricultural use; (3)\n\nAny agreed upon landowner-imposed\ndevelopment restrictions (e.g., locations within the facility site on which the\nlandowner will not allow facility development); (4)\n\nLocations of known or suspected\nsub-surface drainage systems (including outlets), surface drainages, irrigation\nlines, or other unique agricultural facilities; (5)\nUSDA soil mapping for the facility site; and\n(6)\nNYS Agricultural Land\n\nClassification Mineral Soil Groups 1 through 10 for impacted agricultural areas\nwithin the facility site. (c) An Agricultural Plan, consistent with the\n\nNew York State Department of Agriculture and Markets Guidelines (see sections\n1100-15.1(l)(1)(i) and (ii) of this Part) to the maximum extent practicable, to\navoid, minimize, and mitigate agricultural impacts to active agricultural lands\n(i.e., land in active agriculture production defined as active three (3) of the\nlast five (5) years) within NYS Agricultural Land Classified Mineral Soil\n\nGroups 1 through 4. (d) A\nremediation plan to address inadvertent damages to surface or sub-surface\ndrainage, including: (1)\nA demonstration of\nthe likelihood of impacts to surface of subsurface drainage and how the\ninterruption of drainage may impact farmland within and outside of the facility\nsite; and\n(2)\n\nAn identification of\nmethods of repair for damaged drainage features. (e) Any agricultural co-utilization plan for\nthe lifespan of the facility shall demonstrate that the proposed agricultural\nco-utilization will be feasible. The plan shall be assembled by a qualified or\naccredited third party agricultural professional. The plan should include an\nitemization of the investments made by the applicant to facilitate the\nagricultural co-utilization (e.g., grazing plan, planting pasture species, development of watering facilities, modified access for livestock trailers, panel spacing, additional fencing, access roads, gates, housing, etc.).
