  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 §§ 28-1.3 - Increase Sick Leave Accruals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nEffective January 1, 1986, this section\nshall apply only to persons who were in State service on December 31, 1985, including persons on an authorized leave of absence on such date and to persons\nwho were in State service prior to December 31, 1985, who prior to such date\nresigned, retired or who were otherwise separated from their positions who are\nreemployed or reinstated to State service on or after January 1, 1986, who have\ncreditable State service prior to January 1, 1986, who are eligible for but\ndecline to participate in the Income Protection Plan established pursuant to\nthe provisions of Part 78 of this Title (President's Regulations) and any such\npersons who are not otherwise eligible to participate in said plan. For the\npurpose of this section, an employee has prior creditable service if such\nperson is reemployed within one year of resignation, retirement or termination\nor is reinstated by the Civil Service Department or Commission or by court\norder or is reemployed from or while eligible to be reemployed from a preferred\nlist. (2)\n\nSick leave is absence\nwith pay necessitated by the illness or disability of an employee, including\nillness or disability caused by pregnancy or childbirth. (b) Employees shall earn sick leave credits\nat the rate of one-half day per biweekly pay period and may accumulate such\ncredits up to a total of 225 days. Effective January 1, 2000, up to 225 days of\nsuch credits may be used to pay for health insurance in retirement in\naccordance with section\n167\n(4)\nof the Civil Service Law and provided, however, that an employee shall not earn sick leave credit for any biweekly pay\nperiod unless such employee is in full pay status for at least seven workdays\nduring such biweekly pay period. A part-time employee who is required to work a\nfixed number of hours on a fixed schedule five days per week, or who is\nrequired to work at least half-time each biweekly pay period for a fixed number\nof hours on a fixed schedule, shall also earn sick leave credit as provided\nherein, but total pay when absent on such leave shall be the amount which would\nhave been due had such employee worked regularly at his/her usual hours for\nsuch period. (c) An employee absent\non sick leave shall notify his/her supervisor of such absence and the reason\ntherefor on the first day of such absence and within two hours after the\nbeginning of the employee's workday; provided, however, that where the work is\nsuch that a substitute may be required, the appointing authority may require\nearlier notification, but not more than two hours prior to the beginning of the\nemployee's workday. Sick leave credits may be used in such units as the\nappointing authority may approve, but the appointing authority shall not\nrequire that sick leave credits be used in units greater than one-quarter\nhour. (d) Before absence for\npersonal illness may be charged against accumulated sick leave credits, the\nappointing authority may require such proof of illness as may be satisfactory\nto it, or may require the employee to be examined, at the expense of the\ndepartment or agency, by a physician designated by the appointing authority. In\nthe event of failure to submit proof of illness upon request, or in the event\nthat, upon such proof as is submitted or upon the report of medical\nexamination, the appointing authority finds that there is not satisfactory\nevidence of illness sufficient to justify the employee's absence from the\nperformance of his/her duties, such absence may be considered as unauthorized\nleave and shall not be charged against accumulated sick leave credits. Abuse of\nsick leave privileges shall be cause for disciplinary action. (e) The appointing authority may require an\nemployee who has been absent because of personal illness, prior to and as a\ncondition of return to duty, to be examined, at the expense of the department\nor agency, by a physician designated by the appointing authority, to establish\nthat such employee is not disabled from the performance of his/her normal\nduties and that the return to duty will not jeopardize the health of other\nemployees. (f) In addition to\npersonal illness of the employee, the following types of absence, when approved\nby the appointing authority, may be charged against accumulated sick leave\ncredits: (1)\nillness or death in the\nemployee's family; provided however the charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 25 days in any one year; (2)\nabsence of an employee, certified by an\nexamining physician as benefiting from the use of a service animal in\nperforming major life activities, or who is registered with the New York State\n\nCommission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped as legally blind, or\ncertified by an examining physician or licensed optometrist as legally blind, as manifested by visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with best\ncorrection or a visual field of 20 degrees or less, or who has a hearing\nimpairment manifested by a speech discrimination score of 40 percent or less in\nthe better ear with appropriate correction as certified by an examining\nphysician or by a licensed audiologist or otorhinolaryngologist, for the\npurpose of obtaining a guide dog or service animal and required training\nrelated thereto; provided, however, that charge for such absence shall not\nexceed a maximum of 26 days in any one calendar year; and\n(3)\npersonal visits to doctor or dentist. Proof of the need for such absences, satisfactory to the\nappointing authority, may be required. (g) When an employee is transferred, such\nemployee's accumulated sick leave credits shall also be transferred. When an\nemployee is separated from service for other than disciplinary reasons and is\nsubsequently reinstated or reemployed within one year after such separation, or\nis reinstated by action of the State Civil Service Commission, or is reinstated\nor reemployed while eligible for reinstatement from a preferred list, sick\nleave credits accumulated and unused at the time of separation shall be\nrestored; provided, however, that such sick leave credits shall not be restored\nexcept where leave records satisfactory to the appointing authority and the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service are available. (h) Every per diem and hourly paid employee\nnot otherwise allowed sick leave under this Chapter because of anticipated\neligibility shall, on the date on which such employee becomes subject to this\n\nChapter, be credited with the number of days of sick leave which would have\nbeen earned during the preceding nine months if such employee had been subject\nto this Chapter during such period, less the number of days of sick leave with\npay which were granted during such nine- month period, except that no deduction\nshall be made for sick leave drawn during such nine- month period which was\nearned prior thereto in accordance with an established departmental\npolicy. (i) This section shall not\nbe construed to require extension of any employment beyond the time at which it\nwould otherwise terminate by operation of law, rule or regulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
