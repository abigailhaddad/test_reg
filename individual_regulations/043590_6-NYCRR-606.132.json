  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 606.132 - Conduct of apportionment grievance hearing\n\nState Regulations\n\nThere is a presumption that the apportionment determined\nby the regulating district and approved by the department is correct. The\nburden to prove otherwise, by substantial evidence, lies with the public\ncorporation or owner of a parcel of real property interested in or aggrieved by\nthe apportionment. Only the current apportionment may be aggrieved. A separate\ncomplaint must be filed for each parcel or public\ncorporation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n606.132\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
