  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 167.3 - Work order and property record system required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The work order system shall include a\nwork order estimate and work in progress record, which shall be supported as\nindicated in subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section. Standing work orders may\nbe used by class A and B utilities for projects of relatively small value\n(\ne.g., $100,000); except that project upon which interest\nduring construction is charged shall not be recorded through standing work\norders. These limits may be modified by order of the commission when warranted\nby particular circumstances. (b) The work order estimate shall include the following particulars: (1)\n\nThe designation number or letter and the\nsignature of the officer or employee who authorized the work or purchase. If\nthe authorization is by the board of directors or other body, an appropriate\nofficer shall so state above his signature. (2)\nA description and location of the work to\nbe done (or the purchase to be made), stating the reasons the work is\nnecessary, and the dates between which such work (or purchase) is to be\naccomplished. For each project for which interest during construction is\ncharged, the date completed and the date placed in operation shall be shown\neither in the work order estimate or the work in progress record. (3)\n\nDetailed estimates of the cost of the\nproject to be supported by maps, plans, diagrams, specifications, etc., as\napplicable. (4)\n\nThe account or\naccounts to which the cost of the project is chargeable and the amount\nchargeable to each account. (5)\n\nAny\nvariations between estimates and actual costs of the project. (6)\n\nWhen a project involves changes to\nexisting property, either the work order estimate or the work in progress\nrecord shall show the year of installation of any property retired or otherwise\naffected and shall show or refer to other records that cover the book costs (or\nan estimate if not known, and a statement explaining the basis for that\nestimate) and the name and page of the accounting and engineering books and\nrecords covering such installation and the cost thereof. (c) The work in progress record shall contain\nthe following particulars: (1)\nA designation\nnumber or letter that shall correspond to the number or letter on the work\norder estimate covering the same project. When more than one such work in\nprogress record covers the work on a work order estimate, each record shall be\nnumbered or lettered in such a manner as to readily identifiable with the work\norder estimate for the same project. (2)\n\nThe accumulated charges applicable to\neach job or project, the total cost of the completed project, and the cost of\nremoval shall be shown. When any project involves charges to more than one\nelectric plant account, the work in progress record shall be kept so as to show\nthe amount chargeable to each account. Every charge or credit to work in\nprogress records shall refer to the voucher, journal, or other source from\nwhich the entry therein was made. (3)\n\nFull details at any time of the amount\ncarried in account 107, construction work in progress-electric, or account\n108.1, retirement work in progress, as applicable. The cost of completed\nprojects shall be promptly transferred from those accounts to the accounts to\nwhich it is chargeable. Upon coming into service, completed portions involving\nadditions to accounts shall be transferred to the appropriate account even\nthough other portions of the work covered by the same work order are not yet\ncompleted and the work order has not been closed. Credits of such transfers\nshall be made in separate columns. (d) Requirement of the use of the work order\nsystem here outlined may be suspended by order of the commission in the case of\na utility that satisfies the commission that the system it has in use for\nrecording changes in electric plant accounts gives the equivalent detail by\naccounts in substantially the same form. The identification of expenditures\nwith property must be complete and clear, and the detail of the cost of each\nproject or job must be readily available. The total of the uncompleted projects\nmust also be in agreement with account 107, construction work in\nprogress-electric, or account 108.1, retirement work in progress, as\napplicable. (e) The work order\nsystem is required to record changes in electric plant used either wholly or in\npart in electric operations. Its use is recommended, however, in recording\nother expenditures, such as for plant in other departments, repairs, etc. When\nused for repairs, balances applicable thereto shall be cleared monthly to the\nappropriate accounts.
