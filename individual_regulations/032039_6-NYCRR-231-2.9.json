  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-2.9 - Emission offsets\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Emission offset\napplicability. For a proposed source project or proposed major facility which\nis subject to this Subpart for any nonattainment contaminant, the project\nemission potential or facility emission potential respectively shall be\noffset. (b) Offset ratio. (1)\n\nAn emission offset of VOC or NO\nx\nshall exceed the corresponding project emission\npotential or facility emission potential (subsequent to application of LAER or\nBACT), as appropriate, by the ratio amounts indicated in section 231- 2.12 of\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nAn emission\noffset of PM-10 or CO shall at least equal the corresponding project emission\npotential or facility emission potential (subsequent to application of LAER or\nBACT), as appropriate. A greater amount of offset may be required to provide a\nnet air quality benefit as set forth in subdivision (d) of this\nsection. (c) Use of an\nERC as part of an emission offset. An ERC shall meet the following conditions\nto be used as part of an emission offset: (1)\nsuch an ERC shall have physically occurred on or after November 15, 1990 but\nneed not be contemporaneous; and\n(2)\nsuch an ERC, or portion thereof, shall be\ndescribed as a special condition in the permit for the proposed source project\nor proposed major facility for which the reduction is used. (d) Net air quality benefit and\nemission offset location for PM-10 or CO. An emission offset of PM-10 or CO\nshall meet the following: (1)\n\nContribution\ndemonstration. The emission offset may be obtained from the same nonattainment\narea in which a proposed source project or proposed major facility is to be\nlocated. An emission offset may also be obtained from other nonattainment areas\nof equal or higher classification if emissions from such other areas contribute\nto a violation of the NAAQS for PM-10 or CO in the nonattainment area where the\nproposed source project or proposed major facility is to be located. (2)\n\nNet air quality benefit demonstration. As\npart of a permit application, the applicant must submit an air quality impact\nevaluation which is acceptable to the department and demonstrates that: (i) the net impact of the proposed emissions\nincrease and the emission offset provides for a net benefit, on balance, in the\narea affected by the proposed source project or proposed major facility; and\n(ii)\nthe net impact in no case\nexceeds an applicable significant impact level of section\n231-2.11\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nInterstate offsets. An\nemission offset of PM-10 or CO from areas of equal or higher classification may\nbe obtained from another state, provided that an interstate reciprocal trading\nagreement is in place and the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of this\nsubdivision are met. (e) Ozone nonattainment and emission offset location. An emission offset of VOC or\nNO\nx\nis subject to the following: (1)\n\nProposed source project or proposed major\nfacility is located in an ozone nonattainment area. (i) Intrastate offset sources. An emission\noffset of VOC or NO\nx\nmust be obtained from: (a) the same ozone nonattainment area; or\n(b) other ozone nonattainment\nareas of equal or higher classification, if emissions from such other areas\ncontribute to a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the nonattainment area\nwhere the proposed source project or proposed major facility is to be located. Appendix D or Air Guide 26 (or equivalent department\npolicy) may be used by an applicant to find default acceptable VOC or NO\nx\noffset source locations within New York State or to do\na case specific contribution demonstration. (ii)\n\nInterstate offset sources. An emission\noffset may be obtained from other ozone nonattainment areas of equal or higher\nclassification in another state, if emissions from such other areas contribute\nto a violation of the NAAQS for ozone in the nonattainment area where the\nproposed source project or proposed major facility is to be located and an\ninterstate reciprocal trading agreement is in place. Appendix D of Air Guide 26\n(or equivalent department policy) may be used by an applicant to do a case\nspecific contribution demonstration. (2)\n\nProposed source project or proposed major\nfacility located in an attainment area. An emission offset of VOC or NO\nx\nmay be obtained from any location within the ozone\ntransport region. Such an offset may also be obtained from another state in the\nozone transport region, provided that an interstate reciprocal trading\nagreement is in place. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-2.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
