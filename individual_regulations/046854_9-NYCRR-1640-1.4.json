  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-1.4 - Mandatory procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nMandatory procedures are indicated by the word shall. Efforts have been made to limit mandatory procedures to those necessary to\ninsure adequate control, or for the proper and uniform maintenance of accounts, or for the preparation of reports and financial data on a uniformly consistent\nand comparable basis, or to assure evidence of compliance with statutory\nrequirements and the regulations of the Division of Housing. With respect to\nnon-mandatory procedures, local agencies may adopt alternate methods to those\nrecommended or described in this Subchapter provided the information requested\nor required is furnished in essentially the same form. However, the cost of\nperforming any specific operation under a method other than that proposed in\nthis Subchapter shall not exceed the cost of operation under the recommended\nplan. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-1.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
