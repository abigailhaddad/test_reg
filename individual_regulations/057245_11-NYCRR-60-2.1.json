(b) An insurer shall not offer SUM coverage in an amount exceeding the third-party liability coverage limits purchased by the policyholder. The policy shall provide coverage for any insured under the policy for: (1)\nbodily injury to such person, up to the limit of the SUM coverage purchased; and\n(2)\nreceive from the policyholder's own insurer payment for bodily injury sustained due to the negligence of the other motor vehicle's owner or operator.

(d) The rate and premium for SUM coverage shall, in accordance with Insurance Law article 23, take into appropriate account the offsetting characteristic of SUM coverage stated in subdivision (c) of this section. (e) Except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section: (1)\n\nAn insurer shall offer: (i) SUM limits, in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy with split limits, up to $250,000 per person per accident and, subject to such limit for one person, $500,000 per accident; or\n(ii)\na SUM limit, in a motor vehicle liability insurance policy with a combined single limit, up to $500,000 per accident. (2)\n\nAn insurer is not required to offer SUM limits in the motor vehicle liability insurance policy in the amounts specified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, if, in lieu thereof: (i) the insurer offers motor vehicle liability limits in amounts: (a) greater than $100,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one person in any one accident, and, subject to such limit for one person, $300,000 because of bodily injury to or death of two or more persons in any one accident; or\n(b) greater than a combined single limit of $300,000 because of bodily injury to or death of one or more persons in any one accident; and\n(ii)\nthe insurer offers, in the motor vehicle liability policy: (a) SUM coverage with split limits of $100,000 per person per accident and, subject to such limit for one person, $300,000 per accident; or\n(b) SUM coverage with a combined single limit of $300,000 per accident; and\n(iii)\nthe insurer also makes available a personal umbrella liability policy with limits up to at least $500,000, and the insurer provides SUM coverage in the umbrella policy so that the total SUM coverage in the motor vehicle liability insurance policy and the personal umbrella liability policy shall be up to at least $500,000. (3)\n\nAn insurer may offer SUM limits that exceed the amounts specified in paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provision of this subdivision, an insurer shall not provide SUM limits in an amount that exceeds the third-party bodily injury liability limits offered by the insurer and purchased by the policyholder. (f) (1)\n\nWith regard to a motor vehicle liability insurance policy originally entered into on or after June 16, 2018 other than a commercial risk insurance policy, an insurer shall provide SUM limits in an amount equal to the bodily injury liability insurance limits of coverage provided under the motor vehicle liability insurance policy unless a first named insured declines the SUM coverage or selects a lower amount of coverage through a written waiver signed by the first named insured, subject to the requirements of Insurance Law section 3420(f)(2-a)(B); provided however, the insurer may require that the insured's SUM coverage limit be equal to the insured's bodily injury liability insurance limit under the policy. (2)\nA first named insured's signed written waiver declining SUM coverage or selecting a lower amount of SUM coverage shall apply to all subsequent renewals of coverage and to all policies or endorsements that extend, change, supersede, or replace an existing policy issued to the first named insured, unless changed in writing by a first named insured. (3)\n\nWhenever SUM coverage is declined, the policy shall provide the mandatory uninsured motorists (UM) coverage required by Insurance Law section 3420(f)(1). (4)\n\nThe insurer, on subsequent renewals, shall provide to the insured the applicable notice required by section\n60-2.2\n(a) of this Subpart.
