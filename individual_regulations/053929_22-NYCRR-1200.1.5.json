Tit. 22 § 1200.1.5 - Fees and division of fees\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A lawyer shall not make an\nagreement for, charge, or collect an excessive or illegal fee or expense. A fee\nis excessive when, after a review of the facts, a reasonable lawyer would be\nleft with a definite and firm conviction that the fee is excessive. The factors\nto be considered in determining whether a fee is excessive may include the\nfollowing: (1)\nthe time and\nlabor required, the novelty and difficulty of the questions involved, and the\nskill requisite to perform the legal service properly; (2)\nthe likelihood, if\napparent or made known to the client, that the acceptance of the particular\nemployment will preclude other employment by the lawyer; (3)\nthe fee customarily\ncharged in the locality for similar legal services; (4)\nthe amount involved and\nthe results obtained; (5)\nthe time limitations imposed by the\nclient or by circumstances; (6)\nthe nature and length of the\nprofessional relationship with the client; (7)\nthe experience, reputation and\nability of the lawyer or lawyers performing the services; and\n(8)\nwhether the fee is fixed\nor contingent. (b) A lawyer shall communicate to a\nclient the scope of the representation and the basis or rate of the fee and\nexpenses for which the client will be responsible. This information shall be\ncommunicated to the client before or within a reasonable time after\ncommencement of the representation and shall be in writing where required by\nstatute or court rule. This provision shall not apply when the lawyer will\ncharge a regularly represented client on the same basis or rate and perform\nservices that are of the same general kind as previously rendered to and paid\nfor by the client. Any changes in the scope of the representation or the basis\nor rate of the fee or expenses shall also be communicated to the\nclient. (c) A fee\nmay be contingent on the outcome of the matter for which the service is\nrendered, except in a matter in which a contingent fee is prohibited by\nparagraph (d) or other law. Promptly after a lawyer has been employed in a\ncontingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with a writing\nstating the method by which the fee is to be determined, including the\npercentage or percentages that shall accrue to the lawyer in the event of\nsettlement, trial or appeal; litigation and other expenses to be deducted from\nthe recovery; and whether such expenses are to be deducted before or, if not\nprohibited by statute or court rule, after the contingent fee is calculated. The writing must clearly notify the client of any expenses for which the client\nwill be liable regardless of whether the client is the prevailing party. Upon\nconclusion of a contingent fee matter, the lawyer shall provide the client with\na writing stating the outcome of the matter and, if there is a recovery, showing the remittance to the client and the method of its\ndetermination. (d) A\nlawyer shall not enter into an arrangement for, charge or collect: (1)\na contingent fee for\nrepresenting a defendant in a criminal matter; (2)\na fee prohibited by law or\nrule of court; (3)\nfee based on fraudulent billing; (4)\na nonrefundable retainer fee; provided that a lawyer may enter into a retainer agreement with a client\ncontaining a reasonable minimum fee clause if it defines in plain language and\nsets forth the circumstances under which such fee may be incurred and how it\nwill be calculated; or\n(5)\nany fee in a domestic relations\nmatter if: (i) the payment or\namount of the fee is contingent upon the securing of a divorce or of obtaining\nchild custody or visitation or is in any way determined by reference to the\namount of maintenance, support, equitable distribution, or property\nsettlement; (ii)\na\nwritten retainer agreement has not been signed by the lawyer and client setting\nforth in plain language the nature of the relationship and the details of the\nfee arrangement; or\n(iii)\nthe written retainer agreement\nincludes a security interest, confession of judgment or other lien without\nprior notice being provided to the client in a signed retainer agreement and\napproval from a tribunal after notice to the adversary. A lawyer shall not\nforeclose on a mortgage placed on the marital residence while the spouse who\nconsents to the mortgage remains the titleholder and the residence remains the\nspouse's primary residence. (e) In domestic relations\nmatters, a lawyer shall provide a prospective client with a statement of\nclient's rights and responsibilities at the initial conference and prior to the\nsigning of a written retainer agreement. (f) Where applicable, a lawyer shall\nresolve fee disputes by arbitration at the election of the client pursuant to a\nfee arbitration program established by the Chief Administrator of the Courts\nand approved by the Administrative Board of the Courts. (g) A lawyer shall not divide\na fee for legal services with another lawyer who is not associated in the same\nlaw firm unless: (1)\nthe\ndivision is in proportion to the services performed by each lawyer or, by a\nwriting given to the client, each lawyer assumes joint responsibility for the\nrepresentation; (2)\nthe client agrees to employment of the other lawyer after a full disclosure\nthat a division of fees will be made, including the share each lawyer will\nreceive, and the client's agreement is confirmed in writing; and\n(3)\nthe total fee is not\nexcessive. (h) Rule 1.5(g) does not prohibit\npayment to a lawyer formerly associated in a law firm pursuant to a separation\nor retirement agreement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\n§\n1200.1.5.
