  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1643-1.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nAccounting entries and procedures pertaining to the\nfinancing of State-aided low rent public housing projects are described in this\n\nPart. Information with respect to making out the requisition papers--the\nhousing loan voucher and the certificate of purposes--which are a part of every\nfinancing transaction will be found in Part 1646, Development Period\n\nAccounting. State-aided projects are developed under the terms of a loan\ncontract wherein the State agrees to lend, and the local agency agrees to\nborrow, the project development cost. The State raises the funds it has agreed\nto lend to the local agency by issuing State housing bonds. The bond issue is\ntermed permanent financing. However, prior to issuing bonds, the State may\nraise the funds it has agreed to lend to the local agency by issuing short-term\nnotes or, in lieu thereof, it may authorize the local agency to issue its own\nshort-term notes. In the latter case, the local agency borrows directly from\nprivate investors in anticipation of the loan to be made by the State. The\nissue of short term notes, whether by the State or by the local agency, prior\nto the issue of bonds, is termed temporary financing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1643-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
