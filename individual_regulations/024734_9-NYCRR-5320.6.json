  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5320.6 - Environmental effects on progressive integrity\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Environmental effects. The independent\ntesting laboratory approved by the commission pursuant to Part 5318 of this\n\nSubchapter shall perform tests set forth in this section to determine whether\nor not outside influences affect game fairness to the player or create cheating\nopportunities. During the course of testing, such laboratory shall inspect for\nmarks or symbols indicating that a device has undergone product safety\ncompliance testing. Such laboratory also shall perform, where possible, a\ncursory review of submissions and information contained therein related to\nelectromagnetic interference, radio frequency interference, magnetic\ninterference, liquid spills, power fluctuations and environmental conditions. Electrostatic discharge testing is intended only to simulate techniques\nobserved in the field that are used to attempt to disrupt the integrity of\nprogressive gaming devices. A progressive system shall be able to withstand the\ntest described in subdivision (b) of this section, and resume function without\noperator intervention. (b) Electrostatic interference. Protection against static discharges requires that\nprogressive components be grounded in such a way that static discharge energy\nshall not damage permanently, or inhibit permanently the normal operation of\nthe electronics or other components within a progressive system. Progressive\nsystem components may exhibit temporary disruption when subjected to a\nsignificant electrostatic discharge greater than that produced by a human body, but such components shall exhibit a capacity to recover and complete any\ninterrupted function without loss or corruption of any control or critical data\ninformation associated with such progressive system. Such tests shall be\nconducted with a severity level of a maximum of 27 kilovolts air\ndischarge. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5320.6\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
