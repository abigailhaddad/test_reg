  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 621.13 - Permit modifications, suspensions, or revocations by the department\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Permits may be\nmodified, suspended, or revoked at any time by the department on the basis of\nany ground set forth in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subdivision: (1)\nmaterially false or inaccurate statements\nin the permit application or supporting papers; (2)\nfailure by the permittee to comply with\nany terms or conditions of the permit; (3)\nexceeding the scope of the project as\ndescribed in the permit application; (4)\nnewly discovered material information or\na material change in environmental conditions, relevant technology or\napplicable law or regulations since the issuance of the existing\npermit; (5)\nnoncompliance with\npreviously issued permit conditions, orders of the commissioner, any provisions\nof the Environmental Conservation Law or regulations of the department related\nto the permitted activity; or\n(6)\nfor SPDES permits, in addition to paragraphs (1) through (5) of this\nsubdivision, any of the reasons listed in section\n750-1.18\n(b)(1) through\n(7)\nof this Title. (b) The department may consider requests from\nany person other than the permittee for modification, suspension or revocation\nof permits based on reasons given in paragraphs (a)(1) through (6) of this\nsection. Requests must be in writing, contain facts or reasons supporting the\nrequest and be sent to the regional permit administrator as listed in section\n621.19\nof this Part. The department\nmust decide whether the request is justified and the action to be taken in\nresponse to the request. A brief response giving the reason(s) for the\ndepartment's decision must be sent to the party making the request. Rejection\nof requests, pursuant to this subdivision, for modification, suspension or\nrevocation of a permit are not subject to public notice, public comment, or\nadjudicatory proceeding. (c) The\ndepartment must send a notice of intent to modify, suspend or revoke a permit\nto the permittee by certified mail return receipt requested or personal\nservice. The notice must state the alleged facts or conduct which appear to\nwarrant the intended action and must state the effective date, contingent upon\nadministrative appeals, of the modification, suspension, or\nrevocation. (d) Within 15 days of\nmailing a notice of intent, the permittee may submit a written statement to the\nregional permit administrator or chief permit administrator, as directed in the\nnotice of intent, giving reasons why the permit should not be modified, suspended or revoked, or requesting an adjudicatory proceeding, or both. Failure by the permittee to timely submit a statement will result in the\ndepartment's action becoming effective on the date specified in the notice of\nintent. The permittee must also submit a copy of a written request for an\nadjudicatory proceeding to the chief administrative law judge. When a permit\ndecision or notice of intent has been issued for a delegated permit, the\nrequest for an adjudicatory proceeding must also comply with the requirements\nof section\n624.2\nof this Title and for SPDES\npermits, the request for an adjudicatory proceeding must also comply with the\nrequirements of section 750-1.26 of this Title. (e) Where the department proposes to modify, suspend or revoke a permit and the permittee requests a hearing on the proposed\nmodification or change in permit status, the original permit conditions or\npermit status will remain in effect until a decision is issued by the\ncommissioner pursuant to subdivision (h) of this section, except as provided in\nsubdivision 750-1.26(g) of this Title. At such time, the permit conditions or\npermit status supported by the commissioner's decision will take\neffect. (f) For delegated permits, a modification which would result in less stringent regulatory standards in the\npermit or is initiated following a SPDES Environmental Benefits Permit Strategy\nfull technical review will be treated as a new application for a permit\npursuant to this Part. For purposes of this subdivision the date of transmittal\nof the notice and modified draft permit will be considered the completeness\ndate. (g) Within 15 days of receipt\nof the permittee's request pursuant to subdivision (d) of this section, the\ndepartment will either: (1)\nrescind or\nconfirm the notice of intent based on a review of the information provided by\nthe permittee, if a statement without a request for an adjudicatory proceeding\nis submitted; or\n(2)\nnotify the\npermittee of a date and place for an adjudicatory proceeding, if a statement\nwith a request for an adjudicatory proceeding has been submitted, to be\ncommenced not later than 60 days from the Chief Administrative Law Judge's\nreceipt of the notification, except for a SPDES permit, the adjudicatory\nproceeding must not commence earlier than 30 days from notification. (h) In the event an adjudicatory\nproceeding is held the existing permit remains in effect until the adjudicatory\nproceeding concludes and the department issues a final decision, except as\nprovided in subdivision 750-1.26(g) of this Title. The commissioner must, within 30 days of receipt of the complete record, pursuant to paragraph\n624.8(a)(5) of this Title, issue a decision which: (1)\ncontinues the existing permit in effect\nas issued; (2)\nmodifies the permit, or suspends it for a stated period of time or upon stated conditions; or\n(3)\nrevokes the permit; including, where ordered by the commissioner, removal or modification of all or\nany portion of a project, whether completed or not. (i) Revocation or suspension of waste\ntransporter permits that were issued pursuant to Part 364 of this Title\nrequires the department to publish a public notice of the revocation or\nsuspension in the Environmental Notice Bulletin and a newspaper or newspapers\nhaving a general circulation in the area or areas served by the permittee. The\nnotice must include a statement that the permittee is no longer permitted to\nhandle such waste. The notice must be published once each week for two\nconsecutive weeks. The first notice must be published within 15 days following\nthe revocation or suspension. (j) Nothing in this Part shall preclude or affect the commissioner's authority to\nissue summary abatement orders under section\n71-0301\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, or to take emergency actions summarily suspending a permit\nunder section 401(3) of the State Administrative Procedure Act.
