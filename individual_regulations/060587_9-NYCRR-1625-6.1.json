  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1625-6.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Since files\nprovide the storehouse of information which an organization needs to operate\nsmoothly, it is essential that they be maintained in a neat, orderly manner so\nthat ready reference can be made to them. To prevent unnecessary disruption of\noffice activities, no files should be removed by any officer, agent, employee\nor other person to his office, residence or any other location. (b) Files of an operating project may be\nbroadly classified as follows: (1)\n\nTenant\nfiles (active and inactive)\n(2)\n\nApplications' pending files\n(3)\n\nSpecial purpose files\n(4)\n\nGeneral\ncorrespondence files. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1625-6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
