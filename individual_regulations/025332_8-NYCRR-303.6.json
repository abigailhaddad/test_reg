In the event that the trustees\ndetermine that there are no comparable decent, safe and sanitary homes on the\nmarket in the general area of the appropriated property, the trustees may make\nsupplemental relocation payments based upon the cost-to-cure (make decent, safe\nand sanitary) the acquired residential unit or upon whatever other basis they\ndeem appropriate under the particular circumstances involved. In the discretion\nof the trustees, an advance payment may also be made to an eligible residential\ntenant or owner where a hardship situation is deemed to exist pursuant to\nsection\n303.3\n(a)(8). The\namount and manner of such payment is to be determined by the trustees according\nto the particular circumstances of each situation. (b) A supplemental relocation payment of up\nto $5,000 as defined in this Part may be made to owners of residential property\nacquired by the trustees, subject to the following conditions: (1)\n\nThe residence contained no more than\nthree residential units. (2)\n\nThe\nresidence was owned and occupied at least one year as the owner's permanent\nhome or legal residence prior to the date of the first money offer made by the\ntrustees to the owner, or the service on the owner of a written request to\nvacate, whichever is earlier. (3)\n\nThe owner must supply proof of his purchase and of his occupation of a decent, safe, sanitary replacement dwelling as defined herein within one year from the\ndate he is formally requested to vacate by the trustees or 90 days after title\nhas vested in the State of New York, whichever occurs later. (4)\n\nIf the residential dwelling and homesite\nare a part of a substantially larger parcel of the same property, the appraised\nvalue of said dwelling and necessary homesite shall be separated from the\ncompensation for the total appropriated property in calculating the\nsupplemental relocation payment. (5)\n\nAn owner eligible for the $5,000\nsupplemental relocation payment who elects to rent rather than purchase a\nreplacement residence and receives a tenant-owner supplemental relocation\npayment of up to $1,500 and then elects to purchase a residence within the time\nlimit provided herein may receive the owner-supplemental-relocation payment up\nto $5,000 less any prior supplemental relocation payment based on rental\ndifferential. (c) A\nsupplemental relocation payment of up to $1,500 as defined in this Part shall\nbe made to displaced owners or tenants of residential property subject to the\nfollowing conditions: (1)\n\nThe tenant or owner\noccupied the residential unit acquired by the trustees for at least 90 days\nprior to the first money offer made by the trustees to the owner or tenant of a\nwritten request of notice to vacate is served upon him, whichever occurs\nlater. (2)\n\nIn those cases where an\nowner of a residence is eligible for and elects to receive the tenant-owner\nsupplemental relocation payment of up to $1,500, as set forth herein, such\npayment shall be based on 12 percent of the compensation paid for the owner's\nappropriated property and the amount necessary to enable said owner to rent or\nlease an adequate, decent, safe and sanitary residential unit for two\nyears. (3)\n\nPayment will be made\nupon proof acceptable to the trustees of the owner-occupant's or tenant's\nrelocation to a decent, safe and sanitary replacement dwelling as defined\nherein. Notes\nN.Y.
