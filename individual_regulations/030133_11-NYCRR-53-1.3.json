(i) Disciplined current scale means a scale of non-guaranteed elements constituting a limit on illustrations currently being illustrated by an insurer that is reasonably based on actual recent historical experience, as certified annually by an illustration actuary designated by the insurer. Further guidance in determining the disciplined current scale as contained in standards established by the Actuarial Standards Board may be relied upon if the standards: (1)\nare consistent with all provisions of this Part; (2)\nlimit a disciplined current scale to reflect only actions that have already been taken or events that have already occurred; (3)\ndo not permit a disciplined current scale to include any projected trends of improvements in experience or any assumed improvements in experience beyond the illustration date; and\n(4)\ndo not permit assumed expenses to be less than minimum assumed expenses. (j) Equivalent level death benefit of a policy or term life insurance rider means the amount calculated as follows: (1)\n\nAccumulate the guaranteed amount payable upon death, regardless of the cause of death, at the beginning of each policy year for 10 and 20 years at five percent interest compounded annually to the end of the 10th and 20th policy years respectively. (2)\n\nDivide each accumulation of paragraph (1) of this subdivision by an interest factor that converts it into one equivalent level annual amount that, if paid at the beginning of each year, would accrue to the value in paragraph (1) of this subdivision over the respective periods stipulated in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If the period is 10 years, the factor is 13.207 and if the period is 20 years, the factor is 34.719.

(t) Minimum assumed expenses means the minimum expenses that may be used in the calculation of the disciplined current scale for a policy form. The insurer may choose to designate each year the method of determining assumed expenses for all policy forms from fully allocated expenses, marginal expenses and a generally recognized expense table approved by the superintendent based on fully allocated expenses representing a significant portion of insurance companies. Marginal expenses may be used only if greater than a generally recognized expense table. If no generally recognized expense table is approved, fully allocated expenses must be used.

For this purpose, policyowner value will include cash surrender values and any other illustrated benefit amounts available at the policyowner's election. (ab)\n\nTotal death benefit, as it applies to participating life insurance, means the sum of the death benefit provided by the policy, riders attached thereto, and the death benefits purchased by dividends.
