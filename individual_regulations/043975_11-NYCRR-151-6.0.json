  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 §§ 151-6.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Workers' Compensation Law, sections 15(8)(h)(4), 25-A(3), and 151(2)(b) require the Workers' Compensation Board to assess insurers, and the State Insurance Fund for the special disability fund, the fund for reopened cases, and the operations of the board, respectively. First the assessments are allocated to insurers, self-insurers, group self-insurers, and SIF based upon the total compensation payments made by all such entities. In the case of an insurer, once the assessment amount is determined, each pays the percentage of the allocation based on the total premiums it wrote during the preceding calendar year. (b) Prior to January 1, 2010, each insurer paid a percentage of the allocation based on the total direct written premiums it wrote in the preceding calendar year. However, part QQ of chapter 56 of the Laws of 2009 (part QQ) amended Workers' Compensation Law, sections 15(8)(h)(4), and 151(2)(b) to change the basis upon which the board collects the portion of the allocation from each insurer. Thus, effective January 1, 2010, each insurer pays a percentage of the allocation based on the total standard premium it wrote during the preceding calendar year. Part QQ requires the Superintendent of Insurance (the superintendent) to define \"standard premium,\" for the purposes of the assessments, and to set rules, in consultation with the board, and NYCIRB for collecting the assessment from insureds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§§\n151-6.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
