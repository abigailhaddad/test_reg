Tit. 6 § 328.1 - Permit required\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person, individual, public or private corporation, political subdivision, government\nagency, municipality, industry, copartnership, association, firm, trust or\nestate, or any other legal entity whatsoever, shall use chemicals for the\ncontrol or extermination of undesirable fish in any waters of the State without\nhaving applied for and obtained a written permit to do so from a designated\npermit-issuing official, except as specified in subdivision (c) of this\nsection. (b) Such permit may be\nissued for the use of chemicals in the control or extermination of undesirable\nfish, subject to such limitations as may be considered necessary to safeguard\nwater quality. For the protection of riparian uses, no such permit shall be\nissued except where the applicant has certified that the affected riparian\nusers have agreed to temporary curtailment of their uses incidental to\ntreatment or unless the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner that any non-consenting riparian users will not be significantly\nadversely affected by the use of the chemicals subject to such limitations as\nare set forth in the permit. Such limitations shall prescribe what chemical or\nchemicals may be applied to the waters under stipulated conditions to protect\nthe public health, safety or welfare, and terrestrial and aquatic life or the\ngrowth and propagation thereof, other than fish contained in the water for\nwhich chemical treatment is proposed. (c) Such permit, however, shall not be\nrequired: for removing undesirable fish by netting, trapping, drawing down of\nwater or any other method not involving the use of chemicals when it is legally\nauthorized by the Department of Environmental Conservation; or for chemical\ncontrol of fish by the Department of Environmental Conservation on waters\ncompletely enclosed by or bordered by lands owned or leased by the department\nor the State.
