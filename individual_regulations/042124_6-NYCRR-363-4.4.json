Tit. 6 §§ 363-4.4 - Hydrogeologic investigation report\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A hydrogeologic investigation report is required and must contain the\nfollowing: (1)\nA description of the geology\nand hydrology of the existing or the facility in sufficient detail to determine\nthe suitability of the site for the disposal of waste. The report must be\nsubmitted under the stamp and signature of a professional geologist or\nprofessional engineer licensed and currently registered to practice in the\n\nState of New York. The scope and extent of the hydrogeologic investigation must\nbe based on the hydrogeologic complexity of the site and the ability of the\nsite to restrict contaminant migration, and include: (i) an understanding of groundwater and\nsurface water flow and how it relates to local and regional patterns, including\na groundwater table elevation map with groundwater flow direction calculated\nfrom hydraulic head measurements; (ii)\na definition of the critical\nstratigraphic section; (iii)\nthe\nestablishment of an environmental monitoring system capable of readily\ndetecting a contaminant release from the facility; and\n(iv)\na description of the engineering\nproperties of the site, which provide the basis for the design and construction\nof the facility including the; and contingency plans relating to groundwater or\nsurface water contamination or gas migration. (2)\n\nRaw field data, analytical calculations, maps, flow nets, cross-sections, interpretations (with alternative\ninterpretations where applicable), and conclusions. All maps, drawings and\ndiagrams must have a minimum scale of 1:24,000, unless otherwise approved by\nthe department. The description must include: (i) Regional geology. A discussion of the\nregional geology demonstrating how the regional geology relates to the\nfacility's geology and the location of nearby sensitive environments must\ninclude: (a) bedrock stratigraphy and\nstructural geology, including formation and member names, geologic ages, rock\ntypes, thicknesses, the units' mineralogical and geochemical compositions and\nvariabilities, rock fabrics, porosities, bulk permeabilities, and other\ndistinctive features; (b) glacial\ngeology, including a discussion of the formation, timing, stages, and\ndistribution of glacial deposits, advances and retreats, and hydrologic\ncharacteristics of the surficial deposits, such as kames, eskers, outwash\nmoraines, etc.; (c) major\ntopographic features, their origin and their influence upon drainage basin\ncharacteristics; and\n(d) surface\nwater and groundwater hydrologic features, including surface drainage patterns, recharge and discharge areas, wetlands and other sensitive environments, inferred regional groundwater flow directions, aquifers, aquitards and\naquicludes, primary water supply and principal aquifers, public water supply\nwells, and private water supply wells identified in the water supply well\nsurvey; any known peculiarities in surface water and groundwater geochemistry; and any other relevant features. (ii)\n\nFacility geology. Hydrogeologic\nconditions at the facility in three dimensions and their relationship to the\nproposed facility. The report must: (a) define site geology, surface water and groundwater flow, and must relate\nsite-specific conditions to the regional geology; (b) describe the potential impact the\nfacility may have on surface and groundwater resources and other receptors, including changes in hydrogeologic conditions that may occur with site\ndevelopment, and the potential for and effects of off-site contaminant\nmigration; (c) describe\nhydrogeologic conditions in sufficient detail to establish a comprehensive\nunderstanding of groundwater flow that can be quantified and verified through\nhydrologic, geochemical, and geophysical measurements; (d) provide sufficient data to specify the\nlocation and sampling frequency for environmental monitoring points, form the\nbasis for contingency plans regarding groundwater and surface water\ncontamination and explosive gas migration, and support the design of the\nfacility; (e) specifically discuss\nall units in the critical stratigraphic section. This evaluation must include\nmaps, cross-sections, other graphical representations, and a detailed written\nanalysis of the following: (1)\nall\nhydrogeologic units (e.g., aquifers, aquitards and aquicludes), and how they\nrelate to surface water and groundwater flow. This must include all\nhydrogeologic data collected during the site investigation and explain and\nevaluate the hydrologic and engineering properties of the site and each\nspecific unit; and\n(2)\nlocal\ngroundwater recharge and discharge areas, high and low groundwater tables and\npotentiometric surfaces for each hydrogeologic unit, vertical and horizontal\nhydraulic gradients, groundwater flow directions and velocities, groundwater\nboundary conditions, surface water and groundwater interactions, and an\nevaluation of existing water quality. (b) Any aspect of the\nsite investigation that deviates from these requirements of this section must\nbe identified and justified in the site investigation report and must be\napproved by the department. (c) The\napplicant must employ current, standard, and generally accepted methods and\nprocedures in obtaining the required hydrogeologic information. (1)\n\nThe department may approve of alternative\nor innovative methods; however, the department may initially require redundant\ntechnologies to prove the reliability of a new method. (2)\nA professional geologist licensed and\ncurrently registered to practice in the State of New York State, having\nexperience in similar hydrogeologic investigations, must supervise all\nprocedures in a manner that ensures the accuracy of the data and precludes\nenvironmental degradation. (3)\n\nThe\nlocation of all installations, geophysical and geochemical surveys, and seismic\nlines for the proposed investigation must be shown on a map with the same scale\nand coordinate grid system used in the application. (d) Literature search. A comprehensive search\nfor pertinent and reliable information concerning regional and site-specific\nhydrogeologic conditions is required. The literature search must include, as\navailable, records and reports of the Department of Health, the Department of\n\nTransportation, the U.S. Soil Conservation Service, and the New York State\n\nGeological Survey; basin planning reports, groundwater bulletins, water supply\npapers, professional papers and other open file reports of the U.S. Geological\n\nSurvey; bulletins, circulars, map and chart series, memoirs and other\npublications of the New York State Geologic Survey; publications and bulletins\nof the Geological Society of America and other professional organizations; publications of the EPA and the department; college and university reports; and\naerial photography and remotely sensed imagery. (e) Surficial geologic mapping. The facility\nmust be mapped to determine the distribution of surficial deposits on and\nsurrounding the site based on information from the hydrogeologic investigation, field evaluations, and field confirmation of all interpretations made on the\nsite itself. The surficial geological map must be submitted under the stamp and\nsignature of a professional geologist or professional engineer licensed and\ncurrently registered to practice in the State of New York. (f) Test pits. Test pits may be used to\ndetermine shallow stratigraphy. The test pits must be logged by a professional\ngeologist or engineer licensed to practice in the State of New York, and with\nexperience in similar hydrogeologic investigations. Logs must be kept and\ninclude: elevations; surface features before excavation; depth of the test pit\nand of all relevant horizons or features; moisture content of units; standard\nsoil classifications, stratigraphy, soil structure, bedrock lithology, and\nbrittle or secondary structures in soil and bedrock; active seepage; and a\nsketch showing these features for each test pit. Test pits must be promptly\nbackfilled and compacted with the excavated materials. The department may\nrequire that undisturbed soil samples be taken and tested in accordance with\nparagraph 363-4.4(l)(2) of this section. (g) Water well surveys. A survey of public\nand private water wells within one mile downgradient and one-quarter mile\nupgradient of the facility must be conducted. Surveys must obtain, where\navailable, the location of wells, which must be shown on a map with their\napproximate elevation and depth, name of owner, age and usage of the well; stratigraphic unit screened; well construction; static water levels; well\nyield; perceived water quality; and any other relevant data that can be\nobtained. (h) Geophysical and\ngeochemical surveys. The department may require the use of geophysical and\ngeochemical methods, such as electromagnetic, resistivity, seismic surveys, remote sensing surveys, downhole geophysics, isotope geochemistry, and soil gas\nanalysis to justify the interpretations and conclusions of the site\ninvestigation report, to provide information between boreholes, and to aid in\nthe siting of wells. The geophysical and geochemical surveys must be submitted\nunder the stamp and signature of a professional geologist or professional\nengineer licensed and currently registered to practice in the State of New\n\nYork. (i) Tracer studies. The\ndepartment may require the use of tracer studies to aid in understanding\ngroundwater flow, including: (1)\n\nWhere a site\noverlies limestone or dolostone bedrock or karst environments. Tracer studies\nmust identify areas of groundwater flow from the facility attributed to\nsecondary permeability, any recharge or discharge areas on and surrounding the\nsite, groundwater storage, and seasonal variations of water levels; and\n(2)\n\nTo monitor sites with\nexisting contamination, in accordance with subdivision\n363-5.1\n(g)(2)\nof\nthis Part. (j) Site\ninvestigation work plan. The site investigation work plan must clearly define\nthe scope of the intended investigation, all methods used in investigating the\nhydrogeologic conditions of the site and any specific hydrogeologic questions\nto be addressed. (k) Monitoring\nwells and piezometers. (1)\n\nGeneral\nrequirements. (i) Monitoring wells and\npiezometers must define the three-dimensional flow system within the critical\nstratigraphic section. (ii)\n\nConstruction techniques must ensure that groundwater samples and water level\nmeasurements characterize discrete stratigraphic intervals, and prevent leakage\nof groundwater or contaminants along the well annulus. If leakage is detected, it must be corrected or the well properly sealed. (iii)\n\nMonitoring wells and piezometers may be\nplaced individually or as well clusters. Well clusters consist of individual\nwells at varying depths in close proximity, each installed in its own boring. Multiple wells placed into one large borehole are prohibited unless prior\ndepartment approval in writing is obtained. (iv)\n\nSoil borings, soil samples, and rock\ncores must characterize each stratigraphic unit within the critical\nstratigraphic section. (v) Precautions must be taken during drilling and construction of monitoring wells\nto avoid introducing contaminants into a borehole. Only potable water of known\nchemistry may be used in drilling monitoring wells or piezometers unless\notherwise approved by the department in writing. (vi)\n\nAll equipment placed into the boring\nmust be properly decontaminated before use and between boreholes. The initial\ncleaning at the site must ensure that no contaminants from the last site\ndrilled will be introduced into the borings. All equipment must be properly\ndecontaminated between holes. (vii)\n\nWhere possible, upgradient wells should be drilled first. (viii)\n\nThe use of drilling mud must be\navoided unless prior department approval is granted in writing. If drilling mud\nis used, the material used must avoid the introduction of contaminants. Drilling mud must not be used within ten feet of the screened\ninterval. (ix)\n\nAir systems and\ndrilling lubricants must not introduce contaminants into the\nborehole. (x) Well borings must\nhave a minimum diameter that is two inches larger than the outside diameter of\nthe well screen and riser to ensure that a tremie pipe may be properly\nused. (xi)\n\nWells and well borings\nmust not be placed through or into waste unless prior department approval has\nbeen granted in writing and sufficient safety precautions are employed. If\nwaste is unexpectedly encountered during drilling, then drilling of that boring\nmust cease, the hole must be properly sealed, cuttings properly disposed of and\nthe department notified. (2)\n\nConstruction of monitoring wells and\npiezometers. (i) Well screens and risers must\nbe constructed of materials selected to last for the required monitoring period\nof the facility without contributing contaminants to, or removing contaminants\nfrom, the groundwater. All materials used are subject to department approval. Joints, caps, and end plugs are to be secured by either welds, threads with\nthread seal tape, or force fittings. Solvents and glues or other adhesives are\nprohibited. Caps must be vented to allow for proper pressure equalization. The\ninside diameter of each well screen or riser pipe must be nominally two inches\nin diameter and must allow for proper development and for surveying and\nsampling equipment to be used within the screen and casing. A permanent mark\nshould be made at the top of the riser pipe to provide a datum for subsequent\nwater level measurements. (ii)\n\nWell\nscreens are required for all wells and piezometers, unless otherwise approved\nby the department. All screens used must be factory-constructed, non-solvent\nwelded/bonded, continuous-slot, wire-wrap screens of a material appropriate for\nlong-term monitoring. The slot size of the screen must be compatible with the\nsand pack. Water table variations, site stratigraphy, expected contaminant\nbehavior, and groundwater flow must be considered in determining the screen\nlength, materials, and position. Where existing contamination is suspected or\nknown, downhole geophysical techniques may be required by the department to aid\nin selecting well screen elevations. (iii)\n\nThe sand pack surrounding the well\nscreen must consist of clean inert siliceous material. Grain size must be based\non a representative sieve analysis of the zone to be screened. The sand pack\nmust minimize the amount of fine materials entering the well and must not\ninhibit water inflow to the well. The sand pack must be placed in the annular\nspace around the well screen and extend above the top of the screen by two feet\nor 20 percent of the screen length (whichever is greater). In addition, the\nsand pack must extend six inches below the bottom of the screen. The sand pack\nmaterial must be placed using an appropriate method and must avoid bridging. Alternative methods of placing the sand pack must be approved by the department\nin writing. The sand pack must be checked for proper placement. A finer-grained\nsand pack material (100 percent passing the No. 30 sieve and less than two\npercent passing the No. 200 sieve) six inches thick must be placed at the top\nof the sand pack between the sand and the bentonite seal. (iv)\n\nBentonite must be placed above the sand\npack using a tremie or other method approved by the department to form a seal\nat least three feet thick. A six to 12-inch fine-grained sand pack must be\nplaced above the bentonite seal to minimize grout infiltration. If bentonite\npellets or chips are used, full hydration of the bentonite is required prior to\nemplacement of overlying materials. (v) Grout of cement/bentonite, bentonite, or\nother suitable, low-permeability material must completely fill the remaining\nannular space to the surface seal. The grout mixture must set-up without being\ndiluted by formation water, and must displace water in the annular space to\nensure a continuous seal. The grout mixture must be placed under pressure using\na tremie or other method approved by the department. Auger flights or casing\nmust be left in the hole before grouting to prevent caving. The cement used\nmust be appropriate for the groundwater chemistry of the site. (vi)\nA protective steel casing, nominally at\nleast two inches larger in diameter than the well casing, must be placed over\nthe well casing or riser pipe and secured in a surface well seal to adequately\nprotect the well casing. A distinctive, readily visible marker must be\npermanently attached to or near the protective casing to identify the well and\nensure visibility. A drain hole must be drilled at the base of the protective\ncasing. A vent hole must be located near the top of the protective casing to\nprevent explosive gas build up and to allow water levels to respond naturally\nto barometric pressure changes. The annulus of the protective casing should be\nfilled with gravel. A locking cap must be installed with a minimum of a\none-inch clearance between the top of the well cap and the bottom of the\nlocking cap when in the locked position. A weather-resistant padlock must be\nplaced on the protective casing. Padlock keys must be maintained at the\nfacility and provided to department staff upon request. (vii)\nA concrete surface seal designed to\nlast throughout the planned life of the monitoring well must be constructed. The surface seal must extend below the frost depth to prevent potential well\ndamage. The seal must be designed to prevent surface run-off from entering the\nwell casing. In areas where traffic may cause damage to the well, bollards or\nother suitable protection for the well are required. Any damaged or\ndeteriorated surface seals must be reported to the department and repaired or\nreplaced in an appropriate manner. The department may allow alternate designs\nwhen documentation is presented that demonstrates the intent of the regulations\nare met or exceeded. (viii)\n\nAlternative construction methods for piezometers and wells that are not to be\npart of the environmental monitoring plan may be approved in writing by the\ndepartment if those methods meet the requirements set forth in subparagraph\n363-4.4(k)(1)(ii) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nWell and piezometer development. All\nwells and piezometers must be developed as soon as possible after installation, but not before the well seal and grout have set. Water must not be introduced\ninto the well for development, except with written approval of the department. Any contaminated water withdrawn during development must be properly managed. Development must not disturb the sand pack or the strata above the\nwater-bearing zone or damage the well. The entire saturated screened interval\nmust be developed. The department may require multiple attempts at well\ndevelopment to increase the likelihood of obtaining sediment free water. Development methods must be appropriate for formation conditions. The selected\nmethod must minimize to the greatest extent possible the amount of turbidity in\nthe well. (4)\n\nSurvey. The\nlocations and elevations of all existing and abandoned test pits, soil borings, monitoring wells, and piezometers must be surveyed to obtain their precise\nlocation and plotted on a map in the site investigation report. The vertical\nlocation of the ground surface and the mark made on the top of the monitoring\nwell and piezometer risers must be accurately measured to the nearest 100th\nfoot. (5)\n\nWell replacement. All\nwells must be properly protected to ensure their integrity throughout the\nactive life, post-closure period, and custodial care period of the facility. If, in the opinion of the department, water quality or other data show that the\nintegrity of a well is lost, the well must be replaced and sampled within a\ntime period acceptable to the department (but not to exceed 120 days) after\nwritten notification by the department. The initial sample for the replacement\nwell must be analyzed for baseline parameters in the Water Quality Analysis\n\nTables in this Subpart. (6)\n\nWell\nabandonment. All soil borings, rock cores or other abandoned wells that are not\ncompleted as monitoring wells or piezometers must be fully sealed in a manner\nappropriate for the geologic conditions to prevent contaminant migration\nthrough the borehole. Generally, sealing must include: (i) overboring or removal of the casing to\nthe greatest extent possible, followed by perforation of any casing left in\nplace. All casing and well installations in the upper five feet of the boring, or within five feet of the proposed level of excavation, must be\nremoved; (ii)\nsealing by pressure\ninjection with cement bentonite grout, using a tremie or other method\nacceptable to the department. The cement must extend the entire length of the\nboring to no less than five feet below the ground surface or the proposed\nexcavation level. The screened interval of the borehole must be sealed\nseparately and tested to ensure its adequacy before sealing the remainder of\nthe borehole. Where the surrounding geologic deposits are highly permeable, alternate methods of sealing may be required to prevent the migration of the\ngrout into the surrounding geologic formation. The well must be backfilled to\nat least five feet below ground surface with appropriate native materials\ncompacted to avoid settlement; and\n(iii)\nthe sealed site must be restored to a\nsafe condition. The site must be inspected periodically after sealing for\nsettlement or other conditions that may require remediation. (7)\n\nWell extension. All well\nextensions must be constructed to ensure the future use of the well. Well\nextensions shall be designed to maintain the future integrity of the well\ncasing and to prevent surface water intrusion into the well casing. Failure of\na well extension will require well replacement. (l) Geologic sampling. (1)\n\nAll borings and rock cores must be\nsampled continuously to the base of the critical stratigraphic section. For\nwell clusters, continuous samples must be collected from the surface to the\nbase of the deepest well. Other wells in the cluster must be sampled at all\nstratigraphic changes, and at the screened interval. At sites where the geology\nis not of a complex nature the department may allow a reduction in the number\nof wells requiring continuous sampling. Soil borings must be sampled using the\nsplit spoon method, or other approved methods such as continuous sonic core\nsampling, and bedrock or boulders must be sampled by coring with standard size\nNX or larger diameter core bits. Samples must be retained in labeled glass jars\nor wooden core boxes. All samples must be securely stored and accessible\nthroughout the life of the facility. The location of the storage area must be\ndesignated in the facility manual. (2)\nA representative number of undisturbed\nsamples must be collected from test pits and borings using appropriate methods\nto identify the characteristics of all cohesive soil units. These samples must\nbe analyzed in the laboratory for: Atterberg limits; gradation curves by sieve\nor hydrometer analysis or both; undisturbed permeabilities; and visual\ndescriptions of undisturbed soil structures and lithologies. Laboratory\nanalysis of non-cohesive soil units may also be required. (m) Logs. (1)\n\nComplete drilling logs must be provided\nto the department for all soil borings. These logs must provide detailed soil\nclassification according to the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). The\nUSCS visual method must be used on all samples supplemented by the USCS\nlaboratory tests on a representative number of samples from each stratigraphic\nunit and each screened interval. Logs also must contain a description of the\nmatrix, clasts, mineralogy, roundness, color, appearance, odor, and behavior of\nmaterials using an appropriate descriptive system. A clear description of the\nsystem used must be included with the logs. All well logs must contain drilling\ninformation observed in the field including: moisture content, location of the\nwater table during drilling, water loss during drilling, depth to significant\nchanges in lithology, depth to bedrock, sample recovery (measured in tenths of\na foot), hammer blow counts, the method of drilling, any anomalous features\n(e.g., gas in the well), and the use and description of drilling fluids or\nadditives, including the source, and calculated and actual amounts of materials\nused. (2)\n\nRock core logs must\ndescribe the lithology, mineralogy, degree of cementation, color, grain size, and any other physical characteristics of the rock; percent recovery and the\nrock quality designation (RQD); other primary and secondary features, and\ncontain all drilling observations and appropriate details required for soil\nboring logs. A clear photograph of all labeled cores must also be taken and\nsubmitted with the logs. (3)\n\nWell\ncompletion logs must contain a diagram of the installed well, all pertinent\ndetails on well construction, a description of the materials used, and\nelevations of all well features. (4)\n\nCopies of original field logs must be\nsubmitted to the department upon request. (n) In situ hydraulic conductivity testing. In situ hydraulic conductivity testing must be done in all monitoring wells and\npiezometers, unless otherwise approved by the department. The testing method\nused must not introduce contaminants into the well. If contamination is known\nor suspected to exist, all water removed must be properly managed. Hydraulic\nconductivities may be determined using pump tests, slug tests, packer tests, tracer studies, isotopic geochemistry, thermal detection, or other suitable\nmethods. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
