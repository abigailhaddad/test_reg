(d) Time and place of hearing. All\nhearings shall be commenced at the time and place specified in the notice of\nhearing, or as soon thereafter as practicable, but in no event sooner than 60\ndays from the date of the notice. (e) Disclosure. At least 15 days prior to the\ncommencement of a hearing, each party shall disclose to the other party all\ndocuments or other materials, including those that may have been, submit a copy\nof such disclosure to the presiding officer when disclosure to the other party\nis made. (f) Recusal. (1)\nA party may request recusal of a\npresiding officer. The request and the reason for it must be made in writing to\nthe assigned presiding officer at the beginning of the hearing or as soon\nthereafter as the requestor receives information which forms the basis for such\nrequest, whichever occurs first. Denial of a request for recusal shall be\nreviewable by the Administrative Appeals Board under procedures established\npursuant to articles 3-A of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, provided that a final, adverse determination is subsequently made which is appealable by the requestor\nto the Administrative Appeals Board. (g) Conduct of hearings; evidence. (1)\n\nThe order of proof at a hearing shall be\ndetermined by the presiding officer. Testimony shall be given under oath or\naffirmation. The presiding officer, in his or her discretion, may exclude\nwitnesses. The presiding officer may admit any relevant evidence in addition to\noral testimony. Any witness may be questioned and/or cross-examined by the\npresiding officer, by the witness's counsel or representative, and by the party\nwho did not call the witness. (2)\n\nRules governing the admissibility of evidence in a court of law are not\napplicable to hearings held by the department. Evidence which would not be\nadmissible in court, such as hearsay, is admissible in a departmental hearing. The decision of the presiding officer shall be based upon a preponderance of\nthe evidence. (3)\n\nThe privileges\nset forth in article 45 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall be applicable\nto adjudicatory proceedings conducted pursuant to this section. (h) Adjournments. Adjournments of\nhearings may only be granted by the presiding officer responsible for the\nparticular hearing, by a supervisor of such presiding officer. It is the\ndepartment's policy to grant a request for adjournment for good cause if such\nrequest is made in writing and received at least seven days prior to the\nscheduled hearing and if no prior requests for adjournment have been made. Notwithstanding this policy, requests for adjournments made more than seven\ndays prior to hearing may be denied by the presiding officer, or supervisor of\nthe presiding officer, in their discretion. Grounds for such a denial include, but are not limited to, such a request being a second or subsequent request for\nadjournment, where there is reason to believe such request is merely an attempt\nto delay the holding of a hearing, or where an adjournment will significantly\naffect the availability of other witnesses scheduled to testify. Requests for\nadjournments within seven days of a scheduled hearing must be made in writing\ndirectly to the presiding officer. Such requests will generally not be granted. Such requests may be granted in the discretion of the presiding officer for\ngood cause shown. (i) Failure to\nappear; waiver. In any proceeding where no adjournment is requested or, if\nrequested, is not granted, the failure of any party to appear shall be deemed\nto be a waiver of hearing. Upon any party's failure to appear, the presiding\nofficer may receive testimony of available witnesses and enter evidence into\nthe record. (j) Resolution without\na hearing. Either party may request a resolution of the dispute without a\nhearing. The request must be made in writing and must be received by the\npresiding officer at least 15 days prior to the scheduled hearing. The request\nmust be accompanied by sufficient information to permit a determination of\nwhether any unresolved material issue of fact exists and may be accompanied by\na legal memorandum. A copy of such request and all supporting documentation\nmust be served upon the other party when the request is submitted to the\npresiding officer. Proof of service upon the other party shall accompany the\nrequest to the presiding officer. The other party shall have the opportunity to\nrespond to such request. Such response must be received by the presiding\nofficer within 15 days of receipt of the request for resolution without a\nhearing. The response may be accompanied by a legal memorandum. A copy of any\nresponse must be served upon the requesting party when the response is\nsubmitted to the presiding officer. Proof of service upon the requesting party\nshall accompany the response to the presiding officer. If necessary, in order\nto allow the presiding officer to evaluate the request for a resolution without\na hearing, the presiding officer may adjourn the scheduled hearing, with notice\nto all parties of the adjournment. (k) The presiding officer shall render a\ndecision not later than 90 days after the close of the hearing, or, if\nappropriate, the granting of a request for resolution without a hearing. The\ndecision of the presiding officer shall be based upon the preponderance of the\nevidence. The presiding officer shall prepare a decision which shall include\nfindings of fact, a determination on each charge, and, in the event of a\ndetermination of a violation, the remedy to be ordered.
