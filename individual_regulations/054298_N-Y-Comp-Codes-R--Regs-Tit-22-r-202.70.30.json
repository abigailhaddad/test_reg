  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 r. 202.70.30 - Settlement and Pretrial Conferences\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Settlement conference. At the time of\ncertification of the matter as ready for trial or at any time after the\ndiscovery cut-off date, the court may schedule a settlement conference which\nshall be attended by counsel and the parties, who are expected to be fully\nprepared to discuss the settlement of the matter. (b) Mandatory Settlement Conference. Unless\nexempted as set forth herein, the parties in every case pending in the\n\nCommercial Division must participate in a court-ordered mandatory settlement\nconference (MSC) following the filing of a Note of Issue. (1)\n\nReferral to MSC. Following the filing of\na Note of Issue, the parties must confer and file a request to proceed to a MSC\npursuant to one of the following four tracks. If all parties have agreed upon\nthe settlement conference track that they prefer, they may file a joint request\nwith a statement of preferred procedure for MSC. If the parties do not agree, they must file separate requests with statements as to their preference for a\nMSC track. The court will select the settlement conference track after\nconsidering the parties' preferences, the available judicial and other\nresources, and any other factors the court deems appropriate. The four possible\nsettlement conference tracks are as follows: (A)\n\nThe parties may agree to have a\nsettlement conference before the assigned justice or another judge pursuant to\n\nCommercial Division Rule 3(b). (B)\n\nThe court may refer the case to the Judicial Hearing Officer/Special Referee\noffice for assignment of a Judicial Hearing Officer or Special Referee to\nconduct the MSC. (C)\n\nThe court may\nrefer the case to the ADR coordinator or other designated court official in the\njudicial district where the case is pending for assignment, at no charge to the\nparties, of a neutral selected from the roster of neutrals or mediators under\n\nPart 146 of the Rules of the Chief Administrative Judge. If the parties wish to\ncontinue talks with the neutral beyond the initial conference, an arrangement\nwill have to be made to retain such neutral at terms agreed to by the neutral\nand the parties. (D)\n\nThe parties\nmay agree to engage a private neutral. (2)\n\nAttendance at MSC. The MSC shall be\nattended by a person with knowledge of the case and authority to settle the\ncase. (3)\n\nSubmissions to the\nneutral conducting the MSC. The neutral shall determine whether a submission\nshould be provided to the neutral and the service thereof. (4)\n\nExemptions from MSC. MSC is mandatory for\nall cases in the Commercial Division unless the assigned justice to the case, for good cause shown, exempts the case from MSC under this Rule. (5)\n\nConfidentiality. All attendees of the\nMSC, including the assigned neutral, shall treat as confidential information\nany settlement submission created expressly for use in the MSC, anything that\nhappened or was said during the course of or pursuant to the MSC, and any\npositions taken or offers made during the MSC. Such material cannot be\ndisclosed to anyone not involved in the litigation or to the court, and may not\nbe used in any fashion in the litigation of the case. (6)\n\nReport. Following the MSC, the parties\nwill advise the assigned justice whether a settlement was reached, and if a\nsettlement was reached, a date by which the parties expect to complete\ndocumentation of the settlement. The parties shall not discuss any reasons why\na settlement was not reached. (7)\n\nScheduling and Procedures. Any scheduling and procedural issues shall be\ndetermined by the justice assigned to the case. If it is determined that the\nMSC is to be held before a neutral other than the assigned justice, scheduling\nand procedural issues with respect to the MSC shall be determined by the\nneutral. (8)\n\nNon-exclusive. Nothing\nin the Rule shall preclude or replace any settlement practices used by the\ncourt, by any individual justice, or as agreed to by the parties and the\nassigned justice shall retain ultimate authority with respect to each aspect of\nthe MSC. (c) Pre-trial\n\nConference. Prior to the pretrial conference, counsel shall confer in a good\nfaith effort to identify matters not in contention, resolve disputed questions\nwithout need for court intervention and further discuss settlement of the case. At the pre-trial conference, counsel shall be prepared to discuss all matters\nas to which there is disagreement between the parties, including those\nidentified in Rules 27-29, and settlement of the matter. At or before the\npre-trial conference, the court may require the parties to prepare a written\nstipulation of undisputed facts. (d) Consultation Regarding Expert Testimony. The court may direct that prior to the pre-trial conference, counsel for the\nparties consult in good faith to identify those aspects of their respective\nexperts' anticipated testimony that are not in dispute. The court may further\ndirect that any agreements reached in this regard shall be reduced to a written\nstipulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22\nr. 202.70.30.
