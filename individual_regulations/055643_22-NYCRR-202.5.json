The court shall consider the pro se status of any party in\ngranting relief pursuant to this provision. (3)\n\nWhere a person submitting a paper to a\ncourt for filing believes in good faith that the inclusion of the full\nconfidential personal information described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is material and necessary to the adjudication\nof the action or proceeding before the court, he or she may apply to the court\nfor leave to serve and file together with a paper in which such information has\nbeen set forth in abbreviated form a confidential affidavit or affirmation\nsetting forth the same information in unabbreviated form, appropriately\nreferenced to the page or pages of the paper at which the abbreviated form\nappears.
