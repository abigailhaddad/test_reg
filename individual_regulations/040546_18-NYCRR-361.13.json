  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 361.13 - Closing and reopening cases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Closing a case. The case manager must\nclose a case and terminate case management activities when the adolescent: (1)\nsuccessfully accomplishes all the\nlong-range goals identified in his or her case record; (2)\naccomplishes, on schedule for one year, the short-range goals identified in his or her individual case record for all\nthe primary assessment areas, and the adolescent and the case manager agree the\nadolescent should pursue the long- range goals without the performance of case\nmanagement activities by the case manager; (3)\nno longer is under the district's\njurisdiction; (4)\nno longer meets\nthe eligibility requirements for case management activities; or\n(5)\nrequests that the case be closed. If the\nadolescent fails, without explanation or cause, to keep three consecutive\nappointments made by the case manager, and advance notice of the appointments\nwas provided to the adolescent and the appointments are documented in the\nadolescent's individual case record, then the case manager may, but is not\nmandated to, deem such failure to constitute a request by the adolescent to\nhave his or her case closed. However, the adolescent's failure to complete any\nportion of his or her personal plan will not be deemed a request by the\nadolescent to have his or her case closed. (b) Reopening a closed case. (1)\n\nMandatory. At the adolescent's request, the case manager must reopen a closed case if the adolescent continues to meet\nthe mandatory eligibility criteria or the optional eligibility criteria\ndesignated in the social services district's case management plan. (2)\n\nOptional. At the adolescent's request, the case manager may reopen a closed case within six calendar months of the\nmonth in which the case was closed if the adolescent still is a public\nassistance recipient and still would be eligible for case management activities\nif the case had not been closed.
