  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 380-11.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n\nFor each radionuclide, Table I of section\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart indicates\nthe chemical form which is to be used for selecting the appropriate ALI or DAC\nvalue. The ALIs and DACs for inhalation are given for an aerosol with an\nactivity median aerodynamic diameter (AMAD) of 1 µm and for three classes\n(D, W, Y) of radioactive material, which refer to their retention\n(approximately days, weeks or years) in the pulmonary region of the lung. This\nclassification applies to a range of clearance halftimes for D of less than 10\ndays, for W from 10 to 100 days, and for Y greater than 100 days. The class (D, W, or Y) given in the columns headed class applies only to the inhalation ALIs\nand DACs given in Table I, columns 2 and 3. For each radionuclide, Table II of\nsection\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart provides\nconcentration values for airborne and liquid effluents released to the general\nenvironment. Table III of section\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart provides\nconcentration limits for releases to sanitary sewer systems. The concentration\nvalues listed in Tables II and III of section\n380-11.7\nof this Subpart are used\nto control the release of radionuclides to the environment in such a manner\nthat the total dose to an individual member of the public does not exceed the\nlimits prescribed in Subpart 380-5 of this Part.
