  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 219-3.2 - Applicability and compliance dates\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Subpart applies to all new, modified and existing\ninfectious waste incineration facilities whose total permitted charging rate is\nless than 50 tons per day. Except for municipal waste incineration facilities\nexisting as of the effective date of this Subpart [30 days after December 1, 1988], these requirements shall be effective and shall apply to all infectious\nwaste incineration facilities for which a certificate to operate has been\nissued 90 days after such operating requirements have been formally promulgated\npursuant to the State Administrative Procedure Act; provided, however, that\nwhere infectious waste incineration facilities are owned by health care\nfacilities licensed pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law and in\noperation by permit of the department on or before September 1, 1987, then such\nstandards shall become effective as to such facilities on January 1, 1992. Any\nnew or modified infectious waste incineration facility whose total permitted\ncharging rate is 50 tons per day or more or which accepts offsite municipal\nsolid waste from a non-generator of infectious waste must also meet the\nrequirements of Subpart 219-2 of this Part. Note: This Subpart alone does not require the incineration of\nany infectious waste. It only establishes the standards to be met if\nincineration is the chosen method of waste treatment. The requirement for\nincineration of infectious waste (as one treatment option) is found in PHL\n§1389-dd (for treatment at hospitals, residential health care facilities and\nclinical laboratories), in ECL § 15-1507 (for other treatment facilities), in\nthe solid waste regulations (Subpart 360-10 of this Title) and in Department of\n\nHealth regulations (10 NYCRR Chapter V).
