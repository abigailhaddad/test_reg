Tit. 10 § 447.4 - Physical therapy services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) ACCOUNT\nNUMBER COST CENTER TITLE\n7510 Physical Therapy\n(1)\n\nThe standard unit of measure will be the\nrelative value units developed by the American Physical Therapy Association. Relative value units shall be counted during a patient visit for all cost\ncenter activities for which a charge is made. A patient visit is the occasion\nfor service during which the resources of the physical therapy cost center are\nused. A visit is one appearance of a patient regardless of the number of\nevaluation, therapeutic, patient education activities performed during that\nappearance. (2)\n\nThe two major\ncomponents of the relative value unit are: personnel time associated with the\nactivity, and other direct and appropriate indirect department resources used\nin providing the activity. Fifteen minutes has been established as the least\nincrement of time for which a unit of service (e.g., evaluation, therapeutic, or patient educational activity) can occur. The unit of service which requires\nthe least amount of the physical therapy department's total resources is a\nmodality. This activity is used to establish the basic relative value unit of\n1.0. Since the basic relative value unit of 1.0 does not require the continuous\nattendance of physical therapy personnel, the initial unit value for those\nservices that do require the continuous attendance of physical therapy\npersonnel is adjusted upward. An additional.4 of a unit will be added to the\ninitial increment for those activities requiring continuous attendance by\nphysical therapy personnel. When subsequent 15-minute increments of service are\nprovided, some of the initial direct and indirect costs do not recur or are\nreduced. Therefore, relative value units for subsequent increments of time are\napproximately 10 percent less than the initial unit value. (3)\n\nThe recording of 15-minute increments of\nservice begins with the initiation of the evaluation, therapeutic, or patient\neducational activity. Although time may have been spent transporting the\npatient to the department or making entries in the medical record, RVU's are\nnot counted for these activities. Patient transportation, treatment preparation\nand cleanup, and recordkeeping costs are incorporated in the weighting of the\ninitial 15-minute increment of service and additional RVU's cannot be added for\nthese activities. However, the time required to complete a separate formal\nreport for patient evaluations or aftercare planning can be counted. (4)\n\nTherapeutic or evaluation activities\nperformed in the home shall have a unit value equivalent to that for the\nappropriate therapeutic or evaluation activity rendered plus an allowance for\ntravel time to and from the home. Travel time for home visits is valued the\nsame as those activities requiring continuous attendance by physical therapy\npersonnel with the patient. (b) RELATIVE VALUE UNITS\nDescription            Initial       Additional 15\n15        minutes (round to\nminutes      nearest 15\nminutes)\n(1)             EVALUATION ACTIVITIES\nEvaluation activities are       1.4        1.3\nassessments of patients'\nperformance to assist in\nestablishing diagnoses or to\nestablish or reevaluate\ntreatment plans. (2)             THERAPEUTIC ACTIVITIES\n(i) Modalities\nA modality does not require the  1.0        0.9\ncontinuous attendance of\nphysical therapy personnel\nduring a therapeutic activity\n(ii) Procedures\nA procedure does require the     1.4        1.3\ncontinuous attendance of\nphysical therapy personnel\nduring a therapeutic\nactivity. (iii)                                                        Continuous attend\n\nHydrotherapy                                                 attendance of\npersonnel\nrequir-  not\ned       required\n\nExtremity or Body Whirlpool      1.4        1.3      0.9\n\nHubbard Tank or Therapeutic      2.5        1.3      0.9\n\nPool\n\nInitial     Additional 15\n15           minutes\nminutes     (round to\nnearest 15\nminutes)\n(3)  PATIENT EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\nPatient educational activities are used to      1.4        1.3\ninstruct the patient or his attendant, family or their substitute in maintaining\nand improving the patient's condition. (4)  COMBINATION OF EVALUATION, THERAPEUTIC OR\nPATIENT EDUCATIONAL ACTIVITIES\nMultiple evaluation, therapeutic, patient\neducational activities performed during a\npatient visit will be reported as a\ncombination. (i) Any number of modalities in combination     1.0        0.9\n(ii) Any number of evaluation, therapeutic, or  1.4        1.3\npatient educational activities in\ncombination\n(iii) Hydrotherapy in combination with other\nactivities: Extremity or Body Whirlpool                     1.4        1.3\n\nHubbard Tank or Therapeutic Pool                2.5        1.8\n(5)  HOME VISITS\nA home visit is provided to an individual\npatient in a setting other than the physical\ntherapist's office or work facility. The\nstandard unit of measure for home visits\nincludes the number of relative value units\nfor the evaluation, therapeutic, or patient\neducational activity and for travel time. (i) Evaluation, Therapeutic, or Educational     1.4        1.3\n\nActivities\n(ii) Travel Time Travel time for home visits    1.3        1.3\nis the actual time spent by physical therapy\npersonnel going to and from the home. Travel\ntime for multiple home visits during a\nsingle trip is calculated by dividing the\ntotal number of relative value units for\ntravel time by the number of patients\ntreated during that trip. (6)  GROUP ACTIVITIES\nA group activity is the occasion for service    1.3        1.3\nduring which two or more patients\nsimultaneously receive a therapeutic, evaluation, or patient educational activity. Group activities will be reported by\ncounting the number of RVU's for one patient\nparticipating in the group activity session, and adding 0.1 RVU per session for each\npatient participating in the group activity. (7)\n\nNotes\n(i) For further explanation of how to use the\nrelative value units see the accompanying Schedule of Unit Values and Examples\nof Relative Value Unit Computations for Combination Activities. (ii)\n\nWhen multiple personnel are used during\nan entire activity period, additional 1.3 RVU's are recorded for each person\nfor each 15-minute increment. (iii)\n\nThe units of measure do not include wound dressing, debridement, exercise or\nother activities performed in conjunction with hydrotherapy. (iv)\n\nWhen computing an indiviudal's RVU's, the value should be rounded to the nearest one-tenth (e.g., 0.62 = 0.6, 0.68 =\n0.7).
