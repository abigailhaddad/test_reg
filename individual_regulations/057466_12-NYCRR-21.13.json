Anchors and their fastenings shall be approved and the\nanchor shall bear the mark of approval prescribed by the board. They shall be\nmachined from bar stock or forged as hereinafter set forth. Anchors shall\nconform with the dimensions as shown in Figures 2 and 3 below: Click\nto view image\n\nClick\nto view image\n(b) Required material. Anchors and anchor fastenings except reinforcing plates\nshall be of alloys as follows: (1)\n\nItems which are to be forged shall be made of the following alloys: Nickel-copper alloy, ASTM\ndesignation B127-49T containing\n\nNickel\n\nMax. Per cent\n63.0 to 70.0\n\nIron\n\" \"\n2.5\n\nAluminum\n\" \"\n0.5\n\nManganese\n\" \"\n1.25\n\nCarbon\n\" \"\n0.3\n\nSilicon\n\" \"\n0.5\n\nSulfur\n\" \"\n0.02\n\nCopper\nremainder; or\n\nCopper-nickel alloy, ASTM\ndesignation B122-54T, alloy No. 5 containing\n\nNickel\n\nMax. Per cent\n29.0 to 33.0\n\nIron\n\" \"\n0.7\n\nManganese\n\" \"\n1.0\n\nLead\n\" \"\n0.05\n\nZinc\n\" \"\n1.0\n\nCopper\n\nMin.

Per cent\n0.08\n\nManganese\n\" \"\n2.0\n\nSilicon\n\" \"\n1.0\n\nPhosphorus\n\" \"\n0.04\n\nSulfur\n\" \"\n0.03\n\nChromium\n\nPer cent\n18.0 to 20.0\n\nNickel\n\"\n8.0 to 11.0; or\n\nStainless steel AISI type No. 316\ncontaining\n\nCarbon\n\nMax. Per cent\n0.1\n\nManganese\n\" \"\n2.0\n\nSilicon\n\" \"\n1.0\n\nPhosphorus\n\" \"\n0.04\n\nSulfur\n\" \"\n0.03\n\nChromium\n\nPer cent\n16.0 to 18.0\n\nNickel\n\"\n10.0 to 14.0\n\nMolybdenum\n\"\n2.0 to 3.0\n(2)\n\nMachined fastenings and other items shall be of the same material as the\nforgings to which they are attached except that machined parts of stainless\nsteel may be made from AISI type 303 and machined parts of nickel-copper alloy\nmay be made from Class B material having a sulfur content of not more than 0.5\nper cent. (c) Required fabrication. (1)\n\nAnchors and anchor fastenings shall be machined from bar stock, or forged and\ntreated as specified below: FORGING\nMaterial\n\nPreheat temp. (°F.)\n\nStart forging at\n(°F.)\n\nFinish forgin at\n(°F.)\n\nAnneal after\nforging\n\nRange of BHN hardness after forging and\nannealing\n\nNi-Cu\n\nNone\n\nNot over 2150\n\nNot below 1700\n5 to 10 min. at 1600°F. 110 to 140 BHN\nCu-Ni\n\nNone\n1900\n1600\n\nApprox. 5 min. at 1700 to 1750°F. 150 to 170 BHN\n304\nto 1500 slowly\n2050 to 2200\n1600 to 1700\n15 min. 1950 to 2050°F. 150 to 160 BHN\n316\nto 1500 slowly\n2100 to 2200\n1600 to 1700\n15 min. at 1950 to 2050°F. 150 to 170 BHN\n(2)\n\nThe heating for forging of nickel-copper and copper-nickel alloys shall be done\nin an atmosphere that is essentially sulfur-free. The fuel used shall contain\nnot more than 0.5 per cent of sulfur. Such atmosphere shall be slightly\nreducing with a carbon-monoxide content of two per cent or more. After forging\nand annealing, each anchor shall be pickled to remove scale and discoloration. No cold working of anchors other than drilling, spot-facing, reaming, boring, broaching, countersinking, threading, and grinding is\npermitted. (d) Finish. The finished anchor shall be free of imperfections and all\ncorners shall be properly filleted or rounded. Where screw fastenings are used, the surface shall be spot-faced to receive the lock washer under the screw\nhead. (e) Tests of\nfinished forgings. (1)\n\nIf and when the\ncommissioner so requires, the owner of finished forgings of anchors and anchor\nfastenings shall select such number of forgings from each lot as the\ncommissioner may require for testing. The commissioner may require such test\nspecimens to be subjected by the owner to the BHN hardness test and a\nnondestructive test such as the fluorescent penetrant test. (2)\n\nThe manufacturer of such anchor forgings\nshall cause at least one per cent, but not less than two forgings, of each lot\nto be subjected to an impact test as follows: The anchor shall be attached to a rigid anchorage. A 250\npound solid and compact weight of iron or lead shall be suspended from the\nanchor by means of an approved belt terminal and a 6-37 strand three-eighths\ninch plow steel wire rope. The test rope shall be not more than six feet long\nand rope connections shall be by thimble and splice or proper size rope clamps. The test weight shall be hoisted to a point in vertical alignment with the\npoint of suspension and allowed to fall free a distance of four feet. (3)\n\nSuch manufacturer shall notify\nthe commissioner of such impact tests in advance. (4)\n\nIf any specimen from a lot fails to\nwithstand the impact test, the lot from which it was taken shall be either\nre-treated and retested or scrapped. If any specimens from a re-treated lot\nfails to withstand such test, the lot shall be rejected and scrapped. (f) Screw thread. Fastening screws and bolts shall have an untreated portion\nunder the head not less than three-sixteenths inch long. Threads shall be\ncut. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n21.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
