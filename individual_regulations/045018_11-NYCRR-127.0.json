  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 127.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Insurance Department recognizes that authorized insurers routinely enter into reinsurance agreements that yield legitimate relief to ceding insurers from strain to surplus. (b) However, it is improper for an authorized insurer, in the capacity of ceding insurer, to enter into reinsurance agreements for the principal purpose of producing significant surplus aid for the ceding insurer, while not transferring all the significant risks inherent in the insurance policies being reinsured. In substance or effect, the expected potential liability to the ceding insurer remains basically unchanged by the reinsurance transaction, notwithstanding certain risk elements in the reinsurance agreement, such as catastrophic mortality or extraordinary survival. (c) It is the department's position that, except as provided in section\n127.3\nof this Part, if an authorized ceding insurer takes reserve credit by reducing liabilities or establishing assets for reinsurance ceded under the type of reinsurance agreements referred to in subdivision (b) of this section and described in section\n127.2\nof this Part, that ceding insurer would: (1)\nviolate section\n1308 (c)\nof the Insurance Law; (2)\nviolate section\n307 (a)\nof the Insurance Law by distorting its financial statements and not properly reflecting its financial condition in accordance with sections\n4217, 4218, 4221\nand\n4223\nof the Insurance Law; and\n(3)\ncreate a situation that may be hazardous to policyholders and the people of this State. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n127.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
