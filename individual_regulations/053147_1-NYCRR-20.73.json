(b) If the balance in the\nproducer settlement fund is insufficient to make the full payment required\nunder subdivision (a) of this section, the market administrator shall reduce\nuniformly the payments to each handler and shall complete such payments as soon\nas the necessary funds are available. No handler who, on the 20th day of the\nmonth, has not received such payments in full from the market administrator\nshall be deemed to be in violation of sections 20.80 through\n20.82\nof this Part if he reduces\nhis total payments to producers for milk delivered by such producers during the\npreceding month by not more than the amount of the reduction in payment from\nthe producer settlement fund.
