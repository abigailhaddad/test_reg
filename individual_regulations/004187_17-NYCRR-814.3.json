If at\nthe time of the move, the shipper requests additional moving services that were\nnot listed on the original non-binding estimate and order for service, an\nadjustment may be made by the carrier to the non-binding estimate to reflect\nthe additional services and/or charges. Such statement shall be in writing. The\nform shall be fully executed as appropriate in each case in accordance with the\ninstructions thereon. A true legible copy of each form prepared in accordance\nwith this subdivision shall be delivered to the shipper before the pickup of\nthe goods; and a copy thereof shall be maintained by the carrier as part of its\nrecord of the shipment. The order for service shall be signed by the shipper or\nhis representative who is ordering the service, and by the carrier or its\nagent; the requirement of the shipper's signature shall apply to all orders for\nservice, except where there is both an agreement for the extension of credit by\nthe carrier and a written waiver of such requirement signed by the shipper or\nhis representative. A copy of the order for service shall be dated and\nfurnished the shipper or his representative at the time it is executed.

(b) Carriers may furnish to shippers or\nprospective shippers a non-binding estimate form which may contain statements\nof the weights of average pieces of furniture and other household articles of\nvarious types, for use by the shipper in making his own estimate of the total\nweight of his goods. If cubic foot measurements are used in arriving at the\nweight, the form shall state that a weight factor of seven pounds per cubic\nfoot shall be used. (c) In each\ninstance in which the actual charges on any shipment exceed by more than 10\npercent the amount of the non-binding estimate given by the carrier to the\nshipper, immediately upon determining the actual charges, the carrier shall\ninform the shipper of the amount thereof, by telephone, e-mail or other\nelectronic means, provided that the requirement of this subdivision shall not\napply where credit is to be extended by the carrier. (d) Whenever the total tariff charges on a\nC.O.D. shipment shall exceed by more than 10 percent the non-binding estimate\ngiven by the carrier on a weight-rated move or by more than 25 percent of the\nnon-binding estimate given by a carrier on an hourly-rated move, such carrier\nmust relinquish possession of the entire shipment upon payment of the amount of\nthe non-binding estimate plus 10 percent thereof in the case of weight-rated\nmoves or upon payment of the non-binding estimate plus 25 percent thereof in\nthe case of an hourly-rated move, and the carrier shall defer payment of the\nremainder of the tariff charges for a period of at least 15 days following\ndelivery, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and holidays.
