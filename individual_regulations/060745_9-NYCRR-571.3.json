  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 571.3 - Determination of mean high water\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nagency will, upon request of any person having a legal interest in property and\ncontemplating land use or development or subdivision thereon, determine the\nmean high water mark of any lake, pond, river or stream at relevant\npoints. (b) Where recorded\nhydrological data allow, the agency will provide mean high water expressed as\nan elevation above mean sea level for the water body involved, and will list it\nin Appendix Q-2 of these regulations. (c) Where recorded hydrological data cannot\nbe used, the agency will physically locate the mean high water mark upon the\nland in question, utilizing standard vegetative tests, water marks, soil\ncharacteristics and other means customarily employed in making such\ndeterminations. (d) The agency will\ngenerally accept the written and certified determination of a professional land\nsurveyor licensed by the State of New York of the mean high water mark on any\nparticular lot. (e) Except where it\nclearly appears, based upon inspection of the lot, that the original\ndetermination was inaccurate, the agency will generally accept any\ndetermination of mean high water set forth in a deed to the premises. (f) Where the application of subdivision (b), (c), (d) or (e) of this section yields materially different results, the agency\nwill reasonably fix the mean high water mark in the exercise of\ndiscretion.
