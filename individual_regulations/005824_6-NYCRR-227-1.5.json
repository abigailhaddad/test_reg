  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 227-1.5 - Compliance testing, monitoring, and recordkeeping\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The owner or operator of a new solid fuel\nfired stationary combustion installation must conduct an initial compliance\ntest within 180 days of the commencement of operation of the new stationary\ncombustion installation to determine compliance with the applicable particulate\nmatter emission limit as prescribed in this Subpart. The owner or operator of\nan existing solid fuel fired stationary combustion installation must conduct a\ncompliance test within four years of the promulgation of this regulation. After\nthe initial compliance test, all solid fuel fired stationary combustion\ninstallations must conduct periodic compliance tests at least once during the\nterm of the permit. Prior to each test, the owner or operator of a solid fuel\nfired stationary combustion installation must meet the following criteria: (1)\nsubmit a compliance test protocol to the\ndepartment for approval at least 30 days prior to emission testing. The\nconditions of the testing, including the representative loads of operation the\ntesting will be conducted at, and the locations of the sampling devices must be\nacceptable to the department; and\n(2)\nfollow the procedures set forth in 40 CFR\n60, Appendix A Method 5 (See Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), or any other\nmethod acceptable to the department and the administrator for determining\ncompliance with the appropriate particulate matter emission limit in section\n227-1.3\nof this Subpart: (3)\nsubmit a compliance test report\ncontaining the results of the emission test to the department for approval no\nlater than 60 days after completion of the emission test. (b) Monitoring requirements. (1)\n\nAny owner or operator of a stationary\ncombustion installation (excluding combustion turbines) or a group of\nstationary combustion installations with a total maximum heat input capacity\nexceeding 250 million Btu per hour shall install, operate, and properly\nmaintain (in accordance with manufacturer's instructions), accurate COMS that\nsatisfy the criteria in either 40 CFR\n60\n\nAppendix B (See Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title) or a\ndepartment approved case-by-case method for continuously monitoring and\nrecording opacity. Stationary combustion installations required to install COMS\nshall operate the COMS during all periods of oil and/or solid fuel\nfiring. (2)\n\nEach owner or operator\nrequired to operate a COMS in accordance with paragraph (1) of this subdivision\nshall submit an accurate excess emissions and monitoring system performance\nreport to the department for each calendar year quarter. All reports shall be\ncertified by a responsible corporate official as true, accurate and complete\nand postmarked by the 30th day following the end of each calendar quarter. The\nquarterly excess emissions report shall be submitted in a form acceptable to\nthe department and shall include the following minimum information: (i) the magnitude, date and time of each\nsix-minute block average during which the average opacity of emissions exceeds\n20 percent, except for one six-minute block average per hour not to exceed 27\npercent; (ii)\nidentification of the\nspecific cause and corrective action taken for each period of excess\nemission; (iii)\nidentification of\nall periods of COMS downtime, including the date, time and duration of each\ninoperable period, and the cause and corrective action for each COMS downtime\nperiod; (iv)\nthe total time in\nwhich the COMS are required to record data during the reporting\nperiod; (v) the total number of\nexceedances and the duration of ex-ceedances expressed as a percentage of the\ntotal time in which the COMS are required to record data; and\n(vi)\nsuch other things as the department may\ndeem necessary, proper or desirable in order to enforce article 19 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law or the rules promulgated thereunder. (3)\n\nAny owner or operator of a\nstationary combustion installation (excluding combustion turbines) or a group\nof stationary combustion installations firing oil or oil in combination with\nother liquid or gaseous fuels with a total maximum heat input capacity of at\nleast 50 million Btu per hour shall keep vendor certified fuel receipts which\ncontain the sulfur content of the oil being fired as required in 6 NYCRR\nSubpart\n225-1\nof this Chapter. (c) Recordkeeping. (1)\n\nAll records, department approved\ncompliance testing protocols, and test results must be maintained on site or at\nan alternative location, as approved by the department, for a minimum of five\nyears. (2)\n\nStationary combustion\ninstallations required to maintain a COMS must maintain a record of all\nmeasurements made by the COMS and the hours of COMS downtime. (3)\n\nFacilities required to conduct annual\ntune-ups must maintain records of each annual tune-up for all subject\nstationary combustion installations at the facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n227-1.5\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 10, 2021/Volume XLIII, Issue 06, eff. 2/25/2021\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
