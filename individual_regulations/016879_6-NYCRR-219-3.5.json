  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 219-3.5 - Design requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Furnace\ndesign must provide for a residence time for combustion gas of at least one\nsecond at no less than 1,800° F. For a multichamber incinerator, these\nparameters must be met after the primary combustion chamber and the primary\ncombustion chamber temperature must be maintained at no less than 1,400° F, or\n(b) Furnace design must provide a\nresidence time for combustion gas and a temperature which, in combination, are\nshown to be equivalent to subdivision (a) of this section. (c) Auxiliary burners must be designed to\nprovide combustion chamber temperatures as described in subdivision (a) of this\nsection by means of automatic modulating controls. (d) Mechanically fed incinerators must\nincorporate an air lock system to prevent opening the incinerator to the room\nenvironment. The volume of the loading system must be designed so as to prevent\novercharging to assure complete combustion of the waste. (e) The facility must be designed such that\nthe flue gas temperature at the outlet of the final control device does not\nexceed 300° F unless a demonstration is made that an equivalent collection of\ncondensible heavy metals and toxic organics can be achieved at a higher\ntemperature or through the use of alternate technologies. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n219-3.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
