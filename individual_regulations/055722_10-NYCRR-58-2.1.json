(b) Blood donation center\nmeans a fixed satellite location operated by a blood bank and used for the collection of whole blood and/or blood components. (c) Donor\nor\nblood donor\nmeans a person who provides his/her blood or plasma for transfusion of whole blood, blood components or derivatives. (d) Blood components\nmeans those preparations separated from a single donation of whole blood, or collected by apheresis, intended for direct use in transfusion, including but not limited to plasma, fresh frozen plasma, plasma frozen within 24 hours after phlebotomy (FP24), red blood cells, washed red blood cells, leukocyte-reduced red blood cells, platelets, granulocytes, and cryoprecipitate, but does not include lymphocytes collected from a donor of hematopoietic progenitor cells, as defined in Subpart 58-5 of this Part. (e) Derivatives\nmeans those preparations separated from plasma derived from multiple donors, including but not limited to albumin, immune globulin, plasma protein fraction and clotting factor concentrates. (f) Blood products\nmeans whole blood, blood components or derivatives. (g) Plasmapheresis\nmeans the withdrawal of blood to obtain plasma with subsequent or simultaneous reinfusion into the donor of his/her own red blood cells. (h) Serial plasmapheresis program\nmeans a program of individual donor donations on a regular basis by plasmapheresis yielding three liters or more of plasma per consecutive four-week period. (i) Cytapheresis\nmeans the separation and collection of blood cells or other formed elements by hemapheresis for the purpose of obtaining a transfusable blood component. (j) Intraoperative blood recovery\nmeans recovery of blood from a surgical field, and processing of recovered blood for direct reinfusion, storage or infusion into a cardiopulmonary bypass pump. Intraoperative blood recovery does not include performance of perioperative normovolemic hemodilution procedures. Postoperative blood recovery\nmeans recovery of blood from a wound following surgery, and processing of recovered blood for direct reinfusion or storage. Intraoperative blood recovery was formerly termed intraoperative blood salvage. (k) F.D.A. means the Food and Drug Administration of the United States Department of Health and Human Services. (l) Limited transfusion service\nmeans a facility, home care services agency, physician's office, or other entity which administers blood or blood components, and may temporarily store blood or blood components, and distribute them within its own organization, but relies on a blood bank holding a permit in blood services-transfusion to perform laboratory tests required under section\n58-2.17\nof this Subpart. (m) Distribution facility\nmeans a facility at which blood and blood components are temporarily stored prior to distribution.

Allogeneic collection was formerly termed homologous collection. (q) Autogeneic collection\nmeans the removal and storage of blood or blood components from a donor for subsequent reinfusion into that same person, and includes preoperative hemodilution procedures if at any time the blood leaves the operating room in which surgery is performed. Autogeneic collection was formerly termed autologous collection.

Such processing may include, but is not limited to separation (\ne.g., into platelet-rich plasma or fibrin glue), radioisotopic tagging, and genetic and immunologic manipulation. Reinfusion procedures shall not include presurgical autogenic collection, normovolemic hemodilution, intraperative blood recovery or postoperative blood recovery. (v) Normovolemic hemodilution\nmeans the collection of blood prior to surgery, and includes fluid replacement and reinfusion during or after surgery for purposes of reducing red cell loss during surgery. (w) Limited reinfusion service\nmeans a facility, home care services agency, physician's office or other non-hospital entity that performs reinfusion procedures.
