  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4620.5 - Black Jack\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. (1)\nA Black Jack table with up to seven\nbetting spaces on its layout. (2)\n\nOne to four decks of 52 cards each, shuffled together and used as\none. (3)\nA dealing box\n(optional). (b) Personnel. (1)\n\nDealer. The dealer is the\nperson who deals the cards and controls the bank. The dealer never surrenders\nthe deal or the bank. (2)\n\nAssistant. An assistant may be used to assist the dealer in collecting losing\nbets and paying off winning bets. (c) Number of players. Up to seven players, each of whom may bet on several hands depending on the betting spaces\navailable. (d) Value of cards. (1)\n\nAces count either 1 or 11 at the\ndiscretion of the player. (2)\n\nKings, queens and jacks each have a count of 10. (3)\n\nAll other cards are counted at their face\nvalue. (e) The object of\nthe game. A player tries to obtain a higher total card count than the dealer by\nreaching 21 or as close to 21 as possible without exceeding that count. If the\nplayer's total count exceeds 21, the player has \"busted\" and must turn the\nplayer's cards face-up at once. The player has lost his or her bet, and the\ndealer may take the player's wager. The player, at the player's discretion, may\nstand or draw one or more cards in an attempt to better the player's\ncount. (f) Betting. (1)\n\nBefore the deal begins, each player must\nplace his or her bet in the betting space directly before the play in full view\nof the dealer. When a player plays more than one hand at a time, such player\nmust play the hand farthest to his or her right to completion before being\npermitted to play his or her next hand or hands. The dealer may check the\nplayer's bet to see if such bet is within specified limits. (2)\n\nMaximum bet shall be $5 or its equivalent\nin chips. (g) The deal. After all players' bets are down, the dealer removes the first card from the\ndealing box and discards it by placing it aside face-down without showing its\nface value. This card and other discarded cards are not to be used again until\nthe dealing box is emptied. This is known as \"burning\" a card or a \"burnt\"\ncard. All cards used to make a hand are discarded in the same manner. After the\nfirst dealt card has been \"burnt,\" the dealer, starting with the player on the\ndealer's extreme left, begins dealing clockwise giving one card face-up to each\nplayer and one face-up to the dealer. The dealer next deals each player, starting with the player on the dealer's extreme left, a second face-up card\nand one face-down to the dealer. The dealer has the option of dealing one\nface-down card to each player. (h) The play. The organization shall have three options in the event of ties\nbetween the dealer and the player(s). Option number one allows the organization\nto honor a \"push\" or standoff in the case of all ties. Option number two allows\nthe organization to honor a \"push\" or standoff when the dealer and players have\na natural 21 only. The house wins all other ties. Option number three allows\nthe organization to win all ties between the dealer and the player(s). The\nselection of the option shall be set forth in the license application in\nschedule 7 of GC-2B. The license shall reflect one of the following options: Option one: All ties are \"pushes.\"\nOption two: \"Push\" on natural 21 only. Option three: House wins all ties. (1)\n\nIf the dealer's face-up card is a\n10-count or an ace, the dealer must look at his face-down (hole) card. If the\ndealer has a natural 21 (a count of 21 with two cards), the dealer must face it\nand announce \"Twenty-one\" or \"Black Jack.\" If the organization has exercised\nthe option that all ties shall constitute wins for the organization, the dealer\nthen wins and collects all bets, including bets from players having a natural\n21. If the organization has exercised either option number one or number two, the dealer declares all ties to be \"pushes\" and no action is taken on these\nhands. The dealer wins and collects the bets from players not having a natural\n21. (2)\n\nWhen the dealer does not\nhold a natural 21, the player at the dealer's extreme left plays first. If the\nplayer holds a natural 21, the player announces it and faces the player's cards\nso the dealer can verify the count. If the organization has exercised option\nnumber two or option number three, the dealer pays off the winning natural 21\nat 2-to-1 odds. If the organization has exercised the option that all ties are\n\"pushes\" (standoffs), then the dealer pays off the winning natural 21 at 3-to-2\nodds. The dealer then \"burns\" the two played-out cards. (3)\n\nIf the player's two cards total less than\n21, the player may elect: (i) to stay if the\nplayer is satisfied with the total count of the player's two cards; or\n(ii)\nto ask for an additional\ncard if the player is not satisfied with the total count. The player can\ncontinue to ask for cards until the player is satisfied with the total count of\nthe player's cards. If the player draws a card that puts the player over 21, the player must announce a \"bust.\" The dealer takes the player's wager and\ncards and \"burns\" the cards in the discard pile. The play moves to the player's\nleft, clockwise around the table, until all players have played out their\nhands. (i) The dealer's turn at play. If all players have \"busted,\" the dealer merely\nplaces the dealer's cards in the discard pile and deals a new hand. If any\nplayer or players are left, the dealer plays the dealer's hand as follows: (1)\n\nThe dealer turns up the dealer's hole\ncard so that all the dealer's cards are exposed. (2)\n\nIf the dealer's count is 17, 18, 19 or\n20, the dealer must stay. (3)\n\nIf\nthe dealer's count is 16 or less, the dealer must draw a card and continue to\ndraw until the dealer's count reaches 17 or more, at which point the dealer\nmust stay. If the dealer holds a \"soft\" 17, i.e., a 17-count that includes an\nace, the dealer must also stay. This also applies to a soft 18, 19 or 20. The\ndealer stays on 17 and must pull on 16 or less. (4)\n\nIf a dealer errs and deals a player a\ncard that the player did not call for, and the card is refused by the player, the card is considered a \"dead\" card and must be \"burnt\" and\ndiscarded. (j) Payoffs. At the end of the dealer's play, the dealer starts with the first active player\non the dealer's extreme right and moves around the table counterclockwise, paying off players who have a higher count than the dealer with an amount equal\nto the wager they placed and collecting the player's wagers showing a lesser\ncount. If the dealer's count exceeds 21, the dealer pays off each surviving\nplayer an amount equal to the player's wager. If the player and dealer have the\nsame count, the dealer either wins and collects the bet or declares a \"push\"\n(standoff), depending upon the option exercised by the organization. (k) Splitting pairs. (1)\n\nAny two cards that are identical except\nfor suit may be treated as a pair. Also, any two cards each having a value of\n10 may be treated as pairs, such as a 10 and jack, jack and queen, or queen and\nking. (2)\nA player who receives two\ncards forming a pair or considered to be a pair on the initial round may, if\nthe player chooses, separate the two cards and treat each card as the first\ncard dealt in two separate hands. This is called splitting pairs. When pairs\nare split, the player's original wager is placed on one of these cards and an\nequal amount must be wagered on the other. (3)\n\nThe player is then dealt one face-up card\non the face-up card on the player's right, and he or she must play this hand\nout. If, in drawing to the first face-up card, the player forms a pair again, the player may again split pairs, wagering an amount equal to the player's\nfirst card on this third hand. The player may continue to split any further\npairs. (4)\n\nWhen a player splits a\npair of aces, the player is only permitted to draw one card to each split ace, giving the player two cards in all. (5)\n\nIf a picture card or 10 or ace is part of\na split hand and the player makes a two-card count of 21, it is not a natural\nand the player is paid off at even money. (6)\nA player is not permitted to double down\non split pairs. (l) The\ndouble down. (1)\nA player whose first two\ncards total either 10 or 11 may elect to double the player's wager and draw one\nadditional card only. This is known as a \"double down\" or \"down for\ndouble\". (2)\nA player, before\ncalling \"double down,\" must double the player's original wager. The player is\nthen dealt a third and final card on the player's two face-up cards. (m) Insurance betting. Insurance\nbetting. When the dealer's face-up card is an ace, players may make an\ninsurance bet against the dealer's possible natural 21. The dealer, before\nlooking at the dealer's down card, inquires if any player wants insurance. A\nplayer who desires insurance places an amount equal to half the player's\npresent wager on the player's own hand. When the insurance wager is made, the\ndealer looks at the dealer's down card. If such card is a 10-count, the dealer\nturns it face-up and announces a \"natural.\" The insurance bettor is paid off at\nthe rate of 2-to-1 for the amount of the insurance bet. If the dealer's down\ncard is not a 10-count card, the player loses the player's insurance\nwager. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
