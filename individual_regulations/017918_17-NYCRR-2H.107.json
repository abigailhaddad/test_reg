  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2H.107 - Catskill Former Site Signs (NYM9-5, NYM9-6)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 Catskill Former Site (NYM9-5, NYM9-6) signs (see Sign\n\nDrawing SD-G17) may be used to inform motorists of the former locations of\ncommunities removed or relocated during the development of the New York City\nwatershed. Standard: 02 The lettering for names of places, streets and highways\non Catskill Former Site signs shall be composed of a combination of lower-case\nletters with initial upper-case letters (see Section 2A.13). Guidance: 03 The NYM9-5 sign should be used when only one community\nname appears on the sign. The NYM9-6 sign should be used for two community\nnames. 04 For communities whose names are too long to fit within\nthe sign constraints, the spacing between the letters in the name should be\nreduced as needed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2H.107\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
