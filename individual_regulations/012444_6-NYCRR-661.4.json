(b) (1)\n\nAdjacent area shall mean any land\nimmediately adjacent to a tidal wetland within whichever of the following\nlimits is closest to the most landward tidal wetland boundary, as such most\nlandward tidal wetlands boundary is shown on an inventory map (see explanatory\nfigures 1-6): (i) 300 feet landward of said\nmost landward boundary of a tidal wetland, provided, however, that within the\nboundaries of the City of New York this distance shall be 150 feet (see figure\n1); or\n(ii)\nto the seaward edge of\nthe closest lawfully and presently existing (i.e., as of August 20, 1977), functional and substantial fabricated structure (including, but not limited to, paved streets and highways, railroads, bulkheads and sea walls, and rip-rap\nwalls) which lies generally parallel to said most tidal wetland landward\nboundary and which is a minimum of 100 feet in length as measured generally\nparallel to such most landward boundary, but not including individual buildings\n(see figure 2); or\n(iii)\nto the\nelevation contour of 10 feet above mean sea level, except when such contour\ncrosses the seaward face of a bluff or cliff, or crosses a hill on which the\nslope equals or exceeds the natural angle of repose of the soil, then to the\ntopographic crest of such bluff, cliff, or hill (see figures 3 and 4). Pending\nthe determination by the commissioner in a particular case, the most recent, as\nof the effective date of this Part, topographical maps published by the United\n\nStates geological survey, Department of the Interior, having a scale of\n1:24,000, shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of such 10 foot\nelevation. (2)\n\nAdjacent\narea shall not include any area lying landward of an imaginary line drawn\nbetween the seaward edges of two existing (i.e., as of August 20, 1977)\nsubstantial fabricated structures which constitute the landward limit of an\nadjacent area, as provided in subparagraph (ii) of this subdivision, where the\narea landward of such imaginary line does not have located thereon any such\nfabricated structures and where such imaginary line is less than 100 feet in\nlength, as measured generally parallel to the most landward limit of the tidal\nwetland involved (see figure 5). (3)\n\nWhere land lies within the boundaries of\nan adjacent area described by subparagraph (i) or subparagraph (iii) of this\nsubdivision but appears to be excluded from an adjacent area by subparagraph\n(ii) of this subdivision or paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such land shall\nbe deemed to be part of an adjacent area (see figure 6). Provided, however, that in such instances of overlap between the various provisions of this\nsubdivision the regional permit administrator may in his discretion determine\nthat said land is not an adjacent area for the purposes of this Part if factors\nare present which in his opinion justify treating such land as non-adjacent\narea in light of the provisions in subparagraph (ii) or paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision.

Species normally associated with this zone include narrow\nleaved cattail, Typha angustifolia the tall bracklish water cordgrasses, Spartina pectinata and/or S. cynosuroides; and the more typically emergent\nfresh water species such as arrow arum, Peltandra; pickerel weed, Pondederia; and cutgrass, Leersia. (2)\n\nIntertidal marsh. The vegetated tidal wetland zone, designated IM on an\ninventory map, lying generally between average high and low tidal elevation. The predominant vegetation in this zone is low marsh cordgrass, Spartina\nalterniflora. (3)\n\nCoastal shoals, bars and flats. The tidal wetland zone, designated SM on an inventory map, that\n(i) at high tide is covered by water, (ii) at low tide is exposed or is covered\nby water to a maximum depth of approximately one foot, and (iii) is not\nvegetated by low marsh cordgrass, Spartina alterniflora, except as otherwise\ndetermined in a specific case as provided in section\n661.16\nof this Part. (4)\n\nLittoral zone. The tidal wetlands zone, designated LZ on an inventory map, that includes all lands under tidal waters\nwhich are not included in any other category, except as otherwise determined in\na specific case as provided in section\n661.16\nof this Part. Provided, there shall be no littoral zone under waters deeper than six feet at mean low\nwater. Pending determination by the commissioner in a particular case, the most\nrecent, as of the effective date of this Part, national ocean survey maps\npublished by the national ocean survey, national oceanic and atmospheric\nadministration shall be rebuttable presumptive evidence of such six foot\ndepth. (5)\n\nHigh marsh or salt\nmeadow. The normal uppermost tidal wetland zone, designated HM on an inventory\nmap, usually dominated by salt meadow grass, Spartina patens;and spike grass, Distichlis spicata. This zone is periodically flooded by spring and storm tides\nand is often vegetated by low vigor, Spartina alterniflora and Seaside\nlavender, Limonium carolinianum. Upper limits of this zone often include black\ngrass, Juncus Gerardi; chairmaker's rush, Scirpus sp; marsh elder, Iva\nfrutescens; and groundsel bush, Baccharis halimifolia. (6)\n\nFormerly connected tidal wetlands. The\ntidal wetlands zone, designated FC on an inventory map, in which normal tidal\nflow is restricted by man-made causes. Typical tidal wetland plant species may\nexist in such areas although they may be infiltrated with common reed, Phragmites sp. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
