  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.1 - Authority, intent and purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This Part is adopted pursuant to sections\n3-0301 (1)(b) (2)(m)\nand\n8-0113\nof the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw to implement the provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act\n(SEQR). (b) In adopting SEQR, it\nwas the Legislature's intention that all agencies conduct their affairs with an\nawareness that they are stewards of the air, water, land and living resources, and that they have an obligation to protect the environment for the use and\nenjoyment of this and all future generations. (c) The basic purpose of SEQR is to\nincorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the existing\nplanning, review and decision-making processes of state, regional and local\ngovernment agencies at the earliest possible time. To accomplish this goal, SEQR requires that all agencies determine whether the actions they directly\nundertake, fund or approve may have a significant impact on the environment, and, if it is determined that the action may have a significant adverse impact, prepare or request an environmental impact statement. (d) It was the intention of the Legislature\nthat the protection and enhancement of the environment, human and community\nresources should be given appropriate weight with social and economic\nconsiderations in determining public policy, and that those factors be\nconsidered together in reaching decisions on proposed activities. Accordingly, it is the intention of this Part that a suitable balance of social, economic\nand environmental factors be incorporated into the planning and decision-making\nprocesses of state, regional and local agencies. It is not the intention of\nSEQR that environmental factors be the sole consideration in\ndecision-making. (e) This Part is\nintended to provide a statewide regulatory framework for the implementation of\nSEQR by all state and local agencies. It includes: (1)\nprocedural requirements for compliance\nwith the law; (2)\nprovisions for\ncoordinating multiple agency environmental reviews through a single lead agency\n(section\n617.6\nof this Part); (3)\ncriteria to\ndetermine whether a proposed action may have a significant adverse impact on\nthe environment (section\n617.7\nof\nthis Part); (4)\nmodel environmental\nassessment forms to aid in determining whether an action may have a significant\nadverse impact on the environment (appendices A and B of section\n617.20\nof this Part); and (5) examples of actions and classes of actions which are likely to require\nan EIS (section\n617.4\nof this\n\nPart), and those which will not require an EIS (section\n617.5\nof this\n\nPart).
