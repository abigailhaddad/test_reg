  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 645-5.6 - Determination to conduct a public hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After the permit application for a\nproject is complete and following the close of the public comment period, if\nrequired, the commission shall evaluate the application and any comments\nreceived on it to determine whether a public hearing should be held. If a\nhearing should be held, the applicant and all persons who have filed comments\nshall be notified by mail. The determination to hold a hearing shall be based\nupon: whether, in the commission's judgment, the application or public comments\nraise substantive and significant issues relating to any findings or\ndeterminations the commission is required to make pursuant to the ECL, article\n43 or 71, title 33, or rules or regulations promulgated thereunder, including\nthe reasonable likelihood that a permit applied for will be denied or can be\ngranted only with major modifications to the project because the project, as\nproposed, may not meet statutory or regulatory criteria or standards. Where any\ncomments received from members of the public or otherwise raise substantive and\nsignificant issues relating to the application, and the resolution of any such\nissue may result in denial of the permit application, or the imposition of\nsignificant conditions thereon, the commission shall hold a public hearing on\nthe application. (b) Mere\nexpressions of general opposition to a project are insufficient grounds for\nholding a public hearing on a permit application. In order to raise substantive\nand significant issues, written comments expressing objection or opposition to\nan application must explain the basis of that opposition and identify the\nspecific grounds which could lead the commission to deny or impose significant\nconditions on the permit. (c) The\ncommission will not usually require public hearings in connection with\napplications for minor projects, as defined in section\n645-5.3\nof this Subpart. If a permit for a minor project or any project that was not\nsubject to a public hearing is denied, or is issued with significant conditions\nattached, the applicant may request that a public hearing be held. Such a\nrequest must be made within 15 calendar days of the date of denial or issuance\nof the permit with conditions. (d) The hearing shall be held in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 645- 6\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n645-5.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
