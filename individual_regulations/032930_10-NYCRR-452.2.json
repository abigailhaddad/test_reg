  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 452.2 - Basic concepts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Accounting\nentity. A fundamental accounting concept is that of the accounting entity or\nunit. For the purposes of this Article, a residential health care facility is\npresumed to be an accounting entity, the boundaries of which may not be the\nsame as those of the legal entity. The residential health care facility is the\nprimary unit for which the accounting records are maintained. (b) Going concern. An accounting entity is\nviewed as continuing in operation in the absence of evidence to the contrary. The results of operation of an accounting entity are recognized and measured\nbased on this concept. (c) Reporting period. The economic activities of an accounting entity are measured\nand accounted for in incremental time periods that are shorter than the life of\nthe entity. The basic reporting period for this Article is one year, commencing\non January 1st and ending on December 31st of each year. (d) Substance over form. Financial accounting\nis concerned with the economic substance of transactions rather than the legal\nform of such transactions. Generally, economic substance agrees with legal\nform. However, in those instances where substance and form differ, the\nfinancial treatment for such transactions should be accounted for based on\ntheir economic substance to provide more meaningful information of the economic\nactivities of the accounting entity. (e) Consistency. Consistency refers to\ncontinued uniformity, during a period and from one period to another, in\nmethods of accounting, mainly in valuation bases and methods of accrual, as\nreflected in the financial statements of an accounting entity. However, consistency does not require continued adherence to a method or procedure that\nis incorrect or no longer useful, nor does it preclude a justifiable and\ndesirable change in accounting and reporting methods or procedures. (f) Materiality. Materiality is an elusive\nconcept, with the dividing line between material and immaterial amounts subject\nto various interpretations. It is clear, however, that an amount is material if\nits exclusion from the financial statements would cause misleading or incorrect\nconclusions to be drawn by users of the statements. (g) Functional vs. responsibility accounting. (1)\n\nNormally, financial data is accumulated\nfor operating departments that are identified with specific managerial\nresponsibility. This information provides management with the tools necessary\nto evaluate the performance of various departments. Recording and reporting\nfinancial data in this manner is known as responsibility accounting. (2)\n\nFunctional accounting is the process of\nrecording and reporting revenues and expenses on the basis of activities\nperformed without regard to organizational framework. Thus, costs related to a\nspecific activity, normally charged to the organizational unit (department)\nresponsible for that activity, would instead be charged to the cost center\nwhose function is to perform the activity. (3)\n\nSince facilities vary in basic\norganizational structure and the way responsibilities are organized within\ndepartments, this Article mandates reporting on a functional basis in\naccordance with defined activities of each department to achieve a level of\ncompatibility. (h) Objective evidence. (1)\n\nInformation produced\nby the accounting process should be based, to the extent possible, on\nobjectively determined facts. A record of an addition to inventory, for\nexample, should be supported by properly executed business documents such as\nthe purchase order, the receiving report, the supplier's invoice, and the check\nissued in payment of the invoice. Such documents serve as objective evidence of\nthe transaction, and permit reliable determination of the cost of the asset, the amount of the liability, and the appropriateness of the resulting cash\ndisbursement. Retention of these documents for a suitable period makes it\npossible to verify data in the accounting records. (2)\n\nThe requirement of objective evidence, however, cannot always be met by financial data in accounting reports. Although\nvarious computations and analyses can provide some evidence, it is often\nnecessary to make estimates. Determination of depreciation and anticipated bad\ndebts, for example, are based to a large extent on past experience and expected\nfuture conditions. In those instances requiring estimates, the judgment of the\naccountant and of management must be exercised. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
