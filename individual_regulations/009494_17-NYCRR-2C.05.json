  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.05 - Placement of Warning Signs\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE the entire section, including Table\n2C-4. INSERT Table NY2C-4 and the following\nparagraphs: Standard: 00A All references to \"Table 2C-4\" in the MUTCD shall\nbe understood to actually refer to Table NY2C-4. Support: 00B For information on placement of warning signs, see\n\nSections\n2A.16\nto 2A.21. 00C The time needed for detection, recognition, decision, and reaction is called the Perception-Response Time (PRT). 00D Table NY2C-4 lists suggested sign placement distances\nfor three conditions; these values are based on essentially level approaches. The distances shown in Table NY2C-4 can be adjusted for roadway features, other\nsigning, and to improve visibility. Support: 00E Condition C in Table NY2C-4 comprises the distances\nassociated with Condition B with an advisory speed equal to the posted or\n85\nth\n-percentile speed. (e.g., The Condition C\ndistance for 40 mph is 150 ft.)\n\nGuidance: 00F\nWarning signs should be placed so that they\nprovide an adequate PRT. The distances contained in Table NY2C-4 should be used\nas guides in determining advance posting distances, and should be applied with\nengineering judgment. Warning signs should not be placed too far in advance of\nthe condition, such that drivers might tend to forget the warning because of\nother driving distractions, especially in urban areas. 00G\nWarning signs that advise road users about\nconditions that will likely not require a reduction in speed should be placed\nin accordance with Condition C distances. 00H\nWarning signs that advise road users about\nconditions that are not related to a specific location, such as Deer Crossing\nor SOFT SHOULDER, should be installed in an appropriate location, based on\nengineering judgment, since they are not covered by Table\nNY2C-4. 00I\nThe values shown in Table NY2C-4 should be\nsuitably increased on downgrade approaches to accommodate the greater\ndeceleration distances involved. For moderate downgrades (generally five to\neight percent), the values should be increased about 25 percent, and for\nsteeper downgrades (more than eight percent), they should be increased about 50\npercent. Option: 00J On steep upgrades (more than eight percent), the values\nmay be decreased approximately 20 percent. 00K Estimated grades and 85\nth\npercentile approach speeds are usually sufficient, and may be used in\ndetermining advance posting distances. Guidance: 00L\nMinimum spacing between warning signs with\ndifferent messages should be based on the estimated PRT for driver\ncomprehension of, and reaction to, the second sign. 00M\nThe effectiveness of the placement of warning\nsigns should be periodically evaluated under both day and night\nconditions.

Typical signs are Merge and Right Lane Ends. The\ndistances are taken from the 2004 AASHTO Policy, Exhibit 3-3, Decision Sight\n\nDistance, Avoidance Maneuver E. 3 Typical condition is the warning of a potential stop\nsituation. Typical signs are Stop Ahead, Yield Ahead, Signal Ahead, and\n\nIntersection Warning signs. The distances are taken from the 2004 AASHTO\nPolicy, Stopping Sight Distance, Exhibit 3-1. 4 Typical conditions are locations where the road user must\ndecrease speed to maneuver through the warned condition. Typical signs are\n\nTurn, Curve, Reverse Turn, or Reverse Curve. The distances are determined by\nproviding a 2.5 second PRT and a vehicle deceleration rate of 10\nft/second\n2. 5 Typical signs are Added Lane, Road Narrows, Divided\n\nHighway, and Condition B signs displayed without an advisory\nspeed. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.05\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
