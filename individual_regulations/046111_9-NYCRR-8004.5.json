  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8004.5 - Parole Warrant for Retaking and Temporary Detention\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a parole\nofficer having charge of a releasee shall have probable cause to believe that\nsuch person has violated one or more of the conditions of his release in an\nimportant respect, the officer shall report such fact to a member of the Board, or a designated officer identified in section\n8004.2\nof this Part. (b) Subject to further provisions and\nrestrictions of this Part, the member or designated officer may issue a parole\nwarrant, which is a warrant for the retaking and temporary detention of the\nreleasee. No officer shall issue a warrant in a case where they are the one who\nfurnishes the report upon which it is based, including those cases wherein a\nnotice of violation had first been issued. Nothing in this section shall be\nconstrued as prohibiting the issuance of a warrant upon a non-written report to\na member or a designated officer in exigent circumstances. (c) A warrant issued in accordance with\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section may be issued at any time, including\nduring the pendency of a parole revocation case and prior to any scheduled\nfinal revocation hearing. (d) The\nwarrant may be executed by any parole officer, any officer authorized to serve\ncriminal process or any peace officer. (e) Such officer shall be authorized to take\nthe releasee and have them detained in any jail, penitentiary, lockup or\ndetention pen which shall be located, insofar as practicable, in the county or\ncity in which the arrest occurred or within the county in which the violations\nare alleged to have occurred. Said detention pursuant to the warrant shall be\nuntil the department's reasonable receipt of a court determination following a\nrecognizance hearing under the Executive Law and, unless such hearing results\nin a lawful order directing the release of the alleged violator as to the\nwarrant, during the pendency of the revocation proceedings until and as\nconsistent with a decision concluding the revocation case issued pursuant to\nthe authority of the board. Furthermore: (1)\n\nWhere there are one or more violations charges involving conduct that would\nconstitute a new felony or misdemeanor offense, detention is also authorized\nuntil conclusion of a proceeding pursuant to Article 530 of the Criminal\n\nProcedure Law wherein recognizance with respect to the parole revocation case\nmay be determined. The recognizance hearing on the warrant shall not be joined\nwith a Criminal Procedure Law Article 530 proceeding where the warrant had been\nissued for a violation that was already the subject of a court order pursuant\nto such a proceeding. (2)\n\nWhere a\ncourt conducting a recognizance hearing ordered release, and one or more\nviolations are alleged to have occurred subsequent to that hearing or which\noccurred prior to such hearing but that the Department was unaware of at the\ntime of such hearing, the parole warrant pursuant to this section will\nauthorize detention until the conclusion of the parole revocation case, or\nuntil a recognizance court hears the matter again if it had so directed, provided: (i) where the violation(s) occurred\nsubsequent to the recognizance hearing, the conduct is alleged to have violated\na condition of the recognizance court's order or its instructions that there be\nno further violations of the conditions of the Board or Department; or\n(ii)\nwhere the violation(s)\noccurred subsequent to the recognizance hearing, the conduct would\nindependently provide basis for the issuance of a parole warrant, including, but not limited to conduct such as absconding or the commission of a\nmisdemeanor or felony; or\n(iii)\nwhere the violation(s) occurred subsequent to the recognizance hearing, the\nconduct constituted a failure to appear for a parole revocation proceeding\nhearing or appearance; or\n(iv)\nwhere the violation(s) occurred prior to the recognizance hearing but the\n\nDepartment was unaware of the conduct at the time of such hearing, the conduct\nis of such a character or quantity as to be substantially likely, if the\nrecognizance court had been aware of it at the time of the recognizance\nhearing, to have led it to conclude that the releasee presents a substantial\nrisk of willfully failing to appear at any revocation proceeding and no\nnon-monetary conditions in the community could reasonably assure the releasee's\nappearance at such revocation proceedings. In such instance, the recognizance\ncourt shall be promptly informed of the relevant conduct and any retaking\npursuant to the warrant. (3)\n\nIn the event there exist violations of\nthe type specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision the Department is not\nrequired to again take the releasee into custody under the same warrant and/or\nas may be related to the same revocation case, and the Department is not\nprecluded by this subdivision from instead charging such violations in a parole\nrevocation case subsequent to the conclusion of the current case, except that\nthe Department may not request cancellation of the current case solely for\npurposes of pursuing such specified charges in a new revocation case. (4)\n\nWhere reincarceration has been imposed at\nthe conclusion of a final parole revocation hearing, further detention pursuant\nto such warrant and consistent with the revocation decision is\nauthorized. (f) There\nshall be a presumption that the execution of a parole warrant occurs when the\nreleasee is known to be detained exclusively under the authority of such\nwarrant prior to a recognizance hearing, and that the revocation process will\ncontinue in accordance with further provisions in this Part and Part 8005 of\nthis Title following such hearing. (g) The issuance of a parole warrant and\ndetention under its authority shall be a severable issue from the legality of a\nparole revocation case, its continuation, or any final determinations\ntherefrom. (h) Every parole warrant\nshould include, among other information, the following or a similar\nnotification: \"Attention: The Department of Corrections and Community\n\nSupervision is a required party to, and intends to appear at, any recognizance\nhearing to determine continued custody of the subject releasee for purposes of\nparole revocation proceedings. Following the conclusion of the recognizance\nhearing, the Department must be promptly provided the court's order\ntherefrom.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
