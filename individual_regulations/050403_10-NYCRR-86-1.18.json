  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 86-1.18 - Service intensity weights (SIW) and average length-of-stay (LOS)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The table of SIWs and statewide average LOS for each effective period is published on the New York State Department of Health website at: http://www.health.state.ny.us/and reflects the cost weights and LOS assigned to each all-patient refined (APR) diagnosis related group (DRG) patient classification category. The SIWs assigned to each APR/DRG indicates the relative cost variance of that APR/DRG classification from the average cost of all inpatients in all APR/DRGs. Such SIWs are developed using three years of Medicaid fee-for-service cost data, Medicaid managed care data and commercial third party payor data as reported to the Statewide Planning and Research Cooperative System (SPARCS) for the years set forth in subdivision (b) of this section. Costs associated with hospitals that do not have an ancillary charge structure or associated with hospitals and services exempt from the case payment methodology, and costs associated with statistical outliers are excluded from the SIW calculations. (b) For periods on and after December 1, 2009, the SIW and statewide average LOS table shall be computed using SPARCS and reported cost data from the 2005, 2006 and 2007 calendar years as submitted to the department by September 30, 2009. (c) For periods on and after January 1, 2011, the SIW and statewide average LOS table shall be computed using SPARCS and reported cost data from the 2006, 2007 and 2008 calendar years as submitted to the department by June 30,2010. (d) For each calendar year thereafter, the SIW and statewide average LOS table shall be updated by dropping the earliest year of SPARCS data and including the next subsequent calendar year data as submitted to the department by September 30th of the year prior to the rate year. (e) For the period beginning January 1, 2014 and ending, at the discretion of the commissioner, no sooner than April 1, 2014, but no later than July 1, 2014, the SIWs and statewide average LOS utilized for the 2013 calendar year will be utilized by the department.
