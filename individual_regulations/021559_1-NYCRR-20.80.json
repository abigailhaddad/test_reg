  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 20.80 - Time and rate of payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) On\nor before the last day of the month, each handler shall make payment to each\nproducer for milk received from such producer during the first 15 days of the\nmonth at not less than the lowest class price for the preceding\nmonth. (b) On or before the 20th\nday of the month, each handler shall make payment, pursuant to subdivisions\n(c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) of this section, to each producer for the balance\ndue for all milk received from such producer during the preceding month at not\nless than the uniform price for such month, subject to the following\nadjustments: (1)\nappropriate differentials\nset forth in sections\n20.81\nand\n20.82\nof this Part; (2)\nproper deductions for the month that were\nauthorized in writing by producers from whom the handler received milk (except\nas specified in paragraph [a][3] of this section); (3)\nfor milk received in a bulk tank unit and\nfor which transportation was provided by the handler or at his expense, there\nmay be deducted, as proper and as authorized in writing by the producer, or by\na cooperative association authorized to act on behalf of such producer, a tank\ntruck service (transportation) charge. This charge may include any\nfarm-to-first-plant transportation costs for which the handler was not\nreimbursed through the transportation credit pursuant to section\n20.55\nof this Part, but such charge\nshall be reduced by the amount that the class use location value of milk at the\nplant of first receipt exceeds its class use location value where the milk was\naccounted for as a receipt in the bulk tank unit from which the milk was\ntransferred. Any such deduction, plus the transportation credit, and plus the\namount of the increase in class use location value of the milk at the plant\ncompared to the unit, shall not exceed the actual transportation costs\nincurred. Any such deduction must be made by the handler not later than the\ndate on which the producer is required to be paid for such milk. If\nauthorization for such deduction is canceled by the producer or by the\ncooperative by notifying the handler in writing, such cancellation shall be\neffective on the first day of the month following its receipt by the handler; and\n(4)\nfor pool milk delivered\ndirectly, from a farm to a pool plant or a partial pool plant, that was not put\ninto a tank truck prior to such delivery, the handler shall pay to the producer\nan additional amount computed by multiplying the quantity of such milk by a\nrate per hundredweight that is equal to the rate specified in section\n20.55\nof this Part. (c) Upon receipt of a written\nrequest from a cooperative association which the market administrator\ndetermines is authorized by its producer-members to collect payment for their\nmilk, each handler, or before two days before payments are due to individual\nproducers if paid by check, or the same day such payments are due to individual\nproducers if paid in cash or cash equivalent, shall pay the cooperative\nassociation for milk received during the month from the producer-members of\nsuch association, an amount equal to not less than the total amount otherwise\ndue such producer-members as determined pursuant to subdivisions (a) and (b) of\nthis section. (d) Each handler\nwhich is also a cooperative marketing association, determined by the Secretary\nto be qualified under the Capper-Volstead Act with respect to producers who are\nmembers of and under contract with such association, may make distribution, in\naccordance with the contract between the association and such members, of the\nnet proceeds of all its sales in all markets in all use\nclassifications. (e) Whenever\nverification by the market administrator of the payment to any producer or\ncooperative association of producers for milk delivered to any handler\ndiscloses payment of less than is required by this Part, the handler shall make\nup such payment to the producer or cooperative association of producers not\nlater than the time of making payment next following such disclosure. (f) If a handler claims that he cannot make\nthe required payment because the producer is deceased or cannot be located, or\nbecause the cooperative association or its lawful successor or assignee is no\nlonger in existence, such payment shall be made to the producer settlement\nfund, and in the event that the handler subsequently locates and pays the\nproducer or a lawful claimant, or in the event that the handler no longer\nexists and a lawful claim is later established, the market administrator shall\nmake such payment from the producer settlement fund to the handler or to the\nlawful claimant as the case may be. (g) If not later than the date when such\npayment is required to be made, legal proceedings have been instituted by the\nhandler for the purpose of administrative or judicial review of the market\nadministrator's findings upon verification as provided above, such payment\nshall be made to the producer settlement fund and shall be held in reserve\nuntil such time as the above-mentioned proceedings have been completed or until\nthe handler submits proof to the market administrator that the required payment\nhas been made to the producer or association of producers, in which latter\nevent the payment shall be refunded to the handler.
