  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 559.3 - Reporting requirements: initial testing and records maintenance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After\ncompletion of and after cleanup or stimulation, but before placing the well on\nproduction, the operator of a \"Bass Island\" well must measure initial bottom\nhole pressure. The operator must do this by shutting-in the well for a minimum\nof 72 hours and then obtaining a bottom hole pressure, using best efforts to\nobtain that pressure by running a pressure bomb as close to the midpoint of the\nproduction zone as prudent practices indicate, making gradient stops 1,000 feet\nand 500 feet above that point of sufficient duration to record the pressures at\neach of those levels. In instances where wellbore conditions and/or equipment\nwould make the use of a pressure bomb imprudent, the operator must determine a\nbottom hole pressure by calculations based upon a dead-weighted surface\npressure and measurement of any liquid level in the wellbore. (b) (1)\n\nThe\noperator of a \"Bass Island\" well must calculate the gas-oil ratio based on\nactual production for the first seven days the well is on production and report\nthe results of those calculations to the department on a form the department\nprescribes within 30 days of the end of the seven-day production\nperiod. (2)\n\nThe operator of a \"Bass\n\nIsland\" well must measure by means of a chart recording device all gas\nseparated, and must certify to the department the accuracy of those results and\nthe gas-oil ratio determined under paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If gas is\nnot measured in the final stage of separation, the gas volume in the gas-oil\nratio calculation must include an estimate of the gas left in solution after\nthe last stage where measurement occurred. (3)\n\nThe operator must have available for\ndepartment inspection the charts used in the gas-oil ratio calculation for no\nless than three years after the charts were made. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n559.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
