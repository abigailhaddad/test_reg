  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 47.4 - Construction and material\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Splash guards shall be designed and\nconstructed so that they will, by baffle or construction, bar water and road\nsurface substances from being thrown by the rearmost wheels beyond the extreme\nrear of the vehicle or combination of vehicles and shall also be designed, constructed or attached in a manner so as to minimize side spray from the\nsplash guard. Such splash guards should be mounted as far to the rear of the\nvehicle as possible in order to minimize such side spray, but in any event they\nmust meet the specifications set forth in section\n47.3\nof this Part. (b) Any material used in a splash guard shall\nbe of a substantial nature. If metal is used in such construction the splash\nguard must either be positioned in such a manner as to direct solids toward the\nground or should be coated with a soft substance so as to prevent solid\nmaterial from being deflected to the side of the vehicle. (c) If the splash guard is constructed of a\nflexible material it must, nevertheless, have a fair degree of rigidity. Every\nsplash guard shall be constructed of a material of sufficient rigidity that it\nwill retain its protective position at normal vehicle speed. (d) A splash guard conforming to the contour\nof the wheel and tire, and meeting the specifications set forth in section\n47.3\nof this Part will satisfy the\nrequirements of this Part, but such a contour guard is not required. (e) Splash guards must be attached to the\nvehicle in a secure manner and some means must be provided to prevent the\nsplash guard from wearing unduly at the points at which the guard is fastened\nto the vehicle. (f) Splash guards\nmay be constructed of a perforated material provided they otherwise comply with\nthe requirements of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n47.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
