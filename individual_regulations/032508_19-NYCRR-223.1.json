  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 223.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn the event of a conflict between the meaning of a term\nappearing in this section and the use of such term in the material incorporated\nby reference, the definition provided in this section shall prevail. (a) Construct means the building of a new\nplayground or the building or replacement of major types of playground\nequipment within a preexisting playground or the modification of major types of\nplayground equipment within a preexisting playground. This definition shall not\ninclude routine maintenance on playground equipment. (b) Playground means equipment, related\nstructures, surfacing, fencing, signs, internal pathways, land forms and\nvegetation for the use of six or more children. For purposes of this Part, playground does not include areas on one-, two- or three-family residential\nproperties or areas intended to serve as athletic fields or athletic\ncourts. This Part focuses on the implementation of standards to help\nreduce occurrences of children falling from playground equipment. Please note\nthat the publication incorporated by reference into section\n223.2\nof this Part, which has the\nsame force and effect of rule text printed in NYCRR, does not discuss other\npotential playground risks, such as potential injuries that may be associated\nwith exposure to, or ingestion of, surfacing material. Since many factors may\naffect playground safety, the New York State Division of Consumer Protection\ndoes not endorse the standards contained in the incorporated publication as the\nsole method of minimizing playground-related injuries.
