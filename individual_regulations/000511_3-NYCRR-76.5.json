  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 76.5 - Community reinvestment act assessments; public disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) From time to\ntime, as determined by the superintendent, the Banking Department will conduct\ncommunity reinvestment evaluations of each banking institution to which this\n\nPart applies. To the extent feasible, such evaluations will occur with the same\nfrequency as, and coincide with, CRA examinations conducted by a banking\ninstitution's primary Federal regulator. In general, the Banking Department\nwill evaluate the CRA performance of a banking institution once every 24 to 36\nmonths; except that banking institutions with total assets below $250 million\nand rated \"satisfactory\" or \"outstanding\" in their most recent CRA examination\nperformed by the Banking Department generally will be examined once every 48 to\n60 months, respectively. The assessment will be based upon information compiled\nby the Banking Department or obtained from other sources, including information\nobtained from other State and Federal banking regulators. This information will\npertain to the factors set forth in section\n28-b\nof the\n\nBanking Law and the performance tests and standards set forth in section\n76.7\nof this Part. The Banking\n\nDepartment assigns a rating for a banking institution assessed under the\nfactors set forth in Banking Law, section 28-b and the tests set forth in\nsection\n76.7\nof this Part. The lending, investment and service performance for each banking institution evaluated under\nsection\n76.7\n(a)(1)\nof this\n\nPart shall be assigned one of the five following ratings: outstanding, high\nsatisfactory, low satisfactory, needs to improve or substantial noncompliance. A banking institution's performance need not fit each aspect of a particular\nrating profile in order to receive that rating, and exceptionally strong\nperformance with respect to some aspects may compensate for weak performance in\nothers. The banking institution's overall performance, however, must be\nconsistent with safe and sound banking practices and generally with the\nappropriate rating profile. The Banking Department assessment shall form the\nbasis of the biennial numerical CRA rating based on a 1-4 scoring system\nassigned to each such institution by the Banking Department. Specifically, such\nnumerical scores shall represent performance assessments as follows: -outstanding record of meeting community credit needs\n(\"Outstanding\" or \"1\"); -satisfactory record of meeting community credit needs\n(\"Satisfactory\" or \"2\"); -needs to improve record of meeting community credit needs\n(\"Needs to Improve\" or \"3\"); and\n-substantial noncompliance in meeting community credit needs\n(\"Substantial Noncompliance\" or \"4\"). (b) Evidence of discriminatory or other\nillegal credit practices. (1)\n\nThe Banking\n\nDepartment's evaluation of a banking institution's CRA performance is adversely\naffected by evidence of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices in any\ngeography by the banking institution or in any assessment area by any affiliate\nwhose loans have been considered as part of the banking institution's lending\nperformance. In connection with any type of lending activity described in\nsection\n76.8\n(a) of this\n\nPart, evidence of discriminatory or other credit practices that violate an\napplicable law, rule or regulation includes, but is not limited to: (i) discrimination against applicants on a\nprohibited basis in violation, for example, of section 296-a of the New York\n\nState Executive Law, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act or the Fair Housing\n\nAct; (ii)\nviolations of either\nsection\n6-l\nof the Banking\n\nLaw or the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act; (iii)\nviolations of section 5 of the Federal\n\nTrade Commission Act; (iv)\nviolations of section 8 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act; and\n(v) violations of the Truth in\n\nLending Act provisions regarding a consumer's right of rescission. (2)\n\nIn determining the effect of\nevidence of practices described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision on the\nbanking institution's assigned rating, the Banking Department considers the\nnature, extent, and strength of the evidence of the practices; the policies and\nprocedures that the banking institution (or affiliate, as applicable) has in\nplace to prevent the practices; any corrective action that the banking\ninstitution (or affiliate, as applicable) has taken or has committed to take, including voluntary corrective action resulting from self-assessment; and other\nrelevant information. (c) The Banking Department will prepare a\nwritten summary of the results of such assessment. The CRA rating and the\nwritten summary will be made available to the public. In addition, each banking\ninstitution shall include a copy of such rating and the three most recent\nsummaries in the banking institution's public file as required to be maintained\nby Federal CRA regulations.
