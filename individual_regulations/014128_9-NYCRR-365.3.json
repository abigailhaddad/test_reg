  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 365.3 - Statement of purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 568 of the Laws of 2008 requires the Division of Parole (DOP), the\n\nDivision of Probation and Correctional Alternatives (DPCA), and the Office of\n\nTemporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA) to promulgate regulations to provide\nguidance concerning the placement and/or approval of housing for certain sex\noffenders. (b) The State has\npreviously enacted laws concerning sex offenders, including the Sex Offender\n\nRegistration Act, the Sex Offender Management and Treatment Act, the Electronic\n\nSecurity and Targeting of On-Line Predators Act (e-STOP) and laws restricting\ncertain sex offenders who are under probation or parole supervision from\nentering school grounds. Chapter 568 of the Laws of 2008 continues the State's\nefforts in the area of sex offender management and specifically in the area of\nthe placement and housing of sex offenders. Sex offender management, and the\nplacement of housing of sex offenders, are areas that have been, and will\ncontinue to be, matters addressed by the State. These regulations further the\n\nState's coordinated and comprehensive policies in these areas, and are intended\nto provide further guidance to relevant State and local agencies in applying\nthe State's approach. (c) Public\nsafety is a primary concern and these regulations are intended to better\nprotect children, vulnerable populations and the general public from sex\noffenders. The State's coordinated and comprehensive approach also recognizes\nthe necessity to provide emergency shelter to individuals in need, including\nthose who are sex offenders, and the importance of stable housing and support\nin allowing offenders to live in and re-enter the community and become\nlaw-abiding and productive citizens. These regulations are based upon, and are\nintended to further best practices and effective strategies to achieve these\ngoals. (d) In implementing this\nstatute and the State's comprehensive approach, DOP, DPCA, OTDA and the\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services' Office of Sex Offender Management\n(DCJS/OSOM) recognize that: (1)\nnot all sex\noffenders are equally dangerous. Some sex offenders may pose a high risk of\ncommitting a new sexual crime; others may pose only a low risk; (2)\nall reasonable efforts should be made in\nto avoid an ill-advised concentration of sex offenders in certain neighborhoods\nand localities. What constitutes such a concentration will depend on many\nfactors, and may vary depending on housing availability and the locality and\ncommunity. In addition, it is sometimes safer to house sex offenders together. Law enforcement, probation, and parole officers may more effectively monitor\noffenders, and service providers may more easily offer transitional services to\noffenders in these congregate settings. Further, some social services officials\nand departments rely on congregate housing for sex offenders who seek emergency\nshelter because of the limited, or lack of other housing options available for\nthis population. All public officials who are responsible for finding or\napproving housing for sex offenders should recognize that an over-concentration\nof sex offenders may create risks and burdens on the surrounding community, and\nthat their responsibility is to make judgments that are reasonable under the\ncircumstances; (3)\nall social\nservices districts are required by statute, regulation and directive to arrange\ntemporary housing assistance for eligible homeless individuals, including those\nwho are sex offenders; (4)\nto\nreduce recidivism it is important that offenders be able to re-enter society\nand become productive and law-abiding citizens whenever possible. A stable\nliving situation and access to employment and support services are important\nfactors that can help offenders to successfully re-enter society; (5)\nmaintaining and/or finding suitable\nhousing for sex offenders is an enormous challenge that impacts all areas of\nthe State. Offenders reside in all regions of the State and may have\nlong-established residences in their respective communities. Even offenders who\ndo not have such long-established relationships are often discharged from\nprison to the community where they previously lived. As a result, it is not\nappropriate for any one community or county to bear an inappropriate burden in\nhousing sex offenders because another community has attempted to shift its\nresponsibility for those offenders onto other areas of the State. The\nproliferation of local ordinances imposing residency restrictions upon sex\noffenders, while well-intentioned, have made it more challenging for the State\nand local authorities to address the difficulties in finding secure and\nappropriate housing for sex offenders; (6)\ndecisions as to the housing and\nsupervision of sex offenders should take into account all relevant factors and\nno one factor will necessarily be dispositive. These factors should include, but not be limited to, the factors enumerated in the statute, the risk posed by\nthe offender, the nature of the underlying offense, whether housing offenders\ntogether or apart is safer and more feasible, the most effective method to\nsupervise and provide services to offenders, and the availability of\nappropriate housing, employment, treatment and support.
