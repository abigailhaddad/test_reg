(1)\n\nNo municipality, school district, person, group of persons, firm, corporation, association, organization or institution shall install or construct a spray ground, or make any addition or modification to an existing spray ground, until plans and specifications receive the approval of the permit-issuing official. All plans shall be prepared by a person licensed by the State of New York to practice engineering or architecture. The permit- issuing official may require, when granting this approval, such modifications or conditions as the public health or safety may require. (2)\n\nDesign standards for spray grounds (see section\n6-3.24\nof this Subpart) shall be the basis upon which all plans for spray grounds shall be reviewed, approved and constructed. (3)\n\nPlans for any potable water treatment or sewage treatment facilities to be constructed on-site at spray grounds shall be approved prior to construction, by the permit-issuing official or such agency having jurisdiction for such plan approval. (b) Spray grounds constructed prior to the effective date of this Subpart. (1)\n\nThe owner/ operator of a spray ground constructed prior to the effective date of this Subpart must submit a report addressing all of the design criteria specified in section\n6-3.24\nof this Subpart. This report shall be prepared by a New York State licensed professional engineer and must be submitted to the permit-issuing official at least 90 days prior to the proposed opening date. The report must evaluate the spray ground's compliance with this Subpart and identify each aspect of non-compliance and include recommendations for compliance. The permit-issuing official shall obtain the approval of the State Department of Health prior to granting or denying approval of alternative provisions recommended by the professional engineer as providing an equivalent level of protection for compliance with design criteria in section\n6-3.24\nof this Subpart. Waivers for those alternative provisions shall be issued in accordance with section\n6-3.6\n(b) of this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
