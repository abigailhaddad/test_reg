  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 262.119 - Reporting of anti-drug testing results\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each large operator (having more than 50\ncovered employees) shall submit an annual MIS report to RSPA of its anti-drug\ntesting using the management information system (MIS) form and instructions as\nrequired by 49 CFR part\n40\n(at section 40.25 and appendix H to part 40), not\nlater than March 15th of each year for the prior calendar year (January 1st\nthrough December 31st). The administrator shall require by written notice that\nsmall operators (50 or fewer covered employees) not otherwise required to\nsubmit annual MIS reports to prepare and submit such reports to RSPA. (b) Each report required under this section\nshall be submitted to the Office of Pipeline Safety, Research and Special\n\nPrograms Administration, U.S. Department of Transportation, Room 7128, 400\n\nSeventh Street, SW, Washington, DC 20590. (c) To calculate the total number of covered\nemployees eligible for random testing throughout the year, as an operator, you\nmust add the total number of covered employees eligible for testing during each\nrandom testing period for the year and divide that total by the number of\nrandom testing periods. Covered employees, and only covered employees, are to\nbe in an employer's random testing pool, and all covered employees must be in\nthe random pool. If you are an employer conducting random testing more often\nthan once per month (e.g., you select daily, weekly, bi-weekly), you do not\nneed to compute this total number of covered employees rate more than on a once\nper month basis. (d) As an\nemployer, you may use a service agent (e.g., Consortia/Third Party\n\nAdministrator (C/TPA) as defined in 49 CFR part\n40\n) to perform random\nselections for you; and your covered employees may be part of a larger random\ntesting pool of covered employees. However, you must ensure that the service\nagent you use is testing at the appropriate percentage established for your\nindustry and that only covered employees are in the random testing\npool. (e) Each operator that has a\ncovered employee who performs multi-DOT agency functions (e.g., an employee\nperforms pipeline maintenance duties and drives a commercial motor vehicle), count the employee only on the MIS report for the DOT agency under which he or\nshe is randomly tested. Normally, this will be the DOT agency under which the\nemployee performs more than 50 percent of his or her duties. Operators may have\nto explain the testing data for these employees in the event of a DOT agency\ninspection or audit. (f) A service\nagency (e.g., C/TPA) may prepare the MIS report on behalf of an operator. However, each report shall be certified by the operator's anti-drug manager or\ndesignated representative for accuracy and completeness. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
