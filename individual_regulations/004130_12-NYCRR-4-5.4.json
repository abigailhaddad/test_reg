  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.4 - Installation and replacement of safety and relief valves for low pressure boilers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Required. Such valves shall be installed or reinstalled and shall be in proper\nworking order before the boiler is placed in service. (b) Loading. No person shall in any manner\nload or excess of the maximum allowable stated on the certificate of\ninspection. (c) Connection of\nsafety valves. Safety valves shall be connected to boilers with the spindle\nvertical if possible, either directly to a tapped or flanged opening in the\nboiler, to a fitting connected to the boiler by a close nipple, to a Y-base, to\na valveless steampipe between adjacent boilers, or to a valveless header\nconnecting steam outlets on the same boiler. (d) Connection of relief valves. Relief\nvalves shall be connected to the top of boilers, with the spindle vertical if\npossible, either directly to a tapped or flanged opening in the boiler, to a\nfitting connected to the boiler by a close nipple, to a Y-base, to a valveless\nwaterpipe between adjacent boilers, or to a valveless header connecting water\noutlets on the same boiler. (e) Y-base. When a Y-base is used, the inlet area shall be not less than the\ncombined outlet areas. (f) Multiple\nvalves. When the size of the boiler requires a safety valve or relief valve\nlarger than 41/2-inch diameter, two or more valves having the required combined\ncapacity shall be used. When two or more valves are used on a boiler they may\nbe single, directly attached, or mounted on a Y-base. (g) Shutoffs. No shutoff of any description\nshall be placed between the safety or relief valve and the boiler, nor on\ndischarge pipes between such valves and the atmosphere. (h) Internal pipes. Safety and relief valves\nshall not be connected to an internal pipe in the boiler. (i) Discharge pipes. When a discharge pipe is\nused, its area shall be not less than the area of the valve or aggregate area\nbased on the nominal diameters of the valves with which it connects, and the\ndischarge pipe shall be fitted with an open drain to prevent water from lodging\nin the upper part of the valve or in the pipe. When an elbow is placed on a\nsafety valve or a relief valve discharge pipe, it shall be located close to the\nvalve outlet. The pipe shall be supported so that no undue stress is placed on\nthe valve body. (j) Scalding. The\ndischarge from safety or relief valves shall be so arranged that there will be\nno danger of scalding persons or damaging equipment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
