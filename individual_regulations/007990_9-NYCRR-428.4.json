Tit. 9 § 428.4 - Undertakings subject to review\n\nState Regulations\n(a) As early in the planning process as\npossible, and in any case prior to the preparation or approval of any final\ndesign or plan or the permitting or approval of an undertaking the APO shall\ndetermine if the undertaking is subject to review under this Part. APO's are\nstrongly encouraged to consult with the commissioner when making this\ndetermination. (b) Except as\nprovided in sections\n428.11\nthrough\n428.13\nof this Part such review is mandatory whenever it appears that any aspect of\nthe proposed undertaking may or will cause any change, beneficial or adverse, in the quality of any eligible or registered property in the project impact\narea. For purposes of this Part a change includes but is not limited to; the\nwhole or partial restoration or rehabilitation of the property, or landscape or\nimprovements to the site; any action which might lead to the destruction or\nalteration of all or part of the property; alteration of the property's\nsurrounding environment; the introduction of any visual, audible or atmospheric\nelements or any other actions which might cause or contribute to the\ndestruction, alteration or neglect of the property. (c) If it appears that any property in the\nproject impact area, including but not limited to inventoried property as\ndefined in section\n426.2\n(h) of this Title, may meet any of the criteria for listing set forth in section\n427.3\nof\nthis Title the APO shall request an eligibility determination in accordance\nwith section\n428.5\nof this Part. This request shall be made prior to or concurrently with the\nnotice and request for determination of impact made pursuant to subdivision (d)\nof this section. (d) If it is\ndetermined that an undertaking is subject to review under this Part, the APO\nshall notify the commissioner in writing and request that the impact of the\nundertaking on eligible or registered property be determined. This notice must\nlist all State agencies participating in the undertaking and review and\nindicate if a single consolidated review is being conducted pursuant to section\n428.3\nof this Part. (e) The APO shall\nprovide sufficient documentation for the commissioner to make an informed and\nreasoned determination concerning the impact of the undertaking on eligible or\nregistered property. Submission of a completed PRDS will generally be deemed\nsufficient for this purpose. However, the commissioner may determine that the\nPRDS is not adequate and require the agency to submit any additional studies or\ndocumentation deemed necessary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
