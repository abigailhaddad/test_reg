Part 361)\n\nFor each siting condition, a siting consideration weight is\nassigned which may differ from the average weight based on the nature of the\nfacility (see table 1). Within the context of reviewing the siting considerations, each criterion is evaluated separately and a numerical value assigned to it. Assignment of a value of \"1\" means that the site conforms closely with the most\ndesirable site conditions, assignment of a value of \"2\" means that the site has\nproblems but is not wholly undesirable and an assignment of a value of \"3\"\nmeans that the site is undesirable from the viewpoint of the criterion being\nevaluated. The assigned numerical value is multiplied by the percent of\nsiting consideration weight for each evaluation criterion to determine the\ncriterion score. The sum of criteria scores is then multiplied by the siting\nconsideration weight to determine the siting consideration score for each\nsiting criteria (see table 2). The procedure is repeated for each criterion. The resultant scores are then totalled to arrive at the total site score. Consult table 3 for an example of calculating the score for a siting\ncondition. TABLE 1.
