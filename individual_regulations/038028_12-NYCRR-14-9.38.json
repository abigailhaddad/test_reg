  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.38 - Method of support\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nhorizontal-return tubular boiler over 72 inches in diameter shall be supported\nfrom steel hangers by the outside-suspension type of setting, independent of\nthe boiler side walls. The hangers shall be so designed that the load is\nproperly distributed between the rivets attaching them to the shell and so that\nno more than two of these rivets come in the same longitudinal line on each\nhanger. The distance girthwise of the boiler from the centers of the bottom\nrivets to the centers of the top rivets attaching the hangers shall be not less\nthan 12 inches. The other rivets used shall be spaced evenly between these\npoints: (b) A horizontal-return\ntubular boiler, 14 feet or-more in length, or over 54 inches and up to and\nincluding 72 inches in diameter, shall be supported by the outside-suspension\ntype of setting as specified in subdivision (a) of this section, or at four\npoints by not less than eight steel or cast-iron lugs set in pairs. A\nhorizontal return tubular boiler up to and including 54 inches in diameter\nshall be supported by the outside-suspension type of setting as specified in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, or by not less than two steel or cast-iron\nlugs on each side. The distance girthwise of the boiler from the centers of the\nbottom rivets to the centers of the top rivets attaching the hangers shall be\nnot less than the square of the shell diameter divided by 675. If more than\nfour lugs are used they shall be set in four pairs, the lugs of each pair to be\nspaced not over two inches apart and the load to be equalized between them (see\n\nFigure P-46). If the boiler is supported on structural steel work, the steel\nsupporting members must be so located or insulated that heat from the furnace\ncannot impair their strength. Image\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.38\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
