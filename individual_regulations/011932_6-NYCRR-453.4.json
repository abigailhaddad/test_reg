The preferred\nmicrophone height on flat terrain is four feet (1.2 m). (b) When the sound level measurement system\nis hand-held or otherwise monitored by a person located near its microphone, the holder must orient himself relative to the highway in a manner consistent\nwith the recommendation of the manufacturer of the sound level measurement\nsystem.

If the\nmanufacturer of the system does not recommend an angle of orientation for its\nmicrophone, the microphone shall be oriented at an angle of not less than 70\ndegrees and not more than perpendicular to the horizontal plane of the test\nsite at the microphone target point. (d) The sound level measurement system shall\nbe set to the A-weighting network and \"fast\" meter response mode. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
