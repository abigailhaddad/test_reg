  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16§ 13.1 - Applicability of rules and definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding any other commission\nrules or orders to the contrary, this Part governs the rights, duties and\nobligations of every gas, electric and steam corporation or municipality\nsubject to the jurisdiction of the commission by virtue of articles 4 and 4-A\nof the Public Service Law, their nonresidential customers and the applicants\nfor such nonresidential service. (2)\n\nNothing in this Part shall modify the\ncommission's rules or orders applicable to the provision of gas, electric or\nsteam service to residential customers under Part 11 of this Title. (b) Definitions. The following\nwords and terms when used in this Part have the following meanings: (1)\nA utility is any gas corporation, electric corporation, gas and electric corporation, steam corporation or\nmunicipality; provided, however, that the term shall not include any\nmunicipality that is exempt from commission regulation by virtue of section\n1005\n(5)(g)\nof the Public Authorities\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nAn applicant is a person, corporation or other entity who has requested gas, electric or steam service as\na nonresidential customer. (3)\nA\nnonresidential customer is a person, corporation or other entity, supplied by a\nutility with gas, electric or steam service under the utility's tariff, and\npursuant to an accepted application for service, who is not a residential\ncustomer as defined in Part 11 of this Title. The word customer, when used\nalone in this Part, refers only to a nonresidential customer. (4)\nA new customer is a customer who was not\nthe last previous customer at the premises to be served, regardless of whether\nsuch customer previously was or is still a customer of the utility at a\ndifferent location. (5)\nA seasonal\ncustomer is a customer who applies for and receives utility service\nperiodically each year, intermittently during the year, or at other irregular\nintervals. (6)\nA short-term or\ntemporary customer is a customer who requested service for a period of time up\nto two years. (7)\nA demand customer\nis a customer who is billed for demand charges. (8)\n\nAn actual reading is one obtained by a\nutility employee from either the meter or a remote registration device attached\nthereto. (9)\n\nAn access controller\nis a party known to a utility to be in control of access to the metering\nequipment of a customer, and to have an active account of its own with the\nutility. (10)\nA payment is\nconsidered to be made on the date when it is received by a utility or one of\nits authorized agents. (11)\nA late\npayment is any payment made more than 20 calendar days after the date payment\nwas due. Payment is due whenever specified by a utility on its bill, provided\nsuch date does not occur before personal service of the bill or three calendar\ndays after the mailing of the bill. (12)\n\nArrears are charges for which payment\nhas not been made more than 20 calendar days after payment was due. (13)\nA delinquent customer is a customer who\nhas made a late payment on two or more occasions within the previous 12-month\nperiod. (14)\nA business day is any\n\nMonday through Friday when a utility's business offices are open. (15)\nA deferred payment agreement is a\nwritten agreement for the payment of outstanding charges over a specified\nperiod of time. It must be signed in duplicate by a utility representative and\nthe customer, and each must receive a copy, before it becomes enforceable by\neither party. (16)\nA levelized\npayment plan is a billing plan designed to reduce fluctuations in a customer's\nbill payments due to varying, but predictable patterns of\nconsumption. (17)\nA backbill is\nthat portion of any bill, other than a levelized bill, which represents charges\nnot previously billed for service that was actually delivered to the customer\nduring a period before the current billing cycle. A bill based on an actual\nreading rendered after one or more bills based on estimated or customer\nreadings (commonly called a catch-up bill), which exceeds by 50 percent or more\nthe bill that would have been rendered under a utility's standard estimation\nprogram, is presumed to be a backbill. (18)\n\nTampered equipment is any\nservice-related equipment that has been subjected either to unauthorized\ninterference so as to reduce the accuracy or eliminate the measurement of a\nutility's service, or to unauthorized connection occurring after a utility has\nphysically disconnected service. (19)\n\nUtility deficiency means any action or\ninaction by a utility or one of its authorized agents that does not\nsubstantially conform to the rules and regulations of this Title, the utility's\ntariff, or the utility's written business procedures.
