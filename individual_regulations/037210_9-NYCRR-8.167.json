  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.167 - Executive Order No. 167: Ban on Insurers that Withdraw from NY State of Health, New York's Official Health Plan Marketplace\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, the House of Representatives has recently passed\nthe American Health Care Act, which would reduce financial assistance for\nhealth insurance coverage, particularly for people with low or moderate\nincomes. WHEREAS, the American Health Care Act will be disastrous\nfor New York in that it will leave 2.7 million New Yorkers without health care\ncoverage, cut $4.7 billion from the State's Medicaid budget, put at risk 7\nmillion people who rely on Medicaid services and other programs created under\nthe Affordable Care Act, and threaten the entire New York State health care\nsystem which serves 19.5 million New Yorkers. WHEREAS, the American Health Care Act would also enable\ninsurers to charge more for people with preexisting conditions in some states, rolling back a key achievement of the Affordable Care Act, removing protections\nfor people with pre-existing conditions, and resulting in individuals paying\nhigh premiums, and forcing those who cannot afford it to lose coverage. WHEREAS, New York established NY State of Health, the\nstate's official health plan marketplace, in accordance with the Affordable\n\nCare Act to lower premiums for individuals and decrease the number of uninsured\n\nNew Yorkers. WHEREAS, since NY State of Health became operational in\n2013, the uninsured rate in New York has been cut in half from 10 percent to 5\npercent, the lowest level in decades, and the number of individuals who\npurchase insurance has increased by 270 percent. WHEREAS, 3.6 million New Yorkers, 18 percent of the State's\npopulation, are enrolled in affordable health insurance through NY State of\n\nHealth in a continuum of programs based on household income and other\neligibility criteria including Qualified Health Plans, Medicaid, the Essential\n\nPlan and Child Health Plus. WHEREAS, New Yorkers must enroll in health insurance\nthrough NY State of Health in order to receive an estimated $400 million\nannually in federal financial assistance to reduce premiums, as well as cost\nsharing credits that reduce the cost of health care services. WHEREAS, the American Health Care Act, along with\nstatements made by elected representatives in Washington, D.C., has created\nuncertainty in the health insurance market that has the potential to cause\nunnecessary price increases and other adverse impacts on New Yorkers. WHEREAS, withdrawal by insurers from the Individual\n\nMarketplace would have a significant and detrimental impact on hundreds of\nthousands of New Yorkers and is grossly irresponsible, as it puts the health of\nour most vulnerable New Yorkers at risk. WHEREAS, it is therefore critical that the State of New\n\nYork take action to ensure that New Yorkers have uninterrupted access to\naffordable health insurance coverage. NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\n\nLaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. DEFINITIONS\nA. \"Affected State Entities\" means\n(i) all agencies and departments over which\nthe Governor has executive authority, and\n(ii)\nall public-benefit corporations, public\nauthorities, boards, and commissions, for which the Governor appoints the\n\nChair, the Chief Executive, or the majority of Board Members, except for the\n\nPort Authority of New York and New Jersey. B. \"Commissioner\" means the Commissioner of\n\nHealth of the State of New York. C. \"Department\" means the Department of Health of the State of New York. D. \"Insurer\" means an insurer, and any\naffiliates of such insurer, that is licensed to write accident and health\ninsurance pursuant to Article 32 of the Insurance Law; a corporation organized\npursuant to Article 43 of the Insurance Law; or a health maintenance\norganization certified pursuant to Article 44 of the Public Health\n\nLaw. E. \"Marketplace\" means the\n\nIndividual Marketplace within NY State of Health, The Official Health Plan\n\nMarketplace located within the Department. Pursuant to the federal Patient\n\nProtection and Affordable Care Act (Affordable Care Act), the Individual\n\nMarketplace qualifies eligible individuals and families to buy affordable\nqualified health plans and access to federal financial assistance to pay for\nsuch coverage. II. PUBLICLY AVAILABLE LIST OF INSURERS\nA. The\n\nCommissioner is hereby directed to notify Marketplace insurers that on or\nbefore September 1 of each year, or an alternative date as specified by the\n\nCommissioner, each insurer intending to withdraw from the Marketplace must\nnotify the Marketplace of its intention to withdraw from offering qualified\nhealth plans on the Marketplace for the following plan year. B. Upon receipt of such notice, the\n\nCommissioner shall provide to the particular insurer written notice of the\n\nCommissioner's intent to include the insurer on a publicly available list of\ninsurers that have provided notice of their intent to withdraw from the\n\nMarketplace. Insurers shall have a period of 30 days from the receipt of the\n\nCommissioner's notice to present the Commissioner with evidence that the\ninsurer has not withdrawn from the Marketplace. C. The publicly available list of insurers\nthat have provided a notice of intent to withdraw from the Marketplace shall be\nposted on the website of the Department. Where, pursuant to Section II (B)\nabove, the Commissioner makes a good faith determination that the insurer has\nnot withdrawn from the Marketplace, the Commissioner shall not include the\ninsurer on the list. D. The\n\nCommissioner shall notify an insurer that has been included on the\n\nCommissioner's list that the insurer may request removal from the list by\nsubmitting written evidence to the Commissioner within 30 days of the\n\nCommissioner's publication of the list on the Department's website that the\ninsurer has not withdrawn from the Marketplace. If the Commissioner makes a\ngood faith determination that the insurer provides coverage on the Individual\n\nMarketplace, the Commissioner shall remove the insurer from the list. III. PROHIBITION ON CONTRACTING BY\nAFFECTED STATE ENTITIES\nAll Affected State Entities are hereby directed not to\nenter into any new contracts or extend existing contracts with any insurer that\nis included on the Commissioner's list pursuant to Section II above. IV. NO FURTHER PARTICIPATION IN\nOTHER MARKETPLACE PROGRAMS\nThe Department is hereby directed not to permit any insurer\nthat is included on the Commissioner's list pursuant to Section II above, having withdrawn from the Marketplace, from offering plans in any other program\noffered on the Marketplace, including Medicaid, Child Health Plus, and the\n\nEssential Plan. V. COMMISSIONER'S DISCRETION\nNotwithstanding Sections III and IV above, Affected State\n\nEntities and the Marketplace may enter into or extend a contract for services\nwith an insurer on the Commissioner's list but only when the head of the\n\nAffected State Entity or Marketplace makes a written determination that the\nservices to be provided by such insurer are necessary to the performance of an\nessential state function and that such contract is otherwise in the best\ninterests of the State. Such written determination shall be provided to the\n\nSecretary to the Governor and the Counsel to the Governor not fewer than 10\ndays prior to the date that the Affected State Entity or the Marketplace enters\ninto or extends such contract. FURTHER, this Order shall take effect\nimmediately. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n8.167\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
