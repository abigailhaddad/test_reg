(b) Each insurer shall file with its annual statement to this department a certificate of compliance executed by an authorized officer of the insurer wherein it is stated that to the best of such officer's knowledge, the preliminary information forms, policy benefit summaries, and sales illustrations disseminated by the insurer during the preceding statement year complied or were made to comply in all respects with the provisions of this Part.
