  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 4-5.17 - High limit controls\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Application of this section. This section shall apply only to low pressure\nautomatically fired heating system boilers installed after March 31, 1965. Heat\ngenerating apparatus shall be regarded as a new installation and subject to all\napplicable provisions relating to installations made after March 31, 1965\nwhenever both an existing burner and controls are replaced by a new burner and\ncontrols. (b) Hot water boilers. In\naddition to the operating limit control, each hot water boiler shall be\nprovided with a high limit temperature-actuated control which by interruption\nof an electrical circuit will automatically stop the heat generating apparatus\nif the temperature of the water at or near the boiler outlet rises to 30\ndegrees Fahrenheit above the maximum allowable working temperature of the\nboiler. (c) Steam boilers. In\naddition to the operating limit control, each steam boiler shall be provided\nwith a high limit pressure-actuated control which by interruption of an\nelectrical circuit will automatically stop the heat generating apparatus if the\nsteam pressure rises to five pounds psi gage above the maximum allowable\nworking pressure of the boiler. (d) Adjustment. Such control shall be adjustable and capable of being firmly fixed\nor sealed in proper adjustment. Fixed or sealed as used herein means that the\ncontrol device shall be so arranged that it will not change during normal\noperation of the boiler. (e) Manual\nreset. Each such control shall be of the manual reset type, designed to reclose\nonly by manual operation. (f) Circuits. Each such control shall be so incorporated into the electrical\ncircuit essential to the operation of the heat generating apparatus that its\nautomatic operation shall interrupt an ungrounded conductor and stop the heat\ngenerating apparatus regardless of the functioning of any other electrical\ndevice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n4-5.17\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
