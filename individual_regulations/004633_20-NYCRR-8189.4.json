  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 8189.4 - Base manuscripts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Aerial photography. The aerial photography shall be taken at such time as\ndeciduous trees are free of leaves and the ground is free of seasonal snow. The\naerial photography shall be produced in a controlled manner under\nspecifications sufficient to meet the accuracy requirements of the base\nmanuscripts. (b) Photogrammetric\ncontrol. Control points utilized in the photogrammetric procedures in the\npreparation of the base manuscripts shall consist of existing monumented\nstations established by or for the United States governmental agency now known\nas the National Geodetic Survey, and additional points established by ground\nsurveys and/or aerial triangulation. Ground surveys shall be based upon said\nexisting monuments using generally accepted procedures and achieving results\nconsistent with the accuracy requirements for the base manuscripts. Aerial\ntriangulation shall be based upon said existing monuments and said ground\nsurveys and shall also be executed using generally accepted procedures and\nachieving results consistent with the accuracy requirements of the base\nmanuscripts. (c) Compiling. Base\nmanuscripts shall be prepared by photogrammetric methods using stereo plotting\ninstruments and aerial photographs obtained with cartographic cameras. The New\n\nYork State plane coordinate system shall be adopted as the horizontal datum for\nall base manuscripts; grid intersections shall be shown at intervals of five\ninches and shall not vary by more than 0.01 inch from true grid value on each\nmap sheet. Each horizontal control point shall also be plotted on the map\nsheets within the coordinate grid and should lie to an accuracy of 0.01 inch of\nits true position as expressed by the plane coordinates of the point. Manuscripts shall be compiled directly to the required map scales with the\nexception of the one inch equals 50-foot scale. One inch equals 50-foot\nmanuscripts may be obtained by photographic enlargement of one inch equals\n100-foot manuscripts. The absolute horizontal accuracy of the manuscripts shall\nbe such that 90 percent of all well defined planimetric features shall be\nplotted within one fortieth of an inch of their true coordinate position as\nmeasured on original one inch equals 400-foot and one inch equals 200-foot\nmanuscripts. For one inch equals 100-foot manuscripts the requirement shall be\none twentieth of an inch. Well defined features within each original manuscript\nshall be of greater relative accuracy than of absolute accuracy. Use of the\nterm absolute in this subdivision shall be construed as being in relation to\nthe nearest National Geodetic Survey stations used for ground surveys and/or in\naerial triangulation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n8189.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
