  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.14 - Control program requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Control\nprogram verification. (1)\nEPROM-based program\nstorage. Gaming devices that have control programs residing in one or more\nEPROMs shall employ a mechanism to verify control programs and data. Such\nmechanism shall use, at a minimum, a checksum. It is recommended that a cyclic\nredundancy check be used (at least 16-bit). (2)\n\nNon-EPROM program storage. (i) Software shall provide a mechanism for\nthe detection of unauthorized and corrupt software elements, upon any access, and subsequently prevent the execution or usage of such corrupt elements by a\ngaming device. Such mechanism shall employ a hashing algorithm that produces a\nmessage digest output of at least 128 bits. (ii)\n\nIn the event of a failed authentication\nafter a game has been powered up, a gaming device immediately should enter an\nerror condition and display an appropriate error. This error shall require\noperator intervention to clear and shall not clear until the data authenticates\nproperly, following operator intervention, or the media are replaced or\ncorrected, and the gaming device's memory is cleared. Control program\nverification mechanisms will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on\nindustry-standard security practices. (3)\n\nAlterable media. In addition to the\nrequirements set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall: (i) employ a mechanism that tests unused or\nunallocated areas of the alterable media for unintended programs or data and\ntests the structure of the media for integrity. Such mechanism shall prevent\nfurther play of the gaming device if unexpected data or structural\ninconsistencies are found; and\n(ii)\nemploy a mechanism for keeping a record any time a control program component is\nadded, removed or altered on any alterable media. Such record shall contain a\nminimum of the last 10 modifications to the media and each record shall contain\nthe date and time of the action, identification of the component affected, the\nreason for the modification and any pertinent validation information. Alterable\nprogram storage does not include memory devices typically considered to be\nalterable that have been rendered \"read-only\" by either a hardware or software\nmeans. (b) Program identification. Program storage devices that do not have the ability to\nbe modified while installed in a gaming device during normal operation shall be\nmarked clearly with sufficient information to identify the software and\nrevision level of the information stored in such devices. (c) Independent control program verification. A gaming device shall have the ability to allow for an independent integrity\ncheck of such device's software from an outside source. An independent\nintegrity check is required for all control programs that may affect the\nintegrity of the game. In such integrity check, the software shall be\nauthenticated by a third-party device, which may be embedded within the game\nsoftware, by having an interface port for a third-party device to authenticate\nthe media, or by allowing for removal of the media such that the media can be\nverified externally. This integrity check shall provide a means for field\nverification of the software to identify and validate the program. An approved\ntesting laboratory shall, prior to device approval, evaluate the\nintegrity-check method. If the authentication program is contained within the\ngame software, the manufacturer shall receive written approval from the testing\nlaboratory prior to submission for testing. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.14\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
