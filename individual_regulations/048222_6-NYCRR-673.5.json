  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 673.5 - Hazard classifications\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ndepartment may assign a hazard classification to dams according to the\npotential impacts of a dam failure. The factors used to evaluate and assign a\nhazard classification are: (1)\nthe height, impoundment capacity and physical characteristics of the dam; (2)\nthe physical characteristics of the\nlocation of the dam, including the areas which would be affected by a failure\nof the dam; and\n(3)\nthe potential\nconsequences and other circumstances relevant to the failure of the dam, including, without limitation: (i) personal\ninjury and loss of human life; (ii)\ndamage to developed areas, occupied buildings, or other land\nimprovements; (iii)\neconomic\nloss; (iv)\ndamage to natural\nresources; (v) proximity to and\npossible impairment of access to emergency services; and\n(vi)\nother site-specific characteristics or\nfactors which the department determines are necessary to consider. (b) The hazard\nclassifications for dams are assigned based on the particular physical\ncharacteristics of a dam and its location, may be assigned irrespective of the\nsize of the dam, as appropriate, and are as follows: (1)\n\nClass A or low hazard dam. A dam failure\nis unlikely to result in damage to anything more than isolated or unoccupied\nbuildings, undeveloped lands, minor roads such as town or county roads; is\nunlikely to result in the interruption of important utilities, including water\nsupply, sewage treatment, fuel, power, cable or telephone infrastructure; and/or is otherwise unlikely to pose the threat of personal injury, substantial\neconomic loss or substantial environmental damage. (2)\n\nClass B or intermediate hazard dam. A dam\nfailure may result in damage to isolated homes, main highways, and minor\nrailroads; may result in the interruption of important utilities, including\nwater supply, sewage treatment, fuel, power, cable or telephone infrastructure; and/or is otherwise likely to pose the threat of personal injury and/or\nsubstantial economic loss or substantial environmental damage. Loss of human\nlife is not expected. (3)\n\nClass C\nor high hazard dam. A dam failure may result in widespread or serious damage to\nhome(s); damage to main highways, industrial or commercial buildings, railroads, and/or important utilities, including water supply, sewage\ntreatment, fuel, power, cable or telephone infrastructure; or substantial\nenvironmental damage; such that the loss of human life or widespread\nsubstantial economic loss is likely. (4)\n\nClass D or negligible or no hazard dam. A\ndam that has been breached or removed, or has failed or otherwise no longer\nmaterially impounds waters, or a dam that was planned but never constructed. Class D dams are considered to be defunct dams posing negligible or no hazard. The department may retain pertinent records regarding such dams. (c) A list of assigned hazard\nclassifications will be maintained and made available by the department's dam\nsafety section. A list will also be available at each regional office of the\ndepartment for the dams within that region. The list will also be made\navailable to the public in electronic form either through the department's\nwebsite or through other means. The list is informational in nature, and a dam\nis not required to be on the list to confer jurisdiction for action by the\ndepartment according to statute or its implementing regulations. (d) The department may change a dam's hazard\nclassification as necessary at any time to accurately reflect the potential\nimpacts of dam failure. Upon changing the hazard classification of a dam, the\ndepartment shall notify the dam owner in writing and provide the basis\ntherefore. (e) A dam owner may\ncontest the department's assignment of or change to a hazard classification. The dam owner must send a written request for hazard classification review to\nthe department's dam safety section and must accompany the request with\ndocumentation of the specific potential impacts posed by the dam's failure, based on the specific physical characteristics of both the dam and its\nlocation. Documentation may include results of a dam break analysis, inundation\nmapping, and other relevant information in order to support the request for\nreclassification of the dam. The director of the department's Division of\n\nWater, or duly authorized designee, will review the owner's request for review\nand supporting documentation and issue a written decision either denying the\nrequest or changing the hazard classification. (f) Any person may provide to the department, and the department shall consider, information relevant to the assignment of a\nhazard classification to a dam. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
