(1)\n\nAll fiscal and statistical records and\nreports of providers which are used for the purpose of establishing rates of\npayment made in accordance with the medical assistance program and all\nunderlying books, records, documentation and reports which formed the basis for\nsuch fiscal and statistical records and reports are subject to audit. All\nunderlying books, records and documentation which formed the basis for the\nfiscal and statistical reports filed by a provider with any State agency\nresponsible for the establishment of rates of payment or fees must be kept and\nmaintained by the provider for a period of not less than six years from the\ndate of filing of such reports, or the date upon which the fiscal and\nstatistical records were required to be filed, or two years from the end of the\nlast calendar year during any part of which a provider's rate or fee was based\non the fiscal or statistical reports, whichever is later. In this respect, any\nrate of payment certified or established by the commissioner of the Department\nof Health or other official or agency responsible for establishing such rates\nwill be construed to represent a provisional rate until an audit is performed\nand completed, or the period within which to conduct an audit has expired\nwithout such audit having been begun or notice of such audit having been\nissued, at which time such rate or adjusted rate will be construed to represent\nthe final rate as to those items audited. (2)\n\nAll required fiscal and statistical\nreports are subject to audit for a period of six years from the date of their\nfiling or from the date when such reports were required to be filed, whichever\nis later. This limitation does not apply to situations in which fraud may be\ninvolved or where the provider or an agent thereof prevents or obstructs the\ncommissioner from performing an audit pursuant to this Part. Where reports and\ndocumentation have been submitted pursuant to a rate appeal of a provisional\nrate, such reports and documentation will likewise be subject to audit for a\nperiod of six years from the submission of material in support of such appeal\nor two years following certification of any revised rate resulting from such\nappeal, whichever is later. (b) Fee-for-service providers. (1)\n\nAll providers, who are not paid at rates\nor fees approved by the State Director of the Division of the Budget based upon\ntheir allowable costs of operation but who are paid in accordance with the\nrates, fees and schedules established by the department, must prepare and\nmaintain contemporaneous records demonstrating their right to receive payment\nunder the medical assistance program. All records necessary to disclose the\nnature and extent of services furnished and the medical necessity therefor, including any prescription or fiscal order for the service or supply, must be\nkept by the provider for a period of six years from the date the care, services\nor supplies were furnished or billed, whichever is later. (2)\n\nAll information regarding claims for\npayment submitted by or on behalf of the provider is subject to audit for a\nperiod of six years from the date the care, services or supplies were furnished\nor billed, whichever is later, and must be furnished, upon request, to the\ndepartment, the Secretary of the United States Department of Health and Human\n\nServices, the Medicaid Fraud Control Unit or the New York State Department of\n\nHealth for audit and review. This limitation does not apply to situations in\nwhich fraud may be involved or where the provider or an agent thereof prevents\nor obstructs an audit. (c) Notification by the department to the\nprovider of the department's intent to audit shall toll the six-year period for\nrecord retention and audit. The department shall not notify a provider of its\nintent to audit more than six years from the date of filing of the fiscal and\nstatistical reports to be audited or six years from the date they were required\nto be filed, whichever is later. The audit shall begin within 60 days of such\nwritten notification of intent to audit. The department may extend this period\nfor 60 days upon written notice to the provider. The department shall initiate\nno more than one extension of a notification of intent to audit. (d) If an audit has not been commenced within\n60 days of a notification of intent to audit or within 120 days of an extended\nnotification, the effectiveness of the notification shall lapse. However, the\ndepartment may issue subsequent notifications of intent to audit within the\nsix-year period described in subdivision (b) of this section. The passage of\nthis six-year period shall preclude the department from conducting an audit\nunless there is in existence an unexpired notification of intent to audit or an\nextended notification. The passage of this six-year period shall not prohibit\nthe department from concluding an audit already begun. (e) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of this section, the period within which to commence\nan audit may be indefinitely extended on account of delays in the commencement\nof the audit caused or requested by the provider or a representative of the\nprovider. (f) An on-site audit\nbegins with an entrance conference at which the nature and extent of the audit\nmust be discussed. The time, manner and place of an audit will be determined by\nthe department. (g) Where feasible, the department shall enter into an agreement to undertake a combined audit with\nother organizations and agencies having audit responsibilities to satisfy the\ndepartment's auditing needs. In this respect, the department reserves the\nright, after entering into any such agreement, to use the findings of the\ncombined audit or to perform an independent audit of either limited or\ncomprehensive scope of the same fiscal period audited by the other organization\nor agency. (h) In its discretion, the department may terminate an audit at any time in the audit process. The\nprovider shall be notified in writing of such termination. This written\nnotification shall serve in the place of a closing conference, draft audit\nreport or final audit report, as appropriate. If an audit is terminated, the\ndepartment is precluded from recommencing an audit of those items which were\nthe subject of the terminated audit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
