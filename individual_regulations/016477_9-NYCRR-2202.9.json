  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2202.9 - Unavoidable increases in operating costs in small structures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A landlord may\nfile an application for an adjustment of maximum rents on the ground that he\nowns a building containing no more than 19 housing accommodations (whether or\nnot subject to control) and has incurred unavoidable increases in property\ntaxes, fuel, utilities, insurance, and repairs and maintenance, excluding\nmortgage interest and amortization, and excluding allowances for depreciation, obsolescence and reserves, which have occurred since the Federal date\ndetermining the maximum rent. If, as determined by the administrator, the\nlandlord has not been fully compensated by increases in rental income\nsufficient to offset such increases in operating costs, the administrator shall\ngrant an adjustment of the maximum rents. (b) Where the administrator finds, in\nconsidering the application under this section, that a present tenant is paying\na rent less than the maximum rent, the administrator, upon request of the\nlandlord, may reduce the maximum rent of the housing accommodation to the\namount actually being paid, or to the highest maximum rent for comparable\ncontrolled housing accommodations in the structure, whichever is\nhigher. (c) A further application\nmay not be filed under this section sooner than one year from the date of\nfiling of the last prior application for an increase with respect to such\nproperty under this section, where such prior application resulted in the\ngranting of an increase. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2202.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
