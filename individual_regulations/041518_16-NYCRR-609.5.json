(a) Medical\nemergencies. (1)\n\nNo telephone corporation\nshall suspend, terminate or refuse to restore basic local exchange service and\nany access determined by the customer's doctor to be necessary to reach the\ncustomer's doctor when a medical emergency exists, for which certification by a\nmedical doctor or local board of health may be required, for nonpayment of\nmonthly charges in an amount set by the commission; provided, however, that a\ndemonstration of the customer's inability to pay charges for service may be\nrequired before a certificate of medical emergency can be renewed pursuant to\nparagraphs (3) and (4) of this subdivision, unless the commission or its\ndesignee directs otherwise. (2)\nA\nmedical emergency exists when a resident of a customer's residence suffers from\na serious illness or medical condition which severely affects the resident's\nwell-being and the absence of such telephone service would create a serious\nrisk of inaccessibility of emergency medical assistance, assistance relating to\nmedical care or professional advice. An inability to pay charges for service is\ndemonstrated when a customer is unable to pay past due and current telephone\nbills because of insufficient liquid assets and current income, considering\nother necessary and reasonable expenses of the customer such as food, shelter\nand medical expenses, which may be documented by provisions of the information\nrequired in the form set in Appendix 17 of this Title or such other form\napproved by the commission. (3)\n\nCertification. An initial certification of a medical emergency by a medical\ndoctor or local board of health may be made by telephone and shall remain\neffective if written certification is provided thereafter to the telephone\ncorporation within five business days. A telephone corporation may require that\nany certification of a medical emergency shall be submitted on stationery of\nthe medical doctor or local board of health, shall be signed by the medical\ndoctor or an official of the local board of health qualified to make a medical\njudgment and shall state the name and address of the certifying medical doctor\nor local board of health, the doctor's State registration number, the name and\naddress of the seriously ill person, the nature of the serious illness or\nmedical condition any service beyond basic local exchange services which may be\nnecessary to reach the customer's doctor because of the medical condition and\nan affirmation that the customer suffers from a serious illness or a medical\ncondition that severely affects the resident's well-being and that the absence\nof such telephone service would create a serious risk of inaccessibility of\nemergency medical assistance, assistance relating to medical care or\nprofessional advice. The certificate shall be effective for 30 days from the\ntime the telephone corporation receives an oral or written certification, whichever occurs earlier. In deciding whether the conditions for a medical\nemergency are met, the medical doctor or qualified official of the local board\nof health should use his or her best judgment. A telephone corporation\nreceiving an initial certificate shall promptly so notify the customer in\nwriting and shall provide information on renewal of certificates, including the\nform set forth in Appendix 17 of this Title, or such other form approved by the\ncommission, if the telephone corporation intends to make a determination\nconcerning a customer's ability to pay charges for service. The telephone\ncorporation also shall issue a reminder notice on renewal of certificates seven\ndays prior to the expiration of the certificate. (4)\n\nCertificate renewal. If the medical\ncondition is likely to continue beyond the expiration of an initial\ncertification, a certificate may be renewed, provided: (i) a medical doctor or qualified official of\nthe board of health states in writing to the telephone corporation the expected\nduration of the medical emergency, and explains either the nature of the\nmedical emergency or the reason why the absence of such telephone service would\ncreate a serious risk of inaccessibility of emergency medical assistance or\nassistance relating to medical care or professional advice; and\n(ii)\nthe customer demonstrates an inability\nto pay charges for service. A customer may be required, before the expiration\nof the initial certification, to submit to the telephone corporation the\ninformation required in the form set forth in Appendix 17 of this Title, or\nsuch other form approved by the commission for the purpose of demonstrating an\ninability to pay charges for service. A telephone corporation shall, within\nfive days of submission of such information, determine whether the customer's\nliquid assets and current income are insufficient to pay such telephone bills, considering other necessary and reasonable expenses of the customer such as\nfood, shelter, medical and other necessary expenses. Whenever a telephone\ncorporation determines that a customer has not demonstrated a financial\nhardship, it shall provide the customer with written notice of determination\nand the customer's right to review of the determination by the commission or\nits authorized designee. A telephone corporation shall stay any suspension or\ntermination activity pending its determination on the customer's ability to pay\nand any review of such determination by the commission or its authorized\ndesignee. A renewed certificate shall remain in effect for 30 days, provided\nthat in cases certified as chronic by a medical doctor or qualified official of\nthe local board of health, the renewed certificate shall remain in effect for\n60 days or such longer period as may be approved by the commission or its\ndesignee. The telephone corporation may require that the statement of financial\nhardship shall be completed and submitted to the telephone corporation whenever\na certificate is renewed. (5)\n\nNo telephone corporation shall suspend or\nterminate such service to a residential customer after the expiration of a\ncertification of medical emergency or after the telephone corporation\ndetermines and the commission or its designee concurs that the customer has an\nability to pay charges for service without first sending the customer a final\nnotice of suspension or termination at least eight days prior to suspension of\noutgoing service and 20 days prior to the date of termination. (6)\n\nWhile certification of medical\nemergencies remains in effect, customers shall remain liable for payment of\ntelephone service and shall make reasonable efforts to pay charges for such\nservice. The authorized designees of the commission shall be available to offer\nassistance to customers for working out equitable payment arrangements in order\nto avoid substantial arrearages at the end of a medical emergency. (b) Customers who are elderly, blind or disabled. (1)\n\nNo telephone\ncorporation shall suspend or terminate or refuse to restore service where a\nresidential customer is known to or identified to the telephone corporation to\nbe blind, disabled, or 62 years of age or older, and all the remaining\nresidents of the household are 62 years of age or older, 18 years of age or\nunder, blind or disabled, without complying with the procedures specified in\nthis subdivision.

An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such\nthat the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than\n20 degrees shall be considered as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or\nless. (2)\n\nIn such cases, a\ntelephone corporation shall not suspend or terminate service for an additional\n20 days after the date of suspension or termination as stated on the notice and\nshall make a diligent effort to contact by telephone or in person if telephone\ncontact is unsuccessful, an adult resident at the customer's premises at least\neight days prior to the date on which suspension or termination of service may\noccur for the purpose of devising a payment plan. (3)\n\nIn cases where service has been suspended\nor terminated and the telephone corporation subsequently learns that the\ncustomer is entitled to the protections established under this subdivision, the\ntelephone corporation shall, within 24 hours of such notification, restore\nservice for an additional 20 days and make a diligent effort to contact in\nperson an adult resident at the customer's premises for the purpose of devising\na payment plan. A telephone corporation unable to contact such person within 24\nhours shall make reasonable efforts to achieve contact as soon as\npracticable. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
