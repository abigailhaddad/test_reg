  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 173.1 - Credit for New York State personal income tax withheld\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 673\n(a) The New York State personal income tax\ndeducted and withheld in any calendar year is allowable as a credit against the\n\nNew York State personal income tax of the person with respect to whom such New\n\nYork State personal income tax was withheld. Where New York State personal\nincome tax has actually been withheld, such credit for the New York State\npersonal income tax withheld will be so allowed even though the withheld New\n\nYork State personal income tax has not been paid over to the Division of\n\nTaxation. (b) Year of\ncredit. The New York State personal income tax withheld during\nany calendar year will be allowed as a credit against the New York State\npersonal income tax imposed under article 22 of the Tax Law for the taxable\nyear of such person which begins in that calendar year. Thus, a taxpayer\nreporting on a calendar-year basis receives credit for the New York State\npersonal income tax withheld during such taxpayer's entire reporting year. A\ntaxpayer filing on a fiscal-year basis is allowed credit against such\ntaxpayer's New York State personal income tax for the New York State personal\nincome tax withheld in the calendar year during which such fiscal year\nbegan. Example: A files on a fiscal-year basis beginning June 1, 1985 and\nending May 31, 1986. The full amount of New York State personal income tax\nwithheld during the calendar year 1985 must be claimed as a credit on such\nfiscal-year New York State personal income tax return, and it may not be\nprorated to reflect the portion withheld from June 1, 1985 to December 31, 1985. The\n\nWage and Tax Statement\n(form IT-2102) for 1985 must\nbe attached to the New York State personal income tax return filed for such\nfiscal year ending May 31, 1986. (c) Credit on New York State personal\nincome tax return for less than a full taxable year. If the person from whom the New York State personal\nincome tax was withheld has more than one taxable year beginning in a calendar\nyear, the full amount of the New York State personal income tax withheld during\nthat calendar year will be credited against the New York State personal income\ntax for the last taxable year beginning in such calendar year. Example: B files his New York State personal income tax returns on\na calendar-year basis. He is permitted to change to a fiscal-year basis and his\nfirst New York State personal income tax return on this basis is for the fiscal\nyear beginning July 1, 1977 and ending June 30, 1978. He also files the\nrequired short period New York State personal income tax return for the period\n\nJanuary 1, 1977 to June 30, 1977. The credit for the New York State personal\nincome tax withheld for the calendar year 1977 will be applied against the New\n\nYork State personal income tax for the fiscal year July 1, 1977 to June 30, 1978, since such fiscal year is the last taxable year beginning in the calendar\nyear 1977. Thus, no credit with respect to the New York State personal income\ntax withheld during the calendar year 1977 may be applied to the New York State\npersonal income tax for the short-period New York State personal income tax\nreturn, January 1, 1977 to June 30, 1977.
