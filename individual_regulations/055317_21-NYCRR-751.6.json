  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 751.6 - Boating\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe approximately 400 acres of water area within Hudson River\npark are designated by the Hudson River park Act as an estuarine sanctuary. To\nprotect and preserve this important resource and to promote the safe operation\nof vessels within Hudson River park waters, in addition to the requirements set\nforth in sections 751.1 through\n751.7\nof this Part, the following\nrequirements and restrictions also apply to activities and uses within the\npark's water areas: (a) Permits. (1)\n\nUnless within an\narea designated by the trust, authorized pursuant to a permit, or in an\nemergency, it is prohibited for any person to operate, land, anchor, moor, dock, tie-up, store or launch a boat or vessel of any kind on any of the piers\nor along the bulkhead or other areas of the park. The trust or its appointed\nconcessionaire or operator may identify areas for designated boating, landing, docking, or mooring, which may require fees. (2)\nA permit will not be issued for a vessel\nwhich is unsafe or likely to cause injury to people or damage to property or\nthe environment based on U.S. Coast Guard standards as set forth in 33 CFR\nchapter I, subchapter\nE\nand subchapter S, 46 CFR chapter I, subchapter\nA\n(part\n2), subchapter H, subchapter K, and subchapter T, as applicable and as\ndetermined by the trust or its duly authorized designee. (3)\n\nDockage or mooring permits may be issued\nfor vessels that the trust or its duly authorized designee determines based on\nU.S. Coast Guard standards as set forth in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, are capable of safely operating in open water. Before issuing the permit, the\ntrust or its duly authorized designee may inspect the vessel and/or require a\ndemonstration of the vessel's operational capability in open water. Applicant\nmust present evidence of hull and liability insurance, either current State\nregistration or documentation by the U.S. Coast Guard and successful completion\nof the U.S. Coast Guard Auxiliary, State of New York, or equivalent boating\nsafety course or sufficient nautical experience as determined by the trust\nbased on U.S. Coast Guard Standards. (4)\nA permit will authorize the use of a\nmooring that meets the requirements of this section, the location of a mooring\nat a particular position in the mooring field, and the mooring of a particular\nvessel identified by size, type and registration number. (5)\n\nThe applicant for a permit must be the\nowner or lessee of the vessel. A permit will not be issued unless the applicant\npresents evidence that the vessel possesses a current registration from the\n\nState Department of Motor Vehicles or the appropriate agency of another state\nor is documented by the U.S. Coast Guard. If the applicant is not the\nregistered or documented owner of the vessel, the applicant must present\nevidence that he or she is the lessee of the vessel. If a permittee intends to\nreplace a vessel, he or she must notify the trust or its duly authorized\ndesignee in advance so the trust can determine whether the existing location\nand mooring are acceptable for the replacement vessel. The replacement vessel\nmay not be moored until a new permit is granted. No permit will be issued for a\nreplacement vessel if such vessel is not registered with the Department of\n\nMotor Vehicles or the appropriate agency of another state or documented by the\nU.S. Coast Guard. (6)\n\nNotwithstanding the above provisions of this section, the trust or its duly\nauthorized designee may reserve a limited number of permits for moorings and\nissue them to persons for use in connection with special events or other\nactivities that promote the enjoyment by the public of the water for\neducational, recreational, or entertainment purposes. (7)\n\nThe trust or its duly authorized designee\nmay issue seasonal, monthly or short stay permits. The term of a seasonal\npermit begins May 1st and ends October 31st, unless otherwise designated by the\ntrust or its duly authorized designee. Seasonal permits are not renewable. Seasonal permit holders must apply for a new permit each year. (8)\n\nThe trust will annually accept and review\nmooring permit applications. (9)\n\nThe trust and/or its duly authorized designee may impose reasonable conditions\non the issuance of a permit to protect public safety and to safeguard the\ninterests of the public, including but not limited to a requirement that the\npermittee or applicant have his or her mooring inspected or obtain appropriate\nand updated insurance and submit satisfactory evidence of having complied with\nsuch conditions. (10)\n\nNothing in\nthis Part creates a property right in any permit. All permits issued pursuant\nto this Part merely grant a license and such permits are by their nature\nterminable at will by the trust in accordance with the needs or requirements of\nthe trust or in the interests of the public as determined by the\ntrust. (11)\n\nThe trust or its duly\nauthorized designee may terminate any permit issued pursuant to this Part by\nserving permittee with 15 days' written notice of such termination. The trust\nor its duly authorized designee will send by certified mail notice of the\nintention to terminate a permit and the reasons therefor. In the event that a\nmailing address is unknown or mail is returned undelivered, such notice may, in\nlieu of mailing, be posted in a conspicuous place on the vessel. A permittee\nmay file written objections with the trust within seven days from the date of\nsuch mailing or posting, whichever is later. After considering any objections\nraised by the permittee, the trust will make a final determination whether to\nproceed with termination of the permit and will provide notice of such\ndetermination to the permittee in the manner provided herein. (12)\n\nWhere a permit is terminated, the vessel\nmust be removed from the mooring field within 10 days after notice by the trust\nor its duly authorized designee to remove the same is sent by certified mail to\nthe applicant or permittee. In the event that a mailing address is unknown or\nmail is returned undelivered, such notice may, in lieu of such mailing or hand\ndelivery, be posted in a conspicuous place on the vessel. Where the vessel and\nmooring are not removed within 10 days after the mailing or posting of such\nnotice, whichever is later, the trust or its duly authorized designee may\nremove the vessel and mooring or cause the same to be removed from the mooring\nfield. The permittee and owner will be jointly and severally liable for the\ncosts of removal and storage of the vessel and mooring, as well as for any\nassociated costs, such as cleanup of contamination or debris originating from\nthe vessel or mooring and such costs must be paid prior to release of the same. Any vessel or mooring removed from the mooring field that is not claimed within\n10 days may be deemed to be abandoned and may be turned over to the Coast Guard\nor NYPD or other appropriate governmental agency for disposal in accordance\nwith applicable law. (13)\n\nEvery\napplicant and permittee must provide the trust or its duly authorized designee\nwith an address in writing at which he or she may receive notice required by\nthese rules or other applicable law.

(g) Liability of owner for disabled or\nsunken vessels within the park. If any boat or watercraft burns, submerges or become\ndisabled, such boat or watercraft must be removed immediately by its owner or\nother person having custody thereof. If such boat or watercraft is not removed\nwithin 24 hours, the trust or its designee may have it removed and charge the\nowner or other person having custody thereof with any expense incurred in\nrelation thereto. If the trust determines that the disabled or sunken vessel is\ndischarging pollutants into the water or causing any other kind of emergency, the trust may take immediate action to stop the cause of pollution and may\nremove or cause the vessel to be removed, without prior notice to the permittee\nor owner of the vessel, and recover all costs associated with removal and\nstorage or disposal of the vessel from the permittee and/or owner of the\nvessel.
