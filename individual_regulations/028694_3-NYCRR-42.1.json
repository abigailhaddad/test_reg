  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 42.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n6-m\nof the Banking\n\nLaw provides for the regulation of subprime home loans as defined in the\nstatute. In doing so, the statute incorporates the Federal concept of Annual\n\nPercentage Rate (\"APR\"), as defined in the Federal Truth-in-Lending Act, for\ndetermining whether a home loan is deemed subprime. Loans with a fully-indexed\nrate (a calculation correlated with APR) above a specified threshold are\ndefined as subprime loans. (b) The\nterm fully-indexed rate is defined in section 6-m(1)(b) to mean: \"\n(1)\nfor an adjustable rate loan based on an\nindex, the annual percentage rate calculated using the index rate on the loan\non the date the lender provides the 'good faith estimate' required under\n12 USC section\n2601\net seq. plus the margin to be added to\nit after the expiration of any introductory period or periods; or\n(2)\nfor a fixed rate loan, the annual\npercentage rate on the loan disregarding any introductory rate or rates and any\ninterest rate caps that limit how quickly the contractual interest rate may be\nreached calculated at the time the lender issues its commitment.\"\n(c) Section 6-m defines a subprime\nhome loan as a loan in which the initial interest rate or the fully-indexed\nrate, whichever is higher, exceeds by more than one and three-quarters\npercentage points for a first-lien loan, or by more than three and\nthree-quarters percentage points for a subordinate-lien loan, the average\ncommitment rate for loans with a comparable duration of such home loan as set\nforth in an index provided by the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation for\nthe date as specified in the statute (the first-lien threshold and\nsubordinate-lien threshold, collectively, the \"subprime threshold\"). (d) In Mortgagee Letter 2013-04, the Federal\n\nHousing Administration (the \"FHA\") revised the period for assessing the annual\n\nMortgage Insurance Premium (\"MIP\") for FHA-insured loans such that, in certain\ncases, MIP is required to be paid over the life of the loan, effective June 3, 2013. Because MIP is part of the APR calculation, the FHA's revised policy has\ncaused the APR on many FHA-insured loans to increase, resulting in\nsignificantly more FHA-insured loans exceeding the subprime threshold. Because\nof the reluctance of secondary market participants to purchase subprime loans, lenders are less willing to originate such loans, which has significantly\nrestricted the availability of mortgage financing in New York State. (e) Section 6-m anticipated the need to\nadjust the statute's established subprime threshold under certain\ncircumstances. Section 6-m(1)(c)(ii) empowers the Superintendent to adjust the\nthreshold, stating, \"(n)otwithstanding the comparable rates set forth in this\nparagraph, and notwithstanding any other law, if... the provisions of this\nsection have had an unduly negative effect upon the availability or price of\nmortgage financing in this state, the superintendent may from time to time\ndesignate such other threshold rates as may be necessary... to alleviate\nsuch unduly negative effects.\"\n(f) Based on a financial analysis and an assessment of market conditions, the\nsuperintendent has determined that FHA Mortgagee Letter 2013-04 has effectively\ndecreased the threshold on certain loans; as a result, the existing subprime\nthreshold in section 6-m is having an unduly negative effect on the\navailability of mortgage financing in New York State. The superintendent has\nfurther determined to use the authority provided by section 6-m to promulgate\nthis regulation to restore the availability of mortgage financing to New York\n\nState residents. (g) Accordingly, as set forth in section\n42.2\nof this Part, the\nsuperintendent is adjusting the subprime threshold by 75 basis points, or 0.75\npercent, to restore the availability of mortgage financing to approximately the\nlevels predating the effective date of FHA Mortgagee Letter 2013-04, subject to\nthe specifications set forth in section\n42.2\nof this Part.
