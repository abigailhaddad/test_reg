It is expected that the minimum loss ratios applicable to certain policy forms in this classification may be modified under subdivision (g) of this section. except that if the policy form, other than long term care insurance, nursing home insurance only, home care insurance only, and nursing home and home care insurance, has an average annual premium less than $180, the minimum loss ratio shall be five percentage points less than otherwise applicable. The average annual premium per policy shall be computed by the insurer based on an anticipated distribution of business by all applicable criteria having a price difference, such as age, sex, amount, dependent status, rider frequency, etc. (b) Franchise insurance issued to ages under 65. The minimum loss ratio for such franchise insurance shall be 60 percent. (c) Individual and franchise insurance issued to ages 65 and over. The minimum loss ratio for issue ages 65 and over for all such policies shall be 65 percent, unless one rate is charged for all ages under 65 and 65 and over and the policy is issued at all ages 25 and over in which case the applicable standard for policies issued to ages under 65 apply.

(e) Modifications to minimums upon recognition of dividends. When dividends are recognized as benefits in the loss ratio calculations of section\n52.40\n(c) or (d)\nof this Part, when they equal or exceed 15 percent of the premium in any year, and if the minimum loss ratio would not be met without inclusion of the dividends, the otherwise applicable minimum loss ratio shall be raised by five percent (for example, 50 percent to 55 percent).
