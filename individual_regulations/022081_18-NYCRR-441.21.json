Such contacts\nare also for the purpose of guiding the child's parents or relatives towards a\ncourse of action aimed at resolving problems or needs of a social, emotional, developmental or economic nature that are contributing to the reason(s) why\nsuch child is in foster care. In the case of children with the permanency\nplanning goal of another planned living arrangement with a permanency resource\nor adult residential care, such contacts are for the purpose of mobilizing and\nencouraging family support of the youth's efforts to function independently, and to increase his/her capacity to be self-maintaining; evaluating the ability\nof the parents or relatives to establish or reestablish a connection with the\nyouth and serve as a resource to the youth; and, where appropriate, encouraging\nan ongoing relationship between the parents or relatives and the youth.
