  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 246.7 - Monitoring and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n\nGeneral requirements. Any owner or operator of a MRP\nfacility shall comply with the monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting\nrequirements as provided in this section, 6 NYCRR Part\n201, and\n40\nCFR 75\nsubpart I. For purposes of complying with such requirements, the definitions in\nsection\n246.1\nof this Part, 40\nCFR\n72.2, and 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I shall\napply. The terms affected unit and continuous emission monitoring system (or\nCEMS) contained in 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I shall be deemed to refer to the terms\n\nMercury Reduction Program unit, and continuous emission monitoring system (or\nCEMS) respectively, as defined in section\n246.1\nof this Part. The owner or\noperator of a unit that is not a MRP unit but that is monitored under 40 CFR\nsection\n75.82(b)(2)(i)\nshall comply with the same monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements as a MRP unit. (a) Requirements for installation, certification, and data accounting. The owner or operator of each MRP unit\nshall: (1)\ninstall all monitoring systems\nrequired under sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part for monitoring\nmercury mass emissions and individual unit heat input (including all systems\nrequired to monitor mercury concentration, stack gas moisture content, stack\ngas flow rate, and CO\n2\nor O\n2\nconcentration, as applicable) in accordance with 40 CFR\n75.81, 40 CFR\n75.82, and 40 CFR\n60\n\nAppendix B - Performance Specification 12A; (2)\nsuccessfully complete all certification\ntests required under section\n246.8\nof this Part and meet all\nother requirements of sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part, and of 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I of applicable to the monitoring systems under paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision; and\n(3)\nrecord\nand report the data from the monitoring systems under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision in accordance with 40 CFR\n75.84; and\n(4)\nquality assure the data from the\nmonitoring systems under paragraph (1) of this subdivision in accordance with\n40 CFR\n75.80(e). (b) Compliance deadlines. The owner or operator shall meet the monitoring system\ncertification and other requirements of subdivision (a) of this section by the\nfollowing dates: (1)\nfor the owner or\noperator of a MRP unit that commences commercial operation before July 1, 2008, by January 1, 2009. (2)\nfor the\nowner or operator of a MRP unit that commences commercial operation on or after\n\nJuly 1, 2008, by the later of the following dates: (i) January 1, 2009; or\n(ii)\n90 unit operating days or 180 calendar\ndays, whichever occurs first, after the date on which the unit commences\ncommercial operation. (3)\nfor the owner or operator of a MRP unit\nfor which construction of a new stack or flue or installation of add-on mercury\nemission controls, a flue gas desulfurization system, a selective catalytic\nreduction system, or a compact hybrid particulate collector system is completed\nafter the applicable deadline under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subdivision, by 90 unit operating days or 180 calendar days, whichever occurs first, after\nthe date on which emissions first exit to the atmosphere through the new stack\nor add-on mercury emissions controls. (c) Reporting data. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (2) of\nthis subdivision, the owner or operator of a MRP unit that does not meet the\napplicable compliance date set forth in subdivision (b) of this section for any\nmonitoring system under paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall, for each such\nmonitoring system, determine, record, and report maximum potential (or, as\nappropriate, minimum potential) values for mercury concentration, stack gas\nflow rate, stack gas moisture content, and any other parameters required to\ndetermine mercury mass emissions and heat input in accordance with 40 CFR\n75.80(g). (2)\n\nThe owner or operator\nof a MRP unit that does not meet the applicable compliance date set forth in\nparagraph (b)(3) of this section for any monitoring system under paragraph\n(a)(1) of this section shall, for each such monitoring system, determine, record, and report substitute data using the applicable missing data procedures\nin 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart D, in lieu of the maximum potential (or, as appropriate, minimum potential) values, for a parameter if the owner or operator\ndemonstrates that there is continuity between the data streams for that\nparameter before and after the construction or installation under paragraph\n(b)(3) of this section. (d) Prohibitions. (1)\n\nNo owner or operator of a MRP unit shall\nuse any alternative monitoring system, alternative reference method, or any\nother alternative to any requirement of sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part without having\nobtained prior written approval in accordance with section\n246.12\nof this Part. (2)\n\nNo owner or operator of a MRP unit shall\noperate the unit so as to discharge, or allow to be discharged, mercury\nemissions to the atmosphere without accounting for all such emissions in\naccordance with the applicable provisions of sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part, and 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I. (3)\n\nNo owner or operator\nof a MRP unit shall disrupt the continuous emission monitoring system, any\nportion thereof, or any other approved emission monitoring method, and thereby\navoid monitoring and recording mercury mass emissions discharged into the\natmosphere, except for periods of recertification or periods when calibration, quality assurance testing, or maintenance is performed in accordance with the\napplicable provisions of sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part, and 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I. (4)\n\nNo owner or operator\nof a MRP unit shall retire or permanently discontinue use of the continuous\nemission monitoring system, any component thereof, or any other approved\nmonitoring system under this Part, except under any one of the following\ncircumstances: (i) the owner or operator is\nmonitoring emissions from the unit with another certified monitoring system\napproved, in accordance with the applicable provisions of sections\n246.7\nthrough\n246.13\nof this Part, and 40 CFR\n75\nsubpart I, by the department or the administrator for use at that unit that\nprovides emission data for the same pollutant or parameter as the retired or\ndiscontinued monitoring system; or\n(ii)\nthe MRP facility owner submits\nnotification of the date of certification testing of a replacement monitoring\nsystem for the retired or discontinued monitoring system in accordance with\nsection\n246.8\n(c)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Part.
