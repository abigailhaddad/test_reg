  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-7.2 - Standard for admission or continued occupancy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to income eligibility, an\nauthority may establish standards for use in approving eligibility for\nadmission or continued occupancy of a household in any authority project. Such\nstandards shall include that the household will not, or does not, constitute: (1)\na detriment to the health or safety of\nits neighbors or the community; (2)\na source of danger to the peaceful occupation of the other tenants; (3)\na source of danger or cause of damage to\nresidents, personnel, property or premises of the authority; or\n(4)\nsuch other lawful and non-discriminatory\neligibility or continued occupancy criteria as may be established by the\nauthority. (b) An\nauthority may admit or continue the tenancy of a household which might\notherwise be ineligible under subdivision (a) of this section due to behavior\nthat does not result in a criminal conviction if: (1)\nthe person responsible for the prohibited\naction demonstrates rehabilitation or good conduct, demonstrated by, among\nother things, completion of a credible rehabilitation program; (2)\nthe household demonstrates to the\nauthority's satisfaction that the person is no longer engaging in drug or\nalcohol-related activity, if the behavior stemmed from the use or abuse of\ndrugs or alcohol in a way that interfered with the health, safety, or right to\npeaceful enjoyment of the premises by other residents; or\n(3)\nthe household member(s) determined to\nhave engaged in the behavior will not reside in the unit. If the member is a\nminor, the authority may consider individual circumstances including the advice\nof Juvenile Court officials. (c) In determining a household's eligibility\nfor admission or continued occupancy, an authority may give consideration to a\nhousehold member's criminal convictions that involved physical violence to\npersons or property or that adversely affected the health, safety and welfare\nof other people. The authority may not reject an applicant or remove a tenant\nbased solely on that fact that a household member has such a conviction(s) but\nmust conduct an individualized assessment of each household member who has such\nconvictions, taking into account: (1)\nthe\ntime which has elapsed since the criminal conviction(s); (2)\nthe age of the person at the time of the\nconviction(s); (3)\nthe seriousness\nof the conviction(s); (4)\nany\ninformation produced by the household member, or produced on his or her behalf, in regard to rehabilitation and good conduct, including, but not limited to, evidence of completion of treatment, rehabilitative programming, history of\nemployment and tenancy, volunteer or community activity, and letters of\nreference from employers, landlords, community members or others who could\nspeak to the person's conduct since the conviction; and\n(5)\nwhere termination of continued occupancy\nis considered, the effects that termination of occupancy would have on\nhousehold members who do not have convictions. If, after conducting this assessment, the authority\ndetermines that the household is not eligible for tenancy, it must be able to\narticulate its reasoning with specificity. The authority shall communicate its\ndecision to the household, together with the reasons for its\ndetermination. (d) Notwithstanding subdivision (c) of this\nsection, household members with the following convictions shall be ineligible\nfor occupancy in an authority project: (1)\n\nConvictions that lead to lifetime registration in a State Sex Offender\n\nRegistration Program. Provided however, if such lifetime registration\nrequirement is removed, the underlying convictions will be assessed in\naccordance with subdivision (c) of this section. (2)\n\nConvictions for the manufacture or\nproduction of methamphetamine on premises of assisted housing (including\nprivately owned units occupied by Section 8 Voucher Program\nparticipants).
