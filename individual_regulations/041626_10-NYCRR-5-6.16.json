Tit. 10 §§ 5-6.16 - Certification procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll bottled or bulk water products sold or distributed in New York State must be certified. The following procedures must be met to apply for certification: (a) Any person applying for bottled water certification shall, at a minimum, meet the requirements listed below: (1)\n\nComplete and submit a signed application form, GEN 222 Application for Certification of Approval for Distribution of Bottled or Bulk Water. (2)\n\nSubmit a statement from the appropriate regulatory agency of the state or country having jurisdiction over the bottling operation, indicating that the facility has been approved to bottle or package water for human consumption. This approval may be a copy of a certificate, license, permit or a letter of approval from the agency. A copy of the laws and regulations on bottled water processing from the regulatory agency having jurisdiction must also be submitted. When another state or country has no program for inspection and approval of bulk or bottled water facilities, the commissioner may make a determination based on an inspection and evaluation by an independent individual or organization knowledgeable in bulk or bottled water handling practices. (3)\n\nSubmit an engineering report, plans and specifications for the proposal prepared by a registered professional engineer licensed to practice in New York State or in the state which the facility is located. This submittal must include, but not be limited to, the development of the source, methods used in the bottling operation, the water treatment used and laboratory control of water quality provided and a flow diagram from source through the bottling operation. The report submitted with the application must show compliance with the requirements of this Subpart. (4)\n\nSubmit two caps and two labels for each container size of the bottled water product that is to be certified. (5)\n\nSubmit complete inorganic chemical, organic chemical, microbiological and radiological analyses for contaminants listed in section\n5-6.11\nof this Subpart for each source and each finished bottled water product type be distributed in New York State.

(2)\n\nThe request must include documentation that the 'contaminant exceeding the MCL will not constitute an unreasonable health risk. The documentation must include: (i) the identification of the contaminant or contaminants exceeding the MCL; (ii)\nthe concentration level in milligrams per liter of the contaminant, including the maximum, minimum and average value found in the product; (iii)\nthe target consumer group; (iv)\nthe consumption pattern in milliliters per day of the consumers based on estimated or actual market surveys; and\n(v) the health significance of the higher contaminant concentration level; (c) Any person applying for bulk water certification shall, at a minimum, meet the requirements listed below: (1)\n\nComplete and submit a signed application form, GEN 222 Application for Certification of Approval for Distribution of Bottled or Bulk Water. (2)\n\nSubmit a statement from the appropriate regulatory agency of the State having jurisdiction over the bulk water operation indicating that an inspection of the water source, transporting vehicles and sanitation procedures has been made and is in conformance with the appropriate minimum standards as outlined in this Subpart. When another state has no program for inspection and approval of bulk water operators, the commissioner may make a determination based on an inspection and evaluation by an independent individual or organization knowledgeable in bulk water handling practices. (3)\n\nSubmit a report that includes the procedures used in the sanitizing of the tank interior, the name and location of the source water, source treatment, other uses of the tank truck, frequency and type of water quality analyses performed, quantities and frequencies of shipments, primary use of potable water shipped and loading and unloading procedures. (4)\n\nSubmit complete inorganic chemical, organic chemical, microbiological and radiological analyses of contaminants as listed in section\n5-6.11\nof this Subpart for each source to be used. Results of these analyses must be submitted with the application. Additional analyses may be required if, in the judgment of the commissioner, they are needed to determine the acceptability of the source or treatment provided.

The microbiological sample results on source and finished products must conform to the requirements of sections\n5-6.10, 5-6.11\nand\n5-6.13\nof this Subpart. Results of each analysis must be entered on the GEN 221 opposite the date the sample was collected.
