  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1701.5 - Selection of inmates for double-cell housing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Responsibility. The deputy superintendent for security shall be responsible\nfor the selection of inmates for double-cell housing. The deputy superintendent\nfor security or designee shall conduct a risk assessment using t he\neligibility, suitability and compatibility criteria set forth in subdivisions\n(b), (c) and (d) of this section. (b) Eligible population. In determining which\ninmates shall be considered for assignment to double-cell housing, the facility\nshall first consider those inmates newly transferred into the facility; provided, however: (1)\nan inmate temporarily\nmoved to attend an outside court, a death bed/funeral visit or to receive\noutside medical/psychiatric treatment may not be assigned to double-cell\nhousing upon return to the facility, unless the inmate was assigned to\ndouble-cell housing prior to such move; or\n(2)\na general population inmate transferred\nfor non-disciplinary reasons may not be assigned to double-cell housing in\ngeneral confinement at the receiving facility, if the inmate meets all of the\nfollowing criteria: (i) the inmate has been\nwith the department for at least two years following initial\nreception/classification and transfer to a permanent facility; (ii)\nthe inmate has had no Tier II or III\ndisciplinary determinations of guilt within the last two years; and\n(iii)\nthe inmate has not volunteered for\ndouble-cell housing (a transfer sought by an inmate may be conditioned upon the\ninmate volunteering to be housed in a double-cell at the receiving facility). [(iv) the inmate is not being\ntransferred to Woodbourne Correctional Facility.]\n(c) Assessment of\nsuitability. (1)\n\nInformation assessment. When\ndetermining an inmate's suitability for a double-cell assignment, the deputy\nsuperintendent for security or designee shall review the information contained\nin the inmate population management system and other records as deemed\nappropriate to determine if factors exist that would preclude such\nassignment. (2)\n\nPhysical status. (i) Size. Any inmate over 6'5\" or currently\nweighing over 299 pounds shall be precluded from a double-cell\nassignment. (ii)\n\nAge. Except for\nvolunteers, any inmate 70 years of age or over shall be precluded from a\ndouble-cell assignment. (iii)\n\nHealth. Any inmate with a communicable disease or physical disability who\nfacility medical staff conclude should not be housed in a double-cell, based on\nscreening, see paragraph (6) of this subdivision, shall be precluded from a\ndouble-cell assignment (e.g., confinement to a wheelchair or receiving\n\"directly observed therapy\" for treatment of Tuberculosis - so long as the\ninmate is on active treatment). (3)\n\nMental status. (i) Level 1. Any inmate currently classified\nas level 1 by OMH staff shall be precluded from a double-cell\nassignment; (ii)\n\nLevels 2 and 3. If\nan inmate is classified as level 2 or 3 by Office of Mental Health (\"OMH\")\nstaff, the inmate's record must be closely scrutinized prior to assignment to a\ndouble-cell. Factors that may preclude such an assignment would be: (a) extremely poor disciplinary\nadjustment; (b) input from OMH\nstaff specifically recommending a single-cell assignment; or\n(c) any other documented behavior that, when\ncoupled with such OMH designation, would lead the deputy superintendent for\nsecurity or designee to determine that the inmate would not be an appropriate\ndouble-celling candidate. (4)\n\nHistory and behavior. The following\ninmates shall not be approved for double-cell housing, except in accordance\nwith paragraph (5) of this subdivision: (i) Victim prone. Inmates currently in \"voluntary protective custody\" or\n\"involuntary protective custody\" status in accordance with Part 330 of this\n\nTitle. In addition, any inmate with a pattern of being victimized by other\ninmates resulting in serious physical injury or sexual abuse; (ii)\n\nAssaultive inmates. Inmates with a\npattern of predatory assaults on other inmates by the use of contraband weapons\nor where the assaults resulted in serious physical injury to the\nvictims; (iii)\n\nCriminal histories\nof extreme violence. Inmates whose criminal histories involve a pattern of acts\nof violence resulting in serious physical injury to victims, or inmates whose\ncrime(s) of commitment involve acts of violence resulting in serious physical\ninjuries to multiple victims or intentional and depraved infliction of extreme\nphysical pain resulting in serious physical injury to any one victim; or\n(iv)\n\nSame gender sexual\nviolence. Inmates found guilty at facility disciplinary hearings of engaging in\nsame gender sexual violence while incarcerated. (5)\n\nSince the assessment of an inmate's\nineligibility for double-celling is based upon a history of demonstrated\nbehavior in paragraph (4) of this subdivision and it is possible for the inmate\nto positively change such behavior, the deputy superintendent for security may\nexercise a limited amount of flexibility when determining double-cell\nassignments. For this reason, an \"override factor\" has been included in the\nscreening process and may be utilized when more recent history and behavior by\nthe inmate show a positive adjustment factor mitigating in favor of double-cell\nhousing despite earlier events. Whenever the override factor is utilized, the\ndeputy superintendent for security must provide the specific reason on the\ndouble-cell information sheet (see section\n1701.9\nof this\n\nPart). (6)\n\nMedical screening. (i) Medical records screening. The deputy\nsuperintendent for security or designee shall provide a list of inmates under\nconsideration for double-cell housing to the facility health services director\nor designee. The facility health staff shall conduct a medical records review\nprior to possible double-cell assignment and advise the deputy superintendent\nfor security or designee of the existence of a medical condition that would\npreclude double-cell housing or require placement in a bottom bunk bed. (ii)\n\nPhysical assessment. Either\nprior to or within 48 hours after an inmate's placement in a double-cell, a\nphysical assessment will be conducted. If facility health staff determine that\na change in the inmate's current housing is required, that information shall be\nconveyed to the deputy superintendent for security or designee and the\nappropriate change in housing shall be made. Section\n1701.5\n(d) is amended to read as follows: (iii)\n\nThe form used. The facility health\nstaff shall utilize the screening and physical assessment for placement in a\ndouble-cell form (see section\n1701.9\nof this Part) when\nboth conducting the medical records screening review and physical\nassessment. (d) Assessment of compatibility. After an inmate's record has been appropriately screened an\nd the deputy superintendent for security or designee has determined that the\ninmate is a suitable candidate, an assessment of compatibility with the other\ninmate assigned to the cell shall be made. The following criteria shall be used\nin making this determination: (1)\n\nVolunteers. Whether two inmates have requested to be housed together. (2)\n\nEthnic or religious background. The\nfacility should attempt to take into account the ethnic and religious\nbackground of both candidates for the same double-cell. It is not necessary, however, that they share the same ethnic or religious background. (3)\n\nLanguage. The ability of inmates to\ncommunicate with each other. (4)\n\nSize or other physical characteristics. The physical capabilities and needs of\ninmates (e.g., two inmates both requiring a bottom bunk should not be housed in\nthe same cell). (5)\n\nAge. The\nrespective ages of the inmates. Inmates age 60 and over must be assigned bottom\nbunk. (6)\n\nCriminal history/length\nof sentence. Years to earliest release and nature of crimes. (7)\n\nProgram/job assignment. The inmates'\nprogram or job assignments (certain program and job assignments require inmates\nto house on the same location). (8)\n\nFamily relationship. Familial relationship between inmates (e.g., siblings or\ncousins). (9)\n\nKnown enemies. Inmates who are known enemies of record or who the department has otherwise\ndetermined should be kept apart. (e) Double-cell information sheet. The list of factors governing both suitability and\ncompatibility is not exhaustive. Other factors may also be considered. The\ndouble-cell information sheet (see section\n1701.9\nof this Part) has\nbeen developed to properly record each step in the screening/risk assessment\nprocess. Each applicable section must be completed by the deputy superintendent\nfor security or designee. \"Health service review results\" and \" mental health\nstatus\" sections may be completed based on verbal or written input from the\nappropriate areas. A copy of the completed form should be forwarded to the\ninmate records coordinator and the movement and control officer for each inmate\napproved for double-celling. (f) Notwithstanding any other provision of\nthis section, no inmate has a right to be housed in a double-cell or to be\nhoused in a double-cell with a particular inmate. An inmate's request to be\nhoused in a double-cell or to be housed in a double-cell with a particular\ninmate can be denied by the deputy superintendent for security or designee in\nthe exercise of his or her sound discretion.
