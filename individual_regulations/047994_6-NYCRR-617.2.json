(h) Conditioned negative declaration\n(CND)\nmeans a negative declaration issued by a lead agency for an\n\nUnlisted action, involving an applicant, in which the action as initially\nproposed may result in one or more significant adverse environmental impacts; however, mitigation measures identified and required by the lead agency, pursuant to the procedures in section\n617.7\n(d) of this Part, will modify the proposed action so that no significant adverse\nenvironmental impacts will result. (i) Critical environmental area\n(CEA)\nmeans a specific geographic area having exceptional or unique\nenvironmental characteristics that has been designated by a State or local\nagency pursuant to section\n617.14\nof this Part. (j) Department\nmeans the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation. (k) Direct action\nor\ndirectly undertaken action\nmeans an action planned and proposed for implementation by an agency. Direct actions\ninclude but are not limited to capital\nprojects, promulgation of agency rules, regulations, laws, codes, ordinances or\nexecutive orders and policy making that commit an agency to a course of action\nthat may affect the environment. (l) Environment\nmeans the\nphysical conditions that will be affected by a proposed action, including land, air, water, minerals, flora, fauna, noise, resources of agricultural, archeological, historic or aesthetic significance, existing patterns of\npopulation concentration, distribution or growth, existing community or\nneighborhood character, and human health. (m) Environmental assessment form\n(EAF)\nmeans a form used by an agency to assist it in determining the\nenvironmental significance of actions. A properly completed EAF must contain\nenough information to describe the proposed action, its location, its purpose\nand its potential impacts on the environment. The model full and short EAFs, contained in Appendices A and B of section\n617.20\nof this Part\nmay be modified by an agency to better serve it in implementing SEQR, provided\nthe scope of the modified form is as comprehensive as the model. (n) Environmental impact statement\n(EIS)\nmeans a written \"draft\" or \"final\" document prepared in\naccordance with sections\n617.9\nand\n617.10\nof this Part. An EIS provides a means for agencies, project sponsors and the\npublic to systematically consider significant adverse environmental impacts, alternatives and mitigation. An EIS facilitates the weighing of social, economic and environmental factors early in the planning and decision-making\nprocess. A draft EIS is the initial statement prepared by either the project\nsponsor or the lead agency and circulated for review and comment. An EIS may\nalso be a \"generic\" in accordance with section\n617.10\nof this Part, a \"supplemental\" in accordance with section\n617.9\n(a)(7)\nof this Part or a \"Federal\" document in accordance with section\n617.15\nof this Part.

(s) Impact\nmeans to change\nor to have an effect on any aspect(s) of the environment. (t) Involved agency\nmeans an\nagency that has jurisdiction by law to fund, approve or directly undertake an\naction. If an agency will ultimately make a discretionary decision to fund, approve or undertake an action, then it is an \"involved agency\" notwithstanding\nthat it has not received an application for funding or approval at the time the\nSEQR process is commenced. The lead agency is also an \"involved\nagency\". (u) Interested\nagency\nmeans an agency that lacks the jurisdiction to fund, approve or\ndirectly undertake an action but wishes to participate in the review process\nbecause of its specific expertise or concern about the proposed action. An\n\"interested agency\" has the same ability to participate in the review process\nas a member of the public. (v) Lead agency\nmeans an involved agency principally responsible\nfor undertaking, funding or approving an action, and therefore responsible for\ndetermining whether an environmental impact statement is required in connection\nwith the action, and for the preparation and filing of the statement if one is\nrequired.

Scoping, which is not\nlimited to the analysis of potentially significant issues identified in the\nEAF, provides a project sponsor with a written outline of topics that must be\nconsidered and provides an opportunity for early participation by involved\nagencies and the public in the review of the proposal. (ah)\n\nSegmentation\nmeans the\ndivision of the environmental review of an action such that various activities\nor stages are addressed under this Part as though they were independent, unrelated activities, needing individual determinations of\nsignificance.
