Tit. 9 § 7842.1 - Purpose and scope\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\npeople's right to know the process of government decision making and the\ndocuments and statistics leading to determinations is basic to our society. Accordingly, the board's policy with respect to requests for its records is\nthat disclosure is the rule and withholding is the exception. All records not\nexempt from disclosure will be made available. (b) The board shall furnish to the public the\ninformation and records required by the Freedom of Information Law (article 6\nof the Public Officers Law), as well as records otherwise available by\nlaw. (c) Any conflicts among laws\ngoverning public access to records shall be construed in favor of the widest\npossible availability of public records. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n7842.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
