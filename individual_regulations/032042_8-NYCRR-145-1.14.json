  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 145-1.14 - Reawards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An academic\nperformance award offered to an alternate after relinquishment of the award by\nthe original holder shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as\napplied to the original holder. In particular, if the reaward is made after the\neffective date of the award, the alternate shall be eligible to receive such\naward only if he began approved study on the effective date of the award, or\nwould have been entitled to a leave of absence for such period. However, if the\nalternate has, subsequent to the effective date, entered upon study in a school\nor in a program not approved for the reaward, then the reaward shall be offered\ninstead to the next eligible alternate. (b) If a person who has declined an academic\nperformance award should rescind such declination during the period authorized\nby law for reawards, such person shall be restored to the alternate list and\nshall receive appropriate consideration for subsequent reawards that may become\navailable. No additional scholarship can be created for such purpose except in\nthe case of administrative error. Should such declination be rescinded after\nthe final date established for reawards, and should the declination have been\nmade originally through error or oversight on the part of the student, in the\njudgment of the commissioner, then a reaward may be made if there is an\navailable scholarship in such scholarship series that has not yet been\naccepted, provided that payment of scholarship benefits can begin only with the\nacademic year in which such reaward is made. (c) If the recipient of an academic\nperformance award has matriculated for the first semester following the\neffective date of the award, but the award is subsequently relinquished or\nrevoked for reasons that make the recipient ineligible for any payment under\nthat award for such semester, then such award shall be available for reaward to\nan alternate during the remaining period for reawards established by\nlaw. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8\n§§\n145-1.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
