  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5008.5 - Miscellaneous\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All number\nselections or other information appearing on any Lotto bet ticket shall be\ndeemed to be made or given exclusively by the player. Where one person submits\na ticket as agent or nominee for another person or persons, the commission\nshall not be deemed to have any knowledge of such transaction, and all dealings\nof the commission will be conducted solely with the bearer of the\nticket. (b) No claimant will be\nconsidered eligible to receive a prize without presentation of a valid winning\nbet ticket. (c) The commission\nreserves the right to change the prize structures, frequency of draws, draw\ndates, or the games themselves, and any such changes shall be publicly\nannounced in advance by the commission. Any public announcement provided for in\nthis Part shall be made in a news release, an advertisement, on the commission\nwebsite, or in such other form as the commission, in the commission's\ndiscretion, may prescribe to maximize public awareness. (d) If for any reason, a bet ticket is not\nentirely legible or is misprinted or altered in any way, then the computer\nrecord created at the time of sale will be the sole method of determining\nwhether such ticket is a valid winning ticket and whether a first prize shall\nbe payable in installments or as a lump sum. (e) Lotto bet tickets may not be canceled\nonce issued by the computer terminal. However, the agent may receive credit for\nany unreadable bet tickets issued, as these tickets (although unreadable) are\nrecorded on the computer file as valid bets. (f) If an agent applies for credit for an\nunreadable bet ticket and it is determined that such ticket would have\nqualified for a prize, the commission may make a proportionate reduction in the\nnumber of shares into which the prize money for that prize category is divided, thereby increasing the value of the prize available for each qualifying game\npanel. (g) When any question shall\narise as to the validity of a Lotto drawing for any reason whatsoever, the\ncommission shall make the determination as to the validity of said drawing on\nthe basis of the information at the commission's disposal. The determination of\nthe commission shall be a final determination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5008.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
