  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 97.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapter 864 of the Laws of 1985 amended section\n4240\nof the Insurance Law (relating to separate accounts) to add to the circumstances in which an insurance company may guarantee the value of assets allocated to a separate account, or any interest therein, or the investment results thereof. The amendment allows such a guarantee to be made if the insurance company submits annually to the superintendent an opinion and memorandum of a qualified actuary, in form and substance satisfactory to the superintendent, that, after taking into account any risk charge payable from the assets of the separate account with respect to such guarantee, the assets in the separate account make good and sufficient provision for the liabilities of the insurance company with respect thereto. (b) Section\n4240\nof the Insurance Law was also amended to permit the insurance company to value the assets allocated to such a separate account at their market value, and section 4217 was amended to authorize the valuation of the benefits funded by the separate account on a consistent basis. (c) The purpose of this Part is to prescribe: (1)\nthe terms and conditions under which life insurance companies may issue contracts (of the kind described in section\n97.2\n[a]\nof this Part) that: (i) are funded by separate accounts in which assets are valued at market; and\n(ii)\nprovide for fixed or guaranteed minimum benefits; (2)\nthe procedures for establishing and maintaining such separate accounts; and\n(3)\nthe reserve requirements for such contracts and agreements.
