The acknowledgment shall include a\nbrief explanation of the reason for delay and an estimate of the date that the\nproduction or denial of the request will be forthcoming.

(ii)\n\nThe\nrequested records for which the department is the legal custodian cannot be\nfound after a search for such records has been conducted with due\ndiligence. (7)\n\nThe\npublic access officer may upon request certify that a transcript is a true copy\nof the record copied. (d) The records access officer shall delete\nidentifying details or particulars in order to prevent any possible unwarranted\ninvasion of privacy as prescribed by the Freedom of Information Law. He shall\nbe prohibited from disclosing any and all such other details and particulars as\nprescribed by such law; the Tax Law; any other laws of the State of New York or\nthe United States; or any agreements between the State of New York and another\nstate or the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities.
