  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.9 - Wasted areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Shells, drums and headers. Wasted areas in stayed and unstayed shells, drums\nand headers may be built up by welding provided that in the judgment of the\nauthorized inspector the strength of the structure will not be impaired. Where\nextensive weld build-up is employed, the authorized inspector may require an\nappropriate method of nondestructive examination for the complete surface of\nthe repair. Wasted areas shall be built up by welding as specified in Figure\n14-3.9(1) or by other equivalent methods. (b) Access openings. Wasted areas around\naccess openings may be built up by welding provided that in the judgment of the\ninspector the strength of the structure will not be impaired, or they shall be\nrepaired as specified in Figure 14-3.9(2) or by other equivalent methods. The\narea to be repaired may not be closer than two inches from any\nknuckle. (c) Flanges. (1)\n\nWasted flange faces may be cleaned\nthoroughly and built up with weld metal. Built-up flange faces should be\nmachined in place, if possible, and shall be machined to a thickness not less\nthan that of the original flange or that required by calculations in accordance\nwith the provisions of the applicable section of the ASME Code. (2)\n\nWasted flanges may also be remachined in\nplace without building up with weld metal provided the metal removed in the\nprocess does not reduce the thickness of the flange to a measurement below that\ncalculated above. Flanges which leak because of warpage or distortion and which\ncannot be remachined shall be replaced with new flanges which have at least the\ndimensions conforming to the applicable section of the ASME Code. (d) Tubes. Wasted areas on tubes\nmay be repaired by welding provided that in the judgment of the inspector the\nstrength of the tube has not been impaired. Where deemed necessary, competent\ntechnical advice shall be obtained from the manufacturer or from another\nqualified source. This may be necessary when considering such items as size\nlimitations of repaired areas, minimum tube thickness to be repaired, tube\nenvironment, location of the tube in the boiler and other similar\nconditions. (e) The building up or\nrepair by welding of rivet heads, staybolt ends, braces or attachments to\nbraces, ogee sheets, grooved, pitted or corroded areas of unstayed surfaces\nother than as provided above is prohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
