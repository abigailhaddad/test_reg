  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 2188.5 - Threshold Eligibility Requirements for LIHTC Allocation\n\nState Regulations\n\nAt each stage of processing, applications will be subject\nto a threshold eligibility review, which will include, but not necessarily be\nlimited to, whether the project meets the following minimum\nrequirements: (a) The applicant is\nwilling to enter into a regulatory agreement with HFA requiring the project to\nconform to the income, occupancy and rent restrictions of IRC section\n42. (b) The applicant is willing to\nenter into a regulatory agreement with HFA for extended Low-Income use of the\nproject with a minimum extended use period, ending no earlier than 30 years\nafter the project is placed in service, or a later date which the agency may\nestablish, that is in conformance with the requirements of IRC section 42, includes an agreement to waive the right to request a qualified contract and\nprovides that the extended use period will not be subject to early termination\npursuant to the qualified contract provisions of the Code. The regulatory\nagreement shall include provisions requiring that project reserves must be used\nto maintain the property, benefit its residents, and remain with the project\nthroughout the extended use period except as otherwise consented to by the\nagency. The regulatory agreement shall provide that if a Qualified\n\nNonprofit Organization (as defined in IRC section 42(h)(5)(C)) is involved in\nthe project (as described in IRC section 42(h)(5)(B)) or if the tenants of the\nproject otherwise hold a right of first refusal pursuant to IRC section\n42(i)(7) then a right of first refusal agreement (\"ROFR Agreement\") must be\nentered into in such form as may be approved by the agency. The agency recognizes that no Federal income tax benefit\nshall fail to be allowable to the taxpayer with respect to any qualified\n\nLow-Income building merely by reason of a right of first refusal (\"ROFR\") held\nby the tenants (in cooperative form or otherwise) or resident management\ncorporation of such building or by a Qualified Nonprofit Organization (as\ndefined in IRC section 42(h)(5)(C)) pursuant to IRC section 42(i)(7). Any\nproject in which a Qualified Nonprofit Organization is involved (within the\nmeaning of IRC section 42(h)(5)(B)) shall enter into a ROFR Agreement which\ncomplies with the terms of IRC section 42(i)(7). Projects in which a Qualified Nonprofit Organization (as\nset forth in IRC section 42(i)(7)) intends to exercise its ROFR pursuant to IRC\nsection 42(i)(7), as amended from time to time, must enter into a ROFR\nAgreement which meets the requirements of this section. The ROFR Agreement must\nstate that the parties thereto agree that the right of first refusal\ncontemplated in such ROFR Agreement and allowed for under IRC section 42(i)(7)\ndoes not require nor will it be conditioned upon a bona fide third-party offer, as otherwise may be required under law, including statutory, court-interpreted, or common law. The ROFR Agreement must state that the intent of the parties is\nthat the seller is a willing seller under the terms of the ROFR Agreement. The\nROFR Agreement must state the ROFR may be exercised at any time after the close\nof the Compliance Period. Once exercised, the Qualified Nonprofit Organization\nshall have at least 12 months to close on the purchase of the project or the\ninterests of the non-managing members or partners in the project's ownership\nentity or entities. The ROFR Agreement shall state that, with the written\nconsent of the agency, the Qualified Nonprofit Organization may assign the ROFR\nAgreement to another Qualified Nonprofit Organization which may include a\nrelated party. Consent to such sale by the other members, partners, or other\nentities holding an ownership interest in the project shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld, conditioned, or delayed, nor withheld for a non-material breach of\nthe project's organizational documents. The ROFR Agreement must state there are\nno other conditions to the exercise of the ROFR except as explicitly identified\nin the ROFR Agreement. The purchase price to exercise the ROFR set forth in the\nROFR Agreement shall be calculated in accord with the minimum purchase price\npursuant to IRC section 42(i)(7)(B). Any additional amounts added to such\npurchase price will be subject to the agency's consent and approval prior to\nthe exercise of the ROFR. The agency's review in connection with issuance of\nsuch consent to any such additional amounts shall be for the purpose of\nmaintaining the long-term financial stability and affordability of the project. The ROFR Agreement shall state that in the event that IRC section 42(i)(7) is\namended to provide for an option to purchase, as opposed to or in addition to a\nright of first refusal, the Qualified Nonprofit Organization may elect to\nexercise such option in the manner allowed under the Code, notwithstanding\nanything set forth in the ROFR Agreement. The ROFR Agreement shall require the\nagency's consent for any material amendments thereto or assignments\nthereof. Projects in which a Qualified Nonprofit Organization (as\ndefined in IRC section 42(h)(5)(C)) intends to exercise its ROFR based on IRC\nsection 42(i)(7), as may be amended from time to time, must submit a letter of\nintent from a tax credit investor in which the investor agrees and certifies\nthat it will enter into a ROFR Agreement, with the approval of the agency, which grants a right of first refusal to the Qualified Nonprofit Organization\nto purchase the project and which complies with the provisions of this section. Projects in which a Qualified Nonprofit Organization does not hold an ownership\ninterest and is not otherwise involved (as described in IRC section\n42(h)(5)(B)) but instead tenants in the project (organized in cooperative or\nother form) or a partner, member or other entity in the project ownership\nstructure intends to exercise a ROFR must submit a letter of intent from a tax\ncredit investor in which the investor agrees and certifies it will enter into a\nROFR Agreement with such entity, which grants a ROFR to such entity to purchase\nthe project, in such form as may be approved by and consented to by the\nagency. (c) The applicant\nagrees to comply with all applicable Federal and State fair housing laws and\nregulations and not to engage in any illegal discriminatory conduct including\ndiscrimination against section 8 voucher tenants. (d) The project receives an acceptable\n\nFinancial Feasibility Review and underwrites in accordance with the applicable\nHFA underwriting criteria including meeting any criteria limiting costs, fees\nor expenses contained in the QAP and/or any additional agency guidance, which\nmay include a pertinent term sheet. The Financial Feasibility Review will be\nconducted using the standards in the QAP and/or any additional agency guidance, which may include a pertinent Term Sheet. (e) The eligible basis of all the buildings\nin a project divided by the number of units in a project, prior to any increase\nfor buildings in high cost areas under section 42(d)(5)(B), in the applicant's\nrequest for LIHTC and/or in any cost certification to support the allocation of\nsuch LIHTC, does not exceed the per unit eligible basis limit or the eligible\nbasis has been reduced to the maximum eligible basis permitted by the per unit\neligible basis limit under section\n2188.3\n(e)(1)(ii) and\n(f)(1)\nof this Part. This requirement may be\nwaived by the agency, if the agency determines that it is in the public\ninterest to recognize a greater amount of eligible basis per unit. (f) The project is of the appropriate type\n(new construction, substantial rehabilitation, moderate rehabilitation and/or\nacquisition) and design needed to address the housing needs in the area where\nproject is located. (g) The size of\nthe units in the proposed project must be appropriate for the type of occupancy\nproposed. (h) The applicant has\nsite control, consistent with the Code, for the project real estate through a\nlease, option, purchase contract or deed. (i) At the time of application, the project\napplicant has identified all required governmental approvals necessary to\nconstruct and operate the project. At each subsequent stage of processing, the\napplicant must secure all required governmental approvals to construct and\noperate the project. (j) The\nproject applicant has successfully developed and operated projects comparable\nto the proposed project and/or has, or will obtain, the capacity and experience\nto undertake, complete and operate the proposed project. (k) The agency has, prior to the second LIHTC\nunderwriting, completed a credit and background review of the project\ndeveloper, owner and/or manager and their principals with acceptable\nresults.

The project\ndeveloper, owner and/or manager and their principals also does not include\nanyone who, in sole judgement of the agency, has initiated or been the decision\nmaker in requesting a qualified contract under section 42(h)(6)(F) after May\n26, 2021. The project developer, owner and/or manager and their principals must\ninform the agency in a timely manner of any notice of non-compliance issued at\nany time. (m) An independent, third-party appraisal conducted by a New York State licensed appraiser, and\ncommissioned by the credit enhancement provider is required and subject to HFA\nreview and approval. The project's acquisition cost as set forth in the\nappraisal must be the lesser of the actual acquisition cost or the value\nsupported by an as-is value and should distinctly separate the value attributed\nto the land allowing for a clear assessment of the land's contribution to the\noverall cost. The appraisal must be consistent with the analysis of rents and\noperating expenses presented in the application. If necessary, an independent\nmarket study may be requested, at HFA's sole discretion.

(q) The project's design and construction\nmust comply with both HCR's design guidelines and sustainability guidelines, as\nappropriate for the type of building proposed as may also be set forth in a\nrequest for proposals and /or other agency guidance, which may include a\npertinent Term Sheet. Rehabilitation projects must take into account, among\nother factors, cost effectiveness based on the scope of reconstruction\nnecessary and the historic nature of the project. All projects must identify\nhow sustainability requirements will be met and agree to provide, prior to\nconstruction closing, a certification from a responsible green and/or energy\nprofessional that the project will meet such requirements. (r) The project's design and construction\nmust provide for a percentage of accessible units for persons with mobility and\nhearing/vision impairments as defined in HCR's design guidelines, request for\nproposals and/or other agency guidance, which may include a pertinent Term\n\nSheet. (s) All LIHTC-assisted first\nfloor units in new construction projects without an elevator, all LIHTC\nassisted units in new construction projects with an elevator, and as many\nLIHTC-assisted units as feasible in adaptive reuse or rehabilitation projects\nshall meet Visitability Standards, except when such standards are demonstrated\nto be irreconcilable with Federal, State or local statutes, regulations, ordinances or codes. (t) The\napplicant will agree to permit HFA to commission a cost audit of all the\nproject related costs, agree to permit the agency to commission an energy and\ngreen performance audit and include a provision in all contracts with\ncontractors, design professionals and consultants that permits the agency's\nauditors to examine the books and records relevant to the project.
