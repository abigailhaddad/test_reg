  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8.169 - Executive Order No. 169: State Policy Concerning Voter Registration\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, suffrage is a fundamental right that the Supreme\n\nCourt has rightly labeled \"preservative of all rights\"; and\nWHEREAS, New York State has historically led the nation in\nprotecting fundamental rights, yet voter participation rates in the State\nremain stubbornly low; and\nWHEREAS, maximized participation in elections is an\nindisputably desirable hallmark of democracy; and\nWHEREAS, New Yorkers may lack access to voter registration\nforms or be unaware of voter registration requirements; and\nWHEREAS, the State possesses expertise, resources, and\ninfrastructure that uniquely qualifies it to assist New Yorkers with voter\nregistration. NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: A.

The following\nprocedures are hereby established to implement the program of voter\nregistration\n1.

State\nentities which have regular contact with the public in their daily\nadministration of business shall make mail registration forms available to\npersons who are interested in registering to vote, and shall make staff\navailable to assist the public in filling out the mail registration forms; and\nb. State entities shall send\nmail registration forms and related information to persons whose mailing\ninformation is held by the entity in question. The transmission of such mail\nregistration forms to such persons shall occur electronically or by mail, as\nappropriate. 2. All\nin-person voter registration projects subject to Section B(1)(a) above shall be\nconducted in the public areas of State entities. 3. Each State entity involved in a voter\nregistration project, after consultation with the Governor's Office of Employee\n\nRelations as appropriate, shall make employees available to administer the\n\nState entity's voter registration project, and shall appoint a coordinator for\nthat State entity responsible for the implementation and reporting of the voter\nregistration program. 4. Employees\ninvolved in a voter registration project shall assist persons interested in\nregistering to vote by explaining the mail registration process and the\nquestions contained on the mail registration form in accordance with the\nguidelines of this Order. 5. Each\n\nState entity involved in the voter registration project conducted pursuant to\nthis section shall, at the next regularly scheduled printing of its intake\nform, amend such form to include the following statement: \"If you are not registered to vote at your current address\nyou may receive a registration form here today. You may receive government\nservices without being registered to vote. Would you like a registration form?\nYes - No.\"\n6. In the period\nbetween the signing of this Order and the amending of a State entity's intake\nform, each State entity's intake personnel shall, after appropriate training, routinely inquire of persons seeking services from the State entity whether\nsuch persons would like to register to vote. If the applicant answers\naffirmatively either orally or by checking the appropriate section of a State\nentity's amended intake form, the employee shall hand the applicant a voter\nregistration form, offer assistance in filling it out, and direct the applicant\nto the nearest mailbox. Such employee shall not take custody of a completed\nvoter registration form. 7.

In\ncoordination with the New York State Director of State Operations and in\nconsultation with the New York State Board of Elections, each State entity\nconducting a voter registration project shall develop and prominently display\npromotional materials informing the public of the existence of voter\nregistration services. 9.
