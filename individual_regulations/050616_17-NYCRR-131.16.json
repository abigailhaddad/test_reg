Tit. 17 § 131.16 - Permits and agreements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following permits and agreements are issued by the\ndepartment for all utilities, including utilities owned by\nmunicipalities. (a) Highway work\npermit. All individual elements of a utility facility which are to be\nconstructed, removed, relocated, replaced, reconstructed, maintained or\nadjusted, whether in conjunction with or independent of a transportation\nproject, either within or via access from the highway rights-of-way, require\nsubmission of a \"Highway Work Permit Application for Utility Work\" and the\nissuance of a \"Highway Work Permit\" prior to commencement of any work. In New\n\nYork City, a City highway work permit is also required. (b) Utility work agreement. If the utility\nwork is to be included as a part of a State contract, or is to be undertaken by\nthe utility or contractor to the utility in conjunction with a State project, a\n\"Utility Work Agreement\" is also required. This agreement is required whether\nor not the work is reimbursable. The utility work agreement must be executed\nprior to the letting of the State's construction contract and any required\ndeposits must be made to the State Comptroller in accordance with the Highway\n\nLaw. This agreement provides for accommodating the specified utility facility\nwithin the highway rights-of-way, sets forth who is financially responsible for\nthe utility adjustment, and makes possible Federal participation where\napplicable. The completed form is to contain special notes--\"Coordination with\n\nUtility Schedule\", and time schedules for relocating utility facilities\naffected by State transportation projects. It is important that reasonable\nschedules and deadlines be established for the performance of utility\nrelocation work, pursuant to the requirements of section\n11-102\nof the General Obligations\n\nLaw. (c) Agreement of\nreimbursement. Work reimbursable by law requires an agreement of reimbursement. Agreements of reimbursement include municipal agreements, interstate\nagreements, right-of-way agreements of adjustment, and other agreements\nprovided by law. (d) Use and\noccupancy agreement. The use and occupancy agreement provides the conditions\nfor the occupation of the right-of-way and is required for all utilities, except municipally owned utilities. (e) General operating agreement. A document\nproviding for long-term cooperation and coordination, and for advance payments\nto utilities for reimbursable work. (f) Annual work permit. Annual work permits\nare available on a region-wide basis for the maintenance of a utility's\nfacilities. Examples of work which can be performed under this permit include\npruning of trees, emergency repairs, routine maintenance and service\nconnections. Examples of work not authorized by this permit, and requiring a\nhighway work permit include replacement of poles, or other utility facilities\nwhich are obsolete or near life expectancy. (g) Pipeline installation. The highway work\npermit application for pipeline installations shall additionally specify the\nclass of transmittant, the maximum working test or design pressures, the design\nstandards for the carrier, as well as other project specific information. Any\nchange in class of transmittants or the pressures of transmittants requires\nprior notice to and approval by the department. (h) Specific requirements. Highway work\npermits and use and occupancy permits are subject to applicable provisions in\n\nParts 126 through 131, and the department and the utility will discuss and\nattempt to mutually agree upon permit conditions, permit requirements and\nmethod of construction. (i) Owners\nof adjoining property. Nothing contained herein, nor any permit issued pursuant\nto these regulations shall be deemed to authorize any interference with the\nproperty rights of abutting landowners, including, but not limited to rights\nwith respect to trees and other vegetation, and with entry upon private\nproperty. Permittees shall be required to obtain such permission or\nauthorization as may be required by law, prior to undertaking any activity\nwhich would require permission or authorizations from the owners of properties\noutside the rights-of-way. (j) Site\ncare and restoration. Permittees must conduct operations within the\nright-of-way in a manner so as to minimize damage to the natural condition of\nthe landscape. Clearing operations shall be minimized in scope and conducted\nwith care. All plant material shall be pruned consistent with current\narborticultural practices. Deposit of an undertaking or bond or certified check\nto guarantee site restoration, in an amount determined by the department, may\nbe required. A restoration plan, commensurate with the scale of work shall\naccompany the permit application. If the department is required to perform site\nrestoration work, its cost will be deducted from the deposit. (k) Conduct of work and final approval. The\ndepartment reserves the right to timely inspect work during construction to\ninsure conformance with the terms of the permit and this Part. Upon completion\nof the work and notification by the permittee, the department shall have the\nright to make a final inspection. If the work has been satisfactorily\nperformed, the permit will be closed and any excess funds on deposit will be\nreturned. For major installations and adjustments and for all underground\ninstallations and adjustments, as-built plans must be submitted. The department\nmay require certification by a licensed New York State professional engineer\nthat the installation conforms with the terms of the permit. Permittee will be\nadvised of deficiencies for immediate correction. Unfinished or unsatisfactory\nwork which permittee refuses to correct will be completed by the department, or\nby permittee's bonding company. Costs of such work and inspection are the\nresponsibility of permittee. If the work of the permittee was not performed in\naccordance with the as-built plans or deficiencies in such work were made or\ndamage caused to persons or entities other than the permittee by the\nperformance of such work, and such is not readily apparent in connection with\nany such inspection, the permittee shall continue to be liable for the costs of\nsuch unfinished, unsatisfactory work or damage caused by such work of the\npermittee. (l) The erection of a\nutility facility within the highway right-of-way not in accordance with a\npermit issued pursuant to this Part, or the failure to remove, relocate, modify, shield or adjust a utility facility within the highway right-of-way\nupon the direction of the department shall constitute a violation of section\n52\nof the Highway\n\nLaw, and shall subject the utility to such fines as provided therein.
