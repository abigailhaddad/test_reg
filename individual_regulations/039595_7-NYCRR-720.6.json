  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 720.6 - Inmate-to-inmate correspondence\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The superintendent or chief administrator at each facility may designate a\nstaff member to process inmate-to-inmate correspondence requests. (b) These requests will be investigated by\nboth facilities to determine that the exchange of such correspondence will not\ncreate problems relating to the safety, security, or good order of the\nfacilities, or the safety or well-being of any individual before any\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence is authorized. (c) Authorization for such correspondence\nmust come from the involved superintendents or their designees. (1)\n\nException. Only the approval of the\nsuperintendent of the facility where the state inmate is housed is required\nwhen a state inmate requests to correspond with an inmate in the custody of the\n\nNew York City department of corrections. This exception is based on the New\n\nYork City department of corrections' policy which permits inmates to write to\nwhomever they choose, including other inmates. (2)\n\nRestrictions. Inmates are only permitted\nto correspond with immediate family members and codefendants in active cases. Immediate family members are defined as spouses, children, parents, siblings, and grandparents. Other inmate-to-inmate correspondence may only be approved in\nexceptional circumstances. Changes to the inmate-to-inmate correspondence lists\nare permitted only on a quarterly basis at the time of the inmate's scheduled\ninterview. Photographs should not be included in inmate-to-inmate\ncorrespondence. (3)\n\nTransfer of\ninmates. When an inmate is transferred, his/her approval to correspond with\nother inmates will remain in effect. The guidance staff at the receiving\nfacility will notify the correspondence unit of the names of inmates with\napprovals for inmate-to-inmate correspondence. (d) Denial and withdrawal of authorization. (1)\n\nDenial of authorization. Denials of\nauthorization for inmate-to-inmate correspondence shall include a statement of\nreasons for the denial, and shall be placed in both inmates' files. A denial of\nauthorization may be appealed to the commissioner or his designee, in writing, within 30 days. (2)\n\nWithdrawal of\nauthorization. Authorization to correspond may be withdrawn by a superintendent\nin a particular case when it is demonstrated and documented that one or both\ninmates have violated facility or department rules and regulations, that the\nreason for the original approval no longer applies or has been determined to\nhave been erroneous or deceptive, that the safety, security or good order of a\nfacility is jeopardized, or that the safety or well being of any individual is\njeopardized. Documentation shall be placed in both inmates' files. (e) Inmate-to-inmate\ncorrespondence must not be sealed. If it is sealed, it may be opened and\nreturned to the inmate sender. (f) Inmate-to-inmate correspondence may be read by a superintendent (or his/her\ndesignee) of either the sending or receiving facility or by both. No\ninmate-to-inmate correspondence shall be deemed in any way to be privileged\ncorrespondence. (g) There shall be\nno exchange of funds or packages between inmates without the specific approval\nof their respective facility superintendent(s). Transfers are limited to gifts\nbetween inmates related to each other. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
