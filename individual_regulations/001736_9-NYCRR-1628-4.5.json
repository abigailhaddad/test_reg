  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1628-4.5 - Payments due suppliers or contractors\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payment due suppliers or contractors\nshould be processed as promptly as possible and within the cash discount\nperiod, if applicable. Payment vouchers must be substantiated by receiving\nreport or other document signed by authorized personnel, preferably by employee\nother than person signing the payment voucher and indicating that supplies or\nservices were received as ordered. If there are any discrepancies, shortages, defective material, etc., payment must be withheld until matter is\nsatisfactorily adjusted. However, in such cases, the supplier or contractor\nshould be notified promptly so that corrective action can be taken\nimmediately. (b) Invoices must show\nadequate details of the charges. Invoices for work on a time and material basis\nwill list labor separately from materials and will show dates and number of\nhours worked and hourly rate of pay. (c) Any tax from which the authority is\nexempt must be excluded from any payments to suppliers or contractors. Tax\nexemptions are listed in Subpart 1640-6 of the accounting manual (Subchapter D\nof this Chapter). It is recommended that gasoline purchases for authority's\nautomotive equipment be on the basis of credit card obtained from the gasoline\ncompany whose products are normally used. The monthly billing from the gasoline\ncompany will show the tax deductions for purchases being billed. (d) Special attention should be paid to\npayments for fuel oil. Fuel oil contracts usually include a clause providing\nfor price adjustments. These adjustments are generally based on prevailing\nprices posted in the New York Journal of Commerce. The Bureau of Management\nissues a memorandum of such prices at the end of any month in which there is a\nprice change. The price shown on the contractor's invoice should be checked\nagainst the posted price on the day of delivery, as shown in the division's\nlisting, adjusted by the constant differential stated in the contract. The\nquantity of fuel oil should be checked at each delivery. Printed meter delivery\nshould be double checked by comparing with the quantity by which the amount in\nthe storage tank is increased, either by stick reading or liquidometer reading. Nonmetered deliveries should be checked by ascertaining the quantity in the\ntruck's tank or compartment at start of delivery and the quantity, if any, remaining at the end of the delivery. The calibration chart for the tank or\ncompartment, required to be carried on the truck, should be used to convert the\nmeasured reading into gallons. Deliveries of preheated fuel oil require\ntemperature correction to 60° F by reference to the standard table\nestablished for this purpose. The quantity delivered should be further checked\nby comparing with the increased quantity in the storage tank. (e) Prior written approval by the division is\nrequired for final payments of contracts for occasional requirements (see\nsection\n1628-4.3\nof this Subpart). Final\npayment is the payment of the full amount of the contract, or the remaining\nbalance, due upon satisfactory completion of the total contract or purchase. The following documents, properly executed, and reviewed and approved by\nauthority counsel as to form, will be included with letter requesting division\napproval for final payment: (1)\n\nCertificate\nand release--three copies. (2)\n\nRequest for payment (final payment)--three copies. (3)\n\nOne copy of each request for payment\n(partial payment), if any. (4)\n\nOne\ncopy of each change order, if any. (f) Partial payments may be made if the\namount, duration or other conditions of the contract or purchase warrant such\npayments. Request for payment (partial payment) will be prepared in triplicate\nto reflect the work or deliveries on which payment is being based. On all\npartial payments the authority will retain 10 percent of the sum which\nrepresents the completed work or deliveries where there is no payment or\nperformance bond. If a payment or performance bond is provided then the\nauthority will retain five percent of the sum which represents the completed\nwork or deliveries. Partial payments do not require submission to the division\nfor approval but do require the signature of the authorized representative of\nthe division who will check the work or deliveries covered by the request for\npayment (partial payment) and approve the payment. However, a copy of each such\nrequest for payment (partial payment) will be included in the documents\nforwarded for division approval of final payment. When partial payments are\nplanned, unit prices should be specified in the contract or order, or else a\nschedule of amounts for contract payments should be prepared, so that mutually\nsatisfactory unit prices for completed work or deliveries are established with\nthe contractor prior to the first partial payment. (g) Advance notice of completed work or\ndeliveries on which partial or final payment is desired should be given to the\ndivision as soon as possible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
