  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2J.101 - Specific Service Ramp Signs (NYI8-1, NYI8-1a)\n\nState Regulations\n\nSupport: 01 Specific Service Ramp (NYI8-1and NYI8-1a) signs (see\n\nSign Drawing SD-G9) are for use on freeway exit ramps, as necessary, to provide\nguidance to service facilities appearing on Specific Service signs on the\nmainline freeway. Guidance: 02 A separate Specific Service Ramp sign should be\ndisplayed for each service category. A Specific Service Ramp Sign should be\nused only where directional guidance, using Tourist-Oriented Directional signs\nor other forms of guidance, exists at all subsequent turns or critical decision\npoints. 03 Specific Service Ramp signs should be spaced at least\n100 feet from the exit gore sign, from each other, and from the ramp\nterminal. Standard: 04 At single-exit interchanges, Specific Service Ramp signs\nshall be installed along the ramp or at the ramp terminal for facilities that\nhave logo sign panels displayed along the main roadway if the facilities are\nnot readily visible from the ramp terminal. Directions to the service\nfacilities shall be indicated by arrows on the ramp signs. 05 The top line on each Specific Service Ramp sign shall\ncontain the category of the business appearing on the sign (i.e., GAS, FOOD, LODGING, CAMPING, or ATTRACTIONS). 06 The logo sign panels (NYI8-4) used on Specific Service\n\nRamp signs shall be duplicates of those displayed on the Specific Service signs\nlocated in advance of the interchange, but shall be reduced to a size of 24\" x\n15\", as shown in Sign Drawing SD-G9. 07 No more than four logo sign panels shall be displayed on\na NYI8-1 sign. Where more than four facilities in a particular service category\nare signed, a NYI8-1a sign shall be used to display all of the logo sign panels\nin that category. Guidance: 08 The arrows on the Specific Service Ramp sign should\npoint in the general direction to be followed in turning onto the intersecting\nhighway. Vertical and diagonal arrows, where used, should be similar to those\nused on Destination signs (see Section\n2D.37\n), except that they should\nhave wider shafts. Arrows pointing to the right of vertical should be on the\nright side of the sign. Arrows pointing to the left of vertical should be on\nthe left side of the sign. Businesses to the left should appear above\nbusinesses to the right. Where more than one business lies in the same\ndirection, those closer should appear above those more distant. Distances to\nbusinesses should be displayed within the arrows, and should be stated to the\nnearest mile. Where the stated distance would be less than one mile, it should\nbe omitted. Option: 09 Vertical arrows may be on either side of the sign, as\nappropriate. Guidance: 10 Specific Service Ramp signs should be placed along the\nleft side of the exit ramp in advance of the crossroad intersection. They\nshould be arranged so attractions, camping, lodging, food, and gas information\nwill be encountered in that order. 11 Where an assembly consisting of the D9-10 (see Section\n2I.02\n) and/or a D9-1, D9-2, D9-13, NYM11-2, NYM11-5, or NYM11-6 (see Section\n2I.02\n) is also used on the ramp, the Specific Service Ramp sign should be placed in advance of that\nassembly. Option: 12 Where left-side placement is not feasible, Specific\n\nService Ramp signs may be placed on the right side of the exit ramp. 13 If placement of all Specific Service Ramp signs in\nadvance of the crossroad intersection would result in inadequate longitudinal\nspacing, the last sign (or sign pair) in the series may be placed on the far\nside of the intersection. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2J.101\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
