  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 359.5 - Retroactive membership under section 803\n\nState Regulations\n\nSection\n803\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw provides public retirement systems with the authority to grant retroactive\nretirement system membership in connection with service rendered prior to April\n1, 1993, in appropriate cases. Assignment of a retroactive date of membership\nmay affect an individual's tier status in the retirement system. (a) Filing. A member must file an application for retroactive membership\non or before October 24, 1996. In order to ensure that there is no confusion\nbetween written \"inquiries\" and applications for benefits, applications for\nretroactive membership should be filed on forms provided by the retirement\nsystem for such purpose. Forms are available from the retirement system and\nfrom employers. A member may withdraw an application for retroactive transfer\nby requesting withdrawal in writing within 30 days following notification to\nthe member of the member costs of retroactive membership. (b) To be eligible for retroactive membership\nunder section\n803\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, an individual must be a member at the time application is made and must\nhave been a member on March 31, 1993. (c) Continuous service. In order to be eligible for retroactive membership under\nsection\n803\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, a member must have rendered \"continuous service\" from the membership date\nbeing sought under section 803 through the current date of membership, in a\nposition or positions which would have entitled the individual to join a public\nretirement system. For the purposes of section 803 only, service will be\nconsidered \"continuous\" with respect to any plan year in which the individual\nrendered at least 20 days of retirement system eligible service. With respect\nto the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System and the New York\n\nState and Local Police and Fire Retirement System, a plan year begins on April\nfirst and ends on the next following March 31st. Service which is otherwise\ncontinuous under this rule will be considered continuous despite one break in\nservice up to one plan year, or up to two plan years if the break in service is\ndue to the birth of a child, care for such child, or placement with the member\nof a child for adoption or foster care. (d) No previous opportunity to join the\nretirement system. Under section\n803\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, a member is not eligible for retroactive membership if such member was\npreviously afforded an actual opportunity to join or decline membership in the\nretirement system. (e) Employer affidavit. The employer which employed a section 803 applicant on the\ndate of retroactive membership being sought must file an affidavit with the\nretirement system on behalf of each section 803 applicant. The completed\naffidavit must indicate the dates of the member's employment, and whether the\nmember: (1)\nexpressly declined\nmembership in a form filed with that employer; or\n(2)\nparticipated in a program or procedure\nexplaining the option to join the retirement system in which a form, booklet, or other written material explaining the individual's right to join was read\nfrom, explained or distributed; or\n(3)\nparticipated in a program or procedure\nthat a reasonable person would recognize as an actual opportunity to join or\ndecline membership in the retirement system. The individual completing the affidavit shall also indicate\nwhether the employer has instituted a procedure under which an employee may\npresent evidence on the issue of whether he or she was afforded a previous\nopportunity to join or decline membership in the retirement system. An employer\nwho determines that an individual was afforded the previous opportunity to join\nor decline membership in the retirement system shall explain the basis of such\ndetermination and forward all pertinent evidence to the retirement system\ntogether with the completed affidavit. (f) Employer costs. An employer shall make an annual election whether to pay any\nrequired costs on account of individuals granted retroactive membership over\none year, five years or 10 years. One election shall cover all individuals\ngranted retroactive membership during a fiscal year. Such an election must be\nreceived by the retirement system within 30 days after receipt of a request to\nmake such an election. In the event no timely election is received, the\nemployer will be deemed to have elected to pay the costs attributable to\nmembers granted benefits during such fiscal year over a five-year\nperiod. (g) Retirement\nsystem administrative review. Where the employer, following the employer review process, determines and advises the retirement system that the member was afforded a\nprevious opportunity to join the retirement system, the retirement system shall\nnotify the applicant of this determination. Upon written request from the\napplicant, the retirement system shall administratively review the employer\ndetermination. Both the member and his or her employer shall be entitled to\nprovide evidence for the retirement system to consider during the\nadministrative review process. The retirement system shall establish a review\nboard, which shall consider such evidence and any evidence presented by the\nemployer pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section. The retirement system\nreview board may also request additional information from either or both of the\nparties. Following the conclusion of the administrative review process, the\nretirement system shall issue a final determination either approving or\ndisapproving the application for retroactive membership. An applicant or an\nemployer may request an administrative hearing and redetermination under\nsection\n74\nor section\n374\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, as appropriate, with respect to such final determination. Such a request\nmust be in writing, and received within four months from the date of the final\ndetermination. The employer and applicant shall be notified of and entitled to\nappear as interested parties at any hearing conducted pursuant to such a\nrequest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
