  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.4 - IFTA license and decals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 522 and 528(b)\n(a) (1)\nA\ncarrier operating or intending to operate a qualified motor vehicle in New York\n\nState and in one or more other IFTA jurisdictions must obtain an IFTA license\nand decals for each qualified motor vehicle operated or to be operated by the\ncarrier on the public highways of New York State. The carrier must apply to its\nbase jurisdiction for an IFTA license and decals. Provided, however, a carrier\nneed not obtain an IFTA license and decals if the carrier obtains a trip permit\nas provided in section\n491.6\nof\nthis Part. Where New York State is the base jurisdiction of a carrier (also\nreferred to herein as a New York-based carrier), the carrier must apply to the\ndepartment for an IFTA license and decals. (2)\nA carrier that has multiple fleets based\nin New York State and one or more other IFTA jurisdictions may elect to\nconsolidate its fleets in New York State for purposes of obtaining such\ncarrier's IFTA license and decals; provided New York State and such other\njurisdictions agree to such consolidation. (3)\n\nAn IFTA license and decals issued in\naccordance with the provisions of article 21-A of the Tax Law and this section, or in accordance with the laws of a carrier's base jurisdiction are separate\nand distinct from the highway use permits and stickers issued in accordance\nwith the provisions of article 21 of such law and Article 1 of this\n\nSubchapter. (b) (1)\n\nAn application for a New York IFTA\nlicense and decals must be made on the form prescribed by the department for\nsuch purpose and must contain all of the information required\ntherein. (2)\n\nAn application for a\n\nNew York IFTA license and decals must be mailed to the department at the\naddress indicated in the application. The application must be accompanied by\nthe decal fee of four dollars per decal, paid by check or money order, made\npayable, in United States funds, to the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. Two IFTA decals are required for each qualified motor vehicle in the carrier's\nfleet. A carrier may request decals in excess of the number of qualified motor\nvehicles in such carrier's fleet in order to have decals on hand for any\nadditional qualified motor vehicles added to such carrier's fleet. Provided, however, the carrier must maintain adequate records to verify the uses of such\ndecals. Any unused IFTA decals are not refundable or convertible at the end of\nthe calendar year for which they are issued. (c) (1)\n\nThe\ndepartment will review the information submitted by the carrier and will either\napprove or deny the application. Such an application may be denied for a\nviolation of any of the provisions of article 21 or 21-A of the Tax Law or of\nsection 301-h of article 13-A of such law, or any rule or regulation adopted\npursuant thereto. In the event that the application for an IFTA license and\ndecals is denied, the decal fees will be returned to the carrier. (2)\n\nUpon approval of the application, an IFTA\nlicense and two decals for each qualified motor vehicle for which an IFTA\nlicense and decals were requested in the application will be issued. The\nlicense and decals are valid for the calendar year to which they relate and\nmust be renewed annually by renewal application. (3)\n\nThe IFTA license must be reproduced by\nthe licensee and a reproduction carried in each qualified motor vehicle to be\noperated in New York State or any other IFTA jurisdiction. The original license\nshould be stored in a secure environment. The decals must be placed on the\nexterior portion of both sides of the cab. In the case of transporters, manufacturers, dealers, or drive-away operations, the decals need not be\npermanently affixed, but may be temporarily displayed in a visible manner on\nboth sides of the cab. (d) (1)\n\nFor\nthe calendar year 1996, an IFTA license and decals may be used on and after\n\nJanuary 1, 1996. Such license and decals must be used and displayed on and\nafter March 1, 1996. Carriers not displaying a valid IFTA license and decals\nuntil March 1, 1996, must still maintain the proper credentials for traveling\nin IFTA jurisdictions for the months of January and February, 1996. (2)\n\nFor calendar years beginning after\n\nDecember 31, 1996, carriers renewing their IFTA licenses and decals may use\nsuch IFTA credentials one month prior to the effective date shown on the\ncredentials. Further, in order to give ample opportunity for compliance with\nthe provisions of this section, an extension of time for the months of January\nand February of the current calendar year is granted for the use and display of\nthe prior calendar year IFTA license and decals. Thus, during the period\n\nDecember 1 of the calendar year prior to the current calendar year and through\nthe last day of February of the current calendar year, either the prior\ncalendar year or the current calendar year IFTA licenses and decals may\nlawfully be used and displayed.
