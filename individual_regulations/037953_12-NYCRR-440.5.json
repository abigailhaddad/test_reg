Tit. 12 § 440.5 - Fee schedule\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n(i) Prior to October 1, 2019, the maximum reimbursement or payment for prescription\ndrugs or medicines in uncontroverted cases, including all brand name and\ngeneric prescription drugs or medicines, shall be the Average Wholesale Price\nfor the national drug code for the prescription drug or medicine on the day it\nwas dispensed minus twelve percent of the Average Wholesale price plus a\ndispensing fee of four dollars for brand name drugs or medicines, minus twenty\npercent of the Average Wholesale Price plus a dispensing fee of five dollars\nfor generic drugs or medicines. (ii)\n\nOn or after October 1, 2019, the maximum\nreimbursement or payment for New York Workers' Compensation Formulary drugs or\nwhen applicable, drugs that received Prior Authorization in accordance with\nsection\n441.4\nof this Chapter, including\nall brand name and generic prescription drugs or medicines, shall be the lesser\nof the calculated cost, the contract price (for designated pharmacies), or the\nusual and customary price for the prescription drug or medication. (2)\n\nThe maximum reimbursement for\nprescription drugs or medicines dispensed in controverted cases during the\nperiod the case is controverted, including all brand name and generic\nprescription drugs or medicines, shall be twenty-five per cent more than the\ncalculated cost at the time the prescription drugs or medicines are provided if\nthe case was uncontroverted, plus a dispensing fee of seven dollars and fifty\ncents for generic prescription drugs or medicines and six dollars for\nbrand-name prescription drugs or medicines. Prior to the filing of a prescribed\nnotice denying the claim for workers' compensation, the claimant may be\nprescribed and dispensed and the insurance carrier or self-insured employer\nwill be responsible for the cost (as set forth in subdivision of this section)\nof medications from, as applicable, Phase A, B or the Perioperative section of\nthe Pharmacy Formulary. (3)\n\nNothing\nin this section shall bar a self-insured employer or insurance carrier from\nproviding a lower reimbursement rate or dispensing fee pursuant to a written\nagreement with any independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefit\nmanager. (4)\n\nThe maximum\nreimbursements or payments for prescription drugs or medicines set forth in\nthis subdivision shall be the maximum payment any individual or entity may\nreceive from any claimant, individual, entity, self-insured employer, insurance\ncarrier, or third party in connection with a claim for workers' compensation\nbenefits. (b) Fees for\npharmacy benefit management shall be established by agreement between the\nself-insured employer or insurance carrier and the independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefit manager. Fees to a pharmacy processing\nagent shall be established by agreement between the independent pharmacy, pharmacy chain, or pharmacy benefit manager and the pharmacy processing agent. The Chair may audit agreements from time to time for the purpose of ensuring\ncompliance with this Part. (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, if a prescription drug or\nmedicine has been repackaged, the Average Wholesale Price used to determine the\nmaximum reimbursement shall be the Average Wholesale Price of the underlying\ndrug product, as identified by its national drug code (or NDC), of the\nunderlying drug product used in the drug packaging. If the NDC is not supplied\nwith the bill for the prescription drug or medicine, the self-insured employer\nor insurance carrier may identify the NDC of the underlying drug product to\ncalculate reimbursement. While a pharmacy may engage in repackaging by removing\na finished drug product from the container in which it was distributed by the\noriginal manufacturer and placing it into a different (often smaller\ncontainer), the maximum reimbursement must be calculated using the AWP for the\ncontainer in which the finished drug product was distributed by the original\nmanufacturer prior to any repackaging. (d) Compound drug, as defined in subdivision\n(a) of section\n441.1, shall be reimbursed at the\ningredient level, with each ingredient identified using the applicable NDC of\nthe drug product, and the corresponding quantity. Ingredients with no NDC are\nnot separately reimbursable. When a compound drug is prescribed and dispensed\nin accordance with subdivision (a) of section\n441.1\nor pursuant subdivision (m)\nof section\n441.1\n(Prior Authorization), payment shall be based upon a sum of the allowable fee for each NDC\ningredient(s) a set forth in this section, plus a single dispensing fee of six\ndollars per compound drug. Compound drugs with any Non-Formulary drug\ningredient and/or for Formulary drugs being prescribed for other than an FDA\napproved route of administration are not reimbursable. (e) The fee schedule created by this section\nshall not apply to prescription drugs or medicines provided as part of\ntreatment governed by the medical and hospital fee schedule issued pursuant to\n\nWorkers' Compensation Law Section 13.
