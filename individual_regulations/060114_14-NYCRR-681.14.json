  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 681.14 - Rate setting for intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental disabilities (ICF/DD)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Rates of\nreimbursement for intermediate care facilities for persons with developmental\ndisabilities (ICF/DD), other than those operated by OPWDD, shall be determined\nin accordance with Title 10 NYCRR Part\n86\n-\n11. The rates of payment made for\nservices rendered to title XIX recipients established in accordance with the\nmethodology contained in 10 NYCRR Part\n86\n-\n11\nshall be contingent upon Federal\nfinancial participation (FFP) and approval. (b) Reporting requirements. Each provider shall submit reports in accordance with the\nrequirements of Subpart 635-4 of this Title. (c) Rate setting. (1)\n\nUnits of service. (i) A unit of service is the unit of measure\ndenoting lodging and services rendered to one individual between the\ncensus-taking hours of the facility on two successive days; the day of\nadmission but not the day of discharge shall be counted. One unit of service\nshall be counted if the individual is discharged on the same day the consumer\nis admitted, providing there was an expectation that the admission would have\nat least a 24-hour duration. (ii)\n\nReserve bed days determined in accordance with subdivision (i) of this section\nand 18 NYCRR\n505.9\nare units of service. (2)\n\nRate cycle. (i) For facilities of over 30 beds, the rate\ncycle is comprised of two 12-month rate periods. (ii)\n\nFor facilities of under 31 beds, the\nrate cycle is comprised of a base period and a subsequent period or periods. (a) The base period is the first 12-month\nperiod of the rate cycle. (1)\n\nThe base period\nis from January 1st to December 31st for Region II or III facilities. The first\nbase period begins January 1, 1988 for over 30-bed Region II or III facilities. The base period begins January 1, 2003 for under 31-bed Region II or III\nfacilities. (2)\n\nThe base period is\nfrom July 1st to June 30th for Region I facilities. The first base period\nbegins July 1, 1988 for over 30-bed Region I facilities. The base period begins\n\nJuly 1, 2003 for under 31-bed Region I facilities. (b) The subsequent period for over 30-bed\nfacilities is the second 12-month period of the rate cycle. The subsequent\nperiods for under 31-bed facilities are the subsequent 12-month periods. (1)\n\nThe subsequent period is from January 1st\nto December 31st for Region II or III facilities. The first subsequent period\nbegins January 1, 1989 for over 30-bed Region II or III facilities. The first\nsubsequent period begins January 1, 2004 for under 31-bed Region II or III\nfacilities. (2)\n\nThe subsequent\nperiod is from July 1st to June 30th for Region I facilities. The first\nsubsequent period begins July 1, 1989 for over 30-bed Region I facilities. The\nfirst subsequent period begins July 1, 2004 for under 31-bed Region I\nfacilities. (3)\n\nComputation of rates (general). (i) All rates shall not be final unless\napproved by the Director of the Division of the Budget. (ii)\n\nThe commissioner may make adjustments to\nrates calculated in accordance with this section based upon the allowability of\ncosts as determined by subdivision (f) of this section and Subpart 635-4 of\nthis Title. In addition, costs may be reallocated and adjusted following a desk\naudit of cost reports. The desk audit will examine the allocation of costs and\nOPWDD will reallocate unidentified and improperly classified costs, if any, to\nappropriate costs categories. (iii)\n\nThe commissioner may also make adjustments to rates calculated in accordance\nwith subdivision (f) of this section, and Subpart 635-4 of this Title based on\nerrors which occurred in the computation of the rate. A provider may request a\nrate revision based on rate computation errors by notifying OPWDD by certified\nmail, return receipt requested, either within 90 days of the provider receiving\nthe rate computation or within 90 days of the beginning of the rate period in\nquestion, whichever is later. However, if the requested rate revision is\nrelated to the resubmission of an annual cost report, OPWDD shall not accept\nthe request. The commissioner may also adjust for changes in certified\ncapacity, changes in payments for real property which have the prior approval\nof the commissioner and the Director of the Division of the Budget, or changes\nbased upon previously determined final audit findings. If a facility has\nundergone a change in certified capacity, the commissioner may: (a) request the facility to submit a budget\nreport subject to Subpart 635-4 of this Title; (b) request the facility to submit\nincremental/decremental cost data which is associated with the capacity change. Utilizing the submitted incremental/decremental data or\nbudget report, OPWDD shall make the appropriate upward or downward adjustment\nin a facility's rate; or continue the then existing rate for the remainder of\nthe subject rate period in those instances where the commissioner has\ndetermined that the facility is operating at a loss for the rate period in\nquestion and adjusting the current rate would further increase such loss, or\nthe facility is operating at a surplus for the rate period in question and\nadjusting the rate would further increase such surplus. (iv)\n\nRate adjustments as described\nin subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph will be limited to those adjustments\nwhich will result in an annual increase or decrease in reimbursement of $5,000\nor more. (v) Notwithstanding any\nother provisions of this section, for over 30-bed facilities the reimbursable\noperating costs contained in the rates shall be computed as follows. OPWDD\nshall determine the total reimbursable operating costs (with the exception of\neducation and related service costs, sheltered workshop services, and day\ntraining services) included in the payment rate in effect on December 31st or\n\nJune 30th, of the immediately preceding rate period applicable to that\nfacility. The dollars for sheltered workshop, day program services identified\nin clause (4)(viii)(\ne\n) of this subdivision and day training\nservices shall be revised based upon the number of individuals participating in\nthe program. The reimbursable operating cost plus any revised sheltered work\nand day training costs will be increased by the trend factor identified in\nsubdivision (h) of this section and may be adjusted for appropriate appeals, except that day program services costs identified in clause\n(4)(viii)(\ne\n) of this subdivision are not subject to the trend\nfactors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but will be increased by\nthe trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar to those paid for\nthrough the add-on described in clause (4)(viii)(\ne\n) of this\nsubdivision. Education and related services will be updated in accordance with\nclause (4)(ix)(\nc\n) of this subdivision. To determine the\ncapital cost portion of the subsequent period rate, OPWDD shall review the\ncomponent relating to capital costs for substantial material changes and, if\nsaid changes conform to the requirements of paragraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this\nsection and Subpart 635-4 of this Title, make corresponding adjustments in\ncomputing the subsequent period rate. (vi)\n\nThe computation of the rate resulting\nfrom the application of this paragraph can also be represented by the following\nformula: (a) trended reimbursable operating\ncosts + untrended reimbursable operating costs + reimbursable capital costs\nequal total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs / units of service = the rate. (vii)\n\nIf OPWDD is unable to compute a rate\nfor a newly certified facility, it may establish an interim rate which shall be\nthe regional average for other facilities. (a) OPWDD shall replace the interim rate\nretroactively to the starting date of such interim rate by a rate developed\nfrom the initial budget report submitted by the facility. (b) The rate developed from the initial\nbudget report shall be subject to all the requirements of this section, and\nshall be effective for the remainder of the then current rate period. (viii)\n\nProviders shall be\nresponsible for any necessary transportation to and from physician, dentist, and other clinical services, and any other transportation appropriate to the\nindividual's participation in community-based out-of-residence activities\nplanned for or sponsored by the facility. Nothing herein shall be interpreted\nas precluding the accessing of separate Medicaid claiming for\nemergency/nonemergency ambulance services (as defined in 18 NYCRR\n505.10\n)\nnecessitated by the individual's medical condition. (4)\n\nComputation of the base period. (i) For each facility the commissioner shall\nestablish rates in accordance with the certified capacity as stated in a\nfacility's provider agreement. (ii)\n\nBase period rates for over 30-bed facilities shall be computed on the basis of\na full 12-month cost report submitted by the provider for the 12-month period\nbeginning 24 months prior to the effective date of the base period, and subject\nto the cost category screens described herein. For a newly certified over\n30-bed facility, OPWDD shall use budget data, as submitted pursuant to Subpart\n635-4 of this Title. (iii)\n\nThe base\nperiod rate for under 31-bed Region 11 and III facilities shall be computed on\nthe basis of a full 12-month base year cost report submitted by the provider\nfor the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1999 and adjusted in accordance\nwith subparagraph (3)(ii) of this subdivision. The base period rate for under\n31-bed Region I facilities shall be computed on the basis of a full 12-month\nbase year cost report submitted by the provider for the 12-month period\nbeginning July 1, 1999 and adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (3)(ii) of\nthis subdivision. For a newly certified under 31-bed facility, OPWDD shall use\nthe budget data submitted pursuant to Subpart 635-4 of this Title. (iv)\n\nFor a newly certified facility, the base\nperiod rate shall be determined pursuant to subparagraph (vii) of this\nparagraph. For under 31-bed facilities the units of service are determined by\nmultiplying the certified capacity of the facility by 365 days. For over 30-bed\nfacilities, units of service are the certified capacity of the facility\nmultiplied by 365 days multiplied by 99 percent. A facility's submitted budget\ncosts may be adjusted based on a comparison to the actual costs of other\nexisting facilities operated by the provider in order to determine the costs of\nan efficient and economic operation. If the provider does not operate other\nfacilities, the submitted budget costs may be adjusted based on a comparison to\nthe average costs of other facilities in the same region. (v) For facilities which are not newly\ncertified facilities, the base period rate shall be determined pursuant to\nsubparagraph (vii) of this paragraph. For under 31-bed facilities, the units of\nservice are determined by multiplying the certified capacity of the facility by\n365 days. For over 30-bed facilities, units of service are the higher of the\ncertified capacity of the facility multiplied by 365 days multiplied by 99\npercent, or the actual reported units of service. (vi)\n\nAs appropriate, OPWDD shall apply trend\nfactors to each facility's reimbursable operating costs, except for education\nand related services. However, day program services costs identified in clause\n(viii)(\ne\n) of this paragraph are not subject to the trend\nfactors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but will be increased by\nthe trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar to those paid for\nthrough the add-on described in clause (viii)(\ne\n) of this\nparagraph. (vii)\n\nThe computation of\nthe rate resulting from the application of this paragraph can also be\nrepresented by the following formula: (a) trended reimbursable operating costs + untrended reimbursable operating costs +\nreimbursable capital costs = total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs / units of\nservice = the rate. (viii)\n\nFor all facilities there shall be a\nday program services add-on so that facilities which have day program services\nincluded in their rate shall be reimbursed as follows for these services. The\nadd-on shall reflect services needs as well as efficiency and economy of\noperation. (a) For sheltered workshop\nservices, effective July 1, 1995, the facility will receive a reimbursable cost\nof $9,899 per annum for each program participant. For program participants to\nwhom the conditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph apply, the\nfacility will receive a reimbursable cost of $9,499 per annum for each program\nparticipant. (b) For day training\nprograms, effective July 1, 1995, the facility will be reimbursed $11,033 per\nannum for each program participant. For program participants to whom the\nconditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph apply, the facility\nwill be reimbursed $10,633 per annum for each program participant. (c) If an agency applies to OPWDD prior to\n\nJanuary 1, 2003, and for participants receiving services in day training\nfacilities where the developmental disability profile average score for the\nsite exceeds 348 for the adaptive score and exceeds 10 for the health score, the amount of the add-on shall be determined by a budget review. The amount of\nthe add-on received by the ICF/DD for such day training services shall reflect\nindividual service needs as well as efficiency and economy of service\nprovision. Effective January 1, 2003, for any facility to which this subclause\napplies, the add-on shall be equal to the reimbursement that was in the\nfacility's rate on December 31, 2002, and that was applicable to day training\nservices described in this subclause. (d) The costs of day program services\ndelivered in a certified day treatment facility (see Part 690 of this Title)\nmay not be included as an add-on to the ICF/DD rate. (e) Effective January 1, 2003, a provider may\nrequest that a day program services add-on be included in the facility's rate. The day program services add-on for all day program services shall be either\nthe day program services reimbursement included in the rate on December 31, 2002 and adjusted for actual service delivery; or the lower of: (1)\nthe actual costs per the most recent cost\nreport accepted by OPWDD net of any surplus calculated for the day program\nservices; or\n(2)\nthe budget\ncosts; (3)\nthe costs in subclauses\n(\n1\n) and (\n2\n) of this clause are subject to a\ndesk audit. Administrative review of these desk audits shall be in accordance\nwith section\n635-4.6\n(h) of\nthis Title. (f) Effective June 1, 1995, the facility will be reimbursed for education and\nrelated services in accordance with Title 8 NYCRR. These costs shall not be\ntrended. (ix)\n\nEffective\n\nJuly 1, 1997 an under 31-bed facility may submit to the commissioner a request\nfor a transportation add-on for transportation of persons to and from an\noutpatient service certified pursuant to article 28 of the Public Health Law\nfor certain persons if: (a) in order to meet\na person's active treatment needs the person's individual program plan requires\na day service (comprising regular attendance at a sheltered workshop or a day\ntraining service) in combination with visits to the outpatient service\ndescribed above; (b) prior to July\n1, 1996, transportation to and from the outpatient service was not included in\nthe rate for the operator of the outpatient service; (c) prior to July 1, 1996, the rate approved\nby the local social services district was billed separately by a transportation\nvendor for transportation to and from the outpatient service; and\n(d) the vendor ceased billing for\ntransportation of persons residing in the facility to and from the outpatient\nservice. (x) The\ntransportation add-on shall be a reimbursable cost added to a facility's rate\nsubject to the conditions set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph. The\ntransportation add-on shall be calculated using payment/rate data based on\nlocal social service district approved Medicaid payment rates made to\ntransportation vendors as of June 30, 1996. A weighted transportation average\nshall be calculated for each facility by dividing the aggregate transportation\npayments by the aggregate day service transportation round trips for all\npersons described in subparagraph (ix) of this paragraph. (a) The weighted transportation average for\neach facility shall be ranked among all day treatment facilities statewide\npursuant to the methodology for calculating the transportation component add-on\nfor day treatment facilities described in section\n690.7\n(e)(3)(vii)\n(\na\n)(\n1\n) through and including\n(\na\n)(\n3\n) of this Title. (b) The modified weighted transportation\naverage shall be multiplied by the total to and from day service transportation\nunits of service to determine reimbursable transportation costs. (xi)\n\nEffective September 1, 2011, the rate shall be adjusted for providers with ICF/DD populations that include\nindividuals who are Willowbrook class members and who are accessing Willowbrook\ncase services delivered by a non-state provider. (a) The add-on to the rate shall be\npredicated on the number of Willowbrook class members accessing Willowbrook\ncase services delivered by a service coordinator who is qualified to provide\n\nMedicaid service coordination (see Subpart 635-5 of this Title), Willowbrook\ncase services are those case management services required by appendix I of the\npermanent injunction ordered by the United States District Court of the Eastern\n\nDistrict of New York on March 11, 1993 in the case of\n\nNew York State\n\nAssociation for Retarded Children\nv. Cuomo, that\nexceed the case management services delivered by the QIDP in the\nICF/DD. (b) The amount of the\nadditional reimbursement per provider on an annual basis shall be equal to the\nsum of the months in which each Willowbrook class member residing in any of the\nprovider's ICF/DDs receives Willowbrook case services over the span of the\nICF/DD provider's accounting/reporting year multiplied by one half of the\n\nMedicaid service coordination fee established for Willowbrook class members as\nidentified in the Medicaid service coordination contract for providers of that\nservice. (5)\n\nComputation of the subsequent period rate. (i) The reimbursable operating costs\ncontained in the subsequent period rates shall be computed as follows. OPWDD\nshall determine the total reimbursable operating costs (with the exception of\neducation and related service costs, sheltered workshop services, day training\nservices) included in the payment rate in effect on December 31st or June 30th\nof the immediately preceding rate period applicable to that facility. The\ndollars for sheltered workshop and day training services shall be revised based\nupon the number of individuals participating in the program. The reimbursable\noperating costs plus any revised sheltered work and day training costs will be\nincreased by the trend factor identified in subdivision (h) of this section and\nmay be adjusted for appropriate appeals, except that day program services costs\nidentified in clause (4)(viii)(\ne\n) of this subdivision are not\nsubject to the trend factors identified in subdivision (h) of this section, but\nwill be increased by the trend factors used by OPWDD for day services similar\nto those paid for through the add-on described in clause\n(4)(viii)(\ne\n) of this subdivision. Education and related\nservices will be updated in accordance with clause (4)(ix)(\nc\n)\nof this subdivision. OPWDD will determine the capital cost portion of the\nsubsequent period rate by reviewing the component relating to capital costs for\nsubstantial material changes. If such changes conform to the requirements of\nparagraphs (f)(1) and (3) of this section and Subpart 635-6 of this Title, OPWDD will make corresponding adjustments in computing the subsequent period\nrate. (ii)\n\nThe computation of the\nrate resulting from the application of this paragraph can also be represented\nby the following formula: (a) trended\nreimbursable operating costs + untrended reimbursable operating costs +\nreimbursable capital costs = total reimbursable costs; (b) total reimbursable costs/units of service\n= the rate. (iii)\n\nFor a\nnewly certified facility which begins to provide services that fall within a\nsubsequent period, the initial rate shall be calculated as though it were a\nbase period rate. (d) Cost category screens, reimbursement for\nunder 31-bed facilities, and July 1, 2011 consolidation. In order to determine\nthe reimbursable operating costs to be included in the rate calculation, the\nfollowing screens (\ni.e., the maximum amount that will be\nallowed for a specific item or group of items) will be used. The regional\nscreens corresponding to the actual geographic location of the facility will be\napplied. (1)\n\nAdministration screens and\nreimbursement. (i) Screens. (a) Administrative screen values shall be\nequal to the sum of the total reimbursable administrative costs and the total\nreimbursable administrative fringe benefits, less the value of the efficiency\nadjustment, included in the rate effective on the last day of the immediately\npreceding rate period. This amount shall be detrended to the base\nyear. (b) For facilities without a\nscreen as determined in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph, operated by a provider which does operate other facilities, an agency\nadministrative percentage based on the current reimbursement of those other\nfacilities shall be applied. (c) For facilities without a screen as determined in clauses (\na\n)\nand (\nb\n) of this subparagraph, operated by a provider which\noperates other OPWDD certified residential programs, an agency administrative\npercentage based on the current reimbursement of the other OPWDD certified\nresidential programs shall be applied. (d) For facilities without a screen as\ndetermined in clauses (\na\n)-(\nc\n) of this\nsubparagraph, operated by a provider which does not operate any other OPWDD\ncertified residential programs, a regional average administrative percentage\nbased on the current reimbursement of facilities operated by other providers\nshall be applied. (e) For\nfacilities without a screen value as determined per clause (\na\n)\nof this subparagraph, the administrative screen value shall be equal to the\npercentages derived from clause (\nb\n), (\nc\n) or\n(\nd\n) of this subparagraph times the reimbursable operating\ncosts other than administration. This value shall be detrended to the base\nyear. (ii)\n\nReimbursable\nadministration costs shall be the lesser of administrative base year\ncosts/budget costs, or the screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of\nthis paragraph. Effective July 1, 2011, for providers in all regions, rates\nshall be revised such that reimbursable administration costs shall be the\nlesser of: (a) administrative costs as\nreported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008\ncost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000\nbase year or administrative budget costs detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base\nyear; or\n(b) 85 percent of the\nscreen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nDirect care screens\nand reimbursement. (i) Screen. The direct\ncare screen value shall be the direct care FTEs multiplied by the regional\nsalary. (a) Direct care FTEs shall be\ncalculated utilizing the facility specific disability increment plus bed size\nincrement. The term\ndisability increment\nshall mean the\nprocess of developing facility specific direct care FTEs based upon aggregate\nconsumer disability characteristics as referenced and described in section\n690.7\n(d) of this\n\nTitle and reported on the developmental disabilities profile (DDP). The\ndisability increment methodology will only be calculated if at least 50 percent\nof the DDP scores are available. If less than 50 percent of the DDP scores are\navailable, the direct care FTEs calculated shall be based upon bed size\nincrement alone. The disability increment using the DDP scores is calculated as\nfollows: 0.063 FTEs times the facility mean direct care score plus 0.008 FTEs\ntime the facility mean behavior score plus 0.062 FTEs times the facility\nstandard deviation direct care score minus 0.019 FTEs times the facility\nstandard deviation behavior score. The direct score is computed for each\nconsumer from the DDP adaptive and health/medical scores as follows: 7.962 plus\n0.156 times the adaptive score plus 1.611 times the health/medial score. The\nbed size increments are as follows: Bed size\n\nBed size increment\n4\n5.700\n5\n8.310\n6\n6.448\n7\n7.123\n8\n8.294\n9\n9.171\n10\n10.957\n11\n10.939\n12\n12.746\n13\n9.277\n14\n15.154\n15\n10.507\n16\n14.530\n17\n16.987\n18\n18.501\n19\n18.751\n20\n15.115\n21\n20.515\n22\n24.873\n23\n19.688\n24\n22.935\n25\n24.043\n26\n30.361\n27\n31.325\n28\n32.265\n29\n33.205\n30\n34.145\n(b) Direct care regional salaries. Region\nI\n$29,375\nII\n29,522\nIII\n25,005\n\nNote: The above values are in base year dollars. (ii)\n\nReimbursable direct care\ncosts shall be the lesser of the base year costs/budget costs or the screen\nvalues established by subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Effective July 1, 2011, for providers in all regions, rates shall be revised such that\nreimbursable direct care costs shall be the lesser of: (a) direct care costs as reported in the\nprovider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008 cost report for\n\nRegions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year or\ndirect care budget costs detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(b) the screen value as\ndetermined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (3)\n\nSupport personal service\nscreens and reimbursement. (i) Screen. The\nsupport screen value shall be the support FTEs multiplied by the regional\nsalary. (a) Support FTE screen values for\nbudget-based facilities: Bed size\n\nSupport FTE value\n4\n0.55\n5\n0.71\n6\n0.87\n7\n1.03\n8\n1.19\n9\n1.35\n10\n1.50\n11\n1.66\n12\n1.82\n13\n1.98\n14\n2.14\n15\n2.30\n16\n2.46\n17\n2.61\n18\n2.77\n19\n2.93\n20\n3.09\n21\n3.25\n22\n3.41\n23\n3.56\n24\n3.72\n25\n3.88\n26\n4.04\n27\n4.20\n28\n4.36\n29\n4.52\n30\n4.67\n(b) Support FTE screen values for cost-based facilities are based on the base year\ncost report. (c) Support regional\nsalaries. Region\nI\n$29,375\nII\n29,522\nIII\n25,005\n\nNote: The above values are in base year dollars. (ii)\n\nReimbursable support personal\nservice costs shall be the lesser of the base year costs/budget costs, or the\nscreen values established in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Effective July\n1, 2011, for providers in all Regions, rates shall be revised such that\nreimbursable support personal service costs shall be the lesser of: (a) support personal service costs as\nreported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008\ncost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000\nbase year or support personal service budget costs detrended to the\n1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(b) the screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nClinical screens\nand reimbursement. (i) Clinical regional\nsalaries are: Region\nI\n$56,510\nII\n53,584\nIII\n40,414\n\nNote: The above values are in base year dollars. (ii)\n\nRates prior to July 1, 2011. (a) For newly certified facilities, that have\na rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate period, the\nreimbursable clinical costs will be the clinical FTEs approved and reimbursed\nin the rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate period\nmultiplied by the lesser of: (1)\nthe clinical\naverage salary reimbursed in the rate on the last day of the immediately\npreceding rate period detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(2)\nthe appropriate clinical regional salary\nlisted in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (b) For newly certified facilities, that do\nnot have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate\nperiod, OPWDD will consider budgeted FTEs and average salaries, reviewed and\nadjusted if necessary through a desk audit process. The reimbursable clinical\ncosts shall be the desk-audited budgeted clinical FTEs multiplied by the lesser\nof: (1)\nthe desk-audited budgeted clinical\naverage salary, detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(2)\nthe appropriate regional clinical salary\nlisted in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (c) For facilities which are not newly\ncertified, the reimbursable clinical costs shall be the base year cost report\nclinical FTEs multiplied by the lesser of: (1)\nthe base year cost report clinical\naverage salary; or\n(2)\nthe\nappropriate regional clinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nRates effective July 1, 2011. (a) For Region I providers that do not have a\n2008-2009 cost report but that operate an under 31-bed ICF/DD(s) that has\n(have) a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, or for Regions II and III providers\nthat do not have a 2008 cost report but that operate an under 31-bed ICF/DD(s)\nthat has (have) a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, the reimbursable clinical\ncosts will be the clinical component of the June 30, 2011 rate(s) detrended to\nthe 1999/1999-2000 base year. (b) For facilities that do not have a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, OPWDD shall\nuse the budgeted FTEs and budgeted average salaries, reviewed and adjusted if\nnecessary through a desk audit process. The reimbursable clinical costs for\nsuch facilities shall be the desk-audited budgeted clinical FTEs multiplied by\nthe lesser of: (1)\nthe desk-audited budgeted\nclinical average salary, detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(2)\nthe appropriate regional\nclinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (c) For Region I providers that\nhave a 2008-2009 cost report or for Region II or III providers that have a 2008\ncost report, the reimbursable clinical costs shall be the FTEs from the\nprovider's cost report multiplied by the lesser of: (1)\nthe clinical average salary as reported\nin the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I providers or 2008 cost\nreport for Regions II and III providers detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base\nyear; or\n(2)\nthe appropriate\nregional clinical salary listed in subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (5)\n\nFringe benefit screens and reimbursement. (i) Rates prior to July 1, 2011. (a) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall\ncompute a facility-specific fringe benefit percentage. This percentage shall be\ndetermined by summing the direct care, clinical and support fringe benefit\ncosts from the base year budget or cost report and dividing this sum by the sum\nof direct care, clinical and support personal service costs (exclusive of\ncontracted personal service) from the base year budget or cost\nreport. (b) For newly certified\nfacilities, that have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately\npreceding rate period, the fringe benefit percentage screen shall equal the\nfringe benefit percentage contained in the rate effective on the last day of\nthe immediately preceding rate period. (c) For newly certified facilities, that do\nnot have a rate effective on the last day of the immediately preceding rate\nperiod, the fringe benefit percentage screen (as calculated in subparagraph [i]\nof this paragraph) shall equal the average percentage reimbursed to existing\nfacilities currently operated by the provider. If there are no existing\nfacilities, then the fringe benefit percentage screen shall equal the average\nreimbursed fringe benefit percentage of any other programs operated by the\nprovider. If the provider does not operate any other programs, then the fringe\nbenefit percentage screen shall equal the regional average percentage\nreimbursed to other facilities. (d) Reimbursable fringe benefit costs shall be equal to the computed fringe benefit\npercentage established in subparagraph (i), (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph\nmultiplied by the reimbursable direct care, clinical and support personal\nservice dollars, exclusive of contracted personal service. (ii)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011. (a) OPWDD shall compute a facility-specific\nfringe benefit percentage by summing a facility's direct care, clinical and\nsupport fringe benefit costs detrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year and\ndividing this sum by the sum of direct care, clinical and support personal\nservice costs (exclusive of contracted personal service) detrended to the\n1999/1999-2000 base year: (1)\nfor Region I\nproviders that have a 2008-2009 cost report or for Regions II and III providers\nthat have a 2008 cost report, for facilities that are in the cost report, the\ndirect care, clinical, and support fringe benefit costs and direct care, clinical, and support personal service costs shall be those costs reported by\nthe providers in their cost reports; and/or\n(2)\nfor facilities that opened after the\nbeginning of the provider's respective reporting period as described in\nsubclause (\n1\n) of this clause but that have a rate in effect on\n\nJune 30, 2011, the direct care, clinical, and support fringe benefit costs and\ndirect care, clinical, and support personal service costs shall be those costs\nreflected in the provider's site-specific rates in effect on June 30, 2011; and/or\n(3)\n\nFor facilities that do\nnot have a rate in effect on June 30, 2011, the fringe benefit percentage shall\nequal the average percentage reimbursed to existing facilities currently\noperated by the provider. If there are no existing facilities, then the fringe\nbenefit percentage shall equal the average reimbursed fringe benefit percentage\nof any other programs operated by the provider. If the provider does not\noperate any other programs, then the fringe benefit percentage shall equal the\nregional average percentage reimbursed to other facilities. (b) Reimbursable fringe benefit\ncosts shall be equal to the computed fringe benefit percentage established\npursuant to clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph multiplied by the\nreimbursable direct care, clinical and support personal service dollars, exclusive of contracted personal service. (6)\n\nSupport OTPS (other than personal\nservice) screens and reimbursement. (i) The\nfacility's support OTPS screen is determined by multiplying the certified\ncapacity by the appropriate regional per bed value. (ii)\n\nSupport OTPS regional per bed values. Region\nI\n$16,097\nII\n13,085\nIII\n16,418\n\nNote: The above values are in base year dollars. (iii)\n\nReimbursable support OTPS costs shall\nbe the lesser of the base year costs/budget costs, or the screen values\nestablished in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Effective July 1, 2011, for\nproviders in all regions, rates shall be revised such that reimbursable support\nOTPS shall be the lesser of: (a) support OTPS\ncosts as reported in the provider's 2008-2009 cost report for Region I\nproviders or 2008 cost report for Regions II and III providers detrended to the\n1999/1999-2000 base year or support OTPS budget costs detrended to the\n1999/1999-2000 base year; or\n(b) the screen value as determined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (7)\n\nUtility costs will\nnot be included within the support OTPS screen. Prior to July 1, 2011, reimbursable utility costs shall be the base year costs or budget costs. Effective July 1, 2011, the reimbursable utility costs shall be the 2008-2009\ncosts for Region I providers or the 2008 costs for Regions II and III providers\ndetrended to the 1999/1999-2000 base year or the budget costs detrended to the\n1999/1999-2000 base year. (8)\n\nEffective July 1, 2011. Consolidation of site-specific rates into a single rate\napplicable to all facilities operated by a provider. (i) Site-specific rates shall be revised to\neffect new July 1, 2011, rates in accordance with the processes outlined in\nthis subdivision. OPWDD shall then consolidate the site-specific rates for each\nprovider to produce a single rate for all facilities operated by a provider\naccording to the steps outlined as follows: (a) For each provider, the individual cost\ncategories total reimbursable costs contained in the site-specific rates in\neffect on July 1, 2011 for each site operated by that provider shall be\nsummed. (b) For each provider, the\nindividual certified capacities upon which the site-specific rates in effect on\n\nJuly 1, 2011 are predicated for each site operated by that provider shall be\nsummed. (c) For each provider, the\nindividual potential maximum client days upon which the site-specific rates in\neffect on July 1, 2011 are predicated for each site operated by that provider\nshall be summed. (d) If the\noperating component of the single provider-specific rate calculated in\naccordance with clauses (\na\n), (\nb\n) and\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph represents an ICF/DD operating\nfunding level which is greater than the aggregate ICF/DD operating funding\nlevel at June 30, 2011 for the provider, then the July 1, 2011\nprovider-specific rate will be the consolidation of the provider's June 30, 2011 ICF/DD rates. If the single provider-specific operating rate calculated in\naccordance with clauses (\na\n), (\nb\n) and\n(\nc\n) of this subparagraph represents an ICF/DD operating\nfunding level for the provider which is less than the aggregate ICF/DD\noperating funding level at June 30, 2011, then the July 1, 2011\nprovider-specific rate will be the higher of the single provider-specific\noperating rate calculated in accordance with clauses (\na\n), (\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of this subparagraph or the\noperating rate which represents a funding reduction of 10 percent of the\naggregate ICF/DD operating funding level for the provider at June 30, 2011. (ii)\n\nSites opening\nafter July 1, 2011. For a facility that was not operating on June 30, 2011, or\nwas not certified as an ICF/DD on June 30, 2011, the initial site-specific rate\nshall be the current agency ICF/DD rate or a rate based on budgeted costs if\nthe commissioner determines that a rate based on budgeted costs is needed\nbecause the current agency ICF/DD rate would not appropriately reimburse the\nICF/DD when taking into consideration the disability levels of the ICF/DD\nindividuals. In establishing a rate based on budgeted costs, the commissioner\nshall adjust the budgeted costs for the facility by whichever of the following\ncost information is available and reflects necessary costs for operating the\nnew facility: actual costs of similar existing facilities operated by the\nprovider, or average costs of other facilities in the same region and\nhistorical data for similar facilities, in order to establish a rate that uses\nthe most comparable data when taking into consideration the disability levels\nof the ICF/DD individuals. The approved site-specific rates shall be\nincorporated into the single rate for all facilities operated by a provider\naccording to the process outlined in clauses (i)(\na\n), (\nb\n) and (\nc\n) of this paragraph. The\nrecalculated provider-specific rate will be effective on the date of the\ncertification of the new site. (iii)\n\nAs of July 1, 2011, all unresolved desk\naudits precipitated by rebasing to the base year 1999/1999-2000 shall be closed\nand there shall be no further attempts to effect rate adjustments or\nreconciliations. (e) Cost category screens and\nreimbursement for over 30-bed facilities. In order to determine the reimbursable operating costs to be\nincluded in the rate calculation, the following screens (\ni.e., the maximum amount that will be allowed for a specific item or group of items)\nwill be used. (1)\n\nDirect care, mid-level supervision, and clinical personal service cost category screens: (i) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall\ndevelop values by applying a maximum statewide salary amount to a facility's\napplicable individual specific staffing standards. Refer to paragraphs (5)-(8)\nof this subdivision. (ii)\n\nThese\nstandards shall reflect the severity of disabilities of the population residing\nat the facility as determined by the procedures outlined in paragraphs (5)-(7)\nof this subdivision; the number of beds in the facility; whether or not a\nfacility provides on-site day program services; and the persons the facility\nprovides services to (\ni.e., adults, children or\nboth). (iii)\n\nFor any facility which\nelects to participate in the salary enhancement plan as evidenced by adoption\nof a resolution of its governing body, effective on the later of October 1, 1987, or the date of adoption of such resolution, the direct care/support\nreimbursement will be adjusted to reflect the obligation to pay salary levels\nestablished by adoption of the resolution referred to in this subparagraph. In\nabsence of such an election, the standard shall be determined by the facility's\nactual salary amount based upon the budget or cost report used to establish the\nrate being adjusted or calculated. (2)\n\nAdministrative and support cost category\nscreens: (i) OPWDD shall develop values for\nevery new rate cycle by application of a statewide maximum allowable\ncost. (ii)\n\nThe personal service\ncosts shall be determined by applying a maximum statewide salary amount to the\nallowable staffing level contained in this subdivision. (iii)\n\nFor any facility which elects to\nparticipate in the salary enhancement plan as evidenced by adoption of a\nresolution of its governing body, effective on the later of October 1, 1987, or\nthe date of adoption of such resolution, the direct care/support reimbursement\nwill be adjusted to reflect the obligation to pay salary levels established by\nadoption of the resolution referred to in this subparagraph. In the absence of\nsuch an election, the standard shall be determined by the facility's actual\nsalary amount based upon the budget or cost report used to establish the rate\nbeing adjusted or calculated. (3)\n\nFringe benefit cost category screens: (i) For every new rate cycle, OPWDD shall\ncompute a facility-specific fringe benefit percentage. This percentage shall be\ndetermined by computing the total fringe benefit cost from the base year budget\nor cost report and dividing this total by the total personal service cost\n(exclusive of contracted personal service) from the base year budget or cost\nreport. For every rate cycle after April 1, 1984, this percentage shall be the\nlower of the previous rate cycle cost-based fringe benefit percentage plus one\npercent or a new percentage computed in accordance with the immediately\npreceding sentence. If a facility's previous rate is based upon a budget, it is\nnot subject to the aforementioned one-percent fringe benefit\nlimitation. (ii)\n\nTo determine the\nfringe benefit component of the rate, the facility-specific fringe benefit\npercentage shall be multiplied by the total reimbursable personal service\ndollars exclusive of contracted personal services. (iii)\n\nFor newly certified facilities, the\nfringe benefit percentage allowed shall not exceed the average allowed for\nexisting facilities (regardless of size) currently operated by the provider. If\nthere are no existing facilities, then the fringe benefit percentage allowed\nshall not exceed the fringe benefit percentage of any other programs operated\nby the provider. If the provider does not operate any other programs, then the\nfringe benefit percentage allowed shall not exceed the regional average for\nother facilities. (iv)\n\nAny increase\nin the fringe benefit percentage due to Federal or State laws, rules or\nregulations shall not be subject to the percent increase limitation described\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (v) If a newly certified facility whose base\nperiod rate was determined from total reimbursable budget costs, submits a cost\nreport for the subsequent period in accordance with Subpart 635-4 of this\n\nTitle, a new fringe benefit percentage shall be computed by dividing these\ncosts by the total personal service costs (exclusive of contracted services) as\nsubmitted in the new cost report. This percentage shall be subject to the\nlimitations of subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. (4)\n\nOther than personal service\n(OTPS) and overhead shall be combined into one cost category screen. (i) The other than personal service cost\ncategory screen will be based on a per bed amount effective at the beginning of\neach new rate cycle (see paragraph [8] of this subdivision). (ii)\n\nThe overhead cost category screen will\nbe a percentage of reimbursable personal service and fringe benefits (see\nparagraph [8] of this subdivision). This screen will be compared to reported\ncost or budget costs (agency administration, personal service, OTPS, fringe\nbenefits and capital costs) to determine reimbursable costs. (iii)\n\nCosts associated with transportation to\nand from physician, dentist and other clinical services shall be included in\nthe other than personal service screen and subject to the limitations contained\ntherein. (5)\n\nOver 30 bed\nfacility staffing standards, algorithm and screens. FTE factors to determine\nstaff allocations for individuals with differing day programs, who reside in\nover 30 bed facilities.

(ii)\n\nFor\nchildren, bed sizes 61-99, a straight deduction of 0.00119 will be computed per\n1-bed increase from the 0.4350 at 60 beds. (iii)\n\nFor adults, bed sizes 32-59, a straight\ndeduction of 0.00136 will be computed per 1-bed increase from 0.4046 at 31\nbeds.

To be considered allowable, costs must be properly chargeable\nto necessary individual care rendered in accordance with the requirements of\nthis Part. (1)\n\nAllowable costs\n(general). (i) Except where rules concerning\nallowability of costs are stated herein, the Medicare Provider Reimbursement\n\nManual, commonly referred to as HIM-15, shall be used to determine the\nallowability of costs. HIM-15 is published by the U.S. Department of Health and\n\nHuman Services' Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) and is available\nfrom: Health Care Financing Administration, Division of Communication Services, Production and Distribution Branch, Room 577, East High Rise Building, 6325\n\nSecurity Boulevard, Baltimore, MD 21207. It may be reviewed in person during\nregular business hours at the NYS Department of State, 41 State Street, Albany, NY 12207; or, by appointment, at the NYS Office for People With Developmental\n\nDisabilities, Division of Revenue Management, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY\n12229-0001. (ii)\n\nWhere rules stated\nherein, or in Subpart 635-6 of this Title, or in HIM-15 are silent concerning\nthe allowability of costs, the commissioner shall determine allowability of\ncosts based on reasonableness and relationship to individual care and generally\naccepted accounting principles. (iii)\n\nExpenses or portions of expenses\nreported by a facility that are not reasonably related to the efficient and\neconomical provision of care in accordance with the requirements of this Part, because of either the nature or amount of the item, shall be not\nallowed. (iv)\n\nCosts which are not\nproperly related to individual care or treatment, and which principally afford\ndiversion, entertainment or amusement to owners, operators or employees of the\nfacility, shall not be allowed. (v) The OPWDD shall reduce a facility's base year costs/budget costs by the costs\nof such services and activities that are not chargeable to the care of\nindividual in accordance with this subdivision. (a) In the event that the commissioner\ndetermines that it is not practical to establish the costs of such services and\nactivities, the income derived therefrom shall be substituted as the basis for\nreductions of the facility's reported or estimated costs. (b) Examples of sources of such income\ninclude, but are not limited to: (1)\nsupplies\nand drugs sold by the facility for use by nonresidents; (2)\ntelephone and telegraph services for\nwhich a charge is made; (3)\ndiscount on purchases; (4)\nemployees' rental of living quarters; (5)\ncafeterias; (6)\nmeals provided to staff or an\nindividual's guests for which there is a charge; (7)\noperating parking facilities for\ncommunity convenience; and\n(8)\nlease of office and other space by concessionaires providing services not\nrelated to intermediate care facility services. (vi)\n\nCosts for any interest expense related\nto funding expenses in excess of an approved rate, or penalty imposed by\ngovernmental agencies or courts and the costs of insurance policies obtained\nsolely to insure against such penalty, shall not be allowed. OPWDD will not pay\ninterest on the final dollar settlement resulting from the retrospective impact\nof the rate appeals. (vii)\n\nCosts of\ncontributions or other payments to political parties, candidates or\norganizations shall not be allowed. (viii)\n\nRestricted funds are funds expended by\nthe facility, which include grants, gifts, and income from endowments, whether\ncash or otherwise, which must be used only for a specific purpose as designated\nby the donor or grant instrument. Except as provided for in subparagraphs (iii)\nand (iv) of this paragraph, restricted funds are to be deducted from the\ndesignated costs when determining allowable costs. The commissioner may waive\nthe provisions of this subparagraph at his discretion only in those instances\nwhere the provider makes a reasonable showing that the imposition of the\nrequirements of this subparagraph would cause undue financial harm to the\nexistence of the facility. (ix)\n\nOnly that portion of the dues paid to any professional association which has\nbeen demonstrated to be attributable to expenditures other than for lobbying or\npolitical contributions shall be allowed. (x) A monetary value assigned to services\nprovided by a religious order for services rendered to an owner and operator of\na facility shall be considered allowable subject to review by OPWDD for\nreasonableness. (xi)\n\nFunded\ndepreciation. (a) Applicability. This\nsubparagraph shall apply to all facilities except those governed by\nsubparagraph (iii) or (iv) of this paragraph and those for which the provider\nis receiving or has a commitment to receive HUD funding. This section shall\napply to facilities which were governed by subparagraph (3)(iii) or (iv) of\nthis subdivision but which are no longer governed by either such section\nbecause the provider has repaid the entire principal owed on the real property\nof the facility. (b) Effective\n\nApril 1, 1986, for any rate period during which the reimbursement attributable\nto depreciation on a facility's real property, excluding equipment, exceeds the\nprovider's principal repayment obligations on indebtedness attributable to such\nreal property, such provider shall fund depreciation by depositing such\ndifference in an interest- bearing checking account or other secure investment. If the provider operates more than one facility governed by this paragraph, the\nprovider may maintain one funded depreciation account for two or more\nfacilities. The provider shall not commingle such funded depreciation accounts\nwith other monies of the provider. The provider shall not be required to fund\ndepreciation attributable to the provider's equity in such real property. The\nprovider may expend the funds in such account, including accrued interest, to\nretire all or a portion of the indebtedness attributable to such real property, or for building improvements and/or fixed equipment necessary to the\nfacility. (c) OPWDD will not\nreimburse interest expense incurred to meet funded depreciation, pursuant to\nthis subparagraph and subparagraphs (iii) and (iv) of this paragraph. (2)\n\nAllowable costs\n(operating). (i) Interest on working capital\nindebtedness in accordance with standards listed in section\n635-6.4\n(h) of\nthis Title and subject to the limitations of paragraph (d)(1) or (e)(4) of this\nsection will be considered allowable. In the event that a loan is not in\naccordance with the standards listed above, then the approval of the\ncommissioner is required. (ii)\n\nEffective April 16, 1992, costs incurred as a result of the provider of\nservices assessment charged pursuant to section\n43.04\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law in the amount of 2.4 percent of the 3 percent assessment\ncharged on cash receipts shall be included in the rate. (iii)\n\nEffective April 4, 1996, costs in\nexcess of 0.6 percent incurred as a result of the provider of services\nassessment charged on cash receipts pursuant to section\n43.04\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law shall be included in the rate. Effective April 1, 1999, costs in excess of 0.3 percent incurred as a result of the provider of services\nassessment charged on cash receipts pursuant to section\n43.04\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law shall be included in the rate. Effective April 1, 2000, the assessment charged on cash receipts pursuant to section\n43.04\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law shall be a reimbursable expense. (iv)\n\nAllowable operating costs shall also\ninclude, but not be limited to, personal service, fringe benefits, OTPS, utility, administration costs, as well as day treatment, day services, and\ntransportation costs, and regional FTE add-ons. (v) Effective April 1, 2005, costs incurred\nas a result of requests for criminal history record checks under section\n16.33\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law and section\n845-b\nof the\n\nExecutive Law shall be allowable costs and shall be considered part of the\nrate. (3)\n\nAllowable\ncosts (capital). (i) Start-up costs are those\ncosts which are incurred from the period the provider receives approval\npursuant to Part 620 of this Title for a facility to become an intermediate\ncare facility to the date the first individual is admitted. However, costs\nincurred during the period from the first admission to the effective date of\nthe initial provider agreement shall not be considered as start-up costs. (a) OPWDD may, at the discretion of the\ncommissioner, reimburse a provider for all allowable start-up costs incurred in\nthe preparation of the provider during that six-month period prior to the date\nof the first admission. A provider may apply to the commissioner for an\nextension of the six-month reimbursable start-up period, provided that the\nprovider can demonstrate why such an extension is necessary. However, under no\ncircumstances shall a facility be allowed reimbursement of start-up costs for\nany period of time exceeding 18 months prior to the date of the first\nadmission. (b) Allowable start-up\ncosts may include, but not be limited to: (1)\npersonal service expenses; (2)\nutility expenses; (3)\ntaxes; (4)\ninsurance\nexpenses; (5)\nemployee training\nexpenses; (6)\nhousekeeping\nexpenses; (7)\nrepair and\nmaintenance expenses; and\n(8)\nadministrative expenses. (c) Any costs that are properly identifiable\nas organization costs, or capitalizable as construction costs, shall be\nclassified as such and excluded from start-up costs. (d) If a provider intends to prepare all\nportions of its entire facility at the same time, start-up costs for all\nportions of the facility shall be accumulated in a single deferred account and\nshall be amortized from the date of the first admission. However, if a provider\nintends to prepare only portions of its facility (\ne.g., preparation of a floor or wing), start-up costs shall be capital and amortized\nseparately. In either case, unless reimbursed as described in subparagraph (iv)\nof this paragraph, start-up costs shall be amortized over a period not to\nexceed 60 months from the date of the first admission. (ii)\n\nFor any transaction resulting in a\nchange of ownership, the valuation of the assets shall be limited to the lesser\nof the allowable acquisition cost of the assets to the first owner of record\nwho has received Medicaid payment for the assets in question on or after August\n1, 1982, minus any paid depreciation (\ni.e., seller's net book\nvalue) or the acquisition cost of the asset to the new owner. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (1)(viii)\nof this subdivision, in the case of any provider which has been notified by\nOPWDD on or after April 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary reservation of\n\nState aid funds for a capital grant pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section\n41.18(c) or 41.23, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility which\nis the subject of the capital grant shall include the facility's depreciable\nproject costs which were funded with such capital grant, provided that the\nprovider is not receiving and does not have a commitment to receive HUD funding\nfor the facility, and has not repaid the entire principal owed on the real\nproperty of the facility. If the depreciable project costs are adjusted after\naudit, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility will be changed to\nsuch adjusted depreciable project costs. Upon full repayment of principal, the\nbasis for depreciation for the facility will cease to include the amount of the\ncapital grant. Any provider which receives such a capital grant shall enter\ninto certain assurances with the OPWDD whereby the provider agrees that: (a) The difference between depreciation in\nthe rate attributable to the facility's depreciable project costs (other than\ndepreciation attributable to the provider's equity in the facility's real\nproperty at the time such property is put into use as a facility) and the\nprincipal which is repaid shall be deposited in a secure investment approved by\nthe commissioner. (b) Withdrawals\nfrom such investment shall be made only for the purpose of repayment of\nindebtedness owed on the real property of the facility. With the commissioner's\napproval based on cost savings, a provider may use withdrawals from such\ninvestment for repayment of indebtedness owed on the real property of another\nfacility which received a capital grant under this subparagraph or under\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, or if there is no such other facility\nwhich is mortgaged, for the repayment of indebtedness owed on the real property\nof another facility which is mortgaged under the same mortgage as the\nfacility. (c) Each withdrawal must\nbe approved by the commissioner. (d) If the provider ceases to operate the\nfacility as an intermediate care facility for developmentally disabled, or as\nany facility certified by OPWDD, it will repay to the OPWDD the balance on\ndeposit in the secure investment at the time of such cessation, including\ninterest earned on the investment. (e) Depreciable project costs shall mean\nthose acquisition and construction costs of a facility which have been\napproved, either before or after audit, by the New York State Office of the\n\nState Comptroller or by OPWDD or by OPWDD's designee. Such costs shall not\ninclude the cost of land. (f) HUD\nfunding shall mean lower income housing assistance under section 8 of the\n\nUnited States Housing Act of 1937, as amended\n42\nU.S.C. section\n1437(f)\nand/or a loan or loans pursuant to section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959, as\namended\n12\nU.S.C. section\n1701(q). (iv)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph\n(1)(viii) of this subdivision, any provider which has been notified by OPWDD\nbefore April 1, 1986 that there is a preliminary reservation of State aid funds\nfor a capital grant pursuant to Mental Hygiene Law, section 41.18(c) or 41.23, which is not receiving and has no commitment to receive HUD funding for the\nfacility which is the subject of the capital grant, may apply to the\ncommissioner to have the basis for computing depreciation on the facility\ninclude the facility's depreciable project costs which were funded with the\ncapital grant. Such application must be submitted to the commissioner on or\nbefore September 30, 1986 on the forms prescribed by the commissioner. Such\napplication shall be granted at the discretion of the commissioner upon a\nshowing that inclusion in the depreciation basis of the facility's depreciable\nproject costs which were funded with the capital grant is necessary to the\nfinancial viability of the facility and will not impede the facility's\nefficient and economical operation. If the commissioner approves such\napplication, the facility's rate shall be revised retroactive to April 1, 1986\nto include in the depreciation basis the facility's depreciable project costs\nwhich were funded with the capital grant, and the provider shall enter into\ncertain assurances described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. Upon full\nrepayment of principal, the basis for depreciation for the facility will cease\nto include the amount of the capital grant. If the depreciable project costs\nare adjusted after audit, the basis for computing depreciation on the facility\nwill be changed to such adjusted depreciation project costs. (g) Adjustments. Effective January 1, 2005 for Region II and III facilities, and effective July 1, 2005 for Region I facilities, there shall be an\nefficiency adjustment for under 31-bed facilities as described herein and\napplied as a reduction to reimbursable operating costs. (1)\nA determination shall be made as to\nwhether each provider has a per bed surplus or loss for all its under 31-bed\nfacilities. (i) Surplus/loss shall equal\noperating revenue minus operating costs. (a) For purposes of this efficiency adjustment, operating revenue and costs are net\nof day treatment, day service, transportation, and regional FTE\nadd-ons. (b) Revenue for\ndetermining the surplus/loss calculations for all facilities in all regions is\nfrom the rate effective July 1, 2004. (c) Costs for determining the surplus/loss\ncalculations are from the 2001 or 2001-2002 cost reporting year, trended to\n2004 or 2004-2005 dollars. (ii)\n\nThe value of the surplus/loss is divided\nby the total number of beds in all of the provider's under 31-bed facilities to\ndetermine the provider's per bed surplus/loss value. (2)\n\nRegional ranking of the per bed\nsurplus/loss value. (i) Within each of the\nthree regions, the per bed surplus/loss values are ranked and identified in\ndescending order. (ii)\n\nWithin each\nregion, the ranking is divided into five groups. Region I\nSurplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$17,498 to $4,289\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$4,288 to $523\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$522 to ($2,986)\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n($2,987) to ($7,465)\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n($7,466) to ($42,035)\n\nRegion II\nSurplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$17,478 to $6,354\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$6,353 to $4,081\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$4,080 to $873\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n$872 to ($5,343)\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n($5,344) to ($16,087)\n\nRegion III\nSurplus/Loss Range (Per Bed)\n\nEfficiency Group 5\n$12,398 to $7,216\n\nEfficiency Group 4\n$7,215 to $2,207\n\nEfficiency Group 3\n$2,206 to ($1,049)\n\nEfficiency Group 2\n($1,050 to ($6,440)\n\nEfficiency Group 1\n($6,441) to ($15,631)\n(3)\n\nEach of the five groups within each\nregion is assigned an ordinal weight. Group 5 = 5 Group 4 = 4 Group 3 = 3 Group 2 = 2 Group 1 =\n1\n(4)\n\nDetermination of\ntotal adjustment per facility. (i) The number\nof beds in the facility is multiplied by its assigned ordinal weight and the\nresult is multiplied by $334. (ii)\n\nThe facility's reimbursable operating costs are reduced by the amount\ndetermined in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (5)\n\nReallocation of costs. The following\nchanges to cost allocations for all under 31-bed facilities are effective\n\nJanuary 1, 2005 for Region II and III facilities, and effective July 1, 2005\nfor Region I facilities. (i) General\ninsurance costs are reallocated from base year administration OTPS costs to\nbase year support OTPS costs. (ii)\n\nProperty and casualty insurance costs are removed from base year administration\nOTPS costs. Property and casualty insurance costs from the appropriate cost\nreport period are included in capital costs. (iii)\n\nExpensed equipment costs from the base\nyear cost report are included in support OTPS costs. Expensed equipment costs\nare not included in capital costs. (h) Trend factors. OPWDD shall employ any or all of the following trend factor\ncomponents to the reimbursable operating costs. (1)\n\nFor under 31-bed Region I facilities: (i) 3.16 percent for 1994-95 to\n1995-96; (ii)\n2.92 percent for\n1995-96 to 1996-97; (iii)\n5.23\npercent for 1996-97 to 1997-98; (iv)\n2.88 percent for 1997-98 to\n1998-99; (v) 3.19 percent for\n1998-1999 to 1999-2000; (vi)\n2.90\npercent and an enhanced trend of 2.10 percent for 1999-2000 to\n2000-2001; (vii)\n3.52 percent for\n2000-2001 to 2001-2002; (viii)\neffective February 1, 2002, facilities will receive an amount that they would\nhave received if the trend factor in subparagraph (vii) of this paragraph for\nthe rate period of July 1, 2001 to June 30, 2002 were increased in the amount\nof 3.0 percent.

(5)\n\nWhere appropriate, the commissioner shall\nuse some combination in whole or in part of the yearly components to project\ncost data into the appropriate rate period. (i) Appeals to rates. (1)\n\nFor appeals for rate periods before July\n1, 2011, the commissioner will consider only the following appeals for\nadjustment to the rates which would result in an annual increase of $1,000 or\nmore in a facility's allowable costs, and are: (i) needed because of changes in the\nstatistical information used to calculate a facility's staffing or utilization\nstandards; (ii)\nrequests for relief\nfrom the standards contained in subdivision (d) or (e) of this section which\nwere applied to costs used in calculating the base period and subsequent period\nrates; (iii)\nappeals for\nadjustments needed because of material errors in the information submitted by\nthe facility which OPWDD used to establish the rate, or material errors in the\nrate computation; or\n(iv)\nappeals\nfor significant increases or decreases in a facility's overall base period\noperating costs due to implementation of new programs, changes in staff or\nservice, changes in the characteristics or number of individuals, changes in a\nlease agreement so as not to involve a related party, capital renovations, expansions or replacements which have been either mandated or approved by the\ncommissioner and, except in life-threatening situations, approved in advance by\nthe appropriate State agencies. (2)\n\nFor rate periods beginning July 1, 2011\nand thereafter, the commissioner will consider appeals for adjustment to the\nrates which: (i) would result in an annual\nincrease of $5,000 or more in the provider's allowable costs; and\n(ii)\nare needed because of the occurrence of\nbed vacancies. (3)\n\nNotification of first level appeal. (i) In\norder to appeal a rate in accordance with subparagraphs (1)(ii)-(iii) of this\nsubdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD an appeal application by certified\nmail, return receipt requested, either within 90 days of the facility receiving\nthe rate computation or within 90 days of the beginning of the rate period in\nquestion, whichever is later. (ii)\n\nIn order to appeal a rate in accordance with subparagraph (1)(i) or (iv) or\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, the provider must send to OPWDD, within one\nyear of the close of the rate period in question, a first level appeal\napplication by certified mail, return receipt requested. (4)\n\nFirst level rate appeal applications\nshall be made in writing to the commissioner. (i) The application shall set forth the basis\nfor the first level appeal and the issues of fact. Appropriate documentation\nshall accompany the application and OPWDD may request such additional\ndocumentation as it deems necessary. (ii)\n\nActions on first level rate appeal\napplications will be processed without unjustifiable delay. (5)\n\nThe burden of proof on the\nfirst level appeal shall be on the provider to demonstrate that the rate\nrequested in the appeal is necessary to ensure efficient and economical\noperation. (6)\nA rate revised by\nOPWDD pursuant to an appeal shall not be considered final unless and until\napproved by the State Division of the Budget. (7)\n\nAt no point in the first level appeal\nprocess shall the provider have a right to an interim report of any\ndeterminations made by any of the parties to the appeal. At the conclusion of\nthe first level appeal process OPWDD shall notify the provider of any proposed\nrevised rate or denial of same. Once OPWDD has informed the provider of the\nappeal outcome, a provider which submits a revised cost report for the period\nreviewed on appeal shall not be entitled to an increase in the award\ndetermination based on that resubmission. OPWDD shall inform the provider that\nit may either accept the proposed revised rate or request a second level appeal\nin accordance with section\n602.9\nof this Title in the event\nthat the proposed revised rate fails to grant some or all of the relief\nrequested. (8)\n\nIf OPWDD approves\nthe revision to the rate and State Division of the Budget denies the revision, the provider shall have no further right to administrative review pursuant to\nthis section. (9)\n\nAny rate revised\nin accordance with this subdivision shall be effective according to the dates\nindicated in the rate appeal notification. (10)\n\nAny additional reimbursement received by\nthe provider, pursuant to a rate revised in accordance with this subdivision, shall be restricted to the specific purpose set forth in the appeal\ndecision.

(ii)\n\nSecond level appeals shall be brought\nand determined in accordance with the applicable provisions of Part 602 of this\n\nTitle. (j) Employee health care enhancement (HCE). (1)\n\nProviders are eligible to have additional\nfunding included in their rate if they submitted a completed 2005 OPWDD survey\non health care benefits for all full- and part-time employees. (2)\n\nBased on a survey of providers, OPWDD\ndetermined a benchmark of health care benefits offered to employees by\nproviders. In September 2005, OPWDD notified those providers if their health\ncare benefits were at, above, or below the benchmark. (3)\n\nEffective January 1, 2006, providers may\nreceive additional funding as follows: (i) Providers whose employee health care benefits are at or above the benchmark\nshall receive an amount equaling 3.0 percent of the operating costs contained\nin the rate in effect on December 31, 2005 net of any funding provided pursuant\nto paragraph (4) of this subdivision. Providers which receive this 3.0 percent\nincrease may not apply for employee health care funding described in\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders whose employee health care\nbenefits and below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for additional funding as\nfollows: (a) For providers which reported on\nthe survey that no health care benefits are offered, OPWDD determined an\nallocation for each provider based on the total number of employees reported\nmultiplied by $2,500, except that if there are any employees who were reported\non the survey and to whom the provider chooses not to offer this funding, the\nallocation based on the total number of employees reported will be reduced by\nthe number of excluded employees reported multiplied by $2,500. These funds\nmust be used to establish employee health care benefits or to reduce employee\nout-of-pocket health- related expenses. (b) For providers which reported on the\nsurvey that employee health care benefits are offered to some or all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each provider based on the total number of\nemployees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are any employees\nwho were reported on the survey and to whom the provider chooses not to offer\nthis funding, the allocation based on the total number of employees reported\nwill be reduced by the number of excluded employees reported multiplied by\n$325. These funds must be used to enhance employee health care benefits or to\nreduce employee out- of-pocket health-related expenses. (4)\n\nEffective January 1, 2006, providers may receive additional funding that would have been received during\nthe period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005 if the funding described\nin paragraph (3) of this subdivision had been paid. (i) Providers whose employee health care\nbenefits are at or above the benchmark shall receive an amount equaling 3.0\npercent of the operating costs contained in the rate in effect on December 31, 2005, adjusted for the 21-month period from April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. Providers which receive this 3.0 percent increase may not apply for\nemployee health care funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nProviders whose\nemployee health care benefits are below the benchmark may apply to OPWDD for\nadditional funding as follows: (a) For\nproviders which reported on the survey that no employee health care benefits\nare offered, no additional funding for the period of April 1, 2004 through\n\nDecember 31, 2005 is available. (b) For providers which reported on the survey that employee health care benefits\nare offered to some or all employees, OPWDD determined an allocation for each\nprovider based on the total number of employees reported multiplied by $325, except that if there are any employees who were reported on the survey and to\nwhom the provider chooses not to offer this funding, the allocation based on\nthe total number of employees reported will be reduced by the number of\nexcluded employees reported multiplied by $325. The annual allocation of $325\nwill be adjusted for the 21-month period of April 1, 2004 through December 31, 2005. These funds must be used to reimburse health care expenses paid by\nemployees. (5)\n\nIn order to receive an allocation\ndescribed in subparagraph (3)(ii) or (4)(ii) of this subdivision, the provider\nmust send to OPWDD a completed written application submitted in the form and\nformat specified by the commissioner. (6)\n\nFunding is contingent upon OPWDD's\napproval of the application. OPWDD will base its decision on whether the\napplication is complete; whether it complies with the requirements of this\nsubdivision; and whether the application recognizes the provider's lowest paid\nemployees. OPWDD may request additional information and/or documentation as\nneeded before approving the application. (7)\n\nPayment of the allocation described in\nsubparagraph (3)(ii) or (4)(ii) of this subdivision shall be subject to the\nprovider submitting a resolution by its governing body that funds received will\nbe used to implement the plans described in the provider's approved\napplication. To receive the allocation, the provider must submit the resolution\nand the commission may approve it. (8)\n\nFor the purposes of the July 1, 2011, rate calculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all\nexpenses matched to their HCE I revenues to the fringe benefit cost category in\ntheir cost reports. (9)\nA rate\nrevised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final\nunless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (k) Employee health care\nenhancement II. (1)\n\nEffective January\n1, 2007 providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care\nenhancement II (HCE II). Provides must use these funds to establish or enhance\nemployee health care benefits or to reduce employee out of pocket health care\nexpenses. (2)\n\nIn order to receive\nfunding described in this subdivision the provider must have sent to OPWDD a\ncompleted written application by July 31, 2006, unless this deadline was\nextended by the commissioner. (3)\n\nFunding is contingent upon OPWDD's approval of the application. OPWDD shall\ndecide whether to approve the application based on whether the application is\ncomplete; whether it complies with the requirements of this subdivision; and\nwhether the application recognizes the provider's lowest paid employees. OPWDD\nmay request additional information and/or documentation, or revisions to an\napplication, before approving the application. (4)\n\nFunding for HCE II is available at either\n$2,500 per employee or $425 per employee, as follows: (i) The annual allocation at the $2,500 level\nis determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the\nprovider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $2,500. Funding at the\n$2,500 level is available to providers which: (a) submitted an application for HCE II\nfunding at the $2,500 level; and\n(b) do not offer health care benefits; and\n(c) were insufficiently funded\nfor health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by\nOPWDD of this determination. (ii)\n\nThe annual allocation at the $425 level\nis determined by OPWDD based on the total number of employees included in the\nprovider's approved HCE II application multiplied by $425. Funding at the $425\nlevel is available to providers which: (a) offer health care benefits to some or all employees and submitted an\napplication for HCE II funding at the $425 level; or\n(b) applied for HCE II funding at the $2,500\nlevel but received funding at the $2,500 per employee level pursuant to\nsubdivision (j) of this section; or\n(c) submitted an application at the $2,500\nlevel but have sufficient funding for health care, as determined by OPWDD. Affected providers were notified by OPWDD of this determination. (5)\n\nThe application\nsubmitted to OPWDD shall include plans for the expenditure of the HCE II\nallocation in conformance with this subdivision. Such HCE II plans shall assure\nthat all employees included in the application are entitled to some benefit\nfrom HCE II, although the value per employee may be lesser or greater than\n$2,500 or $425 per employee. Higher paid employees whose earnings exceed a\nsalary cap established by the provider may be excluded from receipt of any HCE\nII funds if these funds are reallocated to lower paid staff. (6)\nA provider approved to receive HCE II\nfunding pursuant to subparagraph (4)(ii) of this subdivision shall receive an\namount that would have been paid if the HCE II initiative had been implemented\n\nApril 1, 2006. (7)\n\nPayment of the\nHCE II funding shall be subject to the provider submitting a resolution by its\ngoverning body that funds received shall be used to implement the plans\ndescribed in the provider's approved application. To receive the allocation the\nprovider must submit the resolution and the commissioner must approve\nit. (8)\n\nFor the purpose of the July\n1 2011 rate calculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all\nexpenses matched to their HCE II revenues to the fringe benefit cost category\nin their cost reports. (9)\nA rate\nrevised by OPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final\nunless and until approved by the State Division of the Budget. (l) Employee health care\nenhancement III. (1)\n\nEffective January\n1, 2008 providers may be eligible to receive funding for the health care\nenhancement III (HCE III) included in their rate. (2)\n\nFunding. Based on a survey of providers'\nhistorical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark of health\ncare benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to September 30, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible for HCE III funding\nat the benchmark level. Providers deemed eligible for HCE III funding below the\nbenchmark level were mailed applications with instructions. (i) Providers deemed eligible for HCE III\nfunding at the benchmark level shall receive an amount equaling 3.0 percent of\nthe operating costs exclusive of any HCE III component contained in the rate in\neffect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided pursuant to subparagraph\n(iii) of this paragraph. A provider eligible for HCE III funding at the\nbenchmark level will receive a 1.0 percent funding increase in all its programs\nand services eligible under this Chapter if the provider notified OPWDD by\n\nOctober 31, 2007 that it was declining the 3.0 percent funding level increase\nand electing instead to receive a 1.0 percent funding level increase in all its\nprograms and services eligible under this Chapter. Providers which receive this\n3.0 percent or 1.0 percent funding level increase may not apply for employee\nhealth care funding described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders deemed eligible for HCE III\nfunding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive an amount\nequaling 1.0 percent of the operating costs exclusive of any HCE III component\ncontained in the rate in effect on January 1, 2008 net of any funding provided\npursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (a) Providers shall use these funds to\nestablish or enhance employee health care benefits and/or to reduce employee\nout-of-pocket health care expenses and/or to offset the portion of premium\nincreases paid by the provider which exceeds the portion of the trend factor or\nCOLA applicable to those premium increases. Providers shall assure that\nbenefits resulting from this additional funding recognize their lower paid\nemployees. (b) In order to receive\nthe funding described in this subdivision, the provider must have sent to OPWDD\na completed application and attestation received or postmarked by October 1, 2007, unless the deadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application\nand attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the\nfunds; agreed to obtain a resolution by December 31, 2007 from its governing\nbody authorizing such use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as\nwell as records detailing the distribution of HCE III funds. (c) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's\napproval of the application and attestation. OPWDD shall decide whether to\napprove the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and\nconforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional\ninformation or documentation before approving the application and\nattestation. (iii)\nA\nprovider approved to receive HCE III funding pursuant to subparagraph (i) or\n(ii) of this paragraph shall receive an amount that would have been paid if the\nHCE III initiative had been implemented April 1, 2007. (3)\n\nFor the purpose of the July, 1 2011 rate\ncalculations, OPWDD shall assume that providers have allocated all expenses\nmatched to their HCE III revenues to the fringe benefit cost category in their\ncost reports. (4)\nA rate revised by\nOPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and\nuntil approved by the State Division of the Budget. (m) Health care adjustments (HCA) IV\nand V. (1)\n\nEffective November 1, 2009, providers may be eligible to receive funding for health care adjustments IV and\nV included in their rates. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark providers. Based on a survey of\nproviders' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark\nof health care related benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to\n\nOctober 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible\nfor HCE III funding at the benchmark level. Providers eligible for HCE III\nfunding at the benchmark level are eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding at the\nbenchmark level. All other providers are eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding\nbelow the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA IV\nand HCA V funding at the benchmark level. (a) The HCA IV and HCA V funding levels for benchmark providers shall be 3.0\npercent of the allowable operating costs used in establishing the provider\nspecific rates. Each adjustment shall be applied sequentially to effect\ncompounding of the adjustments. (b) Alternatively, a provider deemed eligible for HCA IV and HCA V funding at the\nbenchmark level shall receive for each adjustment (IV and V) a 1.0 percent\nfunding increase in all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter\nif the provider notified OPWDD by September 11, 2009 in writing that it was\ndeclining the 3.0 percent funding level increase and electing instead to\nreceive a 1.0 percent funding level increase for each adjustment (IV and V) in\nall its programs and services eligible under this Chapter. Increases for HCA IV\nand HCA V shall be applied sequentially to effect compounding of the\nadjustments. (c) Providers eligible\nfor funding at the benchmark level may not apply for employee health care\nfunding described in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA IV and HCA V\nfunding below the benchmark level may apply to OPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA IV and HCA V funding levels for\nnon-benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent of the allowable operating costs\nused in establishing the provider specific rates. Each adjustment shall be\napplied sequentially to effect compounding of the adjustments. (b) Providers shall use these funds first to\noffset health care premium increases. Remaining funds shall be used to\nestablish or enhance employee health care related benefits and/or to reduce\nemployee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. (c) In order to receive HCA IV and HCA V\nfunds, the provider must have sent to OPWDD a completed application and\nattestation received or postmarked no later than September 11, 2009 unless the\ndeadline was extended by the commissioner. In the application and attestation, the provider must have indicated its intended use of the funds; agreed to\nobtain a resolution by October 31, 2009 from its governing body authorizing\nsuch use; and agreed to maintain on file the resolution as well as records\ndetailing the distribution of HCA IV and HCA V funds. (d) Funding is contingent upon OPWDD's\napproval of the application and attestation based on whether it is complete and\nconforms to the requirements of this subdivision. OPWDD may request additional\ninformation or documentation before approving the application and\nattestation. (4)\n\nCatch-up provisions. Effective November\n1, 2009, benchmark providers shall be eligible and non-benchmark providers with\napproved applications shall be eligible to receive additional funding for HCA\nIV in an amount that would have been received for the period of April 1, 2008\nthrough October 31, 2009 if the applicable increment had been implemented on\n\nApril 1, 2008. Effective November 1, 2009, benchmark providers and\nnon-benchmark providers with approved applications shall be eligible to receive\nadditional funding for HCA V in an amount that would have been received for the\nperiod of April 1, 2009 through October 31, 2009 if the applicable increment\nhad been implemented on April 1, 2009. Nothing in this paragraph shall entitle\na provider to receive payment for services which have not been\nprovided. (5)\n\nConsolidation of HCE\nand HCA funds effective January 1, 2010. (i) Effective January 1, 2010, the HCE I through III and HCA IV and HCA V\ncomponents contained in the rate shall be consolidated into a single discrete\namount. For purposes of determining this amount, OPWDD shall combine the HCE I\nthrough III and HCA IV and HCA V components contained in the initial rate in\neffect on January 1, 2010. OPWDD shall use this fixed amount as the HCA payment\nfor the rate periods beginning on or after January 1, 2010. (ii)\n\nEffective January 1, 2010, with the\nconsolidation of the health care adjustments, non-benchmark providers shall use\nHCE I, II and III funds first to either offset health care premium increases\nand/or to maintain benefits that were established and funded with previous HCE\nI, II and III receipts. Remaining funds shall be used to establish or enhance\nemployee health care related benefits and/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket\nhealth care related expenses. Non-benchmark providers shall continue to use HCA\nIV and V funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds\nshall be used to establish or enhance employee health care related benefits\nand/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses. Health\ncare enhancement/adjustment funds included in the rates for services delivered\non or after July 6, 2011 shall be used by non-benchmark providers for the\npurposes described in this subparagraph and/or for any other options that\ncontinue and/or enhance existing health care benefits and/or improve the\nrecruitment and/or retention of the provider's lower paid employees. However, in using these funds accordingly, non-benchmark providers may establish which\npriorities serve the needs of such employees. Additionally, on July 6, 2011, health care enhancement/adjustment funding shall be included in the\nreimbursable cost category of fringe benefits in the rate. (6)\n\nProviders' distribution of HCA IV and HCA\nV funds is subject to audit to ensure conformity with the requirements of this\nsubdivision and distribution of funds consistent with the provider's approved\napplication. (7)\nA rate revised by\nOPWDD pursuant to this subdivision shall not be considered final unless and\nuntil approved by the State Division of the Budget. (n) Health care adjustment (HCA)\nVI. (1)\n\nEffective October 1, 2010, providers may be eligible to receive funding for health care adjustment VI\nincluded in their rates. (2)\n\nBenchmark providers and non-benchmark providers. Based on a survey of\nproviders' historical data as of January 1, 2005, OPWDD determined a benchmark\nof health care related benefits offered to employees by providers. Prior to\n\nOctober 31, 2007, OPWDD notified those providers which OPWDD deemed eligible\nfor health care enhancement (HCE) III funding at the benchmark level. These\nproviders are \"benchmark providers\" and are eligible for HCA VI funding at the\nbenchmark level. All other providers (\"non-benchmark providers\") are eligible\nfor HCA VI funding below the benchmark level. (3)\n\nFunding. (i) Providers eligible for HCA VI funding at\nthe benchmark level. (a) The HCA VI funding\nlevels for benchmark providers shall be 3.0 percent of the allowable operating\ncosts used in establishing the provider specific rates in effect on April 1, 2010. (b) Alternatively, a provider\neligible for HCA VI funding at the benchmark level shall receive a 1.0 percent\nfunding increase in all its programs and services eligible under this Chapter\nif the provider notified OPWDD by August 13, 2010 in writing that it was\ndeclining the 3.0 percent funding level increase and electing instead to\nreceive a 1.0 percent funding level increase for HCA VI in all its programs and\nservices eligible under this Chapter. (c) Providers eligible for funding at the\nbenchmark level may not apply for HCA VI funding described in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph. (ii)\n\nProviders eligible for HCA VI funding below the benchmark level may apply to\nOPWDD to receive these funds. (a) The HCA VI\nfunding level for non-benchmark providers shall be 1.0 percent of the allowable\noperating costs used in establishing the provider specific rates in effect on\n\nApril 1, 2010. (b) Providers shall\nuse these funds first to offset health care premium increases. Remaining funds\nshall be used to establish or enhance employee health care related benefits\nand/or to reduce employee out-of-pocket health care related expenses.
