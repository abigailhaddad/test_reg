  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-1.11 - Remedial action plans (raps)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Why is this section written in a special format?\nThis section is written in a special format to make it\neasier to understand the regulatory requirements. Like other State regulations, this establishes enforceable legal requirements. For this section, \"I\" and\n\"you\" refer to the owner/operator. (b) General information. (1)\n\nWhat is a RAP?\n(i) A RAP is a special form of a Part 373\npermit that you, as an owner or operator, may obtain, instead of a permit\nissued under this Subpart except section\n373-1.3\nof this Subpart and this\nsection, to authorize you to treat, store, or dispose of hazardous remediation\nwaste (as defined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle) at a remediation waste management site. A RAP may only be issued for the\narea of contamination where the remediation wastes to be managed under the RAP\noriginated, or areas in close proximity to the contaminated area, except as\nallowed in limited circumstances under paragraph (g)(1) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe requirements in\nthis Subpart 373-1 except sections\n373-1.3\nof this Subpart and this\nsection do not apply to RAPs unless those requirements for traditional Part 373\npermits are specifically required under subdivisions (b) through (g) of this\nsection. The definitions in section\n370.2\nof this Title apply to\nRAPs. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding any\nother provision of this Subpart, any document that meets the requirements in\nthis paragraph constitutes a treatment, storage or disposal facility permit\nunder section\n27-0913\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law. (iv)\nA RAP may\nbe: (a) a stand-alone document that includes\nonly the information and conditions required by this section; or\n(b) part (or parts) of another document that\nincludes information and/or conditions for other activities at the remediation\nwaste management site, in addition to the information and conditions required\nby this section. (v) If\nyou are treating, storing, or disposing of hazardous remediation wastes as part\nof a cleanup compelled by Federal or State cleanup authorities, your RAP does\nnot affect your obligations under those authorities in any way. (vi)\n\nIf you receive a RAP at a facility\noperating under interim status, the RAP does not terminate your interim\nstatus. (2)\n\nWhen do I\nneed a RAP?\n(i) Whenever you treat, store, or\ndispose of hazardous remediation wastes in a manner that requires a Part 373\npermit under section\n373-1.1\nof this Subpart, you must\neither obtain: (a) a State permit according\nto this Subpart except section\n373-1.3\nof this Subpart and this\nsection; or\n(b) a RAP according to\nthis section. (ii)\n\nTreatment units that use combustion of hazardous remediation wastes at a\nremediation waste management site are not eligible for RAPs under this\nsection. (iii)\n\nYou may obtain a RAP\nfor managing hazardous remediation waste at an already permitted Part 373\nfacility. You must have these RAPs approved as a modification to your existing\npermit according to the requirements of section\n373-1.7\nof this Subpart instead of\nthe requirements in this section. When you submit an application for such a\nmodification, however, the information requirements in sections 373-1.5 and\n373-1.9\nof this Subpart do not\napply; instead, you must submit the information required under paragraph (c)(4)\nof this section. When your permit is modified, the RAP becomes part of the\n\nState permit. (iv)\n\nEvery\napplication for modifications to a permit will be processed pursuant to Part\n621 of this Title. When your permit (including the RAP portion) is renewed, modified, revoked or suspended or when it expires, the entire permit will be\nprocessed according to the applicable requirements in Part 621 of this Title. At that time, the applicable requirements of subdivision (e) of this section\nalso apply to the RAP portion of the permit. (3)\n\nDoes my RAP grant me any rights or\nrelieve me of any obligations? Compliance with a RAP issued pursuant to this\nsection during its term constitutes compliance, for purposes of enforcement, except as described in section\n373-1.6\n(e) of this\n\nSubpart. (c) Applying for a RAP. (1)\n\nHow do I\napply for a RAP? To apply for a RAP, you must complete an application, sign it, and submit it to the regional permit administrator according to the\nrequirements in this section. (2)\n\nWho must obtain a RAP? When a facility or remediation waste management site is\nowned by one person, but the treatment, storage or disposal activities are\noperated by another person, it is the operator's duty to obtain a RAP, except\nthat the owner must also sign the RAP application. (3)\n\nWho must sign the application and any\nrequired reports for a RAP? Both the owner and the operator must sign the RAP\napplication and any required reports according to section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)\nof\nthis Subpart. In the application, both the owner and the operator must also\nmake the certification required under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\n(\na\n) of this Subpart. However, the owner may choose the\nalternative certification under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart if the operator certifies under section\n373-1.4\n(a)(5)(iv)\n(\na\n) of this Subpart. (4)\n\nWhat must I include in my application for\na RAP? You must include the following information in your application for a\nRAP: (i) the name, address, and EPA\nidentification number of the remediation waste management site; (ii)\nthe name, address, and telephone number\nof the owner and operator; (iii)\nthe latitude and longitude of the site; (iv)\nthe United States Geological Survey\n(USGS) or county map showing the location of the remediation waste management\nsite; (v) a scaled drawing of the\nremediation waste management site showing: (a) the remediation waste management site\nboundaries; (b) any significant\nphysical structures; and\n(c) the\nboundary of all areas on-site where remediation waste is to be treated, stored\nor disposed; (vi)\na\nspecification of the hazardous remediation waste to be treated, stored or\ndisposed of at the facility or remediation waste management site. This must\ninclude information on: (a) constituent\nconcentrations and other properties of the hazardous remediation wastes that\nmay affect how such materials should be treated and/or otherwise\nmanaged; (b) an estimate of the\nquantity of these wastes; and\n(c) a\ndescription of the processes you will use to treat, store, or dispose of this\nwaste including technologies, handling systems, design and operating parameters\nyou will use to treat hazardous remediation wastes before disposing of them\naccording to the LDR standards of Part 376 of this Title, as\napplicable; (vii)\nenough\ninformation to demonstrate that operations that follow the provisions in your\nRAP application will ensure compliance with applicable requirements of Subparts\n373-2, 374-1, and Part 376 of this Title; (viii)\nsuch information as may be necessary\nto enable the department to carry out the department's duties under other State\nlaws as is required for traditional Part 373 permits under Part 621 of this\n\nTitle; and\n(ix)\nany other\ninformation the department decides is necessary for demonstrating compliance\nwith this Subpart or for determining any additional RAP conditions that are\nnecessary to protect human health and the environment. (5)\n\nWhat if I want to keep this information\nconfidential? Section\n616.7\nof this Title allows you to\nclaim as confidential any or all of the information you submit to the\ndepartment under this section. You must assert any such claim at the time that\nyou submit your RAP application or other submissions by stamping the words\n\"confidential business information\" on each page containing such information. If you do assert a claim at the time you submit the information, the department\nwill treat the information according to the procedures in Part 616 of this\n\nTitle. If you do not assert a claim at the time you submit the information, the\ndepartment may make the information available to the public without further\nnotice to you. The department will deny any requests for confidentiality of\nyour name and/or address. (6)\n\nTo\nwhom must I submit my RAP application? You must submit your application for a\nRAP to the regional permit administrator for approval. (7)\n\nIf I submit my RAP application as part of\nanother document, what must I do? If you submit your application for a RAP as a\npart of another document, you must clearly identify the components of that\ndocument that constitute your RAP application. (d) Getting a RAP approved. (1)\n\nWhat is the process for approving or\ndenying my application for a RAP?\n(i) If the\ndepartment tentatively finds that your RAP application includes all of the\ninformation required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section and that your proposed\nremediation waste management activities meet the regulatory standards, the\ndepartment will make a tentative decision to approve your RAP application. The\ndepartment will then prepare a draft RAP and provide an opportunity for public\ncomment before making a final decision on your RAP application, according to\nthis section. (ii)\n\nIf the\ndepartment tentatively finds that your RAP application does not include all of\nthe information required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section or that your\nproposed remediation waste management activities do not meet the regulatory\nstandards, the department may request additional information from you or ask\nyou to correct deficiencies in your application. If you fail or refuse to\nprovide any additional information the department requests, or to correct any\ndeficiencies in your RAP application, the department may make a tentative\ndecision to deny your RAP application. After making this tentative decision, the department will prepare a notice of intent to deny your RAP application\n(notice of intent to deny) and provide an opportunity for public comment before\nmaking a final decision on your RAP application, according to the requirements\nin this section. The department may deny the RAP application either in its\nentirety or in part. (iii)\n\nThe\nprocesses outlined in this subdivision are consistent with and are to be read\nin conjunction with Part 621 of this Title. (2)\n\nWhat must the department include in a\ndraft RAP?

In satisfying this provision, the department may incorporate, expressly or by reference, applicable\nrequirements of Subparts 373-2, 374-1, and Part 376 of this Title into the RAP\nor establish site- specific conditions as required or allowed by Subparts\n373-2, 374-1, and Part 376 of this Title; (b) terms and conditions in section\n373-1.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart; (c) terms and conditions\nfor modifying, revoking, suspending, and renewing your RAP, as provided in\nparagraph (e)(1) of this section; and\n(d) any additional terms or conditions that\nthe department determines are necessary to protect human health and the\nenvironment, including any terms and conditions necessary to respond to spills\nand leaks during use of any units permitted under the RAP; and\n(iii)\nif the draft RAP is part of\nanother document, as described in clause (b)(1)(iv)(\nb\n) of this\nsection, the department must clearly identify the components of that document\nthat constitute the draft RAP. (3)\n\nWhat else must the department prepare in\naddition to the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny? Once the department has\nprepared the draft RAP or notice of intent to deny, the department must then: (i) prepare a statement of basis that briefly\ndescribes the derivation of the conditions of the draft RAP and the reasons for\nthem, or the rationale for the notice of intent to deny; (ii)\ncompile an administrative record, including: (a) the RAP application, and any\nsupporting data furnished by the applicant; (b) the draft RAP or notice of intent to\ndeny; (c) the statement of basis\nand all documents cited therein (material readily available at the issuing\noffice or published material that is generally available need not be physically\nincluded with the rest of the record, as long as it is specifically referred to\nin the statement of basis); and\n(d) any other documents that support the decision to approve or deny the RAP; and\n(iii)\nmake\ninformation contained in the administrative record available for review by the\npublic upon request. (4)\n\nWhat are the procedures for public comment on the draft RAP or notice of intent\nto deny?\n(i) Consistent with the requirements\nof Part 621 of this Title, the following must be done: (a) the department must send notice to you of\nthe department's intention to approve or deny your RAP application, and send\nyou a copy of the statement of basis; (b) you must publish a notice of the\ndepartment's intention to approve or deny your RAP application in a major local\nnewspaper of general circulation; (c) you must broadcast the department's\nintention to approve or deny your RAP application over a local radio\nstation; (d) the department shall\nsend a notice of the department's intention to approve or deny your RAP\napplication to each unit of local government having jurisdiction over the area\nin which your site is located, and to each State agency having any authority\nunder State law with respect to any construction or operations at the site and\nto individuals who have requested to be notified of completeness for your\napplication or for all RAPS. The department shall also publish notice of\ncomplete application in the Environmental Notice Bulletin, pursuant to Part 621\nof this Title; and\n(e) the\ndepartment may provide or require you to provide other reasonable public notice\nof complete application and opportunity for public comment, pursuant to Part\n621 of this Title.

(5)\n\nHow will the department make a final\ndecision on my RAP application?\n(i) The\ndepartment must consider and respond to any significant comments raised during\nthe public comment period, or during any hearing on the draft RAP or notice of\nintent to deny, and revise your draft RAP based on those comments, as\nappropriate. (ii)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines that your RAP includes the information and terms and conditions\nrequired in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, then the department will issue a\nfinal decision approving your RAP and, in writing, notify you and all\ncommenters on your draft RAP that your RAP application has been\napproved. (iii)\n\nIf the department\ndetermines that your RAP does not include the information required in paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, then the department will issue a final decision\ndenying your RAP and, in writing, notify you and all commenters on your draft\nRAP that your RAP application has been denied. (iv)\n\nIf the department's final decision is\nthat the tentative decision to deny the RAP application was incorrect, the\ndepartment will withdraw the notice of intent to deny and proceed to prepare a\ndraft RAP, according to the requirements in this section. (v) When the department issues its final RAP\ndecision, it shall include notice of opportunity and procedures for requesting\nan adjudicatory hearing pursuant to Part 621 of this Title if an adjudicatory\nhearing has not been held.

RAPs must be issued for a fixed term, not to exceed 10\nyears, although they may be renewed upon approval by the department in fixed\nincrements of no more than 10 years. In addition, the department must review\nany RAP for hazardous waste land disposal five years after the date of issuance\nor reissuance and you or the department must follow the requirements for\nmodifying your RAP as necessary to assure that you continue to comply with\ncurrently applicable requirements in RCRA sections 3004 and 3005. (4)\n\nWhat happens if I have applied correctly\nfor a RAP renewal and met timely submittal requirements but have not received\napproval by the time my old RAP expires? If you have submitted a timely and\ncomplete application for a RAP renewal pursuant to Part 621 of this Title, but\nthe department, through no fault of yours, has not issued a new RAP with an\neffective date on or before the expiration date of your previous RAP, your\nprevious RAP conditions continue in force until the effective date of your new\nRAP or RAP denial.

(g) Obtaining a RAP for an off-site\nlocation. (1)\n\nMay I perform\nremediation waste management activities under a RAP at a location removed from\nthe area where the remediation wastes originated?\n(i) You may request a RAP for remediation\nwaste management activities at a location removed from the area where the\nremediation wastes originated if you believe such a location would be more\nprotective than the contaminated area or areas in close proximity. (ii)\n\nIf the department determines that an\nalternative location, removed from the area where the remediation waste\noriginated, is more protective than managing remediation waste at the area of\ncontamination or areas in close proximity, then the department may approve a\nRAP for this alternative location. (iii)\n\nYou must request the RAP, and the\ndepartment will approve or deny the RAP, according to the procedures and\nrequirements in this section and Part 621 of this Title. (iv)\nA RAP for an alternative location must\nalso meet the following requirements, which the department must include in the\nRAP for such locations: (a) the RAP for the\nalternative location must be issued to the person responsible for the cleanup\nfrom which the remediation wastes originated; (b) the RAP is subject to the expanded public\nparticipation requirements in section\n373-1.10\n(a), (b), and (c) of this Subpart; (c) the\nRAP is subject to the public notice requirements in Part 621 of this\n\nTitle. (v) These\nalternative locations are remediation waste management sites, and retain the\nfollowing benefits of remediation waste management sites: (a) exclusion from facility-wide corrective\naction under section\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nPart; and\n(b) application of\nsection\n373-2.1\n(a)(9)\nof\nthis Part in lieu of sections\n373-2.2, 373-2.3, and\n373-2.4\nof this Part.
