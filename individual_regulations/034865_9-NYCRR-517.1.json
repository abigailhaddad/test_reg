  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 517.1 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope. (1)\n\nApplicability. These rules are\napplicable in courts-martial, including summary courts-martial, to the extent\nand with the exceptions stated in Mil. R. Evid. 1101. (2)\n\nSecondary sources. If not otherwise\nprescribed in this Chapter or these rules, and insofar as practicable and not\ninconsistent with or contrary to the code or this Chapter, courts- martial\nshall apply: (i) first, the rules of evidence\ngenerally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the United States\ndistrict courts; and\n(ii)\nsecond, when not inconsistent with subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the rules of\nevidence at common law. (3)\n\nRule of construction. Except as otherwise\nprovided in these rules, the term military judge includes the president of a\nspecial court-martial without a military judge and a summary court-martial\nofficer. (c) Purpose and\nconstruction. These rules shall be construed to secure fairness in\nadministration, elimination of unjustifiable expense and delay, and promotion\nof growth and development of the law of the evidence to the end that the truth\nmay be ascertained and proceedings justly determined. (d) Rulings on evidence. (1)\n\nEffect of erroneous ruling. Error may not\nbe predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless the ruling\nmaterially prejudices a substantial right of a party; and\n(i) Objection. In case the ruling is one\nadmitting evidence, a timely objection or motion to strike appears of record, stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground was not\napparent from the context; or\n(ii)\n\nOffer of proof. In case the ruling is one excluding evidence, the substance of\nthe evidence was made known to the military judge by offer or was apparent from\nthe context within which questions were asked. The standard provided in this paragraph does not apply to\nerrors involving requirements imposed by the Constitution of the United States\nas applied to members of the Armed Forces except insofar as the error arises\nunder these rules and this paragraph provides a standard that is more\nadvantageous to the accused than the constitutional standard. (2)\n\nRecord of offer and ruling. The military judge may add any other or further statement which shows the\ncharacter of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the objection\nmade, and the ruling thereon. The military judge may direct the making of an\noffer in question and answer form. (3)\n\nHearing of members. In a court-martial\ncomposed of a military judge and members, proceedings shall be conducted, to\nthe extent practicable, so as to prevent inadmissible evidence from being\nsuggested to the members by any means, such as making statements or offers of\nproof or asking questions in the hearing of the member. (4)\n\nPlain error. Nothing in this subdivision\nprecludes taking notice of plain errors that materially prejudice substantial\nrights although they were not brought to the attention of the military\njudge. (d) Preliminary\nquestions. (1)\n\nQuestions of admissibility\ngenerally. Preliminary questions concerning the qualification of a person to be\na witness, the existence of a privilege, the admissibility of evidence, an\napplication for a continuance, or the availability of a witness shall be\ndetermined by the military judge. In making these determinations the military\njudge is not bound by the rules of evidence except those with respect to\nprivileges. (2)\n\nRelevancy\nconditioned on fact. When the relevancy of evidence depends upon the\nfulfillment of a condition of fact, the military judge shall admit it upon, or\nsubject to, the introduction of evidence sufficient to support a finding of the\nfulfillment of the condition. A ruling on the sufficiency of evidence to\nsupport a finding of fulfillment of a condition of fact is the sole\nresponsibility of the military judge, except where these rules or this Chapter\nprovide expressly to the contrary. (3)\n\nHearing of members. Except in cases tried\nbefore a special court-martial without a military judge, hearings on the\nadmissibility of statements of an accused under Mil. R. Evid. 301-306 shall in\nall cases be conducted out of the hearing of the members. Hearings on other\npreliminary matters shall be so conducted when the interests of justice require\nor, when an accused is a witness, if the accused so requests. (4)\n\nTestimony by accused. The accused does\nnot, by testifying upon a preliminary matter, become subject to\ncross-examination as to other issues in the case. (5)\n\nWeight and credibility. This subdivision\ndoes not limit the right of a party to introduce before the members evidence\nrelevant to weight or credibility. (e) Limited admissibility. When evidence\nwhich is admissible as to one party or for one purpose but not admissible as to\nanother party or for another purpose is admitted, the military judge, upon\nrequest, shall restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the\nmembers accordingly. (f) Remainder\nof or related writings or recorded statements. When a writing or recorded\nstatement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may\nrequire that party at that time to introduce any other party or any other\nwriting or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered\ncontemporaneously with it.
