  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 4-3.6 - Reasonable approximation based on general information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where, after meeting the requirements of\ndue diligence, a corporation lacks sufficient information to use the rules for\nreasonable approximation based on customer information to determine the\ncustomer's primary use location of a digital product or digital service, the\ncorporation must use reasonable approximation based on general\ninformation. (b) Definition. Reasonable approximation based on general information is an alternative method\nused to determine the location at which a customer primarily uses the digital\nproduct or digital service in instances inwhich a general information\nmeasurement, such as the general population, a subset of the general\npopulation, or some other general metric, reasonably reflects the geographic\ndistribution of the customer's primary use location. (c) Application of reasonable approximation\nbased on general information. (1)\nA\ncorporation must use statistical information, based on an appropriate metric, that reasonably approximates where the customers primarily use the digital\nproduct or digital service. (2)\n\nIn\nany case in which the commissioner determines that the corporation's method of\napproximation is not reasonable, the commissioner may substitute another\ngeneral information measurement that the commissioner determines is\nappropriate. In this instance, the corporation bears the burden of\ndemonstrating that the method the commissioner prescribes is not\nreasonable. (3)\n\nIn any case in\nwhich the commissioner determines that the corporation's method of\napproximation is reasonable, but that it has not been applied in a consistent\nmanner with respect to similar transactions, the commissioner shall require\nthat the corporation apply its method of approximation in a consistent\nmanner. (d) In any case\nin which the corporation does not have sufficient information to reasonably\napproximate based on general information, the corporation must instead source\nits receipts to where the digital product or service is received using the\nwhere received method (see section\n4-3.7\nof this Subpart). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§§\n4-3.6\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 27, 2023/Volume XLV, Issue 52, eff. 12/27/2023\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
