Tit. 16 § 11.30 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Extraordinary\ncost means the cost, as determined by a qualified professional and shown in a\nwritten estimate signed by that professional, which also shows all relevant\nlicense numbers or professional qualifications, of installing equipment\nnecessary to eliminate a shared meter in a dwelling or part of a dwelling which\nis in excess of the amount of rent for four months rental of such dwelling, or\ntwo months rental of such dwelling if the amount of service measured by the\nshared meter, that is used outside the shared meter customer's dwelling, is\nless than 20 percent of the average total monthly consumption recorded on the\nmeter for the immediately preceding 12-month period (or if insufficient history\nis available, based on the best available information). (b) Qualified professional means a person who\nis permitted to install or repair gas, steam or electric equipment, including\nrewiring or repiping, by the local code of the municipality where the meter in\nquestion is located. (c) Legal\nimpediment means a restriction which prevents separate metering, rewiring, or\nrepiping due to zoning ordinances, which limit the number, type or location of\nmeters in a building, or due to the historical significance of the structure, or any other legal prohibition against elimination of the shared meter\ncondition. (d) Minimal service. Whenever the quantity of service on a shared meter, that is used outside of the\ntenant's dwelling, is estimated to be less than 10 percent of the total monthly\nconsumption recorded on the meter, based on average monthly service for the\nimmediately preceding 12-month period (or if insufficient history is available, based on the best available information), or 75 kwh/month of electricity, five\ntherms/month of gas or one mlb/month of steam, whichever is greater, the owner, tenant and any third party whose utility service was to be measured through\nanother meter and had caused or benefited from the shared meter condition, may\nnegotiate a mutually acceptable agreement for the responsibility for the cost\nof such shared meter consumption. When the interested parties are unable to\nnegotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement, the commission or its designee may\norder a remedy for a shared meter customer that it deems fair and equitable\nbased on costs incurred and benefits received by the various parties.
