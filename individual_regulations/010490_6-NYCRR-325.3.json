  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 325.3 - Control of termites\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing restrictions must be complied with when applying liquid termiticide: (1)\n\nApplication of termiticide must be made\nin strict accordance with both the labeling of the termiticide being used and\nthese regulations. Where termiticide labeling and these regulations address the\nsame point, the more prohibitive requirements of the labeling or these\nregulations must be complied with. (2)\n\nPrior to subsurface ground application of\ntermiticide by other than the excavation/treated backfill technique, a visual\ninspection of the application area must be made by an individual certified in\nthe termite subcategory to ensure that termiticide will not move from the\napplication area into a structure. Application near foundations that have\nholes, cracks or voids must be made only if application is limited to the\nexcavation/treated backfill technique, or if prior to application all holes, cracks and voids are filled with an impervious material in a manner that\ncompletely seals any openings and prevents termiticide from moving into the\nstructure. (3)\n\nAll pressurized\napplication equipment used for subsurface ground application of termiticide\nmust be equipped with a properly operating pressure gauge that is accurate to\nwithin plus or minus three pounds per square inch. During applications, pressure at the nozzle must not exceed 25 pounds per square inch. (4)\n\nDuring subsurface ground application of\ntermiticide along the exterior of a basement wall, by other than the\nexcavation/treated backfill technique, and during placement of termiticide\nunderneath a concrete slab by angled or horizontal rodding from an area outside\nthe perimeter of the slab, at least two employees of the pesticide business\nmust be present on the premises. During application, one of these employees\nmust be present inside the structure to observe the area of application, and to\nassist the applicator in detecting any intrusion of termiticide into the\nstructure. At the first indication of any movement of termiticide into the\nstructure, the applicator must immediately cease applying termiticide and\ninitiate appropriate clean-up procedures. (5)\n\nSubsurface ground application of\ntermiticide must not be made to soil at or below the level of the local water\ntable as determined by: (i) excavation of a\ntest hole dug down to the lowest planned application area if evidence of a high\nwater table is found, such as water stains or efflorescence on the interior\nsurface of foundation walls, or the presence of a sump pit, sump pump or French\ndrain in the structure to be treated. Application of termiticide to soil must\nnot be made unless, at the end of two hours immediately following completion of\nexcavation of the test hole, the test hole does not contain any water or\nsaturated soil; or\n(ii)\nexamination\nof all sump pits in the structure if they exist. Any standing water must be\nremoved from sump pits, and all sump pumps must be removed from sump pits or\ndisconnected from their power source for the next two hours. Application of\ntermiticide to soil must not be made unless, at the end of two hours\nimmediately following removal or disconnection of pumps, sump pits do not\ncontain any water. (6)\n\nSubsurface ground application of termiticide must not be made to soil located\nwithin 10 feet of a well or cistern as measured across the surface of the soil\nfrom the application area to where the well or cistern begins to descend\nvertically, nor under or adjacent to any structure that contains a well or\ncistern, unless soil is removed and treated outside the foundation by the\nexcavation/treated backfill technique, or unless a driven (steel casing) well\nscreened in the water table aquifer has been abandoned in a manner which meets\nall of the following conditions: (i) all\nmaterials must be removed from the well (inner casings, pumps, pipes, electrical cable, etc.); (ii)\nall\nappurtenant features must be disconnected (water supply pipe); and\n(iii)\nall of the casing must be completely\nsealed with grout, cement or concrete for it's entire length. Removal of the\nouter steel casing is not necessary. (7)\n\nSubsurface ground application of\ntermiticide must not be made to soil within four feet above and beside water\npipes that are located between 10 feet and 25 feet from wells or cisterns, as\nmeasured across the surface of the soil from the application area to where the\nwell begins to descend vertically, unless application is limited to the\nexcavation/treated backfill technique. (8)\n\nApplication of termiticide must not be\nmade to voids in masonry foundations unless: (i) termiticide is applied as a subsurface\nground application within 42 inches of the points along the foundation that are\nclosest to the footing. Points of application must be on the side of the\nfoundation closest to the footing where soil or a masonry element of\nconstruction adjoins the foundation. Anything restricting access to the bare\nmasonry foundation targeted for treatment must be removed to expose an area\nwithin 42 inches of the points along the foundation that are closest to the\nfooting; and\n(ii)\nthe basement or\ncrawl space enclosed by or containing such foundation is ventilated as follows: (a) immediately following application and for\nat least seven days thereafter, the area must be ventilated directly to the\noutside of the structure; (b) the\nminimum net area of ventilating openings must not be less than one square foot\nfor each 150 square feet of interior floor surface of the basement or crawl\nspace area; and\n(c) there must be\nat least four vents, and each vent must be located no farther than three feet\nfrom each corner. (9)\n\nSubsurface ground application of\ntermiticide must not be made to soil in areas where an air circulation system\nis to be installed within or beneath a concrete slab or floor unless the air\ncirculation system: (i) is completely encased\nin concrete; or\n(ii)\nis constructed\nof an impervious material such as metal or plastic that is sealed prior to\nconstruction of a concrete slab or floor. (10)\n\nSubsurface ground application of\ntermiticide must not be made to structures that have an air circulation system\ninstalled within or beneath a concrete slab or floor unless: (i) all supply and return register outlets\nthroughout the air circulation system are permanently filled and sealed to\ncompletely disable the system; or\n(ii)\napplication is restricted to soil\noutside the perimeter of the concrete slab or floor, and application is made\nfrom an area outside the perimeter of the concrete slab or floor by vertical\nrodding, trenching or the excavation/treated backfill technique. (11)\n\nSubsurface ground application\nof liquid termiticide must not be made to structures with plenum air spaces\nunless application is restricted to soil outside the foundation, and\napplication is made from an area outside the foundation by vertical rodding, trenching or the excavation/treated backfill technique. (12)\n\nSubsurface ground application or surface\napplication of termiticide must not be made to exposed soil in crawl spaces\nthat are more than 18 inches but less than five feet in height, as measured\nfrom the floor to the underside of floor joists, or basements unless: (i) the entire exposed soil surface is\ncovered with a concrete slab immediately following application (except areas\nwhere utility access panels are constructed); or\n(ii)\nthe following measures are complied\nwith: (a) treated areas must be covered with\na concrete strip or layer of untreated soil measuring at least the width of\ntreated soil; and\n(b) the basement\nor accessible crawl space must not connect with other interior areas of the\nstructure without a separating wall or floor. The wall or floor must obstruct\nmovement of termiticide vapor to any non-target areas. The wall or floor must\nbe in place for at least seven days following application. Any access doors in\nthe wall or floor must be securely closed immediately following application; and\n(c) the basement or accessible\ncrawl space area must be ventilated in compliance with clauses (8)(ii)(a), (b)\nand (c) of this subdivision. (13)\n\nSubsurface ground application or surface\napplication of termiticide must not be made to exposed soil in crawl spaces\nthat are 18 inches or less in height, as measured from the floor to the\nunderside of floor joists, unless: (i) the\nentire exposed soil surface is covered with a concrete slab immediately\nfollowing application (except areas where utility access panels are\nconstructed); or\n(ii)\nthe following\nmeasures are complied with: (a) the\ninaccessible crawl space must not connect with other interior areas of the\nstructure without a separating wall or floor. The wall or floor must obstruct\nmovement of termiticide vapor to any non-target areas. The wall or floor must\nbe in place for at least seven days following application. Any access doors in\nthe wall or floor must be securely closed immediately following application; and\n(b) the inaccessible crawl\nspace area must be ventilated in compliance with clauses (8)(ii)(a), (b) and\n(c) of this subdivision. (14)\n\nImmediately following subsurface ground\napplication of termiticide, all drill holes must be securely plugged with\nconcrete or mortar. Plugs made out of other materials such as plastic, wood or\ncork must be recessed a minimum of one inch and capped with concrete or\nmortar. (15)\n\nRetreatment must not\nbe made unless there is evidence of reinfestation subsequent to a prior\napplication as determined by the visual observation of live termites, or the\nsealing, extension or reconstruction of mud tubes after they have been\ndisturbed; or there has been a disruption of the termiticide barrier due to\nconstruction, excavation, or landscaping. This requirement applies whether the\ntermiticide used for retreatment is chemically different than the termiticide\npreviously used. When there has been a disruption of the termiticide barrier\ndue to construction, excavation, or landscaping, retreatment is restricted to\napplication of the termiticide to the disrupted area only.
