  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 481.4 - Gross weight method, tax on laden vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 503, subd. 1\n(a) Under the gross weight method the tax on\na laden vehicular unit is computed by determining the rate of tax from the\ntable set forth in section\n481.3\nabove based on maximum gross weight and by multiplying the total mileage\noperated within the State by such rate. (b) The rate of tax for a truck is determined\nby its maximum gross weight as set forth in its permit. Example: If the unloaded weight of a truck is 5,000 pounds, and\nthe maximum load to be carried by it is 20,000 pounds, its maximum gross weight\nis 25,000 pounds and the applicable tax rate is $.009. If it travels 100 miles\nthe tax is computed as follows: 100 × $.009 = $.90\n(c) The rate of tax for a tractor-trailer\ncombination is based on the unloaded weight of the tractor plus the maximum\ngross weight of the trailer as set forth in its permit. Example: If the unloaded weight of a tractor is 12,000 pounds and\nit is operated in combination with a laden trailer having a maximum gross\nweight of 48,000 pounds, the tax is based on 60,000 pounds and the applicable\ntax rate is $.022. If it travels 100 miles the tax is computed as\nfollows: 100 × $.022 = $2.20\n(d) The rate of tax on a laden motor vehicle\nis always based on its maximum gross weight, irrespective of the actual weight\nof the load it may be carrying at any particular time. Accordingly, a decrease\nin the weight of the load, for example by deliveries along its route, has no\neffect on the applicable rate of tax. Example: If a laden tractor-trailer combination has a maximum\ngross weight of 45,000 pounds, the applicable tax rate is $.015. If it travels\n100 miles within the State actually carrying only 10,000 pounds, the tax is\ncomputed as follows: 100 × $.015 = $1.50\n(e) Although the tax is based on maximum\ngross weight as set forth in the permit, nevertheless if the actual weight of\nthe loaded motor vehicle is in excess of that set forth in the permit, the tax\nmust be computed at the rate applicable to the actual weight. In such case an\namended permit must be obtained. (See §\n473.6, supra. )\n(f) As\npointed out in section\n473.6, supra, if a special permit is obtained pursuant to section\n385\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law from the\n\nState Department of Transportation or from any authority having jurisdiction\nover a particular highway which authorizes the operation of the motor vehicle\nwith a maximum gross weight in excess of that set forth in the highway use\npermit issued therefor, an amended highway use permit must be obtained. In such\ncase the tax rate is thereafter based on the higher maximum gross weight for\nwhich the Department of Transportation special permit was obtained. Example: If the unloaded weight of a tractor is 12,000 pounds and\nis operated in combination with a trailer having a maximum gross weight of\n48,000 pounds, and a special permit is obtained from the Department of\n\nTransportation authorizing said vehicular unit to operate with a maximum gross\nweight of 100,000 pounds, the maximum gross weight of such unit is 100,000\npounds and the applicable tax rate is $.059. If it travels 100 miles the tax is\ncomputed as follows: 100 × $.059 = $5.90\n\nThe maximum gross weight of the trailer is thereby\nincreased by 40,000 pounds to 88,000 pounds for future\noperations. (g) Where an\namended permit is issued on the basis of decreased maximum load to be carried, the maximum gross weight set forth in the amended permit is not effective for\ntax purposes until the superseded permit is surrendered to the State Tax\n\nCommission. (See §\n473.5, supra. )\n\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n481.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
