Tit. 9 § 1.41 - Executive order no. 41: relating to the training and development of state employees\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, State and local governments are confronted with a\ncontinuing requirement for qualified personnel to cope with vastly broadened\noperations and increasingly complex problems; WHEREAS, to meet the challenge thus presented, every effort\nmust be made to promote employees' self-development, help employees to utilize\ntheir talents and abilities, improve employee performance in present\nassignments and prepare employees to assume greater responsibilities; WHEREAS, the establishment and implementation of employee\ndevelopment programs will help meet immediate personnel shortages in government\nand will serve the broader social purpose of enhancing open and equitable\nopportunities for employment for a significant segment of the State's citizens; and\nWHEREAS, employee organizations have the right to\nparticipate in the development of these programs as appropriate and consistant\nwith their role as certified representatives of State employees and in accord\nwith the agreements embodied in contracts between the State and employee\norganizations. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Nelson A. Rockefeller, by virtue of the\nauthority vested in me by the Constitution and the Laws of the State of New\n\nYork, by Executive Order, do hereby declare as follows: 1. The State's training and development\nefforts shall be designated to: a. Alleviate\nmanpower shortages at all levels and reduce personnel turnover. b.

Prepare employees to deal more rapidly and\neffectively with the growing social, scientific and economic problems faced by\ngovernment. d. In accordance with\nmerit system principles and the agreements between the State and its employees, accelerate the development of culturally disadvantaged employees whose\nabilities and aptitudes are presently under-utilized because of inadequate\neducation and training, including establishment of pre-service training\nprograms, where feasible, to develop the skills required to compete for State\nemployment. e. Help employees\ndevelop their skills, knowledge and abilities so that they might become better\nqualified to perform the duties of their present jobs and advance to more\nresponsible positions. f. Provide\nfor the development of top administrators capable of managing complex and\nfar-ranging programs. 2. Providing adequate training and development opportunities for New York State\nand local government employees is a large task which can only be accomplished\nthrough the combined efforts of all existing training and educational\nfacilities. Supervisors on the job, government agencies, central training\nagencies and all educational institutions must be mobilized to meet the\nmanpower needs of government. To this end the State, under the leadership of\nthe Department of Civil Service and with appropriate participation of the joint\ncommittees established by the terms of the agreements between the State and the\ncertified representatives of its employees, shall: a. Identify and define these needs. b. Budget for and encourage the establishment\nof appropriate training programs. c. Aid employees to participate in these\nprograms. d. Promote the use of the\nmost advanced and effective techniques and media for training, including\nstatewide programs and cooperative efforts on an interagency basis. e.

State employees at all levels ultimately\nretain an obligation for their own development and education and it is expected\nthat employees will advance their own careers through appropriate\nself-education and self-improvement. b. Individual managers and supervisors have\nthe initial responsibility for the training and development of their\nsubordinates. In fulfilling this responsibility, managers and other supervisory\npersonnel should take an interest in individual training needs of their\nemployees, and working with employees and their representatives, should prepare\nplans for their development. Such plans should make use of on-the-job training\n(including rotational assignments to provide a wider range of experience), individual and group instruction by supervisors and formal training and\neducational activities. c. Each\ndepartment and agency has a responsibility for training and developing its\nemployees. It is responsible for assuring that training programs geared to\nspecific agency needs are planned, budgeted, and established and that their\nemployees participate in these programs. In addition to these steps involved in\ndeveloping and administering such programs, each department shall work closely\nwith other agencies, employees and their duly authorized representatives, and\nthe Department of Civil Service to promote the use of interagency training\nprograms wherever possible. 4. The Department of Civil Service shall be\nresponsible for the State's role in overall planning, coordination and review\nof training programs and appropriate interagency training. The long-range\nobjectives of the Department's training responsibility shall be to assist\nagencies to build and foster an effective and self-operating comprehensive\nemployee training program. In carrying out this responsibility the Department\nshall: a. Collect and provide detailed\ninformation concerning the State's training needs. b. Advise agencies on the most effective\nmethods and techniques for providing training. c. Assist agencies in designing specific\ntraining programs. d. Evaluate\nagency training programs, including agency-contracted programs, and with the\nadvice and assistance of the Interdepartmental Management Improvement Council\nmake recommendations to the Governor for improvements. e.

The Department of Civil Service shall also require that\neach agency prepare comprehensive training plans which include guidelines and\nprograms for providing training opportunities for all categories of agency\nemployees. These plans, when combined with such periodic reports on training\naccomplishments as the Department requires, shall form the basis for agency\ntraining budgets. 5. The Executive Budget, through appropriate\nsupport, shall reflect the fact that training is a basic responsibility of each\nagency vital to the accomplishment of the agency's programs, is of equal\nstature with other staff functions, and may significantly affect the economical\nand effective fulfillment of an agency's program responsibilities. 6. The State University of New York has\nexpressed a strong interest in participating in this effort by making available\nits faculties and facilities in cooperative programs of employee education and\ndevelopment. Departments and agencies shall cooperate with the State University\nin such programs, which will focus on: a. Education for professional personnel in their fields and management training\nfor professional and administrative personnel. b.
