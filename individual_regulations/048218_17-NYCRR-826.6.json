(1)\n\nRates, charges, rules and regulations, and classifications which have been filed with the commissioner must be allowed\nto become effective and remain in effect for a period of at least 30 days\nbefore being changed, canceled or withdrawn, and any change therein must be\nreceived for filing at least 30 days before its proposed effective date, unless\notherwise authorized by the commissioner. (2)\n\nChanges in tariffs may be made by filing\na complete new superseding tariff, or by filing a supplement or a revised page\nto the tariff to be changed, subject to the restrictions imposed in this\nsection. (3)\n\nExcept as otherwise\nprovided in these rules, a supplement may not be issued to single-sheet tariffs\nor loose-leaf tariffs. Not more than one supplement may be in effect at any one\ntime to a tariff containing 3 and not more 16 pages; not more than two\nsupplements may be in effect at any one time to a tariff containing 17 and not\nmore than 80 pages; not more than three supplements may be in effect at any one\ntime to a tariff containing 81 and not more than 200 pages; and not more than\nfour supplements may be in effect at any one time to a tariff containing more\nthan 200 pages. (4)\n\nEach\npublication proposing any change in rates, fares, charges, rules and\nregulations, shall be accompanied by a statement in writing which shall\ninclude: (i) a description of the proposed\nchanges; (ii)\nthe reasons for the\nproposed changes; (iii)\nthe data\n(financial, cost, statistical and otherwise) in support of the reasonableness\nand lawfulness of the proposed changes; (iv)\nthe anticipated effect of the proposed\nchanges on the user of the service; (v) the anticipated effect of the proposed\nchanges on the carrier's annual revenues subject to this commissioner's\njurisdiction; (vi)\na certification\nof notice that all subscribers and tariff recipients have been provided with a\ncopy of the publication containing the matter to be changed, including a\nlisting of the names and addresses of such subscribers and recipients; and\n(vii)\nany other pertinent\nmaterial in support of the proposed changes. (5)\n\nTwo copies of the written statement\nrequired in paragraph (4) of this subdivision shall be received no later than\n30 days prior to the effective date of the proposed changes. Failure to do so\nmay result in a rejection of the filing or a request for a postponement of the\neffective date for a period of 30 days from the receipt of such written\nstatement. (b) Symbols, reissued matter. (1)\n\nAll tariffs, supplements\nand revised pages shall indicate changes from preceding issues by use of the\nfollowing symbols, which shall not be used for any purpose other than those\nstated: R or R to denote reductions\nA or A to denote increases\n<\n> or C to denote changes, the\nresult of which is neither an increase nor a reduction. (2)\n\nThe proper symbol must be used directly\nin connection with each change. (3)\n\nMatter brought forward without change from one supplement to another supplement\nmust be designated as \"Reissued\", and must show the effective date and the\nnumber of the supplement from which it is reissued. Example: Assuming Supplement No. 3 cancels Supplements\n\nNos. 1 and 2: Reissued from Supplement No. 1, effective ________19\n________\n[Here show unchanged matter brought forward from\n\nSupplement No. 1]\nReissued from Supplement No. 2, effective ________19\n________\n[Here show unchanged matter brought forward from\n\nSupplement No. 2]\n(4)\n\nIf it\nis more convenient, an appropriate reference mark may be shown against the\nreissued rate or item. Such reference mark may be explained elsewhere in the\nsupplement. (c) Cancellation of tariff. A tariff may be canceled by a superseding tariff, or by\na supplement to the tariff to be canceled, provided that such supplement shows\nwhere the rates canceled will thereafter be found or what rates will thereafter\napply, or, if there are to be no rates in effect, the reason for such\ncancellation. (d) Rejections. When\na tariff, supplement or revised page is rejected, the number which it bears may\nnot be used again as the designation of any new filing. Any publication that is\nissued in lieu of the rejected publication must bear a notation that it is so\nissued. Example: DOT-NY-M.T. No. 8\n\nCancels\nDOT-NY-M.T. No. 3\n(in lieu of DOT-NY-M.T. No. 7, rejected by\n\nCommissioner)\n(e) (1)\n\nAn agent authorized to file freight\nclassification issues may publish and file supplements to or reissues of such\nclassification in the form approved by the Interstate Commerce Commission and\neffective as to New York intrastate traffic on the same date and upon the same\nnotice to the public and this commissioner as authorized or required by the\n\nInterstate Commerce Commission for interstate traffic, provided that, whenever\nsuch agent shall apply to the Interstate Commerce Commission for an order\ngranting permission to file on less that 30 days' notice a supplement to or\nreissue of such classification, he shall at the time such application is made\nfurnish this commissioner with a complete copy thereof; and in case this\ncommissioner takes exception thereto and so advises the agent, he shall not, as\nto New York intrastate traffic, establish the proposed change on less than full\nstatutory notice. (2)\n\nChanges\neffected by publications issued under this section must not be regarded as\nhaving been anywise approved by this commissioner, and the provisions of this\nsection shall not affect any subsequent proceeding relative to any such\nchange. (3)\n\nAll publications issued\nunder this subdivision shall bear a notation thereon showing short-notice\nauthority as section\n826.6\n(e), Department of Transportation, State of New York, Circular No. 106.
