  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 362-1.4 - Permit application requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA combustion or other thermal treatment facility that is\nnot an exempt facility or subject to the registration provisions of section\n362-1.3\nof this Subpart must obtain\na permit and must submit an application that includes the requirements\nidentified in section\n360.16\nof this Title, a description\nof how the facility will comply with the operating requirements in Part 360 of\nthis Title, sections\n362-1.5\nand\n362-1.6\nof this Subpart, and the\nfollowing: (a) An engineering report\nthat includes the total electric power to be consumed and generated at the\nfacility in kilowatt-hours. (1)\na summary of\nutility requirements, including estimates of: (i) the type, quantity, and method of storage\nof fuels or other process materials stored on-site; (ii)\nthe pressure, temperature, and pounds\nper hour of all steam to be generated and used at the facility; (iii)\nthe total electric power to be consumed\nand generated at the facility in kilowatt-hours; and\n(iv)\nthe total water to be used for cooling, quench, sanitary and processing needs, including the amount which is, or can\nbe, recycled or treated. (b) A waste control plan that must include, in addition to the requirements of section\n360.16\n(c)(4)(i)\nof\nthis Title, the following: (1)\na program for\ndetecting and preventing the receipt of hazardous wastes at the facility. This\nprogram must include, but not be limited to: (i) random inspections of incoming\nloads; (ii)\ninspections of\nsuspicious loads; (iii)\nrecords of\ninspections; (iv)\nprocedures for\nnotifying the proper authorities if a regulated hazardous waste is discovered\nin a load; and\n(v) procedures for\nproper management of discovered regulated hazardous waste; and\n(2)\nidentification of each\nreceiving facility to be used for the disposal of bypass waste. (c) A residue management plan that\nincludes: (1)\na description of the\ngeneration, handling, storage, transportation, treatment, and disposal or use\nof residue as described in section\n362-1.5\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart; (2)\na description of the\nmethods, equipment, and structures necessary to prevent the uncontrolled\ndispersion of residue, considering potential pathways of human or environmental\nexposure including, but not limited to, inhalation, direct contact, and\npotential for groundwater and surface water contamination; (3)\nan estimate of the quantity of residues\nincluding, but not limited to, bottom ash, fly ash, and slag, generated from\nthe facility on a daily basis. This estimate must identify and quantify the\npotential of each residue stream to be segregated for beneficial use in\naccordance with section\n360.12\nof this Title. Market\narrangements for beneficial use of residues must also be included, if\nany; (4)\na residue sampling and\nanalysis plan. This plan must identify both the sample collection protocol that\nwill be used to obtain a representative sample of the residue and the\nanalytical protocols to be used. The sampling and analysis plan must include\nprocedures and techniques for: (i) sample\ncollection; (ii)\nsample\npreservation and shipment; (iii)\ndetermining if the residue exhibits a toxic characteristic for arsenic, barium, cadmium, chromium, lead, mercury, selenium, and silver upon exposure to acid\nliquids; (iv)\nanalysis of the total\ncontent of arsenic, barium, beryllium, cadmium, chromium (total and\nhexavalent), copper, lead, mercury, nickel, silver, zinc, calcium, iron, aluminum, chloride, sulfate, and any other parameters determined by the\ndepartment to be necessary; (v) chain of custody control; and\n(vi)\nassuring consistency and quality in laboratory procedures and\nresults. (d) A radioactive waste detection plan. The plan must include procedures for detecting\nradioactive material; operation and maintenance plans for radiation detectors\nincluding investigation alarm setpoint settings and calibration methods; and\nresponse procedures to be implemented when radioactive waste is detected as\nrequired by section\n362-1.5\n(b)(7)\nof\nthis Subpart.
