(1)\n\nThe official station of every\nemployee shall be designated by the head of the agency. Such designation shall\nbe in the best interests of the State and not for the convenience of an\nemployee or to maximize travel expense reimbursement. Every designation of the\nofficial station of an employee shall be subject to review by the Comptroller. If any designation of an official station is found to be inconsistent with the\nprovisions of this Part, a request for travel expense reimbursement based upon\nsuch an inconsistent designation may be disapproved by the\n\nComptroller. (2)\n\nNo transportation\ncosts will be allowed between any employee's place of residence and his or her\nofficial station. The place of residence is considered to be the city or town\nin which the employee primarily resides. Agency management retains discretion\nin allowing transportation costs to locations within the proximity of the\nofficial station. (b) Subsistence charges. The expense of meals or lodging within the immediate\nvicinity of the official station will not normally be reimbursed unless it is\nin the best interest of the State as determined by the head of the agency's\nfinance office and subject to audit by the Comptroller.
