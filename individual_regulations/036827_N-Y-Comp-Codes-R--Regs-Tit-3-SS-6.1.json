  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 6.1 - Insurance charges by licensed lenders\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A company licensed to make small loans\nunder article 9 of the Banking Law inquired whether, in connection with a\nsingle loan having more than one obligor, the lender could require several\nobligors to be insured and bear the cost of such insurance, so long as a single\namount was charged for the joint or multiple risk rather than a charge which is\nthe sum of the premiums for each individual risk. (b) Section\n357-a\nof the\n\nBanking Law states that when a licensed lender provides credit life or credit\naccident and health insurance, or both, with respect to one or more borrowers, the licensee may collect from the borrower otherwise legal premiums or charges, and further states that \"(o)nly one such amount may be collected in connection\nwith any loan contract irrespective of the number of obligors and only one\nobligor need be insured.\"\n(c) The\ndepartment in response adhered to its long-standing interpretation of the\nstatute as permitting the imposition of insurance charges only in the amount\nnecessary to cover one obligor. The department recognized that several obligors\ncan be insured more economically on a joint rather than a several basis. However, in the department's view it has not been demonstrated that insurance\nof more than one obligor is necessary to protect the licensee's investment or\nthat it adds significantly to the protection afforded by insuring one obligor. Furthermore, there is nothing in the legislative history of section 357-a which\nwould indicate legislative sanction for insurance of more than one\nobligor. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n6.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
