  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.621 - Maximum allowable operating pressure: high-pressure distribution systems\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person\nmay operate a segment of a high-pressure distribution system at a pressure that\nexceeds the lowest of the following pressures, as applicable: (1)\nthe design pressure of the weakest\nelement in the segment, determined in accordance with this Part; (2)\n60 psig (414 kPa), for a segment of a\ndistribution system otherwise designated to operate at over 60 psig (414 kPa), unless the service lines in the segment are equipped with service regulators or\nother pressure limiting devices in series that meet the requirements of section\n255.197\n(c) of\nthis Part. (3)\n25 psig (172 kPa) in\nsegments of cast iron pipe in which there are unreinforced bell and spigot\njoints; (4)\nthe pressure limits to\nwhich a joint could be subjected without the possibility of its parting; or\n(5)\nthe pressure determined by\nthe operator to be the maximum safe pressure after considering the history of\nthe segment, particularly known corrosion and the actual operating\npressures. (b) No person\nmay operate a segment of pipeline to which paragraph (a)(5) of this section\napplies, unless overpressure protective devices are installed on the segment in\na manner that will prevent the maximum allowable operating pressure from being\nexceeded, in accordance with section\n255.195\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.621\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
