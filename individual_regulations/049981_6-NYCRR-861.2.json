  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 861.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I of this Part an item number is assigned to\neach specifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I of this Part shall mean that number or abbreviation which\nhas been assigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for\nthe purpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe\nnumbering or index system used to identify specific waters of New York State\nwas adapted from that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary\nwaters of a drainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred\nto by name or an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively\nnumbered progressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered\nconsecutively as they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the\nletter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as\nthey enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or\nmouth. When isolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely for convenience of their identification and location within a\nsubdrainage basin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being\ntributary to any waters to which no surface connection is shown on the\nreference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was\napplied to the basin under consideration by the Conservation Department in its\nbiological survey of the Lower Esopus Creek watershed and has been closely\nfollowed in connection with the identification of the waters with the following\nexceptions: some of the stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the\nomission of streams originally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation\n\nDepartment at the time of its survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced\nherein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on\nthe newer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lower Esopus Creek drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH-171 portion as described\n\nEsopus Creek\n171st trib. to enter Hudson River from southwest at\n\nSaugerties (Map M-23se). H-171-17 portion as described\n\nSaw Kill\n17th trib. of Esopus Creek, which enters from\nsouthwest 1.2 miles southwest of Lake Katrine (Map N-23ne). H-171-17-23\n\nTrib. of Saw Kill\n\nTrib. 23 of Saw Kill enters from southeast, 1.7\nmiles northeast of Shady (Map M-23sw). H-171-17-23-P 840\n\nMead's Lake\n\nSource of Trib. 23, located approx. 1.9 miles east\nof Shady (Map M-23se). (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib., and\nsubtribs, indicating\ntributary, tributaries, subtributary, and\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water which flows into any other stream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries\nare mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include only the\nstream, lake, pond, or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the\nwaters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I of this Part shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically\ndesignated waters are generally known and which may appear on the reference\nmaps. In cases of specifically designated waters which have no name, the named\ntributary to which the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I of this Part shall mean a\nbrief indication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries may include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map ref. no. as appearing in the table I of this Part means map reference\nnumber and indicates one or more of the following numbered maps reproduced\nherein completely, or in part, on which the specifically designated waters and\ntheir index numbers are shown. It is to be noted that map 2 of this Part, with\nsuperimposed tracing in black of streams and other waters and waters index\nnumbers, has been made by using parts of the U.S.G.S. topographical sheets\nlisted below and combining them into one map. The following maps were produced\nfrom original maps which may be procured through the Washington Distribution\n\nSection, Geological Survey. Map Ref.

(h) Standards\nas appearing\nin table I of this Part, and denoted by the letters A, B, C, or D opposite each\nspecifically designated waters shall mean the standards of quality and purity\nestablished for class A, B, C, or D as the case may be, as set forth in Part\n701, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard\ndesignation shall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the\ndissolved oxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol\n(TS) after any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: Coregonus, Oncorhynchus, Prosopium, Salmo, Salvelinus\nand\n\nThymallus. (j) The Lower Esopus Creek drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following\nareas: all land and water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which\nis directly or indirectly tributary to the Esopus Creek between its confluence\nwith the Hudson River and the Ashokan Reservoir Dam, and the surface waters of\nthe Mink Hollow Brook and all its tributaries above the point where it is\ndiverted from its natural course to Cooper Lake forming part of the water\nsupply of the City of Kingston. (k) All streams or other bodies of water which appear as lines to indicate natural\nwaters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated\nin table I of this Part, shall be assigned the same classes and standards of\nquality and purity as the specifically designated waters to which they are\ndirectly tributary. (l) All streams\nor other bodies of water which are not shown on the reference maps herein shall\nbe assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous flowing natural stream which is not shown on the\nreference maps shall have the same classification and assigned standards as the\nwaters to which it is directly tributary.
