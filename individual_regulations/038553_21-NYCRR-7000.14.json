Tit. 21 § 7000.14 - Client financial eligibility for services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A person eligible to receive legal\nservices from funds allocated pursuant to this Part must have an income that\ndoes not exceed 125 percent of the official poverty threshold as defined by the\n\nUnited States Office of Management and Budget, except in the following\ncircumstances: (1)\nthe person is seeking\nlegal assistance to secure benefits provided by a governmental program for the\npoor; (2)\nthe person would be\neligible but for the receipt of benefits provided by a governmental income\nmaintenance program; or\n(3)\nthe\nperson's circumstances require that eligibility should be allowed on the basis\nof one or more of the factors set forth in subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (b) In addition\nto income, a recipient shall consider other relevant factors in determining\nwhether a person is eligible to receive legal assistance. Factors to be\nconsidered shall include: (1)\ncurrent income, taking into account seasonal variations in income; (2)\nliquid assets; (3)\nfixed debts and obligations, including\n\nFederal and local taxes and medical expenses; (4)\nchild care, transportation, mandatory\npayroll deductions and other expenses necessary for employment; (5)\nage or physical infirmity of resident\nfamily members; (6)\nthe cost of\nobtaining private legal representation with respect to the particular matter in\nwhich assistance is sought; (7)\nthe\nconsequences for the individual if legal assistance is denied; and\n(8)\nany other factors related to financial\ninability to afford legal assistance. (c) A recipient may provide legal assistance\nto a group, corporation, or association if it: (1)\nis primarily composed of persons eligible\nfor legal assistance under these regulations; or\n(2)\nhas as its primary purpose the\nfurtherance of the interests of persons in the community who are unable to\nafford legal assistance; and\n(3)\nprovides information showing that it lacks, and has no practical means of\nobtaining, funds to retain private counsel. (d) A recipient shall adopt a simple form and\nprocedure to obtain information to determine eligibility in a manner that\npromotes the development of trust between attorney and client. If there is\nsubstantial reason to doubt the accuracy of the information, a recipient shall\nmake appropriate inquiry to verify it in a manner consistent with the\nattorney-client relationship. Information furnished to a recipient by a client\nto establish financial eligibility shall not be disclosed to any person who is\nnot employed by the recipient in a manner that permits identification of the\nclient without the express written consent of the client. (e) If an eligible client becomes ineligible\ndue to a change in circumstances, a recipient shall discontinue representation\nif the change in circumstances is sufficiently likely to continue for a period\nwhich will enable the client to retain private legal assistance, and\ndiscontinuation is not inconsistent with the attorney's professional\nresponsibility.
