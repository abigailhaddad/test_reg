  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.361 - Service lines: installation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each\nburied service line shall be installed with at least 18 inches (457\nmillimeters) of cover. However, where an underground structure prevents\ninstallation at those depths, the service line must be able to withstand any\nanticipated external load and suitable protection must be provided. Also, if\nservice inserts of existing service lines are installed this requirement is not\napplicable. (b) Each service line\nmust be properly supported on undisturbed or well- compacted soil, and material\nused for backfill must be free of materials that could damage the pipe or its\ncoating. (c) Where condensate in\nthe gas might cause interruption in the gas supply to the customer, the service\nline must be graded so as to drain into the main or into drips at the low\npoints in the service line. (d) Each service line must be installed so as to minimize anticipated piping strain\nand external loading. (e) Each\nunderground service line installed below grade through the outer foundation\nwall of a building must: (1)\nbe encased in a\nrigid sleeve with suitable protection from shearing action or backfill\nsettlement; (2)\nin the case of a\nmetal service line, be protected against corrosion; and\n(3)\nbe sealed at the foundation wall to\nprevent leakage into the building. (f) When an underground service line is\ninstalled under a building, the following requirements apply: (1)\n\nIt must be encased in a gas-tight\nconduit. (2)\n\nThe conduit and the\nservice line must, if the service line supplies the building it underlies, extend into a normally usable and accessible part of the building. (3)\n\nThe space between the conduit and the\nservice line must be sealed to prevent gas leakage into the building and, if\nthe conduit is sealed at both ends, a vent line from the annular space must\nextend to a point where gas would not be a hazard, and extend above grade, terminating in a rain and insect resistant fitting. (g) All service lines shall be constructed\nwith a clearance of not less than four inches (102 millimeters), whenever\npractical, from any subsurface structures not directly associated with the\npipeline. If it is not practicable to achieve this clearance, a minimum\nclearance of two inches (51 millimeters) shall be maintained and the pipeline\nshall be protected from damage that might result from the proximity of the\nother structure. (h) When steel or\nplastic pipe is to be installed as a service line in a bore, care shall be\nexercised to prevent damage to the coating or pipe during\ninstallation. (i) Locating\nunderground service lines. Each underground nonmetallic service line that is\nnot encased must have a means of locating the pipe that complies with section\n255.321\n(e) of\nthis Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.361\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
