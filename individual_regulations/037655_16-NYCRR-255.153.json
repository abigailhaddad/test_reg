  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.153 - Components fabricated by welding\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for branch connections and\nassemblies of standard pipe and fittings joined by circumferential welds, the\ndesign pressure of each component fabricated by welding, whose strength cannot\nbe determined, must be established in accordance with paragraph UG-101 of\nsection VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Division I (as\ndescribed in section\n10.3\nof this Title). (b) Each prefabricated unit that uses plate\nand longitudinal seams must be designed, constructed, and tested in accordance\nwith the ASME BPVC (rules for Construction of Pressure Vessels as defined in\neither Section VIII, Division 1 or Section VIII, Division 2) (as described in\n\nSection\n10.3\nof this Title), except for: (1)\nmanufactured butt-welded\nfittings; (2)\npipe that has been\nproduced and tested under a specification listed in Appendix 14-B of this\n\nTitle; (3)\npartial assemblies such\nas split rings or collars; or\n(4)\nprefabricated units that the manufacturer certifies have been tested to at\nleast twice the maximum pressure to which they will be subjected under the\nanticipated operating conditions. (c) Orange-peel bull plugs and orange-peel\nswages may not be used on pipelines that are to operate at a pressure of 125\npsig (862 kPa) or more. (d) Except\nfor flat closures designed in accordance with section VIII of the ASME Boiler\nand Pressure Vessel Code (as described in section\n10.3\nof this Title), flat closures\nand fish tails may not be used on pipe that either operates at 100 psig (689\nkPa) or more, or is more than 3 inches (76 millimeters) nominal\ndiameter. (e) The test requirements\nfor a prefabricated unit or pressure vessel, defined for this subdivision as\ncomponents with a design pressure established in accordance with subdivision\n(a) or (b) of this section are as follows. (1)\nA prefabricated unit or pressure vessel installed after July 14, 2004, is not\nsubject to the strength testing requirements at subdivision\n255.505\n(b) of\nthis Part provided the component has been tested in accordance with subdivision\n(a) or subdivision (b) of this section and with a test factor of at least 1.5\ntimes maximum allowable operating pressure (MAOP). (2)\nA prefabricated unit or pressure vessel\nmust be tested for a duration specified as follows: (i) A prefabricated unit or pressure vessel\ninstalled after July 14, 2004, but before October 1, 2021, is exempt from\nsubdivisions\n255.505\n(c) and\n(d) and\n255.507\n(c) of\nthis Part provided it has been tested for a duration consistent with the ASME\nBPVC requirements referenced in subdivision (a) or (b) of this\nsection. (ii)\nA prefabricated unit\nor pressure vessel installed on or after October 1, 2021, must be tested for\nthe duration specified in either subdivisions\n255.505\n(c) or\n(d), 255.507\n(c), or\n255.509(a) of this Part, whichever is applicable for the pipeline in which the\ncomponent is being installed. (3)\n\nFor any prefabricated unit or pressure\nvessel permanently or temporarily installed on a pipeline facility, an operator\nmust either: (i) Test the prefabricated unit\nor pressure vessel in accordance with this section and sections\n255.501\nthrough\n255.517\nof this Part after it has\nbeen placed on its support structure at its final installation location. The\ntest may be performed before or after it has been tied-in to the pipeline. Test\nrecords that meet subdivision\n255.517\n(a) of\nthis Part must be kept for the operational life of the prefabricated unit or\npressure vessel; or\n(ii)\n\nFor a\nprefabricated unit or pressure vessel that is pressure tested prior to\ninstallation or where a manufacturer's pressure test is used in accordance with\nsubdivision (e) of this section, inspect the prefabricated unit or pressure\nvessel after it has been placed on its support structure at its final\ninstallation location and confirm that the prefabricated unit or pressure\nvessel was not damaged during any prior operation, transportation, or\ninstallation into the pipeline. The inspection procedure and documented\ninspection must include visual inspection for vessel damage, including, at a\nminimum, inlets, outlets, and lifting locations. Injurious defects that are an\nintegrity threat may include dents, gouges, bending, corrosion, and cracking. This inspection must be performed prior to operation but may be performed\neither before or after it has been tied-in to the pipeline. If injurious\ndefects that are an integrity threat are found, the prefabricated unit or\npressure vessel must be either non-destructively tested, repressure tested, or\nremediated in accordance with applicable Part 255 requirements for a fabricated\nunit or with the applicable ASME BPVC requirements referenced in subdivisions\n(a) or (b) of this section. Test, inspection, and repair records for the\nfabricated unit or pressure vessel must be kept for the operational life of the\ncomponent. Test records must meet the requirements in subdivision\n255.517\n(a) of\nthis Part. (4)\n\nAn initial\npressure test from the prefabricated unit or pressure vessel manufacturer may\nbe used to meet the requirements of this section with the following conditions: (i) The prefabricated unit or pressure vessel\nis newly-manufactured and installed on or after October 1, 2021, except as\nprovided in subparagraph (e)(4)(ii) of this section. (ii)\n\nAn initial pressure test from the\nfabricated unit or pressure vessel manufacturer or other prior test of a new or\nexisting prefabricated unit or pressure vessel may be used for a component that\nis temporarily installed in a pipeline facility in order to complete a testing, integrity assessment, repair, odorization, or emergency response-related task, including noise or pollution abatement. The temporary component must be\npromptly removed after that task is completed. If operational and environmental\nconstraints require leaving a temporary prefabricated unit or pressure vessel\nunder this paragraph in place for longer than 30 days, the operator must notify\nPHMSA and State or local pipeline safety authorities, as applicable, in\naccordance with section\n255.18\nof this Part. (iii)\n\nThe manufacturer's pressure test must\nmeet the minimum requirements of this part; and\n(iv)\n\nThe operator inspects and remediates the\nprefabricated unit or pressure vessel after installation in accordance with\nsubparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section. (5)\n\nAn existing prefabricated unit or\npressure vessel that is temporarily removed from a pipeline facility to\ncomplete a testing, integrity assessment, repair, odorization, or emergency\nresponse-related task, including noise or pollution abatement, and then\nreinstalled at the same location must be inspected in accordance with\nsubparagraph (e)(3)(ii) of this section; however, a new pressure test is not\nrequired provided no damage or threats to the operational integrity of the\nprefabricated unit or pressure vessel were identified during the inspection and\nthe MAOP of the pipeline is not increased. (6)\n\nExcept as provided in subparagraph\n(e)(4)(ii) and paragraph (e)(5) of this section, on or after October 1, 2021, an existing prefabricated unit or pressure vessel relocated and operated at a\ndifferent location must meet the requirements of this part and the following: (i) The prefabricated unit or pressure vessel\nmust be designed and constructed in accordance with the requirements of this\npart at the time the vessel is returned to operational service at the new\nlocation; and\n(ii)\n\nThe prefabricated\nunit or pressure vessel must be pressure tested by the operator in accordance\nwith the testing and inspection requirements of this part applicable to newly\ninstalled prefabricated units and pressure\nvessels.
