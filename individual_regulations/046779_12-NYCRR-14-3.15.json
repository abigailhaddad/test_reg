  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.15 - Postweld heat treatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. In repairing carbon or low alloy steels, postweld heat treatment shall\nbe required if it would be required for new construction by the ASME Code. Under certain conditions, postweld heat treatment as outlined in this\nsubdivision may be inadvisable or impractical. In these instances, any other\nmethod of postweld heat treatment or special welding method acceptable to the\ninspector may be used. (b) Peening. In lieu of postweld heat treatment of carbon steels, peening or other methods\nacceptable to the inspector may be used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-3.15\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
