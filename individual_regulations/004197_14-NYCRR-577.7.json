  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 577.7 - Rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Payment rates\nshall be established on a prospective basis effective January 1, 1992 and each\n\nJanuary 1st thereafter, except that the rate of payment effective January 1, 2012 through December 31, 2012, and January 1, 2013 through December 31, 2013, shall be a continuance of the rate of payment effective December 31, 2011, and\nshall be provisional pending the completion of an audit in accordance with\nsection\n577.6\nof this Part. (b) Payment rates are computed on a per diem\nbasis by dividing allowable costs by allowable patient days. Allowable patient\ndays shall not exceed a maximum utilization of 98 percent of certified\ncapacity. The allowable costs and patient days shall include the cost of\npsychiatric inpatient and related ancillary services, and as applicable, the\ncost of alcoholism inpatient and related ancillary services. (c) Allowable costs are determined from\nhospital cost reports, as defined in section\n577.5\nof this Part, subject to the\nfollowing priority of definitions of allowable cost: (1)\nthis Part; (2)\nallowable costs under Federal Medical\n\nAssistance Program; (3)\nallowable\ncost under the Medicare Program; (4)\ngenerally accepted accounting principles; and\n(5)\nas determined by audit in\naccordance with section\n577.6\nof this Part. (d) For any rate year, operating\nand capital costs are determined from the allowable costs in the base year. The\nbase year is the year two years prior to the rate year. (e) Operating costs from the base year are\nsubject to a cost limitation. The limitation is the allowable costs one year\nprior to the base year, increased by inflation for one year. (1)\n\nAllowable operating costs in the rate\nyear are calculated by choosing the lower of the base year cost computed on a\nper diem basis or the limitation cost computed on a per diem basis, and\ntrending this amount forward two years by the inflation factor, except for the\nrate period effective January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, when the inflation\nfactor used to trend costs will be limited to the inflation factor for the\nfirst year of the two-year period, and the rate period effective January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, when there will be no inflation factor used to\ntrend costs. Administration costs, as contained in and part of operating costs, shall be subject to an administrative cost screen. Two separate administrative\ncost screens shall be calculated, one for hospitals with greater than 100 beds\n(group one), and one for hospitals with 100 or less beds (group two). The\nadministrative cost screen is derived from the costs in the fiscal year one\nyear prior to the base year (i.e., the same cost year from which the limitation\nis derived), and shall be the group average per diem cost plus 10\npercent. (2)\n\nThe inflation factor\nis the Medicare inflation factor for hospitals and units excluded from the\nprospective payment system. (f) Capital costs which are the allowed costs\nfrom the base year, as defined in subdivision (d) of this section, are the\ncapital related costs as reported in the hospital financial reports. Interest\nand depreciation costs associated with all asset acquisitions are subject to\napproval under Part 551 of this Title. No capital expenditure for which\napproval by the Office of Mental Health is required under the applicable\nprovisions of the Mental Hygiene Law or Part 551 of this Title shall be\nincluded in allowable capital costs for purposes of computing a rate of payment\nunless such approval shall have been secured. Capital costs are computed on a\nper diem basis. (g) Allowed days\nare the patient days applicable to the costs for psychiatric and, if\napplicable, alcoholism inpatient services, as defined in section\n577.4\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (h) Payment rates for new\nhospitals which have no prior cost experience from which to establish base year\ncosts and a cost limitation, as defined in subdivision (e) of this section, shall be determined as follows: (1)\n\nPayment\nrates shall be for the time period as approved in a financial plan submitted by\nthe hospital and approved by the commissioner under Part 551 of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nAllowed capital costs\nduring the period of the financial plan will be computed based upon the\napproved budgeted capital costs, divided by the approved budgeted patient days\nfor the rate year, and retroactively adjusted to actual certified cost divided\nby the higher of actual patient days or approved budgeted patient days. Capital\ncosts are subject to the provisions of subdivision (f) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nOperating costs during\nthe period of the financial plan will be the lower of the approved budgeted\noperating costs divided by the approved budgeted patient days or 110 percent of\nthe statewide weighted average of the operating cost per diem of all private\npsychiatric hospitals for which the Office of Mental Health promulgates rates\nof payment pursuant to this Part. (4)\n\nThe operating cost component of the rate\nwill be updated annually, except for the period January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2010, and the period January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, with the Medicare\ninflation factor for hospitals and units excluded from the prospective payment\nsystem, until the hospital has operated for six months at a minimum occupancy\nlevel of at least 75 percent and files its first cost report for that same\nperiod in accordance with section\n577.5\nof this Part. (5)\n\nThe actual cost report data will be used\nto establish the rate of payment for that hospital on a retroactive basis to\nthe period covered by the hospital cost report. If the resulting rate of\npayment is higher than the per diem costs approved in the financial plan, the\nhospital will continue on the budget based method described in paragraphs\n(1)-(4) of this subdivision, until such time as the hospital submits subsequent\nfinancial reports and the methodology in subdivision (e) of this section can be\napplied.
