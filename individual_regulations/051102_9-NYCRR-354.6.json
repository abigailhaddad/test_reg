  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 354.6 - Case closing requirements and criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Cases referred to probation intake for\npreliminary probation procedures shall be closed in accordance with the\nbelow-listed criteria: (1)\nA case where the\nadjustment process was not commenced and which was excluded from any\nopportunity for adjustment and referred for petition, shall be closed with the\ndesignation \"referred for petition immediately\". (2)\nA case in which a potential petitioner\nfailed to pursue the complaint or withdrew the complaint, for any reason, either before the commencement of the adjustment process or during such\nprocess, shall be closed with the designation \"terminated matter not pursued\nand not referred for petition\". A case in this category includes, but is not\nlimited to, situations where a potential respondent is either unavailable or\ndeclines to participate in the adjustment process and the potential\npetitioner's determination to withdraw the complaint or not pursue it is based\nupon such availability or declining to participate. (3)\nA case in which the satisfactory\nresolution of the complaint was derived without court intervention shall be\nclosed with the designation \"adjusted\". (4)\nA case in which the resolution of the\ncomplaint did not occur because, after the commencement of the adjustment\nprocess, the potential petitioner filed a petition, or the adjustment process\nwas incomplete or unsuccessful and the potential petitioner was notified that a\npetition may be filed, shall be closed with the designation \"terminated without\nadjustment and referred for petition\". (5)\nA case in which a potential petitioner\nseeking relief in a family offense proceeding wishes to commence a criminal\nproceeding and that person is referred to the proper official for the filing of\nan accusatory instrument shall be closed with the designation \"referred to\ncriminal court\".
