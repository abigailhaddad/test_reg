  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 575.16 - Refunds\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1412, 1420\n(a) A grantor or grantee claiming to have\nerroneously paid the tax imposed by Article 31 of the Tax Law or some other\nperson designated by such grantor or grantee may file an application for refund\nwithin two years from the date of payment. If a taxpayer has consented in\nwriting to the extension of the period for determination of tax due, as\nprovided in section\n575.15\n(c) of this Part, the period for filing an application for a refund will not expire\nprior to six months after the extended period in which a determination of tax\ndue may be made. The application for refund must be filed on a form prescribed\nby the department. (b) The\napplication for refund may be granted or denied in whole or in part. The\ndepartment shall notify the applicant of its determination by mail. The\ndetermination is final and irrevocable unless the applicant, within 90 days\nafter the mailing of the determination, petitions the Division of Tax Appeals\nfor a hearing. After a hearing, the administrative law judge shall mail a\nnotice of the determination to the applicant and to the department. The\ndetermination of the administrative law judge may be reviewed by the Tax\n\nAppeals Tribunal as provided by section 2006.7 of the Tax Law. (See Part 3000\nof this Title.) The applicant may petition for judicial review of the decision\nof the Tax Appeals Tribunal provided that the applicant files an undertaking\nwith the department for such amount and with such sureties as a justice of the\n\nSupreme Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed\nor the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which may\naccrue in the prosecution of the proceeding. (c) A person shall not be entitled to a\nrefund of tax, interest or penalty determined to be due pursuant to section\n1411\nof the Tax Law where the person has\nhad a hearing or an opportunity for a hearing or has failed to take advantage\nof the remedies provided. However, a person filing a signed statement with the\ndepartment consenting to the tax due, before a determination assessing tax is\nissued to that person, may apply for a refund within the time provided in\nsubdivision (a) of this section. Tax, interest or penalty determined to be due\nby the department may be refunded only if the determination is found to be\nerroneous, illegal, unconstitutional or otherwise improper after review by the\n\nTax Appeals Tribunal, on the Commissioner's own motion or in a proceeding under\n\nArticle 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules. (d) Interest amounting to one dollar or more\nshall be allowed upon any refund. Interest at the overpayment rate shall be\npaid from the date when the tax, penalty or interest refunded was paid to a\ndate preceding the date of the refund check by not more than 30 days. For\npurposes of this subdivision, any tax paid before the last day prescribed for\nits payment shall be deemed to have been paid on such last day. For the\noverpayment rate of interest, see Part 2393 of this Title. (e) All claims for refund must be filed with\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance, Transaction and Transfer Tax Bureau, Real Estate Transfer Tax Section, Building 9, W. A.
