  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.1 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, section\n43-0112 directs the Lake George Park\n\nCommission (\"commission\") to develop regulations to guide preparation of local\nstormwater management plans and regulatory programs. The statutory provisions\nstate that municipalities within the Lake George Park shall develop and\nimplement the plans and programs consistent with the regulations and subject to\nthe approval of the commission not later than 18 months from the effective date\nof the regulations. If the commission determines that a municipality has failed\nto develop a plan or program or fails to implement an approved plan or program, then the commission shall assume the authority of the municipality to do so. The regulations are contained in this Subpart and they first became effective\non September 19, 1990. The regulations provide that the commission prepare a\nmodel ordinance as an aid to local government and a means to streamline review\nof local regulatory programs. The Model Ordinance was completed and provided to\neach municipality on December 15, 1990. The commission also prepared and\nestablished additional aids for the municipalities. On April 17, 1992, following expiration of the 18-month statutory timeframe, the commission\nassumed jurisdiction over stormwater in three municipalities which had\ndetermined not to develop a plan or regulatory program. Before the commission\napproved any local regulatory program or stormwater plan in municipalities\nwhich had determined to develop a plan or regulatory program, the regulations\nwere amended. This section was added to put these amendments in context. The\npurpose of the amendments was to reduce procedural and regulatory\ninconsistencies which had been identified during the review of several\npreliminary local stormwater regulatory programs and which had a direct bearing\non decisions affecting municipal programs which had been submitted for\napproval. The timing of the amendments was such that the revisions would be in\nplace prior to review and approval of local regulatory programs and stormwater\nmanagement plans. Thus, no local plan or regulatory program was approved prior\nto the referenced amendments. Accordingly, the amendments include a provision\nwhich affords additional time for municipalities to complete action on local\nprograms and plans. In the interest of ensuring that the water quality\nprotection benefits of improved stormwater management not be unduly delayed, the amendments set a time period of nine months from notice of the effective\ndate of the amendments to this Subpart within which the municipalities must act\nto complete and implement a stormwater management plan and regulatory program. Once the nine-month period has passed and a municipality is not in compliance\nwith the time limit set forth in this Subpart, the regulations provide that the\ncommission shall assume jurisdiction over stormwater in such a\nmunicipality.
