Comp. Codes R. & Regs. tit. 17, ch. VI, subch. E, art. 4, pt. 826\n\nStatutory authority: Transportation Law, §§98, 99, 142, 161, 172\nFOREWORD\nThe commissioner will not prescribe initial (first) rates\nor charges for motor carriers. The Transportation Law leaves such rates or\ncharges to the discretion of the carriers. After the initial rates become\neffective, the commissioner may, upon complaint or upon his own initiative, require changes in rates or charges if he finds them to be unlawful, or\nprescribe new rates or charges, but only after a formal hearing. Carriers and agents already using printed[FN*] tariffs or\nschedules may, if they so desire, apply appropriate DOT-NY-M.T. designations\nand file such publications, including all supplements, with the commissioner as\ntheir initial tariffs or schedules, provided that such publications meet the\ngeneral requirements of this Part. Whenever tariffs or schedules already\nprinted are used for filing, a DOT-NY-M.T. number, a new effective date, and\nnumbers of governing tariffs, if any, must be shown and may be applied with pen\nand ink. If references to New York intrastate powers of attorney or\nconcurrences are necessary to be shown in any such tariff, they may be added by\na supplement which must be filed with the tariff and bear the same effective\ndate. The effective date of each initial filing should be set far enough ahead\nso that the documents can be received by the commissioner at least one day\nbefore such effective date. This ruling applies only to the first tariffs or\nschedules filed with the Department of Transportation, State of New York, and\nexpires with June 30, 1939. Initial tariffs may be presumed to comply with the\nlaw and the commissioner's rules unless and until the parties filing them are\nadvised to the contrary by the commissioner, in which event such parties will\nbe directed to bring the initial tariffs into conformity with the law and the\ncommissioner's rules and will be afforded reasonable opportunity to do so. Failure to comply reasonably with such directions will constitute ground for\nrejecting the initial tariffs. All tariff publications filed after the initial\ntariffs or schedules have been filed must fully comply with the law and this\n\nPart unless departures are specifically authorized by the commissioner. Numerous operators have sent the commissioner copies of\ntheir tariffs that were required to be filed with Interstate Commerce\n\nCommission, and they were returned with an appropriate letter of explanation. Such documents must not be considered as ever having been filed with Department\nof Transportation, State of New York.
