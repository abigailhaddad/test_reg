Tit. 16 § 1001.3 - Exhibit 3: location of facilities\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 3 shall contain: Maps, drawings and explanations showing the location of the\nproposed major electric generating facility, all interconnections, and all\nancillary features not located on the facility site such as roads, railroads, switchyards, fuel or energy storage or regulation facilities, solid waste\ndisposal areas, waste treatment and disposal facilities, and similar\nfacilities, in relation to municipalities (county, city, town and village) and\ntaxing jurisdictions associated with any part of the overall development\nproposal. Such maps, drawings and explanations shall include: (a) New York State Department of\n\nTransportation or USGS maps (1:24,000 topographic edition), showing: (1)\nthe proposed location of the major\nelectric generating facility and any reasonable and available alternative\nlocation sites required to be identified, including electric transmission line\nand fuel gas transmission line interconnections that are not subject to review\nunder article VII of the PSL, and including ancillary features located on the\nfacility site such as roads, railroads, switchyards, fuel or energy storage or\nregulation facilities, solid waste disposal areas, waste treatment and disposal\nfacilities, and similar facilities; (2)\nthe proposed location of any\ninterconnections, including all offsite electric transmission lines, fuel gas\ntransmission lines, fuel oil transmission lines, water supply lines, wastewater\nlines, communications lines, steam lines, stormwater drainage lines, and\nappurtenances thereto, to be installed in New York State connecting to and\nservicing the site of a major electric generating facility that are not subject\nto the commission's jurisdiction under PSL article VII; (3)\nthe location of all proposed ancillary\nfeatures not located on the facility site such as roads, railroads, switchyards, fuel or energy storage or regulation facilities, solid waste\ndisposal areas, waste treatment and disposal facilities, and similar\nfacilities, that are not subject to the board's jurisdiction under PSL article\n10; (4)\nthe proposed location of\nany electric transmission line and fuel gas transmission line interconnections\nthat are subject to review under article VII of the PSL and that are not\nsubject to the board's jurisdiction under PSL article 10; and\n(5)\nA study area for the proposed facility\ngenerally related to the nature of the technology and the setting of the\nproposed site. In highly urbanized areas, the study area may be limited to a\none-mile radius from the property boundaries of the facility site, interconnections, and alternative location sites. For large facilities or wind\npower facilities with components spread across a rural landscape, the study\narea shall include the area within a radius of at least five miles from all\nfacility components, interconnections and related facilities and alternative\nlocation sites. For facilities in areas of significant resource concerns, the\nsize of a study area shall be configured to address specific features or\nresource issues. (b) Maps clearly showing the location of the proposed facility site, any reasonable\nand available alternative location sites required to be identified, the\ninterconnections, and all ancillary features not located on the facility site\nin relation to municipal boundaries, taxing jurisdictions, designated\nneighborhoods or community districts, at a scale sufficient to determine and\ndemonstrate relation of facilities to those geographic and political\nfeatures. (c) Written descriptions\nexplaining the relation of the location of the proposed facility site, any\nreasonable and available alternative location sites required to be identified, the interconnections, and all ancillary features not located on the facility\nsite to the affected municipalities, taxing jurisdictions, designated\nneighborhoods or community districts.
