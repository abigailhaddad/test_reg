  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.2 - Machine requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\ngaming device shall be robust enough to resist forced entry. (b) Electrical and mechanical parts and\ndesign principals of a gaming device shall not subject a player to any physical\nhazards. (c) Game integrity\nstandard. Tests shall be performed to determine whether outside influences\naffect game fairness to the player or create cheating opportunities. The\nindependent testing laboratory approved by the commission also shall perform, where possible, a cursory review of submissions related to electromagnetic\ninterference, radio frequency interference, magnetic interference, liquid\nspills, power fluctuations and environmental conditions. Electrostatic\ndischarge testing is intended only to simulate techniques observed in the field\nbeing used to attempt to disrupt the integrity of electronic gaming\ndevices. (d) A gaming device shall\nbe able to withstand the following electrostatic interference tests, resuming\ngame play without operator intervention: (1)\n\nRandom number generator. A random number generator (RNG) and random selection\nprocess shall be impervious to influences from outside the device, including, without limitation, electromagnetic interference, electrostatic interference\nand radio frequency interference. (2)\n\nElectrostatic interference. Protection\nagainst static discharges shall require that a gaming device's conductive\ncabinets be grounded in such a way that static discharge energy shall not\ndamage permanently, or inhibit permanently the normal operation of the\nelectronics or other components within such gaming device. A gaming device may\nexhibit temporary disruption when subjected to a significant electrostatic\ndischarge greater than human body electrostatic discharge, but such device\nshall exhibit a capacity to recover and complete any interrupted play without\nloss or corruption of any control or critical data information associated with\nsuch gaming device. Tests of such protection shall be conducted with a severity\nlevel of a maximum of 27 kilovolts air discharge. (e) Each gaming device shall meet the\nfollowing hardware requirements: (1)\n\nMicroprocessor controlled. A gaming device shall be controlled by one or more\nmicroprocessors or the equivalent in such a manner that a game outcome is\ncontrolled completely by the microprocessor or a mechanical device, as approved\nin section\n5319.35\nof this Part; and\n(2)\n\nOn/off switch. An on/off switch that\ncontrols the electrical current shall be located in a place that is readily\naccessible within the interior of the gaming device but is located so that\npower cannot be disconnected from outside of the gaming device using the on/off\nswitch. The on and off positions of the switch shall be labeled. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.2\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
