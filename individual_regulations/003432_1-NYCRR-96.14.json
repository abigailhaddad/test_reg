The conditions under which seed is certified\nshall be prescribed jointly by the certifying agency and the commissioner. Seeds so certified shall be tagged with a green certification tag which shall\nclearly show the class of certified seed and the respects in which the seed to\nwhich it is attached does not meet regular certification standards. No seed\nshall be certified under this provision under conditions which will be\ninjurious to the reputation of the certified seed. (b) Foundation and registered seed failing to\nmeet certification standards other than those affecting genetic purity may be\nidentified as approved planting stock for the production of certified seed in\n\nNew York State upon the approval of the certifying agency. The tag attached to\nsuch seed shall clearly show the class of certified seed that may be produced\nusing these planting stocks and the respects in which the seed does not meet\nregular certification standards. (c) Should amounts of foundation seed be\ninadequate to meet demands for planting stock due to fire, drought or other\ndisaster, the certifying agency in consultation with the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets shall be authorized to locate, purchase and distribute\nas \"approved planting stock\" any appropriate and suitable seed.
