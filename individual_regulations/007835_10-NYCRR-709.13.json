  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 709.13 - Adult day health-care programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This methodology will be utilized to evaluate certificate of need applications\ninvolving the initiation of adult day health-care programs. It is the intent of\nthe State Hospital Review and Planning Council that this methodology, when used\nin conjunction with the planning standards and criteria set forth in section\n709.1\nof this Part, become a\nstatement of planning principles and decisionmaking tools for directing the\ndistribution of adult day health-care programs. The goals and objectives of the\nmethodology expressed herein are expected to ensure that an adequate number of\nadult day health-care programs are available to provide access to care and\navoid the unnecessary duplication of resources. Additionally it is intended\nthat the methodology provide sufficient flexibility to consider additional\ncircumstances that reflect on the need for adult day health care. (b) The factors and methodology for\ndetermining the public need for adult day health-care services in each county\nshall include, but not be limited to: (1)\n\nAn\nestimate of the capacity needed in adult day health-care programs to serve\nadult day health-care registrants. For purposes of this section, capacity means\nthe number of registrants that an adult day health-care program can accommodate\nat one time based on factors such as availability of staff, furniture and\nequipment and the number and size of the rooms used for the program. This\ncapacity is calculated using population estimates for each county projected\nfive years in the future. This capacity shall be calculated using the following\nage cohorts and capacity measures: (i) capacity for 0.04 registrants per 1,000 population aged 20-64; (ii)\ncapacity for 2.5 registrants per 1,000\npopulation aged 65-74; and\n(iii)\ncapacity for 3.65 registrants per 1,000 population aged 75 and over. (2)\n\nThe estimates for each of the\nage cohorts shall be summed to derive the total capacity needed for adult day\nhealth-care services in a county. (3)\n(i) To\ndetermine unmet need for adult day health-care program capacity in a county, capacity of the approved programs in such county shall be subtracted from the\ntotal capacity needed for such county. (ii)\n\nThe capacity of approved adult day\nhealth-care programs shall be determined as follows: (a) for a program that was approved with a\nspecific capacity, such approved capacity shall be utilized; (b) for a program that was approved for a\ntotal number of registrants without a specific capacity, such number shall be\ndivided by two to determine the program's capacity; (c) for a program that was not approved with\na specific capacity or for a total number of registrants, the department will\ndetermine, based on the most recently received and processed data, the total\nnumber of current registrants of such program and such number shall be divided\nby two to determine the program's capacity. (iii)\n\nThe number of registrants is divided by\ntwo in order to determine an proved program's capacity under clauses (ii)(b)\nand (c) of this paragraph, since it is estimated that each unit of adult day\nhealth-care program capacity will serve two registrants. (4)\n\nIn counties where the total capacity\nneeded for adult day health-care services is less than the minimum capacity\nrequired in order to be approved under the operational standards set forth in\n\nPart 425 of this Title, one program may be approved despite such minimum\ncapacity requirement, provided that all other criteria for approval are\nmet. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding that need\nmay otherwise have been determined to be met under this section, additional\nadult day health-care program capacity may be approved within a county if: (i) all existing programs within the county\nare operating at their approved capacities; and\n(ii)\nthere is evidence of further need for\nadult day health-care services as demonstrated by factors which include, but\nneed not be limited to: (a) waiting lists for\nadult day health-care services; and\n(b) the number of people on alternate level\nof care in the county who could benefit from adult day health-care\nservices.
