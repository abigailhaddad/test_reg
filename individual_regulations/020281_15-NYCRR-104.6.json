  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 104.6 - Registration of boat dealers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n2257\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law requires that any person engaged in the business\nof buying, selling or trading boats be registered with the commissioner as a\nboat dealer. However, that section exempts from the registration requirement, a\nperson who sells no boats other than boats determined by the commissioner to be\nboats or devices which would not ordinarily be considered as usable for\ntransportation on water. For the purposes of that section and this regulation, any boat or device which is not designed to be equipped with a motor by which\nit can be mechanically propelled, provided it is not sold with a motor for such\nuse, shall not be considered as usable for transportation on water. (b) A person applying for registration as a\nboat dealer shall submit to the commissioner the appropriate registration fee\ntogether with an application form or forms supplied by the commissioner\ncompleted and submitted in the manner prescribed on such form. A separate boat\ndealer registration must be obtained for each separate location at which a\nperson is operating as a boat dealer. (c) A dealer registration shall not be issued\nunless the commissioner is satisfied that the applicant has a place of business\nwhich is either owned by the applicant or leased to him for a period of at\nleast one year, and such place of business contains a structure of sufficient\nsubstance to adequately provide for the transaction of business and to afford\nreasonable security for records required to be kept by the dealer. The\ncommissioner shall require the applicant to display a sign or other acceptable\nmeans of identification visible to the public which contains the name of the\napplicant as it appears on the application for registration and the applicant's\nstatus as a registered boat dealer. In addition, proof of compliance with other\nstatutory requirements, such as worker's compensation, shall also be required\nto be filed. However, the commissioner may issue a temporary registration\npending final approval of an application. (d) A registered dealer shall not hold a boat\nfor sale on the dealer premises unless the dealer has acceptable evidence of\nownership or evidence of right to possession of the boat nor shall the dealer\nsell or transfer a boat unless acceptable evidence of ownership is in the\ndealer's possession at the time of sale. (e) As hereinafter provided, a registered\nboat dealer must either provide the transferee with acceptable evidence of\nownership and a bill of sale which conforms to the requirements of subdivision\n(g) of this section or the dealer must submit such evidence of ownership and a\ncopy of such bill of sale to the commissioner along with an application for\nregistration on behalf of the transferee and the appropriate registration\nfee. (f) Whenever a dealer issues a\ntemporary registration the dealer must make application for registration (and\ncertificate of title, if appropriate) to the commissioner on behalf of the\nregistrant. Whenever a dealer transfers a boat which is required to be titled\nin this State and which is subject to a security interest, the dealer must make\napplication to the commissioner for registration and title on behalf of the\ntransferee. A dealer may make application for registration (and certificate of\ntitle, if appropriate) in this State for any other boat transferred by the\ndealer if the transferee agrees. In any case in which the dealer makes such\napplication for registration (and certificate of title, if appropriate) in this\n\nState, the dealer must deliver to the transferee a copy of the application for\nregistration, copies of all evidence of ownership, and the original of the bill\nof sale which he submitted to the commissioner. Whenever a dealer makes\napplication for registration and/or title in this State on behalf of his\ntransferee, such application to the commissioner must be made by mail to the\ncentral processing unit of the department. (g) Bill of sale. Every bill of sale issued\nby a registered boat dealer shall be consecutively numbered with a unique bill\nof sale identification number and shall contain the name and address of the\ndealer, the dealer's registration number, the name and address of the\ntransferee, the boat registration number, if assigned by the dealer or\npreviously issued for that boat, a complete description of the boat, including\nmake, model year, hull identification number, hull material, length, type of\npropulsion, whether the boat is new or used, and a statement that all New York\n\nState and local sales tax has been collected. (h) Temporary registrations. A registered\nboat dealer will, upon request, be furnished with temporary registration\ncertificates and a series of registration numbers by the commissioner which the\ndealer may assign upon the sale or transfer of a boat. After issuance of such\ntemporary registrations, the dealer must mail a completed registration\napplication, with appropriate documentation and the appropriate fee to the\ncommissioner at the central processing unit of the department no later than\nfive calendar days after the issuance of such temporary registration. He must\nprovide the transferee with the temporary registration document properly\ncompleted in conformity with the instructions contained thereon. The dealer\nmust also assign a registration number from the series assigned to the dealer\nby the commissioner, unless the boat being transferred was previously\nregistered and numbered in this State. (i) Required records. (1)\nA boat dealer is required to maintain a\npermanently bound book of registry in which shall be recorded a complete\ndescription of all boats acquired for the purpose of sale, traded or sold, the\nname and address of the person from whom the boat was obtained, the\nregistration number of the boat and the location of the boat, if it is being\nheld elsewhere than on the premises described in the dealer registration. Boat\ndescription shall include make, model year, hull identification number, hull\nmaterial, length, type of propulsion, if any, and whether the boat is new or\nused. The book shall also contain the name and address of the person to whom\nthe boat is transferred, the date of sale, the number of the dealer's bill of\nsale, whether any temporary registration was issued, and if so the date of\nissuance, and the registration number of the boat. If the boat requires a\ncertificate of title, the number of liens listed on the application must also\nbe listed in such book. In addition, a copy of the bill of sale given to the\ntransferee must also be maintained. (2)\n\nWhen a purchaser trades in a boat not\nsubject to the Certificate of Title Law, its registration must be completely\nfilled out showing transfer of the boat to the dealer and must be signed by the\ntransferor at the time of trade-in. If the boat is subject to the Certificate\nof Title Law, the certificate of title properly assigned to the boat dealer and\nsigned by the transferor at the time of trade-in must be obtained by the\ndealer. (3)\n\nAll dealer records must\nbe maintained for a period of five years. Such records shall be open for\ninspection by the commissioner or agents of the commissioner during regular\nbusiness hours. (j) If a\nperson acts as both a boat dealer and a yacht broker, such person must both\nregister as a boat dealer and certify as a yacht broker and must keep separate\nrecords as a dealer and as a yacht broker, including separate books of registry\nfor each function. (k) Dealer\ndemonstrator numbers. Upon request, the commissioner shall assign a series of\ndemonstrator numbers to a registered boat dealer together with a set of two\nvalidating stickers for each such number assigned. The number of demonstrator\nnumbers to be assigned can be limited in the discretion of the commissioner. It\nshall be the dealer's responsibility to fabricate each such number assigned in\nconformity with the dimensions required for registration numbers set forth in\nsubdivision (3) of section\n2253\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law in such a manner that such numbers can be\ntemporarily affixed to any boat owned or controlled by the dealer and held for\nsale, for the purpose of sale or demonstration. Such numbers, together with the\nvalidating stickers shall be temporarily affixed to the boat being used for\ndemonstration at the same locations that regular registration numbers and\nvalidating stickers are attached. (l) A dealer retiring from business must\nreturn all registration forms, numbers and plates which may have been received\nby the dealer from the commissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
