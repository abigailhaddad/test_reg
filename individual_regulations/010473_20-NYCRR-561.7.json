  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 561.7 - Collection of retail sales tax\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When motor fuel is sold at retail, rather than passing through the prepaid tax\nto the customer, the seller must collect the State and local sales taxes based\nupon the actual selling price of the motor fuel less the State motor fuel tax\nimposed by article 12-A and, where applicable, the New York City tax on leaded\ngasoline, at the State and local tax rates in effect where the taxable sale\noccurs. The price upon which the retail sales tax is based must not include the\nprepaid taxes paid on the fuel. The term retail sales for purposes of motor\nfuel transactions shall have the same meaning as contained in section\n526.6\nof\nthis Title. (b) Purchasers of a\nlarge volume of motor fuel shall give the seller a certificate in such form as\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance may prescribed indicating whether the\nfuel is being purchased for resale or purchased at retail for the purchaser's\nown use. Where the purchaser of a large volume of motor fuel does not provide\nthe seller with such a certificate, the seller must determine whether the\nprepaid tax which would be due on each gallon of motor fuel if the fuel\npurchased for resale or the retail sales tax which would be due on each gallon\nof motor fuel if the fuel was purchased at retail is greater. If the prepaid\ntax is greater, the seller shall treat the purchase as a purchase for resale, pass through the prepaid tax and issue a certification of tax payment as\nprovided in section\n561.5\nof this Part. If the retail sales tax is greater, the seller shall treat the\npurchase as purchase at retail and collect the sales tax. For purposes of this\nsubdivision, a purchase of a large volume of motor fuel is a purchase of 500\ngallons or more. (c) Exempt sales. (1)\n\nRetail sales of motor fuel to the\nfollowing purchasers in the described circumstances are exempt from sales tax: (i) the United States of America, and any of\nits agencies and instrumentalities; (ii)\n\nNew York State, or any of its agencies, instrumentalities, public corporations (including a public corporation created\npursuant to agreement or compact with another state or Canada) or political\nsubdivisions (including school districts); (iii)\na hospital which holds a current\noperating certificate issued by the New York State Department of Health under\nsection\n2805\nof the Public Health Law or by the New\n\nYork State Department of Mental Hygiene under article 31 of the Mental Hygiene\n\nLaw and which qualifies as an exempt organization under section\n1116 (a)(4)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw; (iv)\nan airline, as defined in\nsection\n528.10\nof this Title, purchasing kero-jet fuel for use in its own aircraft or for use\nin aircraft under its control; (v) an Indian nation or tribe listed in section\n529.9\nof this Title making purchases from a retail service station on its qualified\nreservation as defined in section\n529.9, and an individual member of such an Indian nation or tribe residing on such a\nqualified reservation making purchases from a retail service station on the\nreservation where he resides; and\n(vi)\ndiplomatic missions and diplomatic\npersonnel purchasing motor fuel with credit cards issued by oil companies, as\nprovided in section\n529.5\n(i) of this Title. Only purchasers who fall within the categories listed above\nmay purchase motor fuel at retail without payment of the sales tax to the\nvendor. The other exemptions from sales tax provided for by sections\n1115\nand\n1116\nof the Tax Law do not apply to sales\nof motor fuel. Although these sales are not exempt under these other exemption\nprovisions, refunds and credits are allowed. See section\n561.10\n(c) of this Part. (2)\n\nIn order to make retail purchases of\nmotor fuel without payment of tax, a purchaser listed in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision must furnish to the seller either: (i) a certificate to the effect that the\npurchaser is entitled to acquire motor fuel tax-free pursuant to paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision on the form which the Department of Taxation and Finance\nhas prescribed, signed by the purchaser and setting forth his name and address\ntogether with such other information as said department has required to be\ncompleted therein; or\n(ii)\na\ngovernment purchase order or the appropriate exemption document where the\npurchaser is a governmental entity described in subparagraphs (1)(i) and (ii)\nof this subdivision. (3)\n\nSales of motor fuel at retail--presumptions. (i) It shall be presumed that all retail\nsales of motor fuel are subject to tax until the contrary is established. It\nshall be further presumed that all motor fuel imported, caused to be imported, produced, refined, manufactured, compounded, received or possessed by any\nperson in this State has been sold subject to tax. This presumption shall not\napply to motor fuel in the fuel tank of a motor vehicle used to propel such\nvehicle or to motor fuel in containers of 10 gallons or less. (ii)\n\nThe burden of proving that any retail\nsale is not subject to the tax shall be upon the purchaser of the motor fuel\nand, except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, shall\nalso be upon the person required to collect the tax. (iii)\n\nWhen a vendor makes a sale of motor\nfuel which is exempt as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, as proof\nof the exemption the vendor shall obtain from the purchaser and retain in his\nfiles either: (a) a certificate to the effect\nthat the purchaser is entitled to acquire motor fuel tax-free pursuant to this\nsubdivision on the form which the Department of Taxation and Finance has\nprescribed, signed by the purchaser and setting forth his name and address\ntogether with such other information as said department has required to be\ncompleted therein; or\n(b) a\ngovernment purchase contract or order or the appropriate exemption document\nwhere the purchaser is a governmental entity described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (iv)\n\nWhen a\nproperly completed certificate, government purchase contract or order or\nexemption document has been furnished to the vendor and accepted by him in good\nfaith within 90 days after the delivery of motor fuel, the burden of proving\nthat the receipts from such sale are not taxable is solely on the\npurchaser. (4)\n\nMotor\nfuel may be purchased without the payment of sales and use tax only when the\npurchasers described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision buy such fuel at\nretail for their own use or consumption. When such purchasers buy motor fuel\nfor resale, the vendor must pass through the tax which has been prepaid on such\nfuel. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
