Tit. 10 § 360.3 - Hospital emergency Surge and Flex Response Plans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every general\nhospital (hereinafter, \"hospital\") shall adopt a detailed emergency Surge and\n\nFlex Response Plan (hereinafter, \"plan\") that, at a minimum, includes the\nfollowing elements: (1)\n\nBed surge plan. The\nplan shall explain how the hospital will increase the number of current staffed\nacute care operational beds to a number set by the Commissioner, which shall be\nup to a 50% increase of such beds within seven days from the date of the\ndeclaration of the state disaster emergency. For the purposes of this Part, an\n\"acute care operational bed\" means a bed that is staffed and equipped with\nappropriate infrastructure such that it can be used to deliver health care\nservices to a patient. The Commissioner may further define the type of acute\ncare operational beds for a given state disaster emergency, which may include\nisolation beds, intensive care (ICU) beds, pediatric and/or acute care beds. The plan shall contain scenarios for increases of current staffed acute care\noperational beds in phased increments, detailing the associated considerations\nfor PPE, staffing, and other supplies and equipment, including whether the\nhospital can meet those requirements using internal resources and capabilities, as well as intra-system load balancing and postponement of some or all\nnon-essential elective procedures. These plans shall inform the Commissioner's\ndirectives, which shall be incremental and geographically tailored at the\n\nStatewide, regional, or community level, as dictated by infection rate\ndata. (2)\nPPE surge plan. The plan\nshall explain how the hospital will increase its supply of personal protective\nequipment (PPE) appropriate for use in a pandemic to achieve continuous\nmaintenance of its required 60-day supply of PPE, pursuant to section\n405.11\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. The plan shall list the contracted entities or other supply chain\nagreements executed by the hospital. Such plan shall further include, as\nappropriate, how the hospital will repurpose existing equipment, replenish the\ninventory from other areas of the health system, and establish cooperative\nagreements to obtain PPE to accommodate supply chain interruptions. A PPE surge\nplan may provide for hospital utilization of some, but not all, of the\nstockpile reserves during a State disaster emergency, provided that within 30\ndays of the end of the State disaster emergency, the stockpile reserve is fully\nrestored. (3)\n\nMass casualty plan. The plan shall explain how the hospital will receive and treat mass casualty\nvictims, in the event of a secondary disaster arising from the interruption of\nnormal services resulting from an epidemic, earthquake, flood, bomb threat, chemical spills, strike, interruption of utility services, nuclear accidents\nand similar occurrences, while addressing the continued need for surge capacity\nfor the underlying state disaster emergency declaration. (4)\n\nStaffing plan. The plan shall explain how\nthe hospital will: identify and train backups for employees who may be unable\nto report to work during a pandemic; institute employee overtime protocols; and\nincrease staffing by inter- and intra-system loan, cross-training, and\nvolunteer programs, which would be operational on seven days' notice. (5)\n\nCapital plan. The plan shall explain how\nthe hospital shall ensure continuous operation of facilities and access to\nutilities, materials, electronic devices, machinery and equipment, vehicles, and communication systems. The plan shall ensure that the hospital routinely\nperforms all required maintenance and peak load testing of its infrastructure\nsystems, including: electrical, heating, ventilation and air conditioning\n(HVAC), and oxygen supply. (b) The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of the\nhospital, or system if authorized by the Commissioner to report on a\nsystem-wide basis, shall certify to the review and approval of the plan, including an attestation that it can be implemented and achieved in the event\nof a declared disaster emergency. The CEO shall be responsible for ensuring\nthat the plan is reviewed and updated, as necessary, periodically as specified\nby the Commissioner and shall re-certify that it is able to be implemented and\nachieved upon each review. (c) The\n\nDepartment may require the hospital to submit its disaster emergency response\nplan and history of semi-annual certifications for review, and may require the\nhospital to make such amendments to the plan as the Commissioner deems\nappropriate, to ensure that the plan will achieve the requirements established\nin subdivision (a) of this section, including increases in bed\ncapacity. (d) In the event of a\ndeclared state disaster emergency, any or all hospitals shall execute their\nplans immediately upon the direction of the Commissioner. (e) Additional preparedness requirements.

Every hospital shall, at all times, continue to maintain the required 60-day supply of PPE appropriate for use in a\ndisaster emergency including a pandemic, pursuant to section\n405.11\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nInformation technology. Every hospital shall ensure that non-essential staff who are capable of working\nremotely in the event of an emergency are equipped and trained to do so, and\nthat infrastructure is in place to allow for the repurposing of existing\nworkspaces as needed when activating the Surge and Flex\n\nSystem. (f) Reporting\nrequirements during the activation of the Surge and Flex System. (1)\n\nIn the event of a declared state disaster\nemergency, upon the Commissioner's direction, hospitals or health systems shall\nreport to the Department all data requested by the Commissioner, in a manner\ndetermined by the Commissioner under Section 306.2. Such data may include, but shall not be limited to: (i) Bed availability, both in total and by\ndesignated service.
