  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 201.13 - Liquidation of burial societies within an incorporated cemetery\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Certain\nincorporated cemeteries maintain sections devoted exclusively to the burial of\npersons who are members of particular burial societies. Many of these societies\nhave become dormant and no longer hold meetings. Some have attempted\ndistribution and liquidation of all of their assets, coupled with attempts to\nsell cemetery plots back to the cemetery at the statutory rate or in exchange\nfor a care arrangement for occupied plots in such society section. The\nliquidation and distribution of such societies falls within the jurisdiction of\nthe New York State Insurance Department, Liquidation Bureau. The Division of\n\nCemeteries is directly concerned with the disposition of unused\ngraves. (b) Accordingly, when\ncemeteries and burial societies attempt to negotiate the liquidation of the\nsociety assets and the buy-back of unused graves, the cemetery shall give\nwritten notice thereof to the director of the Division of Cemeteries, and may\nnot repurchase such graves so offered without the written consent of the\ndirector. Such written notice shall also be given to the New York State\n\nInsurance Department, Liquidation Bureau. The Division of Cemeteries shall also\nnotify the Liquidation Bureau. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 19\n§\n201.13\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
