  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.1 - Purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of\nthis Part is to implement the provisions of article 34 of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, the Coastal Erosion Hazard Areas Act [FN*]. This Part defines\nwhen the department will administer a regulatory program within identified\ncoastal erosion hazard areas and establishes standards for the issuance of\ncoastal erosion management permits by the department. Procedural requirements\nare also established for local governments that wish to implement a local\nprogram, although local implementation is not required until after the\ndepartment has filed coastal erosion hazard area maps for a municipality. Minimum standards and criteria the department will use in certifying and\nrevoking local programs are also outlined. (b) Land use, development and other\nactivities are regulated in coastal areas subject to coastal flooding and\nerosion to minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made property, natural protective features, other natural resources, and to protect human\nlife. (c) New construction or\nplacement of structures is regulated to place them a safe distance from areas\nof active erosion and the impacts of coastal storms to ensure that these\nstructures are not prematurely destroyed or damaged due to improper siting, as\nwell as to prevent damage to natural protective features and other natural\nresources. (d) Public investment in\nservices, facilities or activities which are likely to encourage new permanent\ndevelopment in erosion hazard areas is restricted. (e) Publicly financed erosion protection\nstructures to minimize erosion damage are to be used only where necessary to\nprotect human life or where the public benefits of such structures clearly\noutweigh the public expenditures. (f) The construction of erosion protection\nstructures is regulated in coastal areas subject to serious erosion to assure\nthat, when the construction of erosion protection structures is justified, their construction and operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction\nto man-made property, private and public property, natural protective features, and other natural resources. [FN*] Chapter 841 of the Laws of 1981, which enacted ECL\narticle 34, gave it the statutory short title: \"The Shoreowner's Protection\n\nAct.\"--ED. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
