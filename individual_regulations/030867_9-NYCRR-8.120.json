Tit. 9 § 8.120 - Executive Order No. 120: Declaring an Emergency in Order to Appoint New Jersey and Connecticut Police Officers as Railroad Police Officers to Provide Enhanced Security on Commuter Trains, Buses and Ferries\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, thousands of commuters travel between the states\nof New York, New Jersey and Connecticut via mass transit systems that include\ninterstate rail, bus and ferry systems accessible to the public, and an\nenhanced law enforcement presence on these conveyances is prudent to protect\npublic safety; and\nWHEREAS, terrorists have used explosive and other devices\nto attack public and private transportation systems, as demonstrated by the\nbombings in London in 2005 and in Madrid in 2004, and while there is no known\nconfirmed threat to the New York metropolitan area, mass transit systems\nbetween New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are particularly high-risk\ntargets; and\nWHEREAS, the completed and attempted attacks in New York, including the arrest of Raess Alam Qazi and his brother in November 2012 for\nplanning to carry out attacks at landmarks in New York; the plot against the\nPATH railway system by Assem Hammoud in 2006; the plot against New York City\nsubways by Najibullah Zazi in 2009; the foiled plots of Faisal Shahzad and his\nco-conspirators in May 2010; the October 2012 foiled attempt by Quazi Mohammad\n\nRezwanul Ahsan Nafis to detonate a 1,000 pound car bomb outside the Federal\n\nReserve Bank of New York in Lower Manhattan; and the May 2011 arrest of Ahmed\n\nFerhani and Mohamed Mamdouh for plotting to bomb New York City synagogues, during which Ferhani and Mamdouh discussed additional targets in New York City, including churches and the Empire State Building, demonstrate that terrorists\ncontinue to pose a persistent threat to the State of New York; and\nWHEREAS, the holiday season, including New Year's Eve and\n\nDay, is a time of heightened alert and risk of terrorist attack as terrorists\ntypically consider significant, symbolic dates when planning attacks, with the\nobjective of inflicting mass casualties and maximizing the economic and\npsychological damage to the United States, as evidenced by the 2009 Christmas\n\nDay plot to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner; the November 2010 plot to bomb a\nholiday tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Oregon, by a homegrown violent\nextremist; the December 2010 attack on a market filled with Christmas shoppers\nin Stockholm, Sweden, by a suicide bomber; and the December 2010 arrests in the\n\nUnited Kingdom of 12 individuals plotting to conduct attacks during the holiday\nseason; and\nWHEREAS, New York's sister states, Connecticut and New\n\nJersey, have agreed to deploy police officers from their states to provide\nincreased security on commuter trains, buses and ferries going to and from New\n\nYork State; and\nWHEREAS, sworn members of the Connecticut State Police, sworn police officers of any county or municipality in the State of\n\nConnecticut, sworn members of the New Jersey State Police, and sworn police\nofficers of any county or municipality in the State of New Jersey are\nrestricted in their law enforcement authority once such a conveyance crosses\nthe jurisdictional boundary between Connecticut and New York or between New\n\nJersey and New York respectively; and\nWHEREAS, New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are all\nmembers of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (\"EMAC\"), which allows\nfor mutual assistance and resource sharing among sister states; and\nWHEREAS, EMAC provides that emergency forces from the\nsending state, while operating within the jurisdictional boundaries of the\nreceiving state pursuant to the compact, shall have the same powers (except\nthat of arrest, unless specifically authorized by the receiving state), duties, rights and privileges as are afforded forces of the receiving state in which\nthey are performing emergency services; and\nWHEREAS, to utilize the police resources provided by our\nsister states, we must confer police officer powers, including arrest powers, on such officers while they are within the geographic jurisdiction of New York\n\nState; and\nWHEREAS, Section\n88\nof the Railroad\n\nLaw authorizes the Superintendent of the State Police to appoint any person as\na railroad police officer only under prescribed circumstances and subject to\ncertain limitations; and\nWHEREAS, if such circumstances and limitations were applied\nto sworn police officers from our sister states who are serving as railroad\npolice officers from December 31, 2013, through January 1, 2014, such\napplication would prevent, hinder and delay action necessary to respond to a\nterrorist attack or a threat thereof; and\nWHEREAS, Section\n29-a\nof the\n\nExecutive Law authorizes the suspension, alteration and modification of\nstatutes, local laws, ordinances, orders, rules or regulations, or parts\nthereof, if compliance with such provisions would prevent, hinder or delay\naction necessary to cope with a disaster emergency and the inclusion of any\nother terms and conditions;
