  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 3.2 - Driver license classifications, endorsements and restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivision one of section 501 provides that a driver\nlicense shall be valid only for the operation of the vehicles specified for\neach class of license but shall not be valid for the operation of any type of\nvehicle for which an endorsement is required unless the license contains such\nendorsement and further that such license shall also be subject to any\nrestrictions contained on the license. (a) License classifications. Paragraph (a) of subdivision two of section\n501\nof\nthe Vehicle and Traffic Law establishes eight classes of driver licenses and\nsets forth the vehicles which may be operated with each such class subject to\nany required endorsements and any restrictions which may be made to any such\nlicense. The license classes are: A, B, C, D, E, DJ, M and MJ. Class A, class B\nand class C licenses which contain an H, P, S or X endorsement are commercial\ndriver licenses or CDLs. Any other class license, including a class C license\nwhich does not contain an H, P, S or X endorsement is not a CDL. No license may\ncontain more than one class except that any license may contain a motorcycle M\nclass in addition to its other class. A license which has both a motorcycle and\na DJ class will be designated as a DMJ license. No person shall apply for a\ncommercial learner's permit unless such person holds a class D license. A\ncommercial learner's permit may not be issued with an endorsement authorized by\nfederal regulation, other than a P, S or N endorsement. (b) Endorsements. Paragraph (b) of subdivision two of section 501\nspecifically establishes endorsements which may be added to one or more classes\nof licenses and further provides that the commissioner may by regulation\nestablish additional endorsements. An endorsement is required on a license in\norder for the licensee to operate the type of vehicle or combination of\nvehicles or to transport passengers for the type of cargo specified in the\nendorsement. A license may contain multiple endorsements. (1)\n\nStatutory endorsements. The endorsements\nestablished in statute are T, N, P, X, H, S, W, covered farm vehicle, and\npersonal use vehicle endorsements. A covered farm vehicle endorsement or a\npersonal use vehicle endorsement shall only be added to a license which is not\na CDL. T, N, P, X, S or H endorsement shall only be added to a CDL. A W\nendorsement may be added to a CDL license or to a license that is not a CDL. (i) CDL endorsements. A P endorsement which\nis needed to operate a bus or any motor vehicle with a gross vehicle weight or\ngross vehicle weight rating of more than 26,000 pounds which is designed to\ntransport passengers in commerce requires passage of both a special knowledge\ntest and a skills test in a representative vehicle. An S endorsement which is\nneeded to operate a school bus requires passage of both a special knowledge\ntest and a skills test in a representative vehicle. The holder of an S\nendorsement must also hold a P endorsement. T, N, H, W or X endorsements which\nare needed to operate the following vehicles or combinations require only the\npassage of a knowledge test for each endorsement by the licensee: T - double and triple trailers\nN - tank vehicles\nH - vehicles transporting hazardous materials which are\nrequired to be placarded\nW - tow trucks\nX - combines H & N endorsements\n(a) Metal coil endorsement. (M) This\nendorsement shall be issued to the holder of a commercial driver's license who\ntransports metal coils weighing 5,000 pounds or more or bundled metal coils\nweighing 5,000 pounds or more. (b) A metal coil is a product comprised of mixtures, compounds and/or alloys\ncommonly known as metal, metal foil, metal leaf, forged metal, stamped metal, metal wire or metal chain that are generally good conductors of electricity and\nheat and can be melted or fused, hammered into thin sheets, or drawn into wire\nthat are bulk packaged or packaged from a continuous pull or multiple pulls as\na roll, coil, spool, wind or wrap and where the aggregate weight of the coil is\nequal to or greater than 5,000 pounds. (ii)\n\nCovered Farm Vehicle endorsement. There\nare two types of covered farm vehicle endorsements F and G. The F endorsement\nis required on a non-CDL for operation of covered farm vehicles and covered\nfarm vehicle combinations over 26,000 lbs. The G endorsement is required on a\nnon-CDL for operation of single covered farm vehicles over 26,000 lbs. All of\nthe covered farm vehicle endorsements are limited to operation of the covered\nfarm vehicle or combinations within 150 air miles of the farm or ranch. Beyond\nthat distance, an appropriate class CDL is required. Covered farm vehicle\nendorsements shall be issued for appropriate class licenses upon passage of an\nappropriate non-CDL knowledge test and skills test in a representative\nvehicle. (iii)\n\nPersonal use vehicle\nendorsement. An R endorsement is the personal use vehicle endorsement. It is\nrequired on a non-CDL for operation of recreational vehicles and rental\nvehicles over 26,000 pounds GVWR or over forty feet in length for\ntransportation of personal household goods. It shall be issued upon passage of\na skills test in a recreational vehicle over 26,000 pounds GVWR or over forty\nfeet in length when the licensee has not passed a CDL skills test. (c) Restrictions. Paragraph (c) of subdivision two of section 501\nspecifically provides for three types of restrictions which may be placed on\nlicense classes or endorsements and further provides that the commissioner may\nby regulation establish additional restrictions. A restriction on a license\nlimits the type of vehicles or combinations which can be operated with the\nlicense on which the restriction appears or specifies prosthetic devices or\nequipment which are required in order to operate a vehicle. A license may\ncontain multiple restrictions. (1)\n\nStatutory restrictions. The statutory restrictions are based upon the vehicle\nin which the skills test required for licensing has been passed. Of the three\ntypes of statutory restrictions, the air brake restriction will only be added\nto a CDL. The other statutory restrictions which limit operation to specific\ntypes or combinations of vehicles or to vehicles or combinations of vehicles of\nless than a specified GVWR may be added to any type of license. If the test\nvehicle did not have air brakes and if the knowledge test relating to air\nbrakes is not passed an air brake restriction which prohibits the operation of\nvehicles with air brakes will be placed on a CDL. If the skills test is taken\nin a truck-trailer combination, a restriction limiting the operation of a\ncombination of vehicles to truck-trailer combinations will be placed on the\nlicense. A weight restriction will be placed on a CDL based upon the GVWR of\nthe vehicle in which the test is taken. Ordinarily, the weight restriction\nshall be based upon the following GVWRs: 26,000 lbs. and 18,000 lbs. except\nthat a class C license with a P endorsement may have a weight restriction\nlimiting operation to passenger vehicles having a GVWR of not more than 10,000\nlbs. Different weight restrictions for different types of vehicles may be\nplaced upon the same license. (2)\n\nRestrictions established by regulation. Restrictions established by regulations\nare based upon physical condition or other limitations of the\nlicensee.
