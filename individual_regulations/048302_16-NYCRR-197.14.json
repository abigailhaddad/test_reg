  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 197.14 - Item lists, interpretation of\n\nState Regulations\n\nLists of items appearing in the texts of the several\naccounts are given for the purpose of indicating the application of the\nprescribed accounting in specific cases. The lists are not to be considered as\ncomprising all items includible in the several accounts, but merely as\nrepresentative of them. On the other hand, the appearance of an item in a list\nwarrants the inclusion of such item in the account concerned only when the text\nof the account also indicates inclusion, inasmuch as the same item frequently\nappears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be\ndetermined by the texts of the accounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n197.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
