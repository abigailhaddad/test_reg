  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4227.2 - Foul riding penalized\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nclear, a horse may be taken to any part of the course provided that crossing or\nweaving in front of contenders may constitute interference or intimidation for\nwhich the offender may be disciplined. (b) A horse crossing another so as actually\nto impede him is disqualified, unless the impeded horse was partly in fault or\nthe crossing was wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or\njockey. (c) If a horse or jockey\njostles another horse, the aggressor may be disqualified, unless the impeding\nhorse or his jockey was partly in fault or the jostle was wholly caused by the\nfault of some other horse or jockey. (d) If a jockey willfully strikes another\nhorse or jockey, or rides willfully or carelessly so as to injure another\nhorse, which is no way in fault, or so as to cause other horses to do so, his\nhorse is disqualified. (e) If two\nor more horses are coupled in the betting as an entry, and one or more of them\nshall be disqualified for violation of the rules of racing, the balance of the\nentry shall also be disqualified if in the judgment of the stewards such\nviolation prevented any other horse or horses from finishing ahead of the other\npart of the entry. If said violation is without such effect upon the finish of\nthe race, penalty therefor may be applied against the offender and the balance\nof the entry may go unpunished. (f) Complaints under this section can only be received from the owner, trainer or\njockey of the horse alleged to be aggrieved, and must be made to the clerk of\nthe scales or to the judges before or immediately after his jockey has passed\nthe scales. But nothing in this section shall prevent the judges taking\ncognizance of foul riding. (g) Any\njockey against whom a foul is claimed shall be given the opportunity to appear\nbefore the judges before any decision is made by them. (h) A jockey whose horse has been\ndisqualified or who unnecessarily causes his horse to shorten his stride with a\nview to complaint, or an owner, trainer or jockey who complains frivolously\nthat his horse was crossed or jostled, may be punished. (i) The extent of disqualification shall be\ndetermined by the judges. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4227.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
