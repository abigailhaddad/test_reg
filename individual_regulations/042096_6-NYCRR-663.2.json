(b) Adjacent area means those areas of land\nor water that are outside a wetland and within 100 feet (approximately 30\nmeters), measured horizontally, of the boundary of the wetland. However, the\ndepartment may establish an adjacent area broader than 100 feet (approximately\n30 meters) where necessary to protect and preserve a wetland, as set forth in\nsubdivision 24-0701.2 of the Act and pursuant to Part 664 of this\n\nTitle. (c) Agricultural activity\nmeans: (1)\nthe activity of an individual\nfarmer or other landowner in: (i) grazing and\nwatering livestock; (ii)\nmaking\nreasonable use of water resources for agricultural purposes; (iii)\nharvesting the natural products of\nwetlands; (iv)\nthe selective\ncutting of trees; (v) the\nclear-cutting of vegetation, other than trees, for growing agricultural\nproducts; (vi)\nconstructing winter\ntruck roads of less than five meters (approximately 16 feet) in width for\nremoving trees cut in accordance with subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, where construction is limited to cutting vegetation and compacting ice and does\nnot alter water flows; (vii)\noperating motor vehicles for agricultural purposes; (viii)\ndraining for growing agricultural\nproducts; (ix)\nerecting structures, including fences, required to enhance or maintain the agricultural productivity\nof the land; (x) using chemicals\nand fertilizers according to normally accepted agricultural practices, in order\nto grow crops for human and animal consumption or use, in or adjacent to\nwetlands, where authorized by other State, Federal or local laws; including\napplication of stabilized sludge as fertilizer when applied at agronomic\nloading rates in accordance with a valid Part 360 or 364 landspreading permit; or\n(xi)\notherwise engaging in the\nuse of wetlands for growing agricultural products such as crops, vegetables, fruits or flowers; but\n(2)\ndoes not mean: (i) clear-cutting trees; (ii)\nconstructing roads that require moving\nearth or other aggregate or that alter water flow or in any way deviate from\nsubparagraph (1)(vi) of this subdivision; (iii)\nfilling or deposition of spoil, even\nfor agricultural purposes; (iv)\nmining; or\n(v) erecting structures\nnot required to enhance or maintain the agricultural productivity of the\nland.

The\ninnermost zone of the bog is open water that is of pH 5.00 or lower and is\ntypically anoxic and dark brown. Surrounding this is a floating mat of sphagnum\nmosses, liverworts and shrubby heath plants; this mat is surrounded in turn by\nconiferous swamp above deep deposits primarily of partly decayed sphagnum\nmosses. (h) Classification means\nthe designation placed upon a mapped wetland by the department pursuant to a\nclassification system promulgated in Part 664 of this Title. That system\nestablishes four separate classes that rank wetlands according to their ability\nto perform wetland functions and provide wetland benefits, as required by\nsection 24-0903 of the act. Upon the adoption of an official map, these\nclassifications are the basis for freshwater wetlands regulation regardless of\nthe governmental entity asserting jurisdiction pursuant to the act. (i) Clear-cutting means any cutting of trees\nover six inches in diameter at breast height over any 10-year cutting cycle\nwhere the average residual basal area of trees over six inches in diameter at\nbreast height remaining after such cutting is less than 30 square feet per\nacre, measured within the area harvested; provided, however, that where\nregeneration is assured by stand conditions such that after such cutting, the\naverage residual basal area of trees at least one inch in diameter at breast\nheight is at least 30 square feet per acre, measured within the area harvested, a clearcut will not be deemed to have taken place unless the average residual\nbasal area of trees over six inches in diameter at breast height is less than\n10 square feet per acre, similarly measured. (j) Commercial use facility means any\nfacility or building larger than 20 square meters (approximately 200 square\nfeet) used for retail, wholesale or rental purposes, including storage, sale of\ngoods or services, tourist accommodations or provision of recreational\nfacilities for a fee.

(p) Freshwater wetlands or wetlands means\nlands and waters of the State which meet the definition provided in section\n24-0107(1) of the act and have an area of at least 12.4 acres (approximately 5\nhectares) or, if smaller, have unusual local importance as determined by the\ncommissioner pursuant to section 24- 0301(1) of the act and Part 664 of this\n\nTitle.

No freshwater wetlands permit is required for the\nproposed activity. These activities have been determined by the commissioner as\nbeing compatible with freshwater wetlands and not having a significant adverse\nimpact on wetlands or their functions and benefits. (s) Local government means a village, town, city or county. (t) Map means an\nofficial freshwater wetlands map promulgated by the commissioner pursuant to\nsection 24-0301(5) of the act, or such a map that has been amended or adjusted\npursuant to the act and Part 664 of this Title, on which are indicated the\napproximate location of the actual boundaries of regulated wetlands.

These activities are subject\nto regulation whether or not they occur upon the wetland itself, if they\nimpinge upon or otherwise substantially affect the wetland and are located\nwithin the adjacent area. (1)\n\nThe depositing\nor removal of the natural products of freshwater wetlands by recreational or\ncommercial fishing, shellfishing, aquiculture, hunting or trapping are not\nregulated under the act or this Part. (2)\n\nAgricultural activities, as defined in\nsubdivision (c) of this section, are not regulated under the act or this Part.

(3)\n\nPublic health activities, orders and\nregulations of the New York State Department of Health are not regulated under\nthe act or this Part, provided copies of all such orders or regulations\naffecting wetlands are filed with the Department of Environmental Conservation\nin advance. The commissioner may request modification of these activities, orders or regulations if necessary to implement the policy of the\nact.
