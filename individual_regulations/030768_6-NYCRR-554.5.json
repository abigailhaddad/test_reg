  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 554.5 - Deviation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The maximum\npoint at which a well penetrates a producing formation shall not vary\nunreasonably from the vertical drawn from the center of the hole at the\nsurface. Minor deviations will be permitted, however, without special\npermission for short distances, to straighten the hole, to sidetrack junk, or\nto correct other mechanical difficulties. (b) If for any reason the department feels\nthat a well has been deviated excessively, it shall have the right to require\nthe operator to have a complete angular deviation and directional survey made\nin the well by an approved well surveying company and certified as to\ncorrectness at the operator's sole cost, risk and expense. In the event the\nsurvey reveals any unreasonable violations of the applicable well location or\nspacing regulations, the department may either require the excessively deviated\nwell to be redrilled or to be plugged and abandoned at the option of the\noperator. (c) Any owner or operator\nso desiring, also may petition the department for permission to have an angular\ndeviation and directional survey made in any wells on leases or units\noffsetting the leases or units of the interested owner or operator. If after\npublic hearing on the petition, the department feels the request is justified, and the petitioner has deposited good and sufficient security or bond, the\ndepartment may issue an order authorizing the survey to be made by an approved\nwell surveying company and certified as to correctness at the sole cost, risk\nand expense of the petitioner. In the event the survey reveals an unreasonable\nviolation of the applicable well location or spacing requirements, the\ndepartment then will assess all the costs of the survey to the violator and may\neither require any excessively deviated well to be redrilled or to be plugged\nand abandoned at the option of its operator. (d) Controlled directional drilling also\nshall be permitted upon the approval of the department. Any operator desiring\nto intentionally deviate a well from the vertical shall first make written\napplication to the department. The application, which shall be in addition to\nthe permit application as provided in section\n552.1\nof this Title, must contain\nthe following information: (1)\nnames of the\ncounty, field or area, pool and lease and well number; (2)\ndescription of the surface location and\nof the target bottomhole location in feet from the two nearest lease\nboundaries; (3)\nreason for the\nproposed intentional deviation; (4)\nnames and addresses of the offsetting operators and a statement that each has\nbeen sent a copy of the application by registered mail, and the date of such\nmailing. (e) The\napplication must be accompanied by a neat, legible plat drawn to scale which\nshows the well, all offsetting leases and the wells located thereon, the pool\nin which they are completed, and the names of the offsetting\noperators. (f) Concurrently with\nthe filing with the department of the application to intentionally deviate the\nwell, the applicant must send a copy of said application and accompanying plat\nor plats by registered mail to the operators of all leases or units offsetting\nthe lease or unit on which the well is to be drilled. (g) Upon receipt of the application to\nintentionally deviate the well, the department will hold same for 10 days. If\nwithin said 10-day period any offset operator reciting reasonable cause, shall\nfile in writing with the department a protest to such intentional deviation, or\nif the department is not in accord with the proposed deviation, the application\nshall be scheduled for public hearing. If no objection from either an offset\noperator or the department is interposed within the 10-day period, and all\nother things being in order, the application shall be approved and written\npermission for the intentional deviation shall be issued by the department. The\ncompulsory 10-day waiting period shall not be required if the application for\npermission to intentionally deviate the well is accompanied by the written\nconsent of the operators of all leases or units offsetting the lease or unit\ncontaining the well proposed for deviation. (h) Within 30 days after the completion of an\nintentionally deviated well, a complete angular deviation and directional\nsurvey of the well obtained by an approved well surveying company and certified\nas to correctness shall be filed with the department.
