  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.4 - Forwarding and disposition of charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Forwarding and disposition of charges in\ngeneral. (1)\n\nWho may dispose of charges. Only\npersons authorized to convene courts-martial or to administer nonjudicial\npunishment under 130.15, ML may dispose of charges. A superior competent\nauthority may withhold the authority of a subordinate to dispose of charges in\nindividual cases, types of cases, or generally. (2)\n\nPrompt determination. When a commander\nwith authority to dispose of charges receives charges, that commander must\npromptly determine what disposition will be made in the interest of justice and\ndiscipline. (3)\n\nHow charges may be\ndisposed of. Unless the authority to do so has been limited or withheld by\nsuperior competent authority, a commander may dispose of charges by dismissing\nany or all of them, forwarding any of all of them to another commander for\ndisposition, or referring any or all of them to a court-martial which the\ncommander is empowered to convene. Charges should be disposed of in accordance\nwith the policy in N.Y.R.C.M. 306(b). (i) Dismissal. When a commander dismisses charges, further disposition under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 306(c) of the offenses is not barred. (ii)\n\nForwarding charges. (a) Forwarding to a superior commander. When\ncharges are forwarded to a superior commander for disposition, the forwarding\ncommander must make a personal recommendation as to disposition. If the\nforwarding commander is disqualified from acting as convening authority in the\ncase, the basis for the disqualification must be noted. (b) Other cases. When charges are forwarded\nto a commander who is not a superior of the forwarding commander, no\nrecommendation as to disposition may be made. (c) Forwarding charges against person held\nfor trial by general court-martial. When a person is held for trial by general\ncourt-martial, the commanding officer must, within eight days after the accused\nis ordered into arrest or confinement, if practicable, forward through channels\nthe charges, together with the investigation and allied papers, to the general\ncourt-martial convening authority. If the same is not practicable, he must\nreport in writing to that authority the reasons for delay (ML, 130.33). (iii)\n\nReferral\nof charges (see N.Y.R.C.M. 403, 404, 407, 601). (b) Action by commander not authorized to\nconvene courts-martial. When in receipt of charges, a commander authorized to\nadminister non-judicial punishment but not authorized to convene courts-martial\nmay: (1)\ndismiss any charges; or\n(2)\nforward them to a superior commander for\ndisposition. (c) Action\nby commander exercising summary court-martial jurisdiction. (1)\n\nRecording receipt. Immediately upon\nreceipt of sworn charges, an officer exercising summary court- martial\njurisdiction over the command shall cause the hour and date of receipt to be\nentered on the charge sheet. (2)\n\nDisposition. When in receipt of charges a commander exercising summary court-\nmartial jurisdiction may: (i) dismiss any\ncharges; or\n(ii)\nforward charges\n(or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a subordinate commander for\ndisposition; or\n(iii)\nforward any\ncharges to a superior commander for disposition; or\n(iv)\nsubject to N.Y.R.C.M. 601(d), refer\ncharges to a summary court-martial for trial; or\n(v) unless otherwise prescribed by the Chief\nof Staff to the Governor, direct a pretrial investigation under N.Y.R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of investigation with the charges to a\nsuperior commander for disposition. (d) Action by commander exercising special\ncourt-martial jurisdiction. When in receipt of charges, a commander exercising\nspecial court-martial jurisdiction may: (1)\ndismiss any charges; or\n(2)\nforward\ncharges (or, after dismissing charges, the matter) to a subordinate commander\nfor disposition; or\n(3)\nforward any\ncharges to a superior commander for disposition; or\n(4)\nsubject to N.Y.R.C.M. 601(d), refer\ncharges to a summary court-martial or to a special court-martial for trial; or\n(5)\nunless otherwise prescribed\nby the Chief of Staff to the Governor, direct a pretrial investigation under\nN.Y.R.C.M. 405, and, if appropriate, forward the report of investigation with\nthe charges to a superior commander for disposition. (e) Pretrial investigation. (1)\n\nIn general. Except as provided in\nparagraph (11) of this subdivision, no charge or specification may be referred\nto a general court-martial for trial until a thorough and impartial\ninvestigation of all the matters set forth therein has been made in substantial\ncompliance with this subdivision. Failure to comply with this subdivision has\nno effect if the charges are not referred to a general court-martial (ML, 130.23[a]). (2)\n\nEarlier\ninvestigation. If an investigation of the subject matter of an offense has been\nconducted before the accused is charged with an offense, and the accused was\npresent at the investigation and afforded the rights to counsel, cross-examination, and presentation of evidence required by this subdivision, no further investigation is required unless demanded by the accused to recall\nwitnesses for further cross-examination and to offer new evidence (ML, 130.32[c]). (3)\n\nWho may direct\ninvestigation. An investigation may be directed under this subdivision by any\ncourt-martial convening authority. The Chief of Staff to the Governor may also\ngive procedural instructions not inconsistent with these rules. (4)\n\nPersonnel. (i) Investigating officer. The commander\ndirecting an investigation under this subdivision must detail an officer, not\nthe accuser, as investigating officer, who must conduct the investigation and\nmake a report of conclusions and recommendations. The investigating officer is\ndisqualified to act later in the case in any other capacity. (ii)\n\nDefense counsel. (a) Detailed counsel. Except as provided in\nclause (b) of this subparagraph, military counsel appointed by the Chief of\n\nStaff to the Governor who is a member of the Bar of the State of New York must\nbe detailed to represent the accused. (b) Individual military counsel. The accused\nmay request to be represented by individual military counsel. Such request are\nto be acted on in accordance with N.Y.R.C.M. 506(b). When the accused is\nrepresented by individual military counsel, counsel detailed to represent the\naccused is excused, unless the authority who detailed the defense counsel, as a\nmatter of discretion, approves a request by the accused for retention of\ndetailed counsel. The investigating officer must forward any request by the\naccused for individual investigation. That commander shall follow the\nprocedures in N.Y.R.C.M. 506(b). (c) Civilian counsel. The accused may be\nrepresented by a civilian counsel at no expense to the State. Upon request, the\naccused is entitled to reasonable time to obtain civilian counsel and to have\nsuch counsel present for the investigation. However, the investigation must not\nbe unduly delayed for this purpose. Representation by civilian counsel must not\nlimit the rights to military counsel under clauses (a) and (b) of this\nsubparagraph. (iii)\n\nOthers. The commander who directed the investigation may also, as a matter of\ndiscretion, detail or request an appropriate authority to detail: (a) counsel to represent the State; and\n(b) a reporter; and\n(c) an interpreter. (5)\n\nScope of investigation. The\ninvestigating officer must inquire into the truth and form of the charges, and\nsuch other matters as may be necessary to make a recommendation as to the\ndisposition of the charges. (6)\n\nRights of the accused. At any pretrial investigation under this subdivision the\naccused has the right to: (i) be informed of\nthe charges under investigation; (ii)\nbe informed of the identity of the\naccuser; (iii)\nexcept in\ncircumstances described in N.Y.R.C.M. 804(b)(2), be present throughout the\ntaking of evidence; (iv)\nbe\nrepresented by counsel; (v) be\ninformed of the witnesses and other evidence then known to the investigating\nofficer; (vi)\nbe informed of the\npurpose of the investigation; (vii)\nbe informed of the right against self-incrimination under ML, 130.31; (viii)\ncross-examine witnesses who are\nproduced under paragraph (7) of this subdivision; (ix)\nhave witnesses produced as provided for\nin paragraph (7) of this subdivision; (x) have evidence, including documents or\nphysical evidence, within the control of military authorities produced as\nprovided under paragraph (7) of this subdivision; (xi)\npresent anything in defense, extenuation, or mitigation for consideration by the investigating officer; and\n(xii)\nmake a statement in any\nform. (7)\n\nProduction of\nwitnesses and evidence; alternatives. (i) In\ngeneral. (a) Witnesses. Except as provided in\nclause (iv)(a) of this paragraph, any witness whose testimony would be relevant\nto the investigation and not cumulative, must be produced if reasonably\navailable. This includes witnesses requested by the accused, if the request is\ntimely. A witness is \"reasonably available\" when the significance of the\ntestimony and personal appearance of the witness outweighs the difficulty, expense, delay, and effect on military operations of obtaining the witness'\nappearance. A witness who is unavailable under Mil. R. Evid., 804(a)(1) through\n(6), is \"not reasonably\" available. (b) Evidence. Subject to Mil. R. Evid., section V, evidence, including documents or physical evidence, which is under\nthe control of the State and which is relevant to the investigation and not\ncumulative must be produced if reasonably available. Such evidence includes\nevidence requested by the accused, if the request is timely. Evidence is\nreasonably available if its significance outweighs the difficulty, expense, delay, and effect on military operations of obtaining the evidence. (ii)\n\nDetermination of reasonable\navailability. (a) Military witnesses. The\ninvestigating officer must make an initial determination whether a military\nwitness is reasonably available. If the investigating officer decides that the\nwitness is not reasonably available, the investigating officer must inform the\nparties. Otherwise, the immediate commander of the witness must be requested to\nmake the witness available. A determination by the immediate commander that the\nwitness is not reasonably available is not subject to appeal by the accused but\nmay be reviewed by the military judge under N.Y.R.C.M. 906(b)(3). (b) Civilian witnesses. The investigating\nofficer must decide whether a civilian witness is reasonably available to\nappear as a witness. (c) Evidence. The investigating officer must make an initial determination whether evidence\nis reasonably available. If the investigating officer decides that it is not\nreasonably available, the investigating officer must so inform the parties. Otherwise, the custodian of the evidence must be requested to provide the\nevidence. A determination by the custodian that the evidence is not reasonably\navailable is not subject to appeal by the accused, but may be reviewed by the\nmilitary judge under N.Y.R.C.M. 906(b)(3). (d) Action when witness or evidence is not\nreasonably available. If the defense objects to a determination that a witness\nor evidence is not reasonably available, the investigating officer must include\na statement of the reasons for the determination in the report of\ninvestigation. (iii)\n\nWitness expenses. Transportation expenses and a per diem allowance may be paid\nto civilians requested to testify in connection with an investigation under\nthis subdivision. (iv)\n\nAlternatives\nto testimony. (a) Unless the defense objects, an investigating officer may consider, regardless of the availability of the\nwitness: (1)\nsworn statements; (2)\nstatements under oath taken by telephone, radio, or similar means providing each party the opportunity to question the\nwitness under circumstances by which the investigating officer may reasonably\nconclude that the witness' identity is as claimed; (3)\nprior testimony under oath; (4)\ndepositions; (5)\nstipulations of fact or expected\ntestimony; (6)\nunsworn statements; and\n(7)\noffers of proof of expected\ntestimony of that witness. (b) The investigating officer may consider, over objection of the defense, when the witness is not reasonably available: (1)\nsworn statements; (2)\nstatements under oath taken by telephone, radio, or similar means providing each party the opportunity to question the\nwitness under circumstances by which the investigating officer may reasonably\nconclude that the witness' identity is as claimed; (3)\nprior testimony under oath; and\n(4)\ndepositions of that witness. (v) Alternatives to\nevidence. (a) Unless the defense objects, an\ninvestigating officer may consider, regardless of the availability of the\nevidence: (1)\ntestimony describing the\nevidence; (2)\nan authenticated\ncopy, photograph, or reproduction of similar accuracy of the\nevidence; (3)\nan alternative to\ntestimony, when permitted under clause (iv)(b) of this paragraph, in which the\nevidence is described; (4)\na\nstipulation of fact, document's contents, or expected testimony; (5)\nan unsworn statement describing the\nevidence; or\n(6)\nan offer of proof\nconcerning pertinent characteristics of the evidence. (b) The investigating officer may consider, over objection of the defense, when the evidence is not reasonably available: (1)\ntestimony describing the\nevidence; (2)\nan authenticated\ncopy, photograph, or reproduction of similar accuracy of the evidence; or\n(3)\nan alternative to testimony, when permitted under clause (iv)(b) of this paragraph, in which the evidence is\ndescribed. (8)\n\nProcedure. (i) Presentation of evidence. (a) Testimony. All testimony is to be taken\nunder oath, except that the accused may make an unsworn statement. The defense\nis to be given wide latitude in cross-examining witnesses. (b) Other evidence. The investigating officer\nmust inform the parties what other evidence will be considered. The parties\nmust be permitted to examine all other evidence considered by the investigating\nofficer (ML, 130.32[b]). (c) Defense evidence. The defense has full opportunity to present any matters in\ndefense, extenuation, or mitigation (ML, 130.32[b]). (ii)\n\nObjections. Any objection alleging\nfailure to comply with this subdivision, except paragraph (10) of this\nsubdivision, must be made to the investigating officer promptly upon discovery\nof the alleged error. The investigating officer cannot rule on any objection. An objection is to be noted in the report of investigation if a party so\nrequests. The investigating officer may require a party to file any objection\nin writing. (iii)\n\nAccess by\nspectators. Access by spectators to all or part of the proceeding may be\nrestricted or foreclosed in the discretion of the commander who directed the\ninvestigation or by the investigating officer. (iv)\n\nPresence of accused. The further\nprogress of the taking of evidence must not be prevented and the accused must\nbe considered to have waived the right to be present, whenever the accused: (a) after being notified of the time and\nplace of the proceeding is voluntarily absent (whether or not informed by the\ninvestigating officer of the obligation to be present); or\n(b) after being warned by the investigating\nofficer that disruptive conduct will cause removal from the proceeding, persists in conduct which is such as to justify exclusion from the\nproceeding. (9)\n\nMilitary Rules of Evidence. The Military\n\nRules of Evidence--other than Mil. R. Evid. 301, 302, 303, 305, and section\nV--do not apply in pretrial investigations under this subdivision. (10)\n\nReport of investigation. (i) In general. The investigating officer\nmust make a timely written report of the investigation to the commander who\ndirected the investigation. (ii)\n\nContents. The report of investigation must include: (a) a statement of names and organizations or\naddresses of defense counsel and whether defense counsel was present throughout\nthe taking of evidence, or if not present the reason why; (b) the substance of the testimony taken on\nboth sides, including any stipulated testimony (ML, 130.32[b]); (c) any other statements, documents, or\nmatters considered by the investigating officer, or recitals of the substance\nor nature of such evidence; and\n(d) a statement of any reasonable grounds for belief that the accused was not\nmentally responsible for the offense or was not competent to participate in the\ndefense during the investigation. (iii)\n\nDistribution of the report. The\ninvestigating officer must cause the report to be delivered to the commander\nwho directed the investigation. That commander must promptly cause a copy of\nthe report to be delivered to each accused. (iv)\n\nObjections. Any objection to the report\nmust be made to the commander who directed the investigation within five days\nof its receipt by the accused. This paragraph does not prohibit a convening\nauthority from referring the charges or taking other action within the five-day\nperiod. (11)\n\nWaiver. The\naccused may waive an investigation under this subdivision. Such waiver must be\nin writing. In addition, failure to make a timely objection under this\nsubdivision, including an objection to the report, constitutes waiver of the\nobjection. Relief from the waiver may be granted by the investigating officer, the commander who directed the investigation, the convening authority, or the\nmilitary judge, as appropriate, for good cause shown. (f) Pretrial advice. (1)\n\nIn general. Before any charge may be\nreferred for trial by a general court-martial, it must be referred to the staff\njudge advocate of the convening authority for consideration and advice (ML, 130.34[a]). (2)\n\nContents. The\nadvice of the staff judge advocate must include a written and signed statement\nwhich sets forth that person's: (i) conclusion\nwith respect to whether each specification alleges an offense under the\ncode; (ii)\nconclusion with respect\nto whether the allegation of each offense is warranted by the evidence\nindicated in the report of investigation (if there is such a report); (iii)\nconclusion with respect to whether a\ncourt-martial would have jurisdiction over the accused and the offense; and\n(iv)\nrecommendation of the\naction to be taken by the convening authority. (3)\n\nDistribution. A copy of the advice of the\nstaff judge advocate must be provided to the defense if charges are referred to\ntrial by general court-martial.
