  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 4 § 67.1 - Scoring of examinations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfinal score of each candidate in a written or oral or other test or combination\nof tests comprising an examination shall be reported on a scale to 100, where\nthe score of 100 shall represent the best performance possible, expected or\nattained, and where the score of 70 shall represent a performance meeting the\nminimum needs of the position to be filled with regard to number and quality of\neligibles, and where the score of 60- shall represent any score below\n60. (b) In examinations or tests in\nwhich, considering the needs of the service or the difficulty of the\nexamination or test or other substantial factors, a sufficient number of\ncandidates of sufficient quality achieve raw scores or weighted or corrected\nraw scores, as defined under this section, or some combination of such scores\nequivalent to 70 percent or higher of the maximum possible score, final scores\nshall be determined from raw scores or weighted or corrected raw scores, or\nsome combination of such scores, on a percent basis or by an arithmetic\nadjustment or a series of arithmetic adjustments or by a statistical\nadjustment, as defined under this section, or by any combination of such\nadjustments such that final scores at or about 70 will approximate percent\nscores; provided that no candidate is failed who would pass under percent\nscoring, that the relative order of scores is maintained, and that the scoring\nadjustment used is approved by the director or assistant director of\nexaminations and staffing services. (c) In examinations or tests in which, considering the needs of the service or the difficulty of the examination or\ntest or other substantial factors, an insufficient number of candidates achieve\nraw scores or weighted or corrected raw scores, as defined under this section, or some combination of such scores equivalent to 70 percent or higher of the\nmaximum possible score, final scores may be determined from raw scores or\nweighted or corrected raw scores, or some combination of such scores, by an\narithmetic adjustment or a series of arithmetic adjustments or by a statistical\nadjustment, as defined under this section, or by any combination of such\nadjustments such that more candidates are passed than would pass if final\nscores at or about 70 approximated percent scores; provided that the relative\norder of scores is maintained, that the necessary quality of eligibles is not\njeopardized, and that the scoring adjustment used is approved by the\nadministrative director, deputy administrative director, assistant\nadministrative director or director of examinations and staffing\nservices. (d) Raw score. A raw\nscore is the number of questions answered correctly in a short answer written\ntest or the combination of examiners' ratings in an oral or performance test or\nthe number of credit points earned or assigned in any other kind of test, or\nsome combination of the foregoing. (e) Part raw score. A part raw score is the\nraw score from a part of a test or the raw score from a test that is part of an\nexamination. (f) Corrected raw\nscore. A corrected raw score is a score that has been derived from a raw score\nfrom a short answer written test by one of the following methods: (1)\n\nDeductions for wrong answers, as\ndistinguished from omissions, may be made from raw scores. For example, one\npoint may be deducted from raw scores for every four wrong answers. In this\ncase, for a 100-item test, a candidate who answered 60 questions correctly and\n20 questions incorrectly and who omitted answering 20 questions would have a\nraw score of 60 and a corrected raw score of 55. (2)\n\nAdditions for omissions may be made to\nraw scores. For example, one point may be added to raw scores for every five\nomissions. In this case, for a 100- item test, a candidate who answered 60\nquestions correctly and 20 questions incorrectly and who omitted answering 20\nquestions would have a raw score of 60 and a corrected raw score of 64. These methods may also be applied to part raw scores, the\nresults of which would then be combined with raw scores or weighted or\ncorrected raw scores from the other parts of the test or other tests in the\nexamination. (g) Weighted raw score. A weighted raw score is a score that has been derived from\na raw score by assigning a weight other than one to one or more of the part raw\nscores that contribute to the raw score. For example, in a short answer written\ntest, a weight of two may be assigned to each correct answer to a group of\nquestions comprising the most important part of the test and all other correct\nanswers may be assigned a weight of one each. In this case, a candidate\ncorrectly answering seven questions with a weight of two each and correctly\nanswering 69 questions with a weight of one each would get a weighted raw score\nof 83. Such weights may be assigned, on the basis of job analysis or on\nconsiderations of reliability and/or validity of tests or parts of tests, uniformly for the total condidate group, or differently for candidate\nsubgroups, if scores of such subgroups are shown to differ substantially in\ntheir relation to measures of performance. (h) Arithmetic adjustments. (1)\n\nAn arithmetic adjustment is the adding to\nor subtracting from raw scores or weighted or corrected raw scores or some\ncombination thereof or some fraction or multiple of such scores a uniform whole\nnumber or fraction or combination thereof. For example, final scores may be\ndetermined by using an equation such as: Final score = 3R/2 + 2 1/2\nwhere R is the raw score or the weighted or corrected raw\nscore or some combination of such scores. In this case, a raw score of 60 would\nbecome a final score of 92.5. In another case, final scores may be determined\nby using an equation such as: Final score = R/2 - 10\n\nIn this case a raw score of 180 would become a final score of\n80. (2)\nA series of\narithmetic adjustments consists of the division of the distribution of raw\nscores or weighted or corrected raw scores or some combination of such scores\ninto two or more mutually exclusive ranges of scores and applying a separate\narithmetic adjustment as defined above in each range. For example, a\ndistribution of raw scores from a 120-item test may be split so that all raw\nscores in the range 85 to 120 are converted to final scores by an equation such\nas: Final score = R/2 + 40\nand raw scores in the range 1-84 are converted to final\nscores by an equation such as: Final score = R - 2\n\nIn this case a raw score of 78 would become a final score of\n76 and a raw score of 100 would become a final score of 90. This would\naccomplish a lowering of the passing point below percent standards and at the\nsame time would provide for more than 31 scores between 70 to 100. (i) Statistical\nadjustment. A statistical adjustment is the assignment of final scores\naccording to a predetermined form based on a statistical division of the\ndistribution of raw scores or weighted or corrected raw scores or some\ncombination of such scores. Examples: (1)\n\nThe\nraw scores or weighted or corrected raw scores or some combination of such\nscores of all passing candidates may be evenly distributed between 70 and 100\nwith the best one-sixth of eligibles assigned final scores from 95 to 100, the\nnext one-sixth assigned final scores from 90 to 95, the next one-sixth assigned\nfinal scores from 85 to 90, the next one-sixth assigned final scores from 80 to\n85, the next one-sixth assigned final scores from 75 to 80, and the lowest\none-sixth assigned final scores from 70 to 75. (2)\nA final passing score of 70 may be\nassigned to candidates attaining a mean raw score or mean weighted or corrected\nraw score or a mean of some combination of such scores, and a final score of 80\nmay be assigned to candidates attaining one standard deviation higher, etc. (j) Any officer or\nemployee to whom the identity and rating of one or more candidates in an\nexamination is known shall be disqualified from recommending or approving the\nuse of any scoring adjustment in such examination. In the event that the\nidentity and rating of one or more candidates in an examination is known to an\nofficer or employee whose duties and functions would otherwise involve the\nrecommendation or approval of the use of a scoring adjustment in such\nexamination, the duties and functions of such officer or employee with respect\nto the recommendations or approval of a scoring adjustment in such examination\nshall be assigned to another appropriate officer or employee who is not\ndisqualified under the provision of this section. (k) Where one of the above methods of scoring\nis used, the nature of the scoring adjustment shall be made known upon request\nto any candidate who inspects his examination paper or questions his\nrating.
