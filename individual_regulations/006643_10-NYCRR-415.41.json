  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 415.41 - Specialized programs for residents with neurodegenerative diseases\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nSpecialized\nprogram\nshall mean a discrete unit with a planned array of services, staffing, equipment and physical facilities designed to serve individuals with\nneurodegenerative diseases, and approved pursuant to Part 710 of this Title. The program shall provide goal-directed, comprehensive and interdisciplinary\nservices directed at attaining or maintaining the individual at his or her\nhighest practicable level of physical, affective, behavioral, psychosocial and\ncognitive functioning. (2)\n\nFor\npurposes of this section, neurodegenerative disease\nshall mean\n\nHuntington's disease or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. (3)\n\nFor purposes of this section, and\nconsistent with the requirements of section\n415.11\nof this Part, the program\nshall have an interdisciplinary resident care team consisting of, at a minimum, the resident's physician, a registered professional nurse with responsibility\nfor the resident and, depending on the resident's diagnosis, needs and\nsymptoms, other appropriate staff in disciplines determined to meet the\nresident's needs which may include staff assigned to the unit as set forth in\nsubdivision (e) of this section. (4)\n\nThe program shall be located in a nursing\nunit which is specifically designated for this purpose and physically separate\nfrom other facility units. Residents of the unit shall have access to all of\nthe facility's recreational and therapeutic resources, including those\nresources that are not located in the unit. (5)\n\nThe facility shall ensure that sufficient\nspace, equipment and facilities are available to support the clinical, education and administrative functions of the program in accordance with the\nstandards set forth in Parts 711 and 713 of this Title. (6)\n\nIn addition to the implementation of the\nquality assessment and assurance plan for this program as required by section\n415.27\nof this Part, the facility\nshall participate with the department in an evaluation of the efficacy and\neffectiveness of the program and its impact on residents, families and staff. The facility shall collect data and furnish records, reports and data in a\nformat requested by the department and shall make members of the\ninterdisciplinary resident care team available for participation in the\nevaluation, as requested by the department. The facility shall submit such\ninformation to the department for the period ending December 31st, no later\nthan 90 days following the end of the calendar year, annually through calendar\nyear 2021. (7)\n\nThis section shall\nbe implemented as a Quality Assessment and Performance Improvement (QAPI)\nproject, as described in guidance from the Federal Centers for Medicare and\n\nMedicaid Services. (b) Admission. (1)\n\nThe facility\nshall develop written admission criteria for the specialty unit to include the\ncriteria in paragraph (2) of this subdivision and take into account the\nfacility's goals and objectives regarding outcomes (\ne.g., minimizing self-inflicted injuries/falls, chorea-related trauma, hospitalization [length of stay], emergency department utilization, bed hold, and satisfaction surveys of residents with neurodegenerative diseases staff, families, and others) for residents who live in the specialty unit. The\nfacility shall evaluate the effects of its admission criteria on its success in\nachieving its goals and objectives for the unit and report its findings to the\ndepartment no later than 90 days following the end of the calendar year, annually through calendar year 2021. (2)\n\nAt a minimum, for residents admitted to\nthe unit, there shall be documented evidence in the resident's medical record\nthat: (i) the resident has been diagnosed with\nneurodegenerative disease based on a medical evaluation by a physician as\ndetermined by highly suggestive family history, neurological testing, genetic\ntesting when available, formal consultation setting and/or formal neurological\ndiagnostic consultation; (ii)\nthe\nresident cannot be managed and is not safe, and his or her needs cannot be met, in an available, less restrictive setting; and\n(iii)\nthe resident has the ability to benefit\nfrom the specialized care and services available in the\nunit.
