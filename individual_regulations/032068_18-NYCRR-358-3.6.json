Tit. 18 §§ 358-3.6 - Right to aid continuing\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn certain situations, you have the right to have your\npublic assistance, medical assistance, food stamp benefits, and services\ncontinued unchanged until your fair hearing decision is issued. OAH will\ndetermine whether you are entitled to aid continuing and advise the appropriate\nsocial services agency and you of its decision. (a) Public assistance, medical\nassistance and services. For public assistance, medical assistance and services, the right to aid continuing exists as follows: (1)\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, where the social\nservices agency is required to give you timely notice before it can take any\naction in your case, you have the right to aid continuing for your public\nassistance and medical assistance and services until the fair hearing decision\nis issued if you request a fair hearing before the effective date of a proposed\naction as contained in the notice of action. In the Medical Assistance Program, if you have been receiving assistance based on a spenddown of excess income, the right to aid continuing includes the right to have your spenddown liability\ncontinue unchanged. (ii)\n\nIf your\nassistance or services have been reduced or discontinued, restricted or\nsuspended by the social services agency and you requested a hearing before the\neffective date contained in the notice, your assistance or services must be\nrestored by the social services agency as soon as possible but no later than\nfive business days after notification from OAH that you were entitled to have\nyour public assistance, medical assistance or services continue uninterrupted\npursuant to this paragraph. (iii)\n\nIn cases where the action is an automatic public assistance grant adjustment\nbased on a change in State or Federal law, the effective date for determining\nthe right to continued public assistance, medical assistance and food stamps\nwill be deemed to be 10 days after the date the changed grant becomes available\nto you. (iv)\n\nIf the effective date\nof the proposed action falls on a weekend or holiday, a hearing request\npostmarked or received by OAH on the day after the weekend or holiday will be\nconsidered timely for the purposes of aid continuing. (2)\n\nThere is no right to aid continuing of: (i) public assistance where OAH has\ndetermined that the sole issue is one of State or Federal law or policy, or\nchange in State or Federal law and not one of incorrect grant computation; or\n(ii)\nmedical assistance or\nservices where OAH has determined that the sole issue is one of State or\n\nFederal law or policy; or\n(iii)\nmedical assistance when you have been determined presumptively eligible for\nmedical assistance and have subsequently been denied eligibility for medical\nassistance; or\n(iv)\nmedical\nassistance if you are a recipient in a general hospital, not receiving chronic\ncare services, and you are in short-term hospitalization and a utilization\nreview committee determines that such level of care is no longer required; or\n(v) public assistance, medical\nassistance or services when the social services official determines to\ndiscontinue your benefits because you are receiving concurrent benefits as\ndescribed in section\n351.9\nof this Title in the same\nsocial services district or in another social services district within the\n\nState; or\n(vi)\nchild care\nassistance provided pursuant to section\n415.2\n(a)(1)(i)\nof\nthis Title before the eligibility determination and you have subsequently been\ndetermined ineligible for child care assistance pursuant to section\n415.2\n(a)(1)(ii)\nof this Title. (3)\n(i) Where the social services agency is\nrequired only to give you adequate notice but not timely notice and has\ndiscontinued, reduced, restricted or suspended your public assistance, medical\nassistance or services, you have the right to have your public assistance, medical assistance or services reinstated and continued until a fair hearing\ndecision is issued only if you request a fair hearing within 10 days of the\nmailing of the agency's notice of the action and if OAH determines that the\naction on your public assistance or medical assistance benefits or services did\nnot result from the application of or change in State or Federal law or policy. If OAH determines that you are entitled to have your public assistance, medical\nassistance or services reinstated and continued in accordance with this\nparagraph, the social services agency must restore your public assistance, medical assistance or services as soon as possible but not later than five\nbusiness days after being advised by OAH of such determination. With the\nexception of child care services, there is no right to reinstatement for\nsupportive services provided to enable you to participate in work activities\npursuant to Part 385 of this Title. (ii)\n\nIf the 10th day of the mailing of the\nagency's notice of the action falls on a weekend or holiday, a hearing request\npostmarked or received by OAH on the day after the weekend or holiday will be\nconsidered timely for the purposes of reinstatement pursuant to subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph. (4)\n(i) Where an applicant for or a recipient of public assistance has claimed to be\nexempt from work requirements under the disability program pursuant to section\nsection\n385.2\n(d) of this\n\nTitle and has been determined not to be exempt or to be work limited and a\nhearing is requested to contest such determination within 10 days of the date\nof the agency's notice, any failure to comply with employment requirements\nwithin the 10-day period or thereafter until a fair hearing decision is issued\nwill not be considered noncompliance regardless of the outcome of the fair\nhearing. (ii)\n\nIf the 10th day after\neffective date of the agency's notice of the action falls on a weekend or\nholiday, a hearing request postmarked or received by OAH on the day after the\nweekend or holiday will be considered to be received within 10 days of the\neffective date of the agency notice for purposes of subparagraph (i) of this\nparagraph. (b) Public assistance, medical assistance, and services will not be continued pending the issuance of a fair hearing\ndecision when: (1)\nyou have voluntarily\nwaived your right to the continuation of such assistance, benefits or services\nin writing; or\n(2)\nyou do not\nappear at the fair hearing and do not have a good reason for not appearing; or\n(3)\nprior to the issuance of\nyour fair hearing decision, a social services agency proposes to take or takes\nan action which affects your entitlement to public assistance, medical\nassistance, or services, and you do not make a request for a fair hearing\nregarding the subsequent notice. (c) Food stamp benefits. For food stamp households, including households in\nreceipt of both food stamps and public assistance, the right to aid continuing\nexists as follows: (1)\n(i) You have the right to have your food\nstamp benefits continue at the same level as you have been receiving until the\nfair hearing decision is issued only where the proposed adverse action is to\ntake place during the certification period of your food stamp authorization and\nyour request for a hearing is made prior to the effective date contained in a\ntimely notice for your case closing or authorization reduction. (ii)\n\nIf your food stamp benefits have been\nreduced or discontinued by the social services agency and you have made a\ntimely hearing request by the effective date contained in the notice, your food\nstamp benefits must be restored by the social services agency as soon as\npossible but no later than five business days after notification from OAH that\nyou are entitled to have your benefits continue unchanged pursuant to this\nparagraph. (iii)\n\nWhere the action\nbeing taken is the result of a mass change, the effective date of the action is\ndeemed to be 10 days after the date the changed level of benefits become\navailable to you. (iv)\n\nIf the\neffective date of the proposed action falls on a weekend or holiday, a hearing\nrequest postmarked or received by OAH on the day after the weekend or holiday\nwill be considered timely for the purposes of this paragraph. (2)\n\nThere is no right to aid\ncontinuing where: (i) OAH has determined that\nthe sole issue is one of Federal law or regulation and your claim that your\nbenefits were improperly computed or the law or regulation was misapplied or\nmisinterpreted is invalid; or\n(ii)\nyour food stamp benefits have been reduced, suspended or cancelled as a result\nof an order to reduce allotments issued by the Food and Nutrition Service\nbecause the requirements of states participating in the Food Stamp Program will\nexceed appropriations; or\n(iii)\na\nsocial services official determines to discontinue your benefits because you\nare receiving concurrent benefits as described in section\n351.9\nof this Title in the same\nsocial services district or in another social services district within the\n\nState. (3)\n\nWhen food\nstamp benefits are reduced or terminated because you fail to make the request\nfor a hearing within the required period stated in the notice, upon your\nrequest for a fair hearing your food stamp benefits will be reinstated if you\nestablish that your failure to request a hearing in a timely manner was for\ngood cause. If OAH determines that you have the right to have your food stamp\nbenefits reinstated in accordance with this paragraph, the social services\nagency must reinstate your food stamp benefits as soon as possible but no later\nthan five business days after being advised by OAH of such\ndetermination. (4)\n\nWhen benefits\nare reduced or terminated due to a mass change, your benefits will be\nreinstated only if the issue being contested is that: (i) food stamp eligibility or benefits were\nimproperly computed; or\n(ii)\n\nFederal law or regulation is being misapplied or misinterpreted by a State\nagency or by a social services agency. If OAH determines that you have the right to have your\nfood stamp benefits reinstated in accordance with this paragraph, the social\nservices agency must reinstate your food stamp benefits as soon as possible but\nno later than five business days after being advised by OAH of such\ndetermination. (5)\n\nIf the action proposed in the notice\nresults from a regularly scheduled recertification of your food stamp\nauthorization, your level of participation in the Food Stamp Program will be\ncontinued at the level determined at your recertification. You do not have the\nright to have your level of benefits continued at the prior benefits level\nunless and until the fair hearing decision is issued requiring such benefit\nlevel. (6)\n\nOnce your benefits are\ncontinued or reinstated, your benefits should continue without change until you\nreceive your hearing decision unless: (i) your\ncertification period expires, in which case you may reapply and may be\ndetermined eligible for a new certification period; or\n(ii)\na change affecting your household's\neligibility for food stamps or the basis of issuance of food stamp benefits\noccurs before your hearing decision is issued and you fail to make a request\nfor a fair hearing regarding a subsequent notice of adverse action; or\n(iii)\nbefore the hearing\ndecision is issued a mass change occurs which affects your household's\neligibility for food stamps or basis of issuance. (d) If your public assistance\ngrant, child care services, or food stamp benefits are continued until a fair\nhearing decision is issued and you lose the fair hearing, the social services\nagency may recover the benefits or services which you should not have received. This subdivision does not apply to fair hearings to review the imposition of a\nwork sanction under sections\n351.2\n(i)(2), 385.12 and\n385.13\nof this Title. (e) If you are involuntarily discharged from\na tier II facility after requesting and participating in a hearing, held by the\nfacility or the social services district in which the facility is located, and\nyou request a fair hearing to review this determination, you do not have the\nright to remain at the facility pending the outcome of your fair\nhearing.
