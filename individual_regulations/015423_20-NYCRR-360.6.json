  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 360.6 - Payment of life insurance proceeds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nSection 249-cc of the Tax Law imposes upon insurance companies, as to proceeds\nof certain life insurance policies paid by them upon the life of a resident\ndecedent, the same liability for the estate taxes imposed by article 10-C and\narticle 26 of the Tax Law as is imposed on all other persons or corporations\nhaving assets of a decedent in their possession. Under said section, where the\namount of life insurance proceeds payable by a life insurance company to any\nbeneficiary on the life of a resident decedent is more than $50,000 in the case\nof a decedent dying after August 31, 1977 (or $20,000 in the case of a decedent\ndying before September 1, 1977), such company must give written notice to the\n\nState Tax Commission at least 10 days prior to the payment of such proceeds, and must retain a sufficient portion of such proceeds to pay estate taxes, unless the State Tax Commission consents in writing to such payment. However, where the amount of such proceeds payable in the case of a decedent dying after\n\nAugust 31, 1977 is $50,000 or less, but more than $30,000 in the case of a\ndecedent dying after June 30, 1978 $2,000 in the case of a decedent dying after\n\nAugust 31, 1977 but before July 1, 1978), such company may make payment to the\nbeneficiary as soon as it shall have mailed to the State Tax Commission a\nnotice thereof. In the case of a decedent dying before September 1, 1977 where\nthe amount of such proceeds payable is $20,000 or less, but more than $2,000, such company may make payment to the beneficiary as soon as it shall have\nmailed to the State Tax Commission a notice thereof. Where the amount of such\nproceeds is $30,000 or less, in the case of a decedent dying after June 30, 1978 ($2,000 or less in the case of a decedent dying before July 1, 1978), no\nnotice need be given to the State Tax Commission. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, an insurance company may pay the proceeds of\nlife insurance policies upon the life of a decedent dying after September 30, 1983 to such decedent's surviving spouse, as beneficiary, without the written\nconsent or waiver of the State Tax Commission and without giving written notice\nto the State Tax Commission or retaining any portion of the proceeds for the\npayment of estate tax or interest. (b) The statute applies to the proceeds of\nall life insurance policies issued by any one company on the life of a decedent\nwhether paid to a named beneficiary or to an executor or administrator. In\ndetermining the amount of such proceeds, the net amount payable under the\npolicy shall be used; that is, the amount payable under the policy, inclusive\nof dividends, additional insurance, or refunds of premiums, less any\noutstanding indebtedness. Where a policy is payable in installments the\ncommuted value of the installments, that is, the amount payable if the policy\nhad been issued on a lump sum basis, shall be used. Where a company has issued\nmore than one policy aggregating more than $50,000, in the case of a decedent\ndying after June 30, 1978 ($20,000 in the case of a decedent dying before July\n1, 1978), waivers must be obtained. (c) Waivers of the State Tax Commission may\nbe secured by insurance companies, representatives of estates or beneficiaries. (1)\n\nApplications for waivers shall, wherever\npossible, set forth the following information: name and address of the\ndecedent-insured; name and address of the beneficiary; policy number; the\namount of proceeds payable under each policy; name and address of the legal\nrepresentative of the insured's estate; and the county in which the estate is\nbeing administered. A copy of the decedent's death certificate must be\nsubmitted with the first request for waivers. Upon issuance of a waiver by the\n\nState Tax Commission, the proceeds may be paid forthwith to the beneficiary\nwithout the giving of notice or the withholding of tax. (2)\n\nWaivers may be secured from the New York\n\nState Department of Taxation and Finance, Audit Division-Estate Tax Section, State Campus, Albany, N.Y. 12227. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
