In the performance of these duties, the following\nstandards apply. (B)\n\nAdjudicative responsibilities. (1)\nA judge shall be faithful to the\nlaw and maintain professional competence in it. A judge shall not be swayed by\npartisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism. (2)\nA judge shall require\norder and decorum in proceedings before the judge. (3)\nA judge shall be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, lawyers and others\nwith whom the judge deals in an official capacity, and shall require similar\nconduct of lawyers, and of staff, court officials and others subject to the\njudge's direction and control. (4)\nA judge shall perform judicial\nduties without bias or prejudice against or in favor of any person. A judge in\nthe performance of judicial duties shall not, by words or conduct, manifest\nbias or prejudice, including but not limited to bias or prejudice based up on\nage, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender\nexpression, religion, national origin, disability, marital status or\nsocioeconomic status, and shall require staff, court officials and others\nsubject to the judge's direction and control to refrain from such words or\nconduct.

This paragraph does not preclude\nlegitimate advocacy when age, race, creed, color, sex, sexual orientation, religion, national origin, disability, marital status or socioeconomic status, or other similar factors are issues in the proceeding. (6)\nA judge shall accord to\nevery person who has a legal interest in a proceeding, or that person's lawyer, the right to be heard according to law. A judge shall not initiate, permit, or\nconsider ex parte communications, or consider other communications made to the\njudge outside the presence of the parties or their lawyers concerning a pending\nor impending proceeding, except: (a) Ex parte communications that are\nmade for scheduling or administrative purposes and that do not affect a\nsubstantial right of any party are authorized, provided the judge reasonably\nbelieves that no party will gain a procedural or tactical advantage as a result\nof the ex parte communication, and the judge, insofar as practical and\nappropriate, makes provision for prompt notification of other parties or their\nlawyers of the substance of the ex parte communication and allows an\nopportunity to respond. (b) A judge may obtain the advice of a\ndisinterested expert on the law applicable to a proceeding before the judge if\nthe judge gives notice to the parties of the person consulted and a copy of\nsuch advice if the advice is given in writing and the substance of the advice\nif it is given orally, and affords the parties reasonable opportunity to\nrespond. (c) A judge\nmay consult with court personnel whose function is to aid the judge in carrying\nout the judge's adjudicative responsibilities or with other judges.

(11)\nA judge shall not disclose or use, for any purpose unrelated to judicial duties, nonpublic information acquired in\na judicial capacity.

A judge shall refrain\nfrom recommending a relative within the fourth degree of relationship of either\nthe judge or the judge's spouse or the spouse of such person for appointment or\nemployment to another judge serving in the same court. A judge also shall\ncomply with the requirements of Part 8 of the Rules of the Chief Judge (22\nNYCRR Part\n8\n) relating to the appointment of relatives of judges. Nothing in\nthis paragraph shall prohibit appointment of the spouse, domestic partner, or\nunrelated household member of the town or village justice, or other relative as\nclerk of the town or village court in which such justice sits, provided that\nthe justice obtains the prior approval of the Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts, which may be given upon a showing of good cause.

Where the judge knows the relationship to be within\nthe second degree, (i) the judge must disqualify him/herself without the\npossibility of remittal if such person personally appears in the courtroom\nduring the proceeding or is likely to do so, but (ii) may permit remittal of\ndisqualification provided such person re mains permanently absent from the\ncourtroom. (f) The\njudge, while a judge or while a candidate for judicial office, has made a\npledge or promise of conduct in office that is inconsistent with the impartial\nperformance of the adjudicative duties of the office or has made a public\nstatement not in the judge's adjudicative capacity that commits the judge with\nrespect to: (i) an issue in\nthe proceeding; or\n(ii)\nthe parties or controversy in the\nproceeding. (g) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubparagraphs (c) and (d) of this section, if a judge would be disqualified\nbecause of the appearance or discovery, after the matter was assigned to the\njudge, that the judge individually or as a fiduciary, the judge's spouse, or a\nminor child residing in his or her household has an economic interest in a\nparty to the proceeding, disqualification is not required if the judge, spouse\nor minor child, as the case may be, divests himself or herself of the interest\nthat provides the grounds for the disqualification. (2)\nA judge shall keep\ninformed about the judge's personal and fiduciary economic interests, and make\na reasonable effort to keep informed about the personal economic interests of\nthe judge's spouse and minor children residing in the judge's\nhousehold.

If, following such disclosure of any basis for\ndisqualification, the parties who have appeared and not defaulted and their\nlawyers, without participation by the judge, all agree that the judge should\nnot be disqualified, and the judge believes that he or she will be impartial\nand is willing to participate, the judge may participate in the proceeding. The\nagreement shall be incorporated in the record of the proceeding. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
