  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 600.5 - Affirmative action plans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Adoption of affirmative action plans. A sponsor's commitment to equal\nopportunity in recruitment, selection, employment and training of apprentices\nshall include the adoption of a written affirmative action plan. (b) Definition of affirmative action. Affirmative action is not mere passive nondiscrimination. It includes\nprocedures, methods and programs for the identification, positive recruitment, training and motivation of present and potential minority and female (minority\nand nonminority) apprentices, including the establishment of goals and\ntimetables. It is action which will equalize opportunity in apprenticeship so\nas to allow full utilization of the work potential of minorities and women. The\noverall result to be sought is equal opportunity in apprenticeship for all\nindividuals participating in or seeking entrance to the State's labor\nforce. (c) Outreach and positive\nrecruitment. An acceptable affirmative action plan must also include adequate\nprovision for outreach and positive recruitment that would reasonably be\nexpected to increase minority and female participation in apprenticeship by\nexpanding the opportunity of minorities and women to become eligible for\napprenticeship selection. In order to achieve these objectives, sponsors shall\nundertake activities such as those listed in this subdivision. It is not\ncontemplated that each sponsor necessarily will include all the listed\nactivities in its affirmative action program. The scope of the affirmative\naction program will depend on all the circumstances, including the size and\ntype of the program and its resources. However, the sponsor will be required to\nundertake a significant number of appropriate activities in order to enable it\nto meet its obligations under this Part. The affirmative action plan shall set\nforth the specific steps the sponsor intends to take in the areas listed in\nthis subdivision. (1)\n\nDissemination of\ninformation concerning the nature of the apprenticeship, requirements for\nadmission to apprenticeship, availability of apprenticeship opportunities, sources of apprenticeship applications, and the equal opportunity policy of the\nsponsor. For programs accepting applications only at specified intervals, such\ninformation shall be disseminated at least 30 days in advance of the earliest\ndate for application at each interval. For programs customarily receiving\napplications throughout the year, such information shall be regularly\ndisseminated but not less frequently than semiannually. Such information shall\nbe given to the commissioner, employment service offices, local schools, women's centers, outreach programs and community organizations which can\neffectively reach minorities and women, and shall be published in newspapers\nwhich are circulated in the minority community and among women, as well as in\nthe general areas in which the program sponsor operates. (2)\n\nParticipation in annual workshops\nconducted by employment service agencies for the purpose of familiarizing\nschool, employment service and other appropriate personnel with the\napprenticeship system and current opportunities therein. (3)\n\nCooperation with local school boards and\nvocational education systems to develop programs for preparing students to meet\nthe standards and criteria required to qualify for entry into apprenticeship\nprograms. (4)\n\nInternal\ncommunication of the sponsor's equal opportunity policy in such a manner as to\nfoster understanding, acceptance and support among the sponsor's various\nofficers, supervisors, employees and members and to encourage such persons to\ntake the necessary action to aid the sponsor in meeting its obligations under\nthis Part. (5)\n\nEngaging in programs\nsuch as outreach for the positive recruitment and preparation of potential\napplicants for apprenticeships; where appropriate and feasible, such programs\nshall provide for pretesting experience and training. If no such programs are\nin existence, the sponsor shall seek to initiate these programs. In initiating\nand conducting these programs, the sponsor may be required to work with other\nsponsors and appropriate community organizations. The sponsor shall also\ninitiate programs to prepare women and encourage women to enter traditionally\nmale programs. (6)\n\nTo encourage the\nestablishment and utilization of programs of preapprenticeship, preparatory\ntrade training or others designed to afford related work experience or to\nprepare candidates for apprenticeship, a sponsor shall make appropriate\nprovision in its affirmative action plan to assure that those who complete such\nprograms are afforded full and equal opportunity for admission into the\napprenticeship program. (7)\n\nUtilization of journeypersons to assist in the implementation of the sponsor's\naffirmative action program. (8)\n\nGranting advance standing or credit on the basis of previously acquired\nexperience, training, skills or aptitude for all applicants equally. (9)\n\nAdmitting to apprenticeship persons whose\nage exceeds the maximum age for admission to the program, where such action\nassists the sponsor in achieving its affirmative action obligations. (10)\n\nDevelop and submit to the State Division\nof Human Rights for approval, a plan to increase the employment of members of a\nminority group. Subdivision 12 of section 296 of the State Human Rights Law\npermits an employer, employment agency, labor organization or joint\nlabor-management committee to carry out a plan, approved by the Division of\n\nHuman Rights, to increase the employment of a minority group which has a\nstatewide unemployment rate that is disproportionately high in comparison with\nthe statewide unemployment rate of the general population. Any plan approved\nunder this measure must be in writing and the State Division of Human Rights'\napproval shall be for a limited period and may be rescinded at any time for\ngood cause. (11)\n\nOther appropriate\naction to ensure that the recruitment, selection, employment and training of\napprentices during apprenticeship shall be without discrimination because of\nage, race, color, religion, national origin, sex, disability or marital status; e.g., general publication of apprenticeship opportunities and advantages in\nadvertisements, industry reports, articles, etc.; use of present minority and\nfemale apprentices and journeypersons as recruiters; career counseling; periodic auditing of affirmative action programs and activities; and\ndevelopment of reasonable procedures between the sponsor and employers of\napprentices to ensure that employment opportunity is being granted, including\nreporting systems, on-site reviews, briefing sessions, etc. The affirmative\naction program shall set forth the specific steps the sponsor intends to take\nin the above areas, under this section. (d) Goals and timetables. (1)\nA sponsor adopting a selection method\nunder section\n600.6\n(b)(1)-(2)\nof this Part which, on the basis of the analysis described in subdivision (e)\nof this section, has deficiencies in terms of underutilization of minorities\nand/or women (minority and nonminority) in the craft or crafts represented by\nthe program shall include in its affirmative action plan percentage goals and\ntimetables for the admission of minority and/or female (minority and\nnonminority) applicants into the eligibility pool. (2)\nA sponsor adopting a selection method\nunder section\n600.6\n(b)(3)-(4)\nof this Part which, on the basis of the analysis described in subdivision (e)\nof this section, has deficiencies in terms of the underutilization of\nminorities and/or women in the craft or crafts represented by the program shall\ninclude in its affirmative action plan percentage goals and timetables for the\nselection of minority and female (minority and nonminority) applicants for the\napprenticeship program. (3)\n\nUnderutilization as used in this subdivision refers to the situation where\nthere are fewer minorities and/or women (minority and nonminority) in the\nparticular craft or crafts represented by the program than would reasonably be\nexpected in view of an analysis of the specific factors in subdivision (e) of\nthis section. Where, on the basis of the analysis, the sponsor determines that\nit has no deficiencies, no goals and timetables need be established. However, where no goals and timetables have been established, the affirmative action\nplan shall include a detailed explanation why no goals and timetables have been\nestablished. (4)\n\nWhere the sponsor\nfails to submit goals and timetables as part of its affirmative action plan or\nsubmits goals and timetables which are unacceptable, and the commissioner\ndetermines that the sponsor has deficiencies in terms of underutilization of\nminorities or women (minority and nonminority) within the meaning of this\nsection, the commissioner shall establish goals and timetables applicable to\nthe sponsor for the admission of minority and female (minority and nonminority)\napplicants into the eligibility pool or selection of apprentices, as\nappropriate. The sponsor shall make good faith efforts to attain these goals\nand timetables in accordance with the requirement of this section. (e) Analysis to determine if\ndeficiencies exist. The sponsor's determination as to whether goals and\ntimetables shall be established, shall be based on an analysis of at least the\nfollowing factors, which analysis shall be set forth in writing as part of the\naffirmative action plan: (1)\nthe size of the\nworking age minority and female (minority and nonminority) population in the\nprogram sponsor's labor market area; (2)\nthe size of the minority and female\n(minority and nonminority) labor force in the program sponsor's labor market\narea; (3)\nthe percentage of\nminority and female (minority and nonminority) participation as apprentices in\nthe particular craft as compared with the percentage of minorities and women\n(minority and nonminority) in the labor force in the program sponsor's labor\nmarket area; (4)\nthe percentage of\nminority and female (minority and nonminority) participation as journeypersons\nemployed by the employer or employers participating in the program as compared\nwith the percentage of minorities and women (minority and nonminority) in the\nsponsor's labor market area and the extent to which the sponsor should be\nexpected to correct any deficiencies through the achievement of goals and\ntimetables for the selection of apprentices; and\n(5)\nthe general availability of minorities\nand women (minority and nonminority) with present or potential capacity for\napprenticeship in the program sponsor's labor market area. (f) Establishment and attainment of goals and\ntimetables. The goals and timetables shall be established on the basis of the\nsponsor's analyses of its underutilization of minorities and women and its\nentire affirmative action program. A single goal for minorities and a separate\nsingle goal for women is acceptable unless a particular group is employed in a\nsubstantially disparate manner in which case separate goals shall be\nestablished for such group. Such separate goals would be required, for example, if a specific minority group of women were underutilized even though the\nsponsor had achieved its standards for women generally. In establishing the\ngoals, the sponsor should consider the results which could be reasonably\nexpected from its good faith efforts to make its overall affirmative action\nprogram work. Compliance with these requirements shall be determined by whether\nthe sponsor has met its goals within its timetables, or failing that, whether\nit has made good faith efforts to meet its goals and timetables. Its \"good\nfaith efforts\" shall be judged by whether it is following its affirmative\naction program and attempting to make it work, including evaluation and changes\nin its program where necessary to obtain the maximum effectiveness toward the\nattainment of its goals. However, in order to deal fairly with program\nsponsors, and with women who are entitled to protection under the goals and\ntimetables requirements, during the first 12 months after the effective date of\nthese regulations, the program sponsor would generally be expected to set a\ngoal for women for the entering year class at a rate which is not less than 50\npercent of the proportion women are of the workforce in the program sponsor's\nlabor market area and set a percentage goal for women in each class beyond the\nentering class which is not less than the participation rate of women currently\nin the preceding class. At the end of the first 12 months after the effective\ndate of these regulations, sponsors are expected to make appropriate\nadjustments in goal levels. (See section\n600.9\n[b]\nof this\n\nPart.)\n(g) Data and information. The commissioner shall make available to program sponsors data and information\non minority and female (minority and nonminority) labor force characteristics\nfor each standard metropolitan statistical area and for other special areas, as\nappropriate.
