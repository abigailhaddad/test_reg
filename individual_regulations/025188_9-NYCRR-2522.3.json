  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2522.3 - Fair market rent appeal and other applications for adjustment of initial legal regulated rent for housing accommodations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except as provided in section\n2521.1\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title, an appeal of the initial rent on the ground that it exceeds the\nfair market rent for the housing accommodation may be filed with the DHCR by\nthe tenant of a housing accommodation which was subject to the City Rent Law on\n\nDecember 31, 1973. This right is limited to the first tenant taking occupancy\non or after April 1, 1984, except where such tenant had vacated the housing\naccommodation prior to the service by the owner of the Notice of Initial Legal\n\nRegulated Rent as required by section\n2523.1\nof this Title. In such\nevent, any subsequent tenant in occupancy shall also have a right to file a\n\nFair Market Rent Appeal until the owner mails the required notice and 90 days\nshall have elapsed without the filing of an appeal by a tenant continuing in\noccupancy during said 90-day period. Once a Fair Market Rent Appeal is filed, no subsequent tenant may file such appeal. Notwithstanding the above, where the\nfirst tenant taking occupancy after December 31, 1973, of a housing\naccommodation previously subject to the City Rent Law, was served with the\nnotice required by section 26 of the former code of the Rent Stabilization\n\nAssociation of New York City, Inc., the time within which such tenant may file\na Fair Market Rent Appeal is limited to 90 days after such notice was mailed to\nthe tenant by the owner by certified mail. However, no Fair Market Rent Appeal\nmay be filed after six years from the date the housing accommodation was no\nlonger subject to the City Rent Law. (b) The tenant must allege in such appeal: (1)\nthat the initial rent is in excess of the\nfair market rent; and\n(2)\nfacts\nwhich, to the best of his or her information and belief, support such\nallegation. (c) Such\nappeal shall be dismissed where: (1)\nthe\nappeal is filed more than 90 days after the certified mailing to the tenant of\nthe Initial Apartment Registration, together with the Notice pursuant to\nsection\n2523.1\nof this Title; or\n(2)\nthe appeal is filed more than six years\nafter the vacancy which caused the housing accommodation to no longer be\nsubject to the City Rent Law. (d) (1)\n\nThe\norder shall direct the affected owner to make the refund of any excess rent to\nthe tenant in cash, check or money order, and to the extent the present owner\nis liable for all or any part of the refund, such present owner may credit such\nrefund against future rents over a period not in excess of six months. In the\nabsence of collusion between the present owner and any prior owner, where no\nrecords sufficient to establish the fair market rent were provided at a\njudicial sale, or such other sale effected in connection with, or to resolve, in whole or in part, a bankruptcy proceeding, mortgage foreclosure action or\nother judicial proceeding, an owner who purchases upon or subsequent to such\nsale shall not be liable for excess rent collected by any owner prior to such\nsale. An owner who did not purchase at such sale, but who purchased subsequent\nto such sale shall also not be liable for excess rent collected by any prior\nowner subsequent to such sale to the extent that such excess rent is the result\nof excess rent collected prior to such sale. If the refund exceeds the total\nrent due for six months, the tenant at his or her option may continue to abate\nhis or her rent until the refund is fully credited, or request the present\nowner to refund any balance outstanding at the end of such six-month\nperiod. (2)\n\nCourt-appointed\nreceivers. A receiver who is appointed by a court of competent jurisdiction to\nreceive rent for the use or occupation of a housing accommodation shall not, in\nthe absence of collusion or any relationship between such receiver and any\nowner or other receiver, be liable for excess rent collected by any owner or\nother receiver, where records sufficient to establish the fair market rent have\nnot been made available to such receiver. (e) In determining Fair Market Rent Appeals\nfiled pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, consideration shall be given\nto the applicable guidelines promulgated for such purposes by the Rent\n\nGuidelines Board and to rents generally prevailing for housing accommodations\nin buildings located in the same area as the housing accommodation involved. The rents for these comparable housing accommodations may be considered where\nsuch rents are: (1)\nunchallenged rents in\neffect for housing accommodations subject to this Code on the date the tenant\nfiling the appeal took occupancy; or\n(2)\nat the owner's option, market rents in\neffect for other comparable housing accommodations on the date the tenant\nfiling the appeal took occupancy, as submitted by the owner. (f) (1)\n\nExcept as provided in section\n2521.1\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis code, the landlord or tenant of a housing accommodation made subject to\nthis Code by the ETPA may, within 60 days of the date the housing accommodation\nbecame subject to the ETPA or the commencement of the first tenancy thereafter, file an application on forms prescribed by the DHCR to adjust the initial legal\nregulated rent on the grounds that the presence of unique or peculiar\ncircumstances materially affecting the legal regulated rent has resulted in a\nrent which is substantially different from the rents generally prevailing in\nthe same area for substantially similar housing accommodations. (2)\n\nThe DHCR may grant an appropriate\nadjustment of the initial legal regulated rent upon finding that such grounds\ndo exist, provided that the adjustment shall not result in a legal regulated\nrent substantially different from the legal regulated rents generally\nprevailing in the same area for substantially similar housing\naccommodations. (3)\n\nAny such\nadjustment shall consider, in addition to the factors contained in section\n2522.3\n(f)(2), the\nequities involved and the general limitations required by section\n2522.7\nof this title. (4)\n\nPrevious regulation of the rent for the\nhousing accommodation under the PHFL or any other State or Federal law shall\nnot, in and of itself, constitute a unique and peculiar circumstance within the\nmeaning of this subdivision. Any change in economic circumstances arising as a\nconsequence of the termination of such prior regulation of rent may only be\naddressed in a proceeding for adjustment of the legal regulated rent under\nsubdivisions (c) and (d) of section\n2522.4\nof this code.
