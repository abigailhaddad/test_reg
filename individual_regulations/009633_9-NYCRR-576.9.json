(b) The deputy\ndirector-regulatory programs shall have authority to determine whether a\nrequest to amend a variance involves a material change in variance conditions, the applicable law, environmental conditions or technology since the date of\nissuance of the variance, and to issue an amended variance for, or deny, those\nrequests that do not involve a material change. The deputy director-regulatory\nprograms may require additional information pertaining to any amendment\nrequest, and any applicable time period shall not begin to run until such\ninformation has been provided. (c) Any request to amend a variance which may involve a material change shall be\ntreated as an application for a new variance, except that a request to amend a\ncondition of a variance without any change in the project proposal, applicable\nlaw or environmental conditions or technology may be treated by the agency as a\nrequest for reconsideration and governed by section\n572.22\nof this Title. In the case\nof a request which is treated as a new application, the parties to any public\nhearing previously held on the variance shall be notified of such\nrequest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
