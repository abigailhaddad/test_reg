Tit. 18 § 502.5 - Time and manner of disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The information specified in section\n502.4\nof this Part must be\nprovided upon application for enrollment and annually thereafter to the\ndepartment. Except where the provider is certified on an other than annual\nbasis, the disclosure requirement may coincide with the\ncertification/recertification period. Where the provider discloses the\nownership and control information for the purposes of Medicare\ncertification/recertification, such disclosures will be deemed to satisfy these\ndisclosure requirements.

Failure to report any change in ownership\nor control or change of a managing employee, may result in the termination of\nthe disclosing entity's provider agreement and require the newly constituted\nentity to enroll as a new provider.
