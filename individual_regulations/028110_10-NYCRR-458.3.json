  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 458.3 - Other than salaries and wages\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employee benefits. The costs of employee benefits are charged directly to the\nappropriate functional reporting center. If such benefits are charged initially\nto an employee benefits account, they must be assigned to appropriate\nfunctional reporting centers at year-end prior to cost finding. Reference: section\n452.4\n(a)(1)(ii). Specific classifications for employee benefits follow: (1)\n\nEmployee Uniform Allowance; (2)\nFICA; (3)\n\nState Unemployment and Federal\n\nUnemployment Insurance; (4)\n\nGroup\n\nHealth Insurance; (5)\n\nPension and\n\nRetirement--Union; (6)\n\nWorkers'\nCompensation Insurance; (7)\n\nPension\nand Retirement--Nonunion; (8)\n\nDisability; (9)\n\nOther Employee\n\nBenefits; (10)\n\nUnion Health and\n\nWelfare; and\n(11)\n\nEmployee Meal\n\nAllowance. (b) Fees. The\nfees and other amounts paid for professional services of people who are not on\nthe facility's payroll are included in the following classifications: (1)\n\nAdministrative Fees--Long-Term\n\nDebt; (2)\n\nPhysicians' Fees. Included in this classification are all fees paid to nonsalaried physicians for\npatient care and supervisory activities, and other professional fees for\nservice; (3)\n\nTherapists and Other\n(Nonphysicians); (4)\n\nConsulting and\n\nManagement Services; (5)\n\nLegal\n\nServices; (6)\n\nAuditing\n\nServices; (7)\n\nRegistered\n\nNurses; (8)\n\nLicensed Practical\n\nNurses; (9)\n\nPrivate Duty Nurses'\nFees; and\n(10)\n\nOther\n\nFees. (c) Supplies and\nmaterials. The following classifications are used to report the costs of the\nvarious supplies used by a residential health care facility. The fair market\nvalue of donated supplies is included in these classifications if the commodity\nwould otherwise be purchased by the facility. An offsetting amount would be\nincluded in the reporting level Other Operating Revenue, Donated Commodities, section\n453.3\n(i)(2)(xxi)\nof this Article. (1)\n\nDisposable\n\nLinen; (2)\n\nPrescription Drugs. Include in this classification the cost of all drugs for which a prescription\nwould be required if purchased at an outside pharmacy; (3)\n\nMedicine Cabinet Drugs. Include in this\nclassification the cost of all drugs that could be purchased without a\nprescription; (4)\n\nOther Medical\n\nCare Materials and Supplies. Include in this classification the cost of all\nmedical materials and supplies used in direct patient care; (5)\n\nDietary--Food. Include in this\nclassification all food purchased by the facility; (6)\n\nDietary--Other. Include in this\nclassification all dietary supplies other than food; (7)\n\nLinen and Bedding; (8)\n\nCleaning Supplies; (9)\n\nOffice and Administrative\n\nSupplies; (10)\n\nEmployee Wearing\n\nApparel; (11)\n\nInstruments and Minor\n\nMedical Equipment; (12)\n\nMinor\n\nNonmedical Equipment; and\n(13)\n\nOther Supplies and Materials. Include in this classification the cost of\nnonmedical supplies not included elsewhere. Include the cost of miscellaneous\nsupplies used for the personal care of patients. (d) Purchased and contracted services. These\nclassifications are provided to report the costs of purchased or contracted\nservices. For instance, if the laboratory function is contracted outside the\nresidential health care facility, the expense would be classified Contracted\n\nServices, in the laboratory functional reporting center. If, however, a minor\nservice such as exterior painting were purchased outside the residential health\ncare facility, the expense would be classified Repairs and\n\nMaintenance--Purchased Services-- Nonassignable. The difference between the\npurchased and contracted classification lies in the magnitude of the service\nprovided by outsiders. Note that because the service rendered (exterior\npainting) benefited the entire facility and, therefore, is not directly\nassignable to a specific functional reporting center (other than the Plant\n\nOperation and Maintenance functional reporting center), the cost of the service\nis classified Repairs and Maintenance--Purchased Services--Nonassignable. In\nthose instances where outside repairs and maintenance can be directly assigned\nto a specific functional reporting center, e.g., the repair of a piece of\nlaundry equipment, the cost must be classified Repairs and\n\nMaintenance--Purchased Services-- Directly Assignable. (1)\n\nRepairs and Maintenance--Purchased\n\nServices--Nonassignable. Include in this classification purchased repair and\nmaintenance services not directly assignable to a specific functional reporting\ncenter other than the Plant Operation and Maintenance functional reporting\ncenter; (2)\n\nRepairs and\n\nMaintenance--Purchased Services--Directly Assignable. Include in this\nclassification purchased repair and maintenance services that are directly\nassignable to a functional reporting center other than the Plant Operation and\n\nMaintenance functional reporting center; (3)\n\nMedical--Purchased Services; (4)\n\nManagement Services; (5)\n\nCollection Services; (6)\n\nOther Purchased Services; and\n(7)\n\nContracted Services. (e) Depreciation, leases and rentals. (1)\n\nDepreciation and Amortization; (2)\n\nRental or Lease--Land; (3)\n\nRental or Lease--Buildings; (4)\n\nRental or Lease--Fixed equipment; and\n(5)\n\nRental or Lease--Movable\nequipment. (f) Other\ndirect expenses. (1)\n\nElectricity; (2)\n\nGas; (3)\n\nWater and Sewer; (4)\n\nFuel Oil #2; (5)\n\nFuel Oil #4; (6)\n\nFuel Oil #6; (7)\n\nOther Utilities. Include in this\nclassification steam, coal and all other utilities; (8)\n\nInsurance; (9)\n\nInterest. Include in this classification\nall interest expense of the facility; (10)\n\nLicenses and Taxes (other than Income\n\nTaxes); (11)\n\nTelephone and\n\nTelegraph; (12)\n\nDues to Nursing\n\nHome Associations; (13)\n\nPrinting, Duplicating, Microfilming; (14)\n\nTravel, Conferences, Workshops; (15)\n\nBooks, Periodicals, Etc.; and\n(16)\n\nOther Direct Expenses. (g) Assessments from\nmunicipalities, religious or educational foundations, or other associations.
