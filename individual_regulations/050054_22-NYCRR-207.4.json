  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 207.4 - Papers filed in court; clerk's file number; official forms\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless otherwise specified\nby the court, attorneys, as well as parties appearing without attorneys, shall\nprepare and submit all papers, pleadings, orders and decrees to be acted upon\nby the Surrogate. The party causing the first paper to be filed shall\ncommunicate the clerk's file number forthwith to all other parties to the\nproceeding; service of the citation bearing the file number shall be\nsufficient. Thereafter such number shall appear on the outside cover and first\npage to the right of the caption of every paper tendered for filing in the\nproceeding. The caption also shall contain the title of the proceeding, an\nindication of the county of venue and a brief description of the nature of the\npaper. All papers shall comply with the provisions of CPLR 2101 and (other than\nwills, codicils, exhibits and forms of other governmental agencies) shall be on\nstandard 81/2 inch by 11-inch paper. The text of all papers must be legible\nand, other than prompts and instructions, must be in a standard typeface of 10\nto 12-point characters and have margins that shall be no less than one-half\ninch. Papers also shall contain the name of the attorney or party submitting\nthem and, whenever possible, the names, addresses and information regarding\nparties to the proceeding shall be printed in bold typeface. (b) The forms set forth in\n\nChapter VII of Subtitle D of this Title, designated \"Surrogate Court Forms,\"\nand including forms for the Surrogate's Court and adoption forms of the Family\n\nCourt and Surrogate's Court, shall be the official forms of the court and shall\nbe accepted for filing pursuant to SCPA 106. Forms produced on computers or\nword processors shall be accepted for filing, provided (1) the text used shall\nbe the same as that contained in the official forms and (2) the attorney or\nparty preparing such form shall certify at the end thereof that the form is the\nsame as the official form and that the substantive text has not been altered. Persons submitting such forms may leave out instructions (contained in\nbrackets) and optional words or phrases that have not been selected or are\nirrelevant. Submitting a form to be an official form, but upon which the text\nhas been intentionally altered to change the substance or meaning thereof, may\nbe regarded as an attempt to mislead the court. (c) Examples of the official forms shall\nbe available at the clerk's office of any Surrogate's Court. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
