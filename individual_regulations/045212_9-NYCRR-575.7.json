  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 575.7 - Application of sewage system setback restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any seepage pit, drainage field or other\nleaching facility receiving any form of household effluent, regardless of\nwhether it receives toilet wastes, is subject to the sewage disposal system\nsetback restrictions. (b) Any\nouthouse privy or other pit privy which is not a self-contained system is\nsubject to the sewage disposal system setback restrictions. (c) Any lawfully existing onsite wastewater\ntreatment system which is in non-conformance with the agency shoreline setback\nrequirements, when proposed to be replaced, must be replaced in conformance\nwith the setback requirements to the greatest extent possible, and in any case, no closer to the mean high water mark. No variance will be required for a\nreplacement system which meets this requirement and which will also provide\nenhanced treatment over the lawfully existing system as determined by the\nagency, provided such system is not also being expanded to meet an actual or\npotential occupancy increase. (d) Any proposed expansion of a non-conforming onsite wastewater treatment system\ndesigned to service an actual or potential increase in occupancy of the\nshoreline structure served must meet all existing standards for such systems, including the shoreline setback requirements. Otherwise, a variance will be\nrequired for the system expansion. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n575.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
