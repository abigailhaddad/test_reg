  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-1.5 - Modifications\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe accounting procedures set forth in this Subchapter\nare designed to be as flexible as possible to fit a State-wide program\nparticipated in by local agencies, some of which represent extremes in size and\norganization. Under the circumstances, modifications of or supplements to this\n\nSubchapter will be inevitable and will follow from time to time. Until such\nmodification or supplements are issued, however, it is requested that no\ndeviation be made from the mandatory procedures prescribed without the prior\nwritten approval of the Division of Housing. With respect to non-mandatory\nprocedures, modifications may be made by the local agency as described in\nsection\n1640-1.4, above. Refinements in\nthis Subchapter can come only in the light of the experience gained in the\napplication to the operations of the various local agencies. Comments and\nsuggestions intended to clarify and simplify the material and procedures are\nsolicited from the local agencies and others who have occasion to use or refer\nto this Subchapter in their work. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
