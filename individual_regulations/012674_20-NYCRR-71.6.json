A determination as to whether a\nlicense should be cancelled or suspended and the duration of suspension will be\nmade by the department on the basis of the circumstances in each case. The\ndepartment may, in its discretion, continue such license upon such terms and\nconditions as it may deem necessary for the protection of the revenue under\narticle 20 of the Tax Law and the cigarette marketing standards contained in\narticle 20-A of such law. (b) (1)\n\nGenerally, a license as a cigarette agent\nwill not be cancelled nor suspended unless the agent has had an opportunity for\na hearing prior to such action (see subdivision [c] of this section for\nexceptions). A license may be cancelled or suspended upon a licensee's: (i) failure to file, deposit or maintain in\nfull force and effect the credit bond or other acceptable security, or increase\nthe amount thereof, as required by the Department of Taxation and Finance (if\nsuch agent has elected and has been approved by the department to purchase\ncigarette stamps on credit); (ii)\nfailure to comply with any of the provisions of article 20 or article 20-A of\nthe Tax law or any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto (see also\narticle 2 of this Subchapter); or\n(iii)\nknowingly aiding and abetting another\nperson in violating any of the provisions of such articles or of such rules or\nregulations. (2)\nA\nlicense as a cigarette agent may also be cancelled or suspended if it is\ndetermined that the licensee or any controlling person as defined in section\n71.5\nof this\n\nPart: (i) has committed fraud or deceit in\noperating the cigarette agency or has committed fraud or deceit in procuring a\nlicense as a cigarette agent; (ii)\nhas been convicted in a court of competent jurisdiction, either within or\nwithout the State of New York, of a felony bearing on the licensee's duties and\nobligations under any article of the Tax Law; (iii)\nhas impersonated any person represented\nto be a cigarette agent pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law but who has in\nfact not been so licensed; or\n(iv)\nhas knowingly aided and abetted the sale of cigarettes by a person which such\nlicensee or controlling person knows has not been licensed as a cigarette agent\nby the Department of Taxation and Finance and who is conducting activities as\nsuch an agent. (c) A license as a cigarette agent may be\ncancelled or suspended prior to a hearing if the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance believes that the assessment or collection of any tax imposed by\narticle 20 of the Tax Law will be jeopardized by the delay of such cancellation\nor suspension. (d) If a cigarette\nagent's license is cancelled or suspended, such former agent or suspended agent\nis prohibited from conducting any activities as a cigarette agent in New York\n\nState. Upon notice of cancellation or suspension, a former or suspended agent\nmust immediately surrender its certificates of license as a cigarette agent to\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance. Immediately following the effective\ndate of cancellation or suspension any taxes outstanding, including taxes not\nyet due, pursuant to article 20 of the Tax Law must be paid in full and any\nappropriate returns or reports must be filed with the department.
