  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.22 - Fittings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe flanges of all valves and pipe\nfittings of cast iron or steel shall conform to the American National Standards\naccepted by ASME. Note: Flange bolts or bolt studs shall conform to a standard\naccepted by ASME and the bolts or bolt studs shall extend completely through\nthe nut. (Where the word \"fittings\" is used, it is understood that pipe\nfittings are meant and it does not include, other types.)\n(2)\n\nAll valves and fittings shall be marked\nas required by ASME. (3)\n\nRolled or\nforged flanges may be in accordance with the requirements of ASME. (4)\n\nValves and other boiler appurtenances, such as water columns, may have fusion-welded joints provided the welding\nprocedure and welding operator are qualified under the requirements of ASME\nexcept that no stress-relieving, radiographic examination, or inspection of the\njoint is required. The manufacturer shall furnish, if requested, a statement\ncertifying that these requirements have been met. (b) The minimum pressure and temperature\nrating for all valves and fittings in steam, feedwater, blowoff, and\nmiscellaneous piping shall be equal to the pressure and temperature specified\nby ASME for the connected piping on the side that has the higher pressure, except that in no case shall the pressure be less than 100 psi, and for\npressures not exceeding 100 psi in feedwater and blowoff service, the valves\nand fittings shall be equal at least to the requirements of the American\n\nNational Standards for class 125 cast iron or class 150 steel accepted by\nASME. (c) (1)\n\nAll valves and fittings on all feedwater\npiping from the boiler up to and including the first stop valve and the check\nvalve shall be equal at least to the requirements of any Standard accepted by\nASME for a pressure exceeding the maximum allowable working pressure of the\nboiler by either 25 percent or 225 psi, whichever is the lesser. (2)\n\nAll valves and fittings for feedwater\npiping between the required check valve and the globe or regulating valve, when\nrequired by ASME and including any by-pass piping up to and including the\nshutoff valves in the by pass, shall be equal at least to the requirements of\nany Standard accepted by ASME for a pressure rating equal to the expected\noperating pressure required to feed the boiler. (3)\n\nValves and fittings made of any material\npermitted by this Part for pressure ratings of 125 pounds or more and marked as\nrequired may be used for feed line and blowoff service up to 80 percent of the\nrated pressure, except where certain materials are specified, and in no case\nshall they be used for temperatures exceeding that permitted by ASME. (d) (1)\n\nIn all cases the scheduled working\npressure (primary service pressure rating) for American National Standard steel\nfittings or valves accepted by ASME may be used for maximum saturated steam\npressures (and for feed and blowoff services at pressures not to exceed the\nadjusted maximum allowable working pressure) as given in Table P-15, provided\nthat all pressure retaining parts of the valves are suitable for the pressure\nat which they are to be used. (2)\n\nValves and fittings of steel construction otherwise complying with the\nrequirements of ASME, but having butt welding ends, may be rated at the\npressure stated in Table P-15, provided also that all parts of the valves are\nsuitable for the pressure at which they are used. (3)\n\nWhen the service requirements exceed the\npermissible values given in Table P-15, the requirement of the Code will be met\nif the bolting material, flange, and/or body thicknesses are increased so that\nthe deflection limits are no greater and the factor of safety is at least that\nof the nearest pressure rating class in Table P-15. (e) Screwed fittings of cast iron or\nmalleable iron conforming to the requirements of the Standards for 125, 150, 250, and 300 pounds pressure accepted by ASME may be used except where\notherwise specifically prohibited. They shall not be used for temperatures over\n450° Fahrenheit. (f) Cast- or\nforged-steel screwed fittings or valves that are at least equal to the strength\nrequirements of ASME which would otherwise be required may be used in all cases\nexcept where flanged fittings are specifically required. (g) Brass or bronze screwed or flanged-type\nfittings or valves may be used provided they are least equal to the strength\nrequirements of ASME for cast-iron fittings which would otherwise be required. The materials shall comply with ASME specifications SB-61 and SB-62 with\nmaximum temperatures allowed of 550º Fahrenheit for SB-61 and 406º\nFahrenheit for SB-62. Brass or bronze shall not be used where steel or other\nmaterial is specifically required. Screwed type fittings shall not be used\nwhere flange types are specified.

Adjusted pressure ratings for Steel Valves\n(Standard Class) for steam service at saturation temperature corresponding to\nthe pressure, derived from Tables 1 and 2-1.1A, using material group 1.1 of\nANSI B16.34-1981. For other materials or design temperatures exceeding\nsaturation temperature, see ANSI B16.5-1981 and ANSI B16.34-1981 for\npressure-temperature limitations. The pressure listed is rounded to the nearest\n5 psi. (2)\n\nPressures shown include\nthe factor for boiler feed and blowoff line service, corrected for line design\ntemperature, as required by ANSI/ASME B31.1. The pressure listed is rounded to\nthe nearest 5 psi. (3)\n\nRating\nexceeds critical pressure of water. (4)\n\nThe pressure-temperature ratings provided\nherein apply to the flange and do not necessarily reflect the rating of the\nassembled flange joint. The pressure-temperature ratings provided apply to the\ngasketed and bolted flange joint only when the gasket and studs conform to the\nrecommendations of ANSI B16.5-1981. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.22\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
