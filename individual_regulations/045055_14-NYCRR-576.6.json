Tit. 14 § 576.6 - Standards pertaining to reserved bed days\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of reserving a bed and making\npayment for the days for which a bed is reserved is to make provision for the\ncontinued availability of services in the same residential treatment facility\nfor residents who are temporarily hospitalized or who are on leave of absence\nfor a therapy day. A bed may be reserved only for a resident who has been\nresiding in the residential treatment facility for at least 15 consecutive days\nsince the resident's current initial admission to the residential treatment\nfacility. (1)\nA bed may be reserved for a\nresident who is temporarily hospitalized for medical or psychiatric care if the\nfollowing conditions are met: (i) The resident\nis admitted to a hospital, other than a residential treatment facility, which\nis currently licensed or otherwise authorized to operate pursuant to the laws\nof the jurisdiction in which the hospital is located. (ii)\n\nThe resident is expected, on the day of\nadmission to the hospital, to return to the residential treatment facility in\nno more than 15 calendar days. (iii)\n\nThe residential treatment facility\nnotifies the hospital by telephone, and confirms in writing in accordance with\nprocedures prescribed by the Office of Mental Health, that the resident's bed\nis being reserved and that the hospital must notify the residential treatment\nfacility during the period that the bed is being reserved of any change in the\nresident's condition which affects the date of discharge. (a) On or before the morning of the fourth\nday of hospital care, the hospital shall notify the residential treatment\nfacility of the resident's anticipated discharge date. (b) If following the 3rd day and before the\n16th day of temporary hospitalization, it becomes necessary to adjust the\nplanned discharge date as a result of either a change in the resident's\ncondition or the availability of additional clinical information, the hospital\nshall immediately advise the residential treatment facility by\ntelephone. (iv)\n\nThe bed\nreservation shall be extended under the following conditions: (a) For a resident temporarily hospitalized\nfor medical care the bed reservation shall be extended for up to five\nadditional days, if granting such extension will permit the resident to return\nto the residential treatment facility within 20 days of the date of admission\nto the hospital. (b) For a resident\ntemporarily hospitalized for psychiatric care the bed reservation shall be\nextended for up to 15 additional days, if granting such extension will permit\nthe resident to return to the residential treatment facility within 30 days of\nthe date of admission to the hospital. (v) Payment for reserved bed days for\ntemporary hospitalization shall be requested as follows: (a) When reserved bed days do not exceed 15\ndays for any single hospital stay and the resident returns immediately to the\nresidential treatment facility payment may be requested without prior\nauthorization. (b) When a bed\nreservation has been extended in accordance with clause (iv) (a) or (b) of this\nparagraph, and the resident returns immediately to the residential treatment\nfacility, the residential treatment facility must request prior authorization\nfrom the Office of Mental Health to request payment for the actual period the\nbed was reserved. (vi)\n\nThe bed reservation shall be terminated under the following conditions: (a) If the planned discharge date determined\nduring the first 3 days of hospitalization is more than 15 days from the day of\nadmission to the hospital, the bed reservation shall be terminated. (b) If the planned discharge date determined\nfollowing the third day of temporary hospitalization is more than 15 days from\nthe day of admission to the hospital or, more than 20 days for medical care or\nmore than 30 days for psychiatric care for bed reservations extended in\naccordance with clause (iv)(a) or (b) of this paragraph, the bed reservation\nshall be terminated. (c) If the\nresident is discharged from the hospital and does not return to the residential\ntreatment facility, the bed reservation shall be terminated on the day the\nresident is discharged from the hospital. (vii)\n\nAll of the above provisions in this\nparagraph are subject to a vacancy rate of no more than 5% or 2 vacant beds, whichever is greater, on the first day of resident's hospitalization from\neither the residential treatment facility or the distinct unit of the\nresidential treatment facility, to which the resident is expected to return. A\ndistinct unit will require specific admission criteria listed on the\nresidential treatment facility's operating certificate but will not require a\nseparate reimbursement rate for the unit. When computing a vacancy rate, the\nRTF must disregard beds that have been reserved for other patients. (2)\nA bed may be reserved for a\nresident who is on a leave of absence for a therapy day if the following\nconditions are met: (i) The residential\ntreatment facility has written policies and procedures governing leaves of\nabsence for therapy days. Such policies and procedures are subject to the\napproval of the Office of Mental Health. (ii)\n\nThe leave of absence for a therapy day\nis in conformance with such policies and procedures. (iii)\n\nThe leave of absence for a therapy day\nis provided for in the resident's individual treatment plan. (iv)\n\nThe number of days for which a bed is\nreserved for any individual whether she/he is a resident in one or more\nresidential treatment facility does not exceed 75 days in any 12-month\nperiod. (v) The resident is not\nadmitted to a hospital, other medical facility or another residential treatment\nfacility. (vi)\n\nThe resident returns\nfrom the leave of absence for a therapy day and is not discharged within 24\nhours of return. (3)\nA\nbed may not be reserved as a direct result of a labor dispute occurring within\nthe residential treatment facility. (b) Certain requirements of this section may\nbe waived by the Office of Mental Health. (1)\nA request for a waiver must be submitted to the office and must justify the\nneed for waiver and include such other information or documentation as the\n\nOffice of Mental Health may require. (2)\n\nThe Office of Mental Health may grant a\nrequest for waiver of a requirement if it determines that the request is\nappropriate and reasonable and that the waiver of the request is in the best\ninterests of the resident and the residential treatment facility. (3)\n\nThe circumstances in which waiver of a\nrequirement may be requested are as follows: (i) The requirement that a bed may be\nreserved only for a resident who has been residing in the residential treatment\nfacility for at least 15 consecutive days (see subdivision (a) of this\nsection). (ii)\n\nThe disallowance of a\nbed reservation for a resident who is discharged while on a leave of absence\nfor a therapy day or within 24 hours of return may be waived if the discharge\nwas not anticipated on the day of departure from the residential treatment\nfacility and at the time of discharge the resident is determined to no longer\nbe in need of residential treatment facility services (see subparagraph\n(a)(2)(vii) of this section). (c) Special limits, subject to the approval\nof the State Commissioner of Social Services, may be established on an\nindividual basis, based on the recommendation of the Office of Mental Health. The circumstances in which the application of special limits may be requested\nare as follows: (1)\n\nThe limit of 20 calendar\ndays for a resident who is temporarily hospitalized for medical care may be\nextended if such extension is expected to permit the resident to return to the\nresidential treatment facility (see clause [a][1][iv][a ] of this\nsection). (2)\n\nThe limit of 30\ncalendar days for a resident who is temporarily hospitalized for psychiatric\ncare may be extended if such extension is expected to permit the resident to\nreturn to the residential treatment facility (see clause [a][1][iv][ b] of this\nsection). (d) The\n\nCommissioner of Mental Health may waive any of the standards pertaining to\nreserved bed cays in individual cases under special conditions except those\nstandards requiring the approval of the Commissioner of Social Services as\nprovided for in subdivision (c) of this section.
