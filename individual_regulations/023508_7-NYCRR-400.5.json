Tit. 7 § 400.5 - Commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn eligible person occupying a business, farm operation or a\nnonprofit organization will be reimbursed for actual, reasonable and necessary\nmoving expenses, actual reasonable and necessary expenses in searching for a\nreplacement site and actual direct losses of tangible personal property in\nmoving or discontinuing the operation or activity. (a) The eligible person shall notify the\ndepartment eight weeks prior to the starting date of the move of his definite\nintentions regarding the manner and method of moving. At the option of the\ndepartment, personnel of the department may conduct an inventory of personal\nproperty and merchandise to be moved, including a description of each phase of\nthe work to be performed and an explanation of any unusual or peculiar\ncircumstances that will be pertinent to arriving at a comprehensive cost of\nmoving figure. The address of the appropriated property, address the eligible\nperson is moving to and the approximate distance between is to be included\ntherein. This inventory is to be signed by the eligible person and is to be\nsupplied to all estimators and bidders for each phase of the work and they are\nto base their estimates and bids on removal of the items listed therein. The\noccupant may at his own expense, obtain competitive bids on the costs of moving\nand may submit a competitive self-move bid on all or a portion of the\nremoval. (b) Actual costs must be\ndocumented upon receipted, detailed bills from recognized movers, skilled\ncraftsmen and are not to exceed the total of the lowest acceptable bids or\nestimates obtained on each phase of the move. (c) Estimates and bids on each phase of the\nmove shall be obtained by the department from generally recognized, qualified\nmovers and skilled craftsmen. Upon receipt and review of all estimates and\nbids, the department will determine the lowest acceptable bid. This bid will be\nsent to the eligible person advising him to commence moving and setting forth\nthe limits of reimbursement and the time and manner in which payment will be\nmade. After the removal has been accomplished actual costs must be documented\nby detailed, receipted bills from recognized movers, skilled craftsmen and are\nnot to exceed the approved amount based on a total of the lowest acceptable\nbids or estimates obtained on each phase of the move. All bids from movers and\ncraftsmen must be submitted in accordance with section\n400.6\nof this Part. (d) In the case of a\nself move the eligible person may at the option of the department be paid an\namount to be negotiated by the State not to exceed the lower of two firm bids\nor estimates obtained by the department from qualified moving firms. In the\ncase of a self move performed by the eligible person, his family and others not\nnormally in the moving business, the move must be in compliance with all\napplicable State and Federal laws. All charges must be detailed in the form of\na summary affidavit. (e) When\npersonal property which is used in connection with the business to be moved is\nof low value and high bulk and the estimated cost of moving would be\ndisproportionate in relation to the value, the State may negotiate with the\nowner for an amount not to exceed the difference between the cost of\nreplacement of comparable item(s) on the market and the amount which would\nprobably have been received for the item(s) on liquidation, but such amount may\nnot exceed the reasonable costs of moving these items. (f) All books and records kept by eligible\npersons shall be subject to review and audit by a State representative during\nreasonable business hours. (g) Payment of moving expenses is based upon the preapproval of estimates and bids\nsubmitted to the department before commencing the move. If, due to\nextraordinary circumstances a move is completed without submitting necessary\nbids, the commissioner may, upon receipt of sufficient written justification\nfor failure to submit estimates, pay reasonable and necessary actual expenses\nupon verification and support for the expenses incurred.
