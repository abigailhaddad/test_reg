Tit. 9 § 4081.3 - Bred back in New York State\n\nState Regulations\n\nTo qualify as having been bred back in New York, a\nmare, after foaling in New York State, shall remain in New York for a minimum\nof 90 consecutive days after arrival. During such applicable period, such mare\nshall be booked exclusively to and serviced exclusively by a registered New\n\nYork sire. Should such mare fail to be so certified as in foal during such\nperiod, it may be taken from the State after that minimum 90-consecutive-day\nperiod and be deemed \"bred back\" provided it is not serviced by a nonregistered\n\nNew York sire thereafter in the year. Should such mare die or otherwise become\nmedically unfit for breeding during or after foaling, it shall be considered\n\"bred back\" if such mare had been booked for service to a registered New York\nstallion in such year and, if alive, was not serviced by a nonregistered New\n\nYork sire thereafter during such year or the following year.
