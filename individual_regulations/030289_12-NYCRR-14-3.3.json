  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-3.3 - General rules for alterations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Authorization. (1)\n\nAlterations to boilers, with the exception of rerating, shall be performed in accordance with the\n\nNational Board Inspection Code. (2)\n\nAn organization holding only a National Board or New York State Repair\n\nCertificate of Authorization may do alterations provided the design changes\ninvolved are certified by the holder of an appropriate ASME Code Symbol Stamp\nand Certificate of Authorization and such changes are verified by the ASME Code\n\nStamp holder's authorized inspector. (3)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of\nthis section, alterations to boilers shall be performed by an organization that\nholds an ASME Code Symbol Stamp listed in the same section of the ASME Code as\nthe code symbol on the boiler to be altered. The work involved in the\nalteration must be within the scope of the ASME Code Symbol Stamp holder's\n\nCertificate of Authorization. (b) Stamping or nameplate attachment to\naltered boilers. (1)\n\nAuthorization. The\nstamping of, or attaching of a nameplate to, an altered (including rerated)\nboiler in accordance with the National Board Inspection Code shall indicate\nthat the alteration was carried out in compliance with the requirements of this\n\nCode. Such stamping or attaching of a nameplate shall be done only with the\nknowledge and authorization of the inspector. The organization responsible for\ncompleting the Report of Alteration, shall also be responsible for marking by\nmeans of a nameplate or stamping on the boiler as shown and in a location\nindicated in Figure 14-3(a). (2)\nASME Code Symbol Stamp. Altered boilers shall not be restamped with the ASME\nCode Symbol Stamp. (3)\n\nRemoval of\noriginal stamping or nameplate. When an alteration requires removal of that\npart of a boiler containing the ASME Code stamping, the authorized inspector\nshall, subject to the approval of the jurisdiction, witness the making of a\nfacsimile of stamping, the obliteration of the old stamping and the transfer of\nthe stamping to the new part. When the stamping is on a nameplate the inspector\nis to witness the transfer of the nameplate to the new part. Any relocation\nshall be described on the Report of Alteration. The Code Symbol is not to be\nrestamped. (c) Documentation of alterations. (1)\n\nThe Welded\n\nRepair/Alteration Report is a dual purpose form that shall be used for\ndocumenting either repairs or alterations, unless otherwise specified in this\n\nCode or by the National Board Inspection Code. For purposes of this Code, when\nsuch form is used to document alterations, it is referred to as the Report of\n\nAlteration. (2)\n\nPreparation of the\nreport of alteration. The Report of Alteration, indicating the changes that\nhave been made, shall be prepared and distributed in accordance with section\n14-3.20\n(c) of\nthis Subpart for each alteration of a boiler as described below: (i) Where the alteration involves rerating\nwith no physical change in the boiler, the Report of Alteration shall be\nprepared by the original manufacturer or the holder of a valid ASME Certificate\nof Authorization described in the National Board Inspection Code. The\nmanufacturer's authorized inspector shall indicate acceptance of the design\nchange on the Report of Alteration. Where such preparation cannot be obtained\nfrom this source, the Report of Alteration shall be prepared by a registered\nprofessional engineer with verification by the authorized inspection agency\nresponsible for the inservice inspection of the object. In each instance\nrevised calculations shall accompany the Report of Alteration, and all such\ndocumentation shall be subject to the acceptance by the jurisdiction. (ii)\n\nWhere the alteration involves a rerating\nwhere a physical change has been made to the boiler, the documentation in\nsubdivision (a) of this section shall be accompanied by a Report of Alteration, prepared by the holder of the ASME Certificate of Authorization who performed\nthe alteration and shall be verified by his inspector. (iii)\n\nWhere an alteration is made without\nrerating the boiler, the Report of Alteration shall be prepared by the holder\nof the ASME Certificate of Authorization who performed the alteration and shall\nbe verified by his inspector. (3)\nA copy of the original manufacturer's\ndata report and any required manufacturer's partial data reports shall be a\npart of the completed report of alteration and shall be attached thereto. Where\nthe manufacturer's data report is unavailable, documentation acceptable to the\ndepartment shall be submitted. (d) Test. A pressure test as required for new\nconstruction shall be applied to the boiler after the alteration has been\ncompleted, at a pressure of at least the set pressure of the lowest set safety\nor safety relief valve on the altered object, but not to exceed 150 percent of\nthe maximum allowable working pressure, except that the authorized inspector\nmay accept an alternate test. Note: Where water is used in a hydrostatic test, the\ntemperature of the water should be not less than the ambient temperature and in\nno case less than 70° Fahrenheit and the maximum temperature during\ninspection should not exceed 120° Fahrenheit. If a test is conducted at\n1-1/2 times the maximum allowable working pressure (MAWP) and the owner\nspecified a temperature higher than 120° Fahrenheit, the pressure should be\nreduced to the MAWP and the temperature should be reduced to 120°\nFahrenheit for the close examination. (e) Examples of alterations. Alterations\nshall include, but are not limited to, the following examples: (1)\nto increase the maximum allowable working\npressure or temperature of a boiler regardless of whether or not a physical\nchange was made to the boiler; (2)\nthe addition of new nozzles or openings in a boiler except those classified as\nrepairs; (3)\nan increase in any\nheating surface which results in increasing the heat output or the final\ntemperature above that specified in the original design; (4)\nreplacement of a pressure retaining part\nin a boiler with a material of different nominal strength or nominal\ncomposition from that used in the original design; and\n(5)\na decrease in the minimum temperature\nsuch that additional mechanical tests are required as specified in the\n\nCode.
