  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 2C.109 - SLIDES Sign (NYW4-15)\n\nState Regulations\n\nOption: 01 The SLIDES (NYW4-15) sign (see Sign Drawing SD-W12) may\nbe used, as necessary, to warn of roadway sections where slides of soil, rock, or other material may obstruct the roadway or shoulder, or otherwise affect\nnormal traffic flow. Guidance: 02 The SLIDES sign should be removed when the condition\nstabilizes, or is corrected, and future incidents involving slides are\nconsidered unlikely. 03 The SLIDES sign should be supplemented with a Distance\nplaque (see Section\n2C.55\n) where the roadway section\nis 1000 feet or longer. Additional SLIDES signs, supplemented with Distance\nplaques stating the distance to the end of the section, should be placed at\nsuitable locations (for example, beyond intersections), and at appropriate\nintervals, in long sections. Where such additional sign is placed within 1000\nfeet of the end of the section, the Distance plaque should be\nomitted. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n2C.109\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
