  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 16.61 - Therapy equipment operating at potentials of 60 kvp and below\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Equipment. All provisions of subdivision (a) of section\n16.60\nof this Part shall apply except that the leakage five centimeters from the surface of the tube housing shall not exceed 0.1 roentgen per hour. (b) Conditions for operation of equipment. (1)\n\nThe output of the X-ray generator shall be calibrated prior to the use of the apparatus for treating humans. Calibration shall be performed by a person qualified pursuant to section\n16.122\n(f) of this Part and experienced in the calibration of such units. The method of calibration used shall ensure accurate delivery of the prescribed dose under all conditions of use. Calibrations shall be made at least annually. Recalibration, however, shall be made after each tube replacement and after any changes or replacements in the generating apparatus which could change the X-ray output. (2)\n\nIf the tube must be hand-held during irradiation, the operator shall wear protective gloves and a protective apron of no less than 0.5 mm lead equivalent. (3)\n\nThe operator shall be able to observe and communicate with the patient during irradiation. (4)\n\nEquipment having an output of more than 1,000 roentgens per minute at any accessible place shall not be left unattended without the power being shut off at the main disconnect switch in addition to the control panel switch. (5)\n\nWhen operating equipment constructed with beryllium or other low filtration windows the operator shall insure that the useful beam is blocked at all times except when actually being used. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n16.61\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
