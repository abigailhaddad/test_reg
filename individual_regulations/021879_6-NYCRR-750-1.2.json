  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-1.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Whenever used\nin this Part, unless a different meaning is stated in a definition applicable\nto only a portion of this Part, the following terms will have the meanings set\nforth below: (1)\n\nAct\nmeans\nthe Clean Water Act formerly referred to as the Federal Water Pollution Control\n\nAct, 33 USC\n1251\net seq. (see section\n750-1.25 of this Subpart). (2)\n\nAction level\nmeans, when used in a SPDES permit, a monitoring\nrequirement characterized by a numerical value that, when exceeded, triggers\nadditional permittee monitoring and department review to determine if numerical\neffluent limitations should be imposed. (3)\n\nAdministrative renewal\nmeans renewal of a SPDES permit in accordance with Part 621 of this Title, based on an abbreviated review of changes at the permitted facility. (4)\n\nAdministrator\nmeans the\nadministrator of the EPA. (5)\n\nAnimal feeding operation\n(AFO) means a lot or facility (other\nthan an aquatic animal production facility) where animals have been, are, or\nwill be stabled or confined and fed or maintained for a total of 45 days or\nmore in any 12-month period, and the animal confinement areas do not sustain\ncrops, vegetation, forage growth, or post-harvest residues in the normal\ngrowing season. Two or more animal feeding operations under common ownership\nare a single animal feeding operation if they physically adjoin each other, or\nif they use a common area or system for the disposal of wastes. (6)\n\nAnimal unit. [\nReserved\n]\n(7)\n\nApplicable water quality standards and effluent limitations\nmeans all State and Federal water quality standards and effluent limitations to\nwhich a discharge is subject under the act, or under State law, including but\nnot limited to water quality standards, effluent limitations, best management\npractices, standards of performance, toxic effluent standards and prohibitions, pretreatment standards, and ocean discharge criteria. (8)\n\nApprovable\nis defined as\nthat which can be approved by the department, with only minimal revision. Minimal revision\nshall mean revised and resubmitted to the\ndepartment within 60 days of notification by the department of the revisions\nthat are necessary, unless otherwise defined by the applicable SPDES\npermit. (9)\n\nAverage\nmeans the arithmetic mean of pollutant parameter\nvalues for samples collected in a given period. (10)\n\nBest available technology\neconomically achievable (BAT)\nmeans effluent limits authorized under\nsection 301(b)(2)(A) of the act, 40\nCFR\n122.44(a) and (e)(1) and\n(2), 40 CFR\n125.3(2)(iii), 40 CFR\n405\nto\n471\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Subpart) and ECL 17-0801. BAT is\ntechnology-based effluent limitations guidelines established by the act as the\nmost appropriate means available on a national basis for controlling the direct\ndischarge of toxic and nonconventional pollutants to navigable waters. BAT\neffluent limitations guidelines, as established by EPA, represent the best\nexisting performance of treatment technologies that are economically achievable\nwithin an industrial point source category or subcategory. (11)\n\nBest conventional pollutant\ncontrol technology (BCT)\nmeans effluent limits authorized under the\nact, section 301(b)(2)(E), 40\nCFR\n122.44(a), 40 CFR\n125.3(2)(ii), 40 CFR\n405\nto\n471\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Subpart) and ECL 17-0811. BCT is technology\nbased effluent limitations guidelines for the discharge of conventional\npollutants from existing industrial point sources including BOD5, TSS, fecal\ncoliform, pH, oil and grease. The BCT is established by EPA using a two-part\ncost reasonableness test that compares the cost for an industry to reduce its\npollutant discharge with the cost to a POTW for similar levels of reduction of\na pollutant loading. The second test examines the cost-effectiveness of\nadditional industrial treatment beyond BPT. EPA must find limits that are\nreasonable under both tests before establishing them as BCT. (12)\n\nBest management practices\n(BMPs)\nmeans schedules of activities, prohibitions of practices, maintenance procedures, and other management practices to prevent or reduce the\npollution of waters of the state. BMPs also include treatment requirements (if\ndetermined necessary by the permittee), operating procedures, and practices to\ncontrol plant site runoff, spillage and leaks, sludge or waste disposal, or\ndrainage from raw material storage. (13)\n\nBest practicable control\ntechnology currently available (BPT)\nmeans effluent limits authorized\nunder the act, section 301(b)(2)(E), 40\nCFR\n122.44(a), 40 CFR\n125.3(2)(ii), 40 CFR\n405\nto\n471\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Subpart) and ECL 17-0811. The initial level\nof technology-based standards established by the CWA to control pollutants\ndischarged to navigable waters, BPT effluent limitations guidelines are\ngenerally based on the average of the best existing performance by plants\nwithin an industrial category or subcategory. Because BPT has been supplanted\nby BAT and BCT in all other instances, BPT is only applied by EPA when proposed\nBCT limits fail the cost comparison with secondary treatment regulations for\nPOTWs. (14)\n\nBest\nprofessional judgement (BPJ)\nmeans effluent limits authorized under\nthe Act section 402(a)(1)(B), 40\nCFR\n122.44(e)(1) and (2), 40 CFR\n125.3(a)(2)(I)(B)-(v), 40\nCFR\n414.11(h), 40 CFR\n501.15(b)\n(see section\n750-1.25 of this Subpart) and ECL 17-0811. BPJ is the method used by permit\nwriters to develop BAT or BCT limits or requirements on a case-by-case basis\nfor pollutants and wastewaters not addressed by 40 CFR\n405\nto\n471. (15)\n\nBiological monitoring\nmeans the determination of the effects of the discharge of pollutants on\naquatic life, including accumulation of pollutants in tissue, in receiving\nwaters due to the discharge of pollutants by scientifically sound techniques\nand procedures, including sampling of organisms representative of appropriate\nlevels of the food chain appropriate to the volume and the physical, chemical\nand biological characteristics of the effluent, at appropriate frequencies and\nlocations. Such monitoring includes, but is not limited to whole effluent\ntoxicity testing as set forth in 40 CFR part\n136\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nSubpart). (16)\n\nBiosolids\nmeans dewatered treatment residuals that meet\n\nFederal regulations ( 40 CFR part\n501\n- see section\n750-1.25\nof this Subpart) and State\nregulations (Part 360 of this Title) and local rules for reuse concerning\nmetals, pathogens, and vector attraction reduction. (17)\n\nBypass\nmeans the\nintentional or unintentional diversion of wastewater or stormwater around any\nportion of a treatment facility having the effect of reducing the degree of\ntreatment designed for the bypassed portion of the treatment\nfacility. (18)\n\nCentral\noffice\nmeans the principal office of the department, located in the\n\nCounty of Albany, State of New York. (19)\n\nCertified laboratory\nmeans a laboratory that is certified by the State Commissioner of Health\npursuant to section\n502\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law (see section 750-1.25 of this Subpart) for the analyte or\nanalytes in question.
