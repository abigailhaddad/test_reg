  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 646-4.10 - Vegetative cutting and clearing restrictions in stormwater regulatory programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nvegetation shall be felled into any lake, pond, river, stream or intermittent\nstream and if inadvertently felled into one of these water bodies, shall be\nremoved immediately from the waterbody. The removal of dead, or dying, diseased\ntrees or trees presenting a health or safety hazard shall not be exempt from\nthis requirement. (b) Within 500\nfeet of the mean high water mark of any lake, pond, river, stream, or wetland, no land area, including areas stockpiled with earthen materials, which has been\ncleared may be made or left devoid of growing vegetation for more than 24 hours\nwithout a protective covering securely placed over the entire area and/or\nerosion control devices properly installed to prevent sediments from entering\nthe water body. Acceptable protective coverings include natural mulch of a\ndepth of two inches, rock rip-rap, non-degradable materials such as plastic or\ncanvas coverings, and impervious structures. (c) Any area of land from which the natural\nvegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by\ndevelopment activities shall be revegetated within 10 days from the substantial\ncompletion of such clearing and construction. Acceptable revegetation shall\nconsist of the following: (1)\n\nReseeding with\nan annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or\nits equivalent of sufficient coverage, but not less than 50 percent of the\ntotal disturbed area, to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is\nestablished over 90 percent of the seeded area. (2)\n\nReplanting with native woody and\nherbaceous vegetation accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent\nof sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established\nand are capable of controlling erosion. (3)\n\nAny other recognized method which has\nbeen reviewed and approved as satisfying the intent of this\nrequirement. (d) Any area\nof revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of 75 percent of the cover\ncrop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must\nbe repeated in successive years until the minimum 75 percent survival for one\nyear is achieved. (e) Ground\nclearing or grading activities which occur during the period October 15th to\n\nApril 15th, during which germination of vegetation typically will not take\nplace, shall be required to incorporate extra measures during revegetation in\norder to reduce erosion and maintain water quality. These extra measures\ninclude, but are not limited to, the use of screen mesh, netting, extra mulch, and siltation fences. (f) Land\ndisturbance must be compliant with regulations for stream corridors at Section\n6465. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
