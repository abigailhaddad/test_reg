Tit. 9 §§ 1628-1.1 - Budget preparation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All\nauthorities are required to submit an operating budget for each project or\nconsolidated projects for the period from the date of substantial completion to\nthe end of the current fiscal year assigned to the authority, and annually\nthereafter. However, under certain conditions in consolidated project\noperations, the division may require a budget for each of the individual\nprojects. (b) Budgets will be\nprepared on forms provided by the Division of Housing and Community Renewal. A\npreliminary budget will be prepared in pencil and forwarded in duplicate, not\nlater than 60 days prior to the beginning of the next succeeding fiscal year, to the Bureau of Management for review. Immediately upon return of the\npreliminary budget, the final budget will be prepared in four copies and\nforwarded for the formal approval of the Bureau of Management. Neither the\npreliminary nor the final budget will be forwarded to the Bureau of Management\nuntil it has been reviewed and approved by the local authority.
