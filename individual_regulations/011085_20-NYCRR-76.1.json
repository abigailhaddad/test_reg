Tit. 20 § 76.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 4, 171, 471(1), 471-a, 473, 475 and\n476\n(a) (1)\n\nThe tax imposed on cigarettes possessed\nin the State for sale pursuant to section\n471\nof the Tax Law is not required to be\npaid on cigarettes sold under any circumstances that the State is without power\nto impose the tax. Further, such tax is not required to be paid on cigarettes\nsold to or by the United States or a voluntary unincorporated organization of\nthe armed forces of the United States which operates a place for the sale of\ngoods pursuant to regulations promulgated by the appropriate executive agency\nof the United States. The tax on cigarettes possessed for sale is not required\nto be paid on cigarettes sold to the State of New York, to out-of-state\npurchasers or to the United Nations. (2)\n\nThe tax imposed on cigarettes used in the\n\nState pursuant to section\n471-a\nof the Tax Law is not required to be\npaid on any cigarettes which are the subject of a tax exempt sale, provided\nsuch cigarettes are used within the scope of such exemption. (3)\n\nThe terms\nexempt, exemption from\ntax\nor similar phraseology as used in this Part and throughout this\n\nTitle shall not be narrowly construed and shall include any privilege, right, exclusion, relief, immunity or other freedom from the cigarette tax allowed by\nor pursuant to the authority of law. (b) (1)\n\nIn\ngeneral, exemptions from the cigarette tax shall be effectuated by means of a\nlicensed cigarette agent's sale of cigarettes upon which such tax has not been\nprepaid by the seller on behalf of the ultimate consumer nor precollected as\npart of the selling price of such cigarettes. Cigarettes upon which the tax has\nnot been prepaid and precollected shall include unstamped packages of\ncigarettes, as well as specially stamped exempt packages if so authorized by\nthe Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. Cigarettes upon which the tax has\nbeen paid shall, only in extraordinary circumstances or as specifically\nprovided for in Part 77 of this Title, be sold for exempt purposes. Where the\nseller of such cigarettes or an exempt purchaser can establish to the\nsatisfaction of the Department of Taxation and Finance that circumstances\nnecessitated the sale or purchase of cigarettes upon which the tax had been\npaid and that such tax was borne by the seller or exempt purchaser, as the case\nmay be, the department may refund the tax paid. No interest shall be paid by\nthe department on any such refunds. (2)\n\nExcept as provided herein, only a\nlicensed cigarette agent may sell cigarettes upon which the tax has not been\nprepaid and precollected. Exceptions to this rule are limited to sales by: (i) persons introducing cigarettes into the\n\nNew York State market for sale exclusively to licensed agents pursuant to\nsection\n74.3\nof this Title; (ii)\nthe United\n\nStates or voluntary unincorporated organizations of the armed forces of the\n\nUnited States pursuant to section\n76.2\nof\nthis Part; (iii)\npersons through\nbonded warehouses to diplomatic missions and diplomatic personnel pursuant to\nsection\n76.4\nof this Part; and\n(iv)\nany other\npersons under any circumstances in which the State is without power by reason\nof the United States Constitution and any laws enacted pursuant thereto. Accordingly, no dealer other than a licensed cigarette\nagent and the aforementioned persons and entities may sell or purchase for\nresale, in New York State, cigarettes upon which the cigarette tax has not been\nprepaid and precollected, and the terms seller and purchaser for resale, or the\nlike, as used hereafter in this Part shall be read with such understanding. Moreover, nothing in this Part shall be construed as authorizing the sale or\npurchase of cigarettes upon which the seller has not prepaid and precollected\nthe cigarette tax for any purpose other than for the proper administration of\nthe exemptions from the cigarette tax imposed pursuant to article 20 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (c) (1)\n\nIt\nis presumed that all cigarettes within the State are subject to tax until the\ncontrary is established. The burden of proof that any cigarettes are not\ntaxable is upon the person or persons in possession of such cigarettes. To\nsatisfy this burden of proof, any person purchasing cigarettes who is entitled\nto an exemption from tax, or any person who is entitled to purchase for resale\nto exempt purchasers cigarettes upon which the seller has not prepaid and\nprecollected the cigarette tax, must furnish to the seller of such cigarettes\n(or have furnished to the seller on its behalf) proper documentation\nsubstantiating its right to such entitlement. Upon presentation of the proper\ndocumentation, the seller may supply such purchasers with cigarettes upon which\nthe tax has not been prepaid and precollected. (2)\n\nIn order to make purchases of cigarettes\nupon which the seller has not prepaid and precollected the cigarette tax, a\npurchaser must furnish to the seller: (i) a\nproperly completed certificate to the effect that the purchaser is entitled to\nacquire cigarettes upon which the tax has not been prepaid and precollected, either as an exempt purchaser or for purposes of resale to exempt purchasers, on a form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance for such\npurpose, together with such other information as the department may\nrequire; (ii)\na government purchase\ncontract or purchase order; or\n(iii)\nany other appropriate exemption\ndocument or proof of exemption as provided in this Part. (3)\n\nEvery person selling cigarettes upon\nwhich the cigarette tax has not been prepaid and precollected must obtain from\nthe purchaser and retain as part of such person's records such certificates, documents or other proof of exemption in support of all exempt sales. Documentation substantiating an exempt transaction must be retained by the\nseller for at least three years following the date that the transaction was\nrequired to be reported to the department or the date that the transaction was\nactually reported to the department, if later. Where such transaction is not\nrequired to be reported to the department, such documentation must be retained\nby the seller for at least three years following the date of the\ntransaction. (d) (1)\nA seller of cigarettes who, at or prior\nto the delivery of such cigarettes, in good faith accepts from the purchaser a\nproperly completed exemption certificate or other document evidencing an\nexemption from tax or a purchase for resale to exempt purchasers, is relieved\nof the liability for failure to have prepaid and precollected the cigarette tax\nwith respect to that transaction and the burden of proving that such sale of\ncigarettes is not subject to tax is solely on the purchaser. (2)\n(i) A\ncertificate or other document is accepted in good faith when a seller of\ncigarettes has no actual knowledge that the exemption certificate or other\ndocument issued by the purchaser is false or is fraudulently\npresented. (ii)\nA certificate or\nother document is considered to be properly completed when it contains: (a) the date prepared; (b) the name and address of the\npurchaser; (c) the name and address\nof the seller; (d) the\nidentification number of the purchaser as shown on its wholesaler dealers\nlicense or sales tax certificate of authority or its exempt organization number\nas shown on its exempt organization certificate, if any such numbers are\nrequired; (e) the signature of the\npurchaser or the purchaser's authorized representative; and\n(f) any other information required to be\ncompleted on the particular certificate or document.
