  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 55.2 - Specifications and requirements for padded instrument panels\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen that area of the instrument panel that is within the\nhead impact area is impacted by a 15-pound, 6.5 inch diameter head form at a\nrelative velocity of 15 miles per hour, the deceleration of the head form shall\nnot exceed 80g continuously for more than 3 milliseconds. (a) Exceptions. This standard does not apply\nto: (1)\nconsole assemblies; (2)\nareas less than 5 inches inboard from the\njuncture of the instrument panel attachment to the body side inner\nstructure; (3)\nareas closer to the\nwindshield juncture than those statically contactable by the head form with the\nwindshield in place; (4)\nareas\noutboard of any point of tangency on the instrument panel of a 6.5- inch\ndiameter head form tangent to an inboard of a verticle longitudinal plane\ntangent to the inboard edge of the steering wheel; or\n(5)\nareas below any point at which a vertical\nline is tangent to the rearmost surface of the panel. (b) Demonstration procedures. Tests shall be\nperformed as described in Society of Automotive Engineers recommended Practice\nJ921, Instrument Panel Laboratory Impact Test Procedure, June 1965, using the\nspecified instrumentation or instrumentation that meets the performance\nrequirements specified in Society of Automotive Engineers Recommended Practice\nJ977, Instrumentation for Laboratory Impact Tests, November 1966, except that: (1)\nthe origin of the line tangent to the\ninstrument panel surface shall be a point on a transverse horizontal line\nthrough a point 5 inches horizontally forward of the seating reference point of\nthe front outboard passenger designated seating position, displaced vertically\nan amount equal to the rise which results from a 5-inch forward adjustment of\nthe seat or 0.75 inches; and\n(2)\ndirection of impact shall be either: (i) in a\nvertical plane parallel to the vehicle longitudinal axis; or\n(ii)\nin a plane normal to the surface at the\npoint of contact. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n55.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
