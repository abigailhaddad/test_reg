  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 174.5 - New York State employer's identification number\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Each employer and each payer of\ncertain gambling winnings (see section\n171.11\n[a]\nof this Article) must be identified by a New York State employer identification\nnumber. This employer identification number will be the same as the Federal\nemployer identification number in every case where such a number has been\nassigned by the Internal Revenue Service. The permanent employer identification\nnumber is a nine-digit number separated by a hyphen as follows: 00-0000000. Except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, no employer may have\nmore than one employer identification number. Where a temporary New York State\nemployer identification number has been assigned and such employer later\nobtains a Federal employer identification number, the New York State Division\nof Taxation must be notified of the Federal employer identification number\nreceived and the Federal employer identification number must be used for all\nsubsequent New York State personal income tax withholding purposes. (b) Employers with branch locations or\ndivisions. Employers seeking to have branch locations or divisions file as\nseparate entities may apply for special New York State employer identification\nnumbers to the Department of Taxation and Finance. Such department, at its\ndiscretion, may assign a special New York State employer identification number\nupon a showing by such employer of a legitimate business purpose for such\nrequest. (c) See section\n158.1\n(c) of this Title with regard to the requirement of furnishing identifying\nnumbers. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n174.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
