The purpose of educational programming in an institutional\ndetention facility is to provide success-oriented, short-term educational\nactivity. (1)\n\nChildren under care\nshall receive suitable educational instruction in accordance with the New York\n\nState Education Law for such short-term programs. (2)\nA minimum of three hours of educational\nactivity instruction each weekday shall be provided each child. (3)\n\nEducational instruction shall be provided\nby a teacher qualified by, or eligible for certification by, the New York State\n\nEducation Department, as provided in 8 NYCRR\n80.32. (b) Medical program. The purpose of the health program of an institutional\ndetention facility should be the provision of adequate and appropriate health\nservices to assure that both public and individual health care needs of the\nchildren are met. The health care rendered should be of good quality, efficient, accessible and continuous. Provisions should be made for basic\nprimary health care which would also include, but not be restricted to, dental, obstetrical, gynecological, mental health, and public and preventive health\nservices. The extent that these services can be reasonably delivered will\ndepend on the health needs of the youngsters, the length of stay at the\nfacility and the health resources of both the detention facility and the\nsurrounding community. The highest priorities in providing health services for\nyoungsters in detention are the identification and treatment of emergency\nand/or serious acute health conditions, and the responsible interim management\nand treatment of chronic serious health conditions. (1)\n\nAdministration. As a minimum, detention\nfacilities should have a health program which includes, but is not restricted\nto, the following: (i) A specific\nadministrative structure with designated director or administrative head with\nopen access and reporting responsibilities to the chief administrator of the\nfacility. (ii)\n\nThere should be the\nidentification and documentation of all licensed physicians and medical\npersonnel who supervise health personnel, directly render service, devise and\nreview medical procedures. (2)\n(i) Procedures. A set of written procedures disseminated to and understood by all\nrelevant detention staff, established to assure that basic health services are\nmet. These procedures should include but not be limited to the health\nassessments. (ii)\n\nHealth\nassessments. All youngsters upon entering detention shall have a prompt health\nassessment conducted by a licensed physician or a health professional, trained\nspecifically to perform health assessments under the supervision of a\nphysician. This health assessment should be conducted within at least 72 hours\nafter the youngster is admitted to the facility on routine cases. In\ncircumstances where there exist conditions, indications or circumstances, either reported by the youngster, the youngster's family those, transporting\nand/or referring youngsters or other members of the detention facility, that\nindicate a physician's assessment is required sooner than 72 hours, the\nfacility should make provisions to perform an immediate health assessment on an\nemergency basis. The health assessment should include the following: (a) The health historyincluding but not\nrestricted to pertinent data, family and social history, history of\nhospitalizations and/or past medical illness, review of body systems, current\nmedical illness or complaints, any allergies or drug reactions and current use\nof prescribed medications, history of alcohol or substance abuse. (b) Physical examinationshould include\nmeasurement of height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure, pulse, respiration rate; and include the physical inspection of those parts of the\nbody pertinent for the assessment of the status of growth and development, psychoneurologic, cardio-respiratory, gastrointestinal, genitourinary, integement, musculosketal, metabolic, endocrine, and immunohematologic\nsystems. (c) Laboratory testing\n(where appropriate)should include and not be restricted to hemoglobin and\nhematocrit, urinalysis, tuberculosis skin test, serology test for syphilis, Pap\ntest and culture for gonorrhea for sexually active persons; other laboratory\ntesting as appropriate or medically indicated to assure the proper diagnosis\nand/or treatment of any serious individual or public health disorder. (3)\n\nService plans for\nall identified health problems. The records should reflect service plans for all identified\nhealth problems. For those health problems in which the physician has deemed it\nappropriate to defer further diagnostic inquiry and/or treatment, the records\nshould reflect this deferment as part of the treatment plan. Appropriate\nimmunization services should be provided. (4)\n\nHealth policies and admission into the\ndetention facility. (i) The life or the\nhealth of a child should not be jeopardized by admitting into detention any\nchild with serious health problems that exceed the capacity for the detention\nfacility to provide necessary health services. Unconscious or frankly suicidal\nchildren should not be admitted or maintained at a detention facility. Children\nin these categories should receive at the detention site those emergency health\nservices that should assure the safe and immediate transportation to the\nappropriate local health facility. (ii)\n\nChildren with obvious signs of injury, altered state of consciousness, inexplicable bizarre behavior, obviously\nintoxicated states or other indications of serious health problems should be\nimmediately assessed by the detention physician or health personnel as to the\nextent of the problem. A clinical decision should be made as to whether there\nexists a serious health problem that exceeds the capacity of the detention\nfacility to provide the necessary health services. In the event that a\nphysician or other health personnel are not onsite, the highest administrative\ndetention official at a detention center must act immediately to secure such a\ndecision by telephone consultation with the detention health personnel or other\nhealth care professionals. In the event that a clinical decision is made that\nthere is any likelihood that the necessary health care cannot be rendered at\nthe detention site, then immediate steps should be taken to transport such\nyoungsters to the appropriate health facility. (5)\n\nPrescription medications. (i) The detention facility should have the\nfacilities, equipment, records and personnel to assure the provisions for the\nprescription, storage, dispensation, administration of prescribed medication\nand/or controlled medication in compliance with Federal, State and local\nlaws.
