Its purposes are to show how the tribunal has jurisdiction, to show\nenough facts to notify the respondent of the claim being made, and to provide\nthe petitioner with a means to request specific action or relief. Additional\ninformation can be provided in the accompanying affidavits and other\nattachments. HEADING/CAPTION: Identify the Petitioner and Respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is\nbeing worked by the State or local child support enforcement agency (i.e., IV-D\nagency). Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments). Under \"Responding IV-D Case No.\" and\n\"Responding Docket No.\", enter appropriate case and docket numbers that the\nresponding State uses to identify the case, if applicable and if known. Under\n\"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other\nappropriate reference number. Under \"Initiating IV-D Case No.\" and\n\"Initiating Docket No.\", enter appropriate case and docket numbers which your\nIV-D agency or local tribunal has assigned to the case. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate\nreference number. SECTION I, ACTION: List the children on\nwhose behalf the action in the petition is requested. Include each child's full\nname (First, Middle, Last), date of birth, and Social Security Number. Check the appropriate boxes to indicate\nwhich actions are requested. Multiple actions may be requested, as\nappropriate. Check \"Establishment of Paternity\" to\nrequest that paternity be established. In a IV-D case, ask another State to\nestablish paternity only if use of long-arm jurisdiction is not appropriate. Be\nsure to attach an \"Affidavit in Support of Establishing Paternity\" for each\nchild whose paternity is at issue. Check \"Establishment of Order\" to request\nthat an order be established. Indicate the type of order by checking the\nappropriate box. Check \"Child Support\" to request the\ninitial establishment of a new child support order. If the responding State\nuses UIFSA and an order governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren)\nalready exists, you should generally only request the establishment of a new\norder if: (1) there is more than one existing order, (2) the obligor, obligee, and child have all moved out of the issuing States, and (3) the parties have\nnot filed written consent allowing an issuing State to assert\njurisdiction. ____________\nInstructions to Uniform Support\n\nPetition--Page 1\n\nCheck \"Spousal Support\" to request\nestablishment of a spousal support order. Do not check this item in a IV-D\ncase; establishment of spousal support is not IV-D function. When requesting\nestablishment of spousal support, contact the support enforcement agency for\nthe appropriate procedure. Check \"Support for a Prior Period\" to\nrequest establishment of support for a prior period. On the \"From\" and \"To\"\nlines, enter the beginning and ending dates of the prior period. If support for\nmultiple prior time periods is being requested, enter the beginning date of the\nfirst period in the \"From\" line, and enter the closing date of the last time\nperiod in the \"To\" line. States may establish child support awards covering a\nprior period, but such awards must be based on guidelines and take into\nconsideration either the current earnings and income at the time the order is\nset, or the obligor's earnings and income during the prior period. The award of\nback support is not required under Federal rules but may be appropriate in\naccordance with State law. Not all States have authority to establish support\norders for prior periods. Check \"Paternity Testing Costs\" to request\nan order for reimbursement of costs incurred as a result of genetic testing for\npaternity establishment purposes. If the initiating State has already incurred\ncosts for genetic testing, enter the amount of the costs on the blank line. If\nreimbursement of previously paid genetic tests is not sought, but genetic tests\nmay be ordered, enter \"actual\" on the blank line. Check \"Medical Coverage\" to request\nestablishment of an order that provides for the provision of medical insurance\nor other health care coverage. Medical support must be requested in all IV-D\nPublic Assistance cases, all IV-D Non Public Assistance Medicaid cases, and in\nother IV-D Non Public Assistance cases where health coverage is sought. Check \"Reasonable Attorney Fees, Other\n\nFees and Costs\" to request an order for attorney fees or other costs such as\ncosts of the delivery of the child and other medical costs not covered by\ninsurance. Provide testimony regarding the type and amount of these\ncosts. Check \"Modification of a Support Order\" to\nrequest modification of an existing order. If you are requesting modification of an\norder that was issued by the responding State, in most instances you do not\nneed to complete a Uniform Support Petition. On the other hand, if you are\nrequesting modification of an order that was issued by a State other than the\nresponding State, a Uniform Support Petition is usually necessary. If multiple orders exist, do not ask a\nresponding UIFSA State to modify an order unless that order is the\n\"controlling\" that has priority under UIFSA. UIFSA contains rules for\ndetermining which order is recognized when multiple orders exist. Check \"Other Remedy Sought\" if you are\nrequesting an action not listed in section I. Specify in the space provided\nwhat remedy you are requesting. The Uniform Support Petition is generally\nnot needed to request enforcement action from a UIFSA State. SECTION II, GROUNDS FOR REMEDY\nSOUGHT: In those cases where the respondent is the\nnoncustodial parent of the children named in the petition, check the first box\nin section II of the petition. ____________\nInstructions for Uniform Support\n\nPetition--Page 2\n\nGrounds (reasons) for remedy sought are\nrequired in actions to register an out-of-state child support order for\nmodification. If you are using the petition to request a modification, check\nthe second box under section II of the petition. Grounds for remedy sought are also\nrequired when seeking a remedy that must be affirmatively sought under the\nresponding State's law. SECTION III, ADDITIONAL SUPPORTING\nINFORMATION: Check the appropriate boxes to indicate\nwhich documents are being sent with the petition. If you are sending forms with\nthe petition that are not specifically identified in this section, mark the\n\"Other\" box and list the additional forms in the space provided. SECTION IV, VERIFICATION: The petition must be verified by the\npetitioner. Check the box under this part and have the petitioner (obligee, guardian, putative father, or authorized IV-D representative) sign and date the\nform. Only the verification (petitioner's)\nsignature requires a notary. (If petitioner retains an independent (non IV-D)\nattorney who also signs the petition, the attorney's signature is not\nnotarized.)\nUIFSA allows a party to retain independent\ncounsel. If the petitioner is represented by a private attorney, obtain the\nattorney's signature and Bar Number (if applicable) in the space provided in\nthis part. **************************************************\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis information collection is conducted\nin accordance with\n45 CFR\n303.7\nof the child support enforcement\nprogram.
