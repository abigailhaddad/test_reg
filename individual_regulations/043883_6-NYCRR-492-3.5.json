  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 492-3.5 - Payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installment\npayments of the State grant will be made at the request of the municipality, and will be based on the cost of the work performed, materials and equipment\nsupplied and incorporated in, and services rendered in connection with, an\napproved project. (b) The\n\nDepartment will retain five percent from each payment except the final\npayment. (c) If the municipality\nfails to comply with any of the requirements of the Environmental Conservation\n\nLaw or regulations of the Department applicable to the project, the Department\nmay withhold all or part of further payments pending compliance. (d) Upon notification from the municipality\nthat the project is complete, the Department will determine if the project is\noperating in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. The cost of any\nwork completed after the final determination, or after a date established by\nthe Department at the final determination, will not be considered part of the\nproject cost. (e) A final payment, which brings the total of State grant payments to 100 percent of the State\nshare of the project cost, will be released upon determination by the\n\nDepartment that the project is complete and is operating satisfactorily, and\nthat all grant requirements have been met. If the project is complete but not\noperating satisfactorily, the Department may withhold from the final payment an\namount sufficient, in the judgment of the Department, to ensure correction of\ndeficiencies. The amount withheld will be released when deficiencies are\ncorrected. (f) Total grant payments\nmay not exceed the State share of either the estimated reasonable cost or the\nactual project cost, whichever is lower after deducting any other State or\n\nFederal funds received or to be received for the project.
