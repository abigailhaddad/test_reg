  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 309.1 - Background and determination\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Court of Appeals of the State of New York has determined\nthat a member of the Retirement System who was granted a leave of absence\nwithout pay for medical reasons, pursuant to the rules and regulations of the\n\nDepartment of Civil Service, continued to be in service upon which her\nmembership was based for the duration of the leave granted. The Appellate\n\nDivision, Third Department, has determined that a member of a retirement system\nwho was granted a leave of absence without pay for medical reasons continues to\nbe in service upon which membership in the system is based. In accordance with\nthe above judicial principles, the Comptroller has determined that a member of\nthe retirement system who is receiving benefit payments from either Workers'\nCompensation or other employer-funded disability programs and whose employment\nhas not terminated by resignation, employer action or any other means, shall be\nconsidered to be in service upon which membership in the system is based, for\nthe purposes of meeting certain statutory filing deadlines. Sections 5.2 and\n22.2\nof the rules and regulations\nof the Department of Civil Service direct that a permanent State employee may, in the discretion of the appointing authority, be granted a leave of absence\nfrom his position without pay for a period not exceeding two years, and such\nleave may be extended beyond two years, for periods aggregating not in excess\nof an additional two years, only with the approval of the Civil Service\n\nCommission. Sections\n62, 63, 362, 363, 363-b, 363-c, 506\nand\n507\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, relating disability retirement, provide the applicant must file\napplication for benefits while in service, or within certain statutorily\nprovided time periods after discontinuance from service. Sections\n507-a\nand\n605\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, relating to disability retirement, provide the applicant must file an\napplication within specified time periods from the last date the member was\nbeing paid on the payroll. Any retirement granted pursuant to these sections\nshall be effective as of a date approved by the Comptroller. Sections\n60, 60-a, 60-b, 448, 508\nand\n606\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, relating to ordinary death benefits, provide that a death benefit shall be\npayable if the member dies while in service upon which the membership is\nbased. This Part is promulgated to provide the criteria for\ndetermining whether members of the New York State Employees' Retirement System\nand the New York State Policemen's and Firemen's Retirement System who are\neither on a leave of absence without pay for medical reasons or receiving\nbenefit payments from either Workers' Compensation or other employer-funded\ndisability programs are to be considered in service for the purpose of filing\nan application for disability retirement and for eligibility for certain death\nbenefits.
