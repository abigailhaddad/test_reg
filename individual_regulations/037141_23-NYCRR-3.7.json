The request for an\nexception shall be in writing and state the reasons why the records, or\nportions thereof, should be excepted from disclosure. The records submitted to\nthe department shall be excepted from disclosure and shall be maintained\nseparate and apart from all other records until 15 days after the department\nhas finally determined that the records are not entitled to the exception, or\nsuch further time as may be ordered by a court of competent\njurisdiction. (b) Upon the\ninitiative of the department, or upon a request for a record that the\ndepartment maintains separate and apart from all other records pursuant to\n\nPublic Officers Law section 89(5), the department shall: (1)\ninform the record submitter of the\ndepartment's intention to determine whether an exception should be\ncontinued; (2)\nafford the record\nsubmitter 10 business days after receipt of notification from the department to\nsubmit a written statement in support of the necessity for the continuation of\nsuch exception; (3)\nwithin seven\nbusiness days of receipt of such written statement, or within seven business\ndays of the expiration of the period prescribed for submission of such\nstatement, issue to the record submitter a written determination continuing or\nterminating such exception and stating the reasons therefor.

Written notice of\nthe determination shall be served upon the FOIL requester, the record\nsubmitter, and the Committee on Open Government.

Such proceeding, if commenced by the record\nsubmitter, must be commenced within 15 days of the service of the written\nnotice containing the adverse determination of appeal in accordance with the\nprovisions of Public Officers Law section 89(5) (d). (e) The record submitter shall have the\nburden of proving entitlement to the exception from disclosure provided by\n\nPublic Officers Law section 87(2)(d), except when the department on its own\ninitiative denies access to a record pursuant to that exception.
