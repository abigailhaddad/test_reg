The treatment planning\nprocess is a means of reviewing and adjusting the services necessary to assist\nthe patient in reaching the point where he or she can pursue life goals, without impediment resulting from his or her illness. The treatment planning\nprocess includes, where appropriate, a means for determining when the patient's\ngoals have been met to the extent possible in the context of the programs\noffered by the integrated services provider, and planning for the appropriate\ndischarge of the patient from the program. (b) Patient participation in treatment\nplanning shall be documented by the signature of the patient or the signature\nof the person who has legal authority to consent to care on behalf of the\npatient or, in the case of a child, the signature of a parent, guardian, or\nother person who has legal authority to consent to health care on behalf of the\nchild, as well as the child, where appropriate, provided, however, that the\nlack of such signature shall not constitute noncompliance with this requirement\nif the reasons for non-participation by the patient are documented in the\ntreatment plan.

(4)\n\nFor patients moving directly from one\nprogram offered by an integrated services provider to another program offered\nby the same provider, whether or not it is a program approved to provide\nintegrated services, the existing treatment plan may be used if there is\ndocumentation that it has been reviewed and, if necessary, updated within 14\ndays of transfer. (d) The\ntreatment plan shall address physical health, behavioral health, and social\nservice needs. In addition, specific consideration of the need for health home\ncare coordination should be noted when appropriate.
