(b) In addition, a\nsocial services official must make payments for the cost of care, services and\nsupplies payable under the State's program of medical assistance for needy\npersons provided to any child for whom kinship guardianship assistance payments\nare being made under title 10 of article 6 of the Social Services Law and this\n\nPart who is not eligible for medical assistance under subdivision (a) of this\nsection and for whom the relative or successor guardian is unable to obtain\nmedical coverage through any other available means, regardless of whether the\nchild otherwise qualifies for medical assistance for needy persons. Payments\npursuant to this subdivision may be made only with respect to the cost of care, services, and supplies which are not otherwise covered or subject to payment or\nreimbursement by insurance, medical assistance or other sources. Payments made\npursuant to this subdivision may only be made if the relative or successor\nguardian applies to obtain such medical coverage for the child from all\navailable sources, unless the social services official determines that the\nrelative guardian has good cause for not applying for such coverage, which\ninclude that appropriate coverage is not available or affordable. (c) An application for payments under this\nsection must be made prior to the issuance of letters of guardianship for the\nchild. An approval of an application for payments under this section is not\nsubject to annual review by the social services official, and such approval\nremains in effect for as long as kinship guardianship assistance payments are\nbeing made under this Part for the child. Applications for such payments shall\nbe accepted prior to the issuance of letters of guardianship of the child, and\napproval thereof may be granted contingent upon such issuance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
