Acceptance of such surrender without the\nexplicit advance approval of the social services district, in and of itself\nwill not obligate the social services district to provide support, care or\nservices. (h) Before accepting a\nsurrender, the authorized agency must ascertain that the biological parent or\nguardian has a full understanding of the meaning thereof and of the religious\nfaith requirements of section\n373\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law.

(3)\n\nThe statement must advise the parents\nthat their religious wishes will be complied with so far as they are consistent\nwith the best interests of the child and where practicable. (4)\n\nWhen the father and mother of a child\nborn in or out of wedlock have signed statements of religious wishes as to the\nplacement of the child and these wishes conflict, they must be advised that the\nsocial services official or authorized agency may place the child according to\neither religious preference, based on the best interests of the child and where\npracticable. (j) Children who are not in foster care. When requested by the parent(s) or guardian(s), a social\nservices official must determine, after appropriate consultation, if in such\nofficial's judgment, without regard to the likelihood of placing the child in\nan adoptive home, whether the best interests of the child will be served by a\nsurrender. The care, custody and guardianship of a child not in foster care may\nbe committed to an authorized agency by a surrender executed either before a\njudge of the family court or a surrogate, or in the presence of one or more\nwitnesses before a notary public or other officer authorized to take proof of\ndeeds, pursuant to section\n384\nof the\n\nSocial Services Law.

Where the\nsurrender is conditioned upon the adoption of the child by a particular person\nor persons, such person or persons must be either a certified or approved\nfoster parent in accordance with Part 443 of this Title or an approved adoptive\nparent in accordance with this Part and the permanency plan for the child must\nbe for such child to be adopted by the person or persons.
