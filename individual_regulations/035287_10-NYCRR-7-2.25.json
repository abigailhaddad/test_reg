Interviews must be conducted of each party or witness individually, not in the presence of other parties or witnesses or under circumstances in which other parties or witnesses may perceive any aspect of the interview. The person alleging the incident, or who is the subject of the incident, must be offered the opportunity to give his/her version of the event. At least one of the persons conducting the interview must have an understanding of, and be able to accommodate, the unique needs or capabilities of the person being interviewed.

(a) The camp shall maintain a facility incident review committee, in accordance with 14 NYCRR Part\n704. The incident review committee shall be composed of members of the governing body of the children's camp and other persons identified by the camp operator, including some members of the following: camp administrative staff, direct support staff, licensed health care practitioners, service recipients, the permit-issuing official or designee and representatives of family, consumer and other advocacy organizations, but not the camp director. The camp operator shall convene a facility incident review committee to review the timeliness, thoroughness and appropriateness of the camp's responses to reportable incidents; recommend additional opportunities for improvement to the camp operator, if appropriate; review incident trends and patterns concerning reportable incidents; and make recommendations to the camp operator to assist in reducing reportable incidents. The facility incident review committee shall meet each year in which there is a reportable incident. When the incident review committee is responsible for approving or developing corrective action plans, the committee shall meet within 45 days of the conclusion of an investigation, unless an extension for such plans has been granted by the Justice Center. (b) Pursuant to paragraph (f) of subdivision (1) of section\n490\nof the Social Services Law and 14 NYCRR Part\n704, a camp operator may seek an exemption from the requirement to establish and maintain an incident review committee. In order to obtain an exemption, the camp operator shall file an application with the permit-issuing official and provide sufficient documentation and information to demonstrate that compliance would present undue hardship, that granting an exemption would not create an undue risk of harm to campers' health and safety and specify an alternative process to ensure appropriate review and evaluation of reportable incidents. The permit-issuing official shall consult with the department and shall not grant or deny an application for an exemption unless it first obtains department approval for the proposed decision. An operator shall meet all terms of an approved exemption(s). An exemption shall remain in effect until revoked by the permit-issuing official. A camp operator shall immediately notify the permit-issuing official when conditions, upon which the incident review committee exemption was granted, have changed. (9)\n\nIn addition to the requirements specified by section\n7-2.4\n(d) and (g)\nof this Subpart, a permit may be denied, revoked, or suspended if the children's camp fails to comply with regulations, policies, or other requirements of the Justice Center. In considering whether to issue a permit to a children's camp, the permit-issuing official shall consider the children's camp's past and current compliance with the regulations, policies, or other requirements of the Justice Center.
