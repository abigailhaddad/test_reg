  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 252.11 - Answer; failure to file\n\nState Regulations\n\nIf the party or parties against whom the charge is\nbrought fails to file an answer in the manner and within the time herein\nprovided, it may be limited to crossexamination of witnesses called by the\ncharging party and shall have such other rights as the hearing officer may deem\nproper. Where prejudice to the charging party is demonstrated or no sufficient\nexcuse or justification for the failure to file is proffered, the hearing\nofficer may deem such failure to constitute an admission of the material facts\nalleged in the charge and a waiver by the respondent of a\nhearing.
