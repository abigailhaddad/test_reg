Effective April 1, 1994 and thereafter, reimbursement for adult day health care services that are provided to registrants with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), other human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) related illnesses and, effective April 1, 2017, that are provided to registrants who are otherwise considered at the discretion of the commissioner to be part of a high-need population that, regardless of their HIV status, would benefit from receiving these adult day health care services shall be established pursuant to this section. (a) For payments made pursuant to this section for day health care services rendered to patients who have AIDS or HIV-related illness and other high-need registrants, reimbursement shall be a single price per visit, with not more than one reimbursable visit per day per patient. For 1993 an initial price shall be determined taking into consideration reasonable projections of necessary costs, and the costs and statistics contained in proposed annual budgets for this service as defined in section\n759.1\n(d) of this Title, including, but not limited to, utilization, staffing and salaries. For subsequent rate periods the price established pursuant to this section shall be adjusted by the trend factor described in subdivision (e) of this section after considering the actual allowable expenditures and statistics for the year which ended 15 months prior to the rate period. (b) To be eligible to receive reimbursement pursuant to this section, a free-standing ambulatory care facility must be certified to provide general medical services and day health care services for AIDS/HIV patients and, effective April 1, 2017, to other high-need registrants. (c) The price established pursuant to this section shall be full reimbursement for the following: (1)\nphysician services, nursing services, and other related professional expenses directly incurred by the licensed facility, including the provision of triage or sick call services; (2)\nspace occupancy and plant overhead costs; (3)\nadministrative personnel, business office, data processing, recordkeeping, housekeeping, food services, transportation, and other related facility overhead expenses; (4)\nall ancillary services described in section\n759.8\nof this Title and laboratory tests and diagnostic X-ray services appropriate to the level of primary medical care required by the patient; (5)\nall medical supplies, immunizations, and drugs directly related to the provision of services. (d) Components of the price may be adjusted for service capacity, urban or rural location, and for regional differences in wage levels, space occupancy, and facility overhead costs, by comparing anticipated utilization and costs with actual experiences. The downstate region shall be defined as the counties of Putnam, Rockland, Westchester, Bronx, Kings, New York, Queens, Richmond, Nassau, and Suffolk and the upstate region shall be defined as all remaining counties in the State. (e) The commissioner shall establish trend factors to project increases in prices for the effective period of the reimbursement rates. The trend factors shall be developed using available price indices including elements of the United States Department of Labor consumer and producer price indices and special price indices developed by the Commissioner for this purpose. The projected trend factors shall be updated on an annual basis, based upon current and available data. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
