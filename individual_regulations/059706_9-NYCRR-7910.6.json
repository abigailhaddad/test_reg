  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 7910.6 - Program application for interest subsidy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Processing. Program applications for\ninterest subsidies will be processed upon their receipt by the Energy Office on\na first-come, first-served basis. (b) Application contents. Each program\napplication for an interest subsidy submitted to the Energy Office shall\ncontain the following materials: (1)\nA\ncompleted application form. (2)\n\nAn\nenergy audit or, a technical feasibility study, as appropriate, complying with\nthe requirements of section\n7910.7\nof this Part. (3)\n\nTwo construction bids, or in the case of\nin-house projects, schedules consistent with paragraph (4) of this subdivision, containing cost estimates for the energy conservation improvement project to be\nimplemented. Cost estimates and schedules must reflect the total installed cost\nof the project, including materials, labor, and construction management design\nfees. However, construction management fees greater than 15 percent of the cost\nof the materials and labor of the energy conservation improvement project are\nnot eligible for an interest subsidy. The Energy Office may, in its discretion, waive the two-bid requirement where the applicant demonstrates good cause for\nthe waiver. (4)\n\nIn the case of\nin-house projects, schedules of wages and projected hours to be worked on the\nproposed energy conservation improvement project, and two suppliers' estimates\nof the cost of the materials to be used for the project. Documentation of\nactual in-house labor costs incurred for approved projects shall be maintained\nby the applicant and may be reviewed by the Energy Office. (5)\n\nSimple payback calculations for each\nrecommended energy conservation improvement. Simple payback is to be calculated\nby dividing the total installed cost of the improvement presented in the\nselected contractor's bid, or in the applicant's schedules and selected\nestimate in the case of an in-house project, by the projected annual energy\ncost savings. Ongoing operation and maintenance costs, finance charges, and the\ncost of preparing and updating energy audits or technical feasibility studies\nshall not be included in the total installed cost. (6)\n\nEnergy savings calculations and\ncalculation sheets. (i) All recommended\nenergy conservation improvements must be accompanied by a full explanation of\nthe methodology used in calculating energy savings. The Energy Office may\nprovide standard calculation sheets, which must be used whenever\nprovided. (ii)\n\nIf standard\ncalculation sheets have not been provided by the Energy Office, the methodology\nused to calculate energy savings will be reviewed for adequacy and\nreasonableness by the Energy Office. (iii)\n\nThe projected annual energy cost\nsavings may include electric demand savings. (iv)\n\nFor submetering improvements, energy\nsavings of no greater than 15 percent shall be used. (7)\nA copy of the commitment issued by a\nfinancing institution to make a program loan, which shall include the terms of\nsuch loan, and which shall be submitted either with the application or\nfollowing a review of the rest of the application and a determination of\nproject eligibility by the Energy Office. (8)\n\nAuthorization from the building owner to\nundertake the energy conservation improvements where the program application is\nbeing submitted by someone other than the building owner. (9)\nA breakdown of construction management\nand design fees to be paid for out of the loan proceeds, if\napplicable. (10)\n\nFor projects\ninvolving submetering, proof of any required New York State Public Service\n\nCommission approval. (11)\n\nSuch\nadditional information as may be required by the Energy Office. (c) Notice of award. The Energy\n\nOffice will provide written notification to the applicant and the financing\ninstitution making the program loan of the Energy Office's approval of the\napplication and of the amount of the approved interest subsidy. Such notice may\nrequire that a program loan be made to the approved applicant within a time\nperiod to be specified by the Energy Office. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
