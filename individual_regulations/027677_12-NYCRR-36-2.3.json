Each building containing a place of public\nassembly and each tier or floor of same shall be provided with required exits\nas follows: Capacity of tier, floor, or building\n\nMinimum number of\nexits\n500 persons or less\n2\n501 to 1000 persons\n3\n1001 or more persons\n4\n(2)\n\nFor rooms. Every room or\ngroup of connected rooms having an aggregate floor area of 1,000 square feet or\nmore shall be provided with one or more exits opening onto an exitway. If the\narea of the room or group of connected rooms exceeds 1,500 square feet, or its\noccupancy exceeds 75 persons at least two exits shall be provided. (3)\n\nSmall basements. Basement or cellar floors with 500 square feet or less area require only one\nexit. (b) Location. (1)\n\nRemoteness. The required exits from any room, tier, or floor\nshall be remote from and independent of each other. (2)\n\nDistance of travel. The\ndistance of travel from any point on a tier or floor to the nearest required\nexit therefrom shall not exceed 100 feet except that in existing places such\ndistance shall not exceed 125 feet. This distance shall be measured along\nnormally travelled routes. (3)\n\nHazardous travel. No required exitway hereafter constructed\nshall lead through a kitchen, service pantry, boiler room or other space of\nsimilar hazard. (c) Type. Exits shall consist of grade exit doorways, interior or\nexterior stairways or ramps, or horizontal exits, except as may be otherwise\nspecified herein. (d) Aggregate widths of exitways. (1)\n\nDoorways and stairways. The necessary aggregate widths of doorways and stairways shall be determined by\nthe capacity of the places, floors or tiers they serve on the basis of 12\ninches of width for each 50 persons or fraction thereof. (2)\n\nExitways serving several\nplaces. Where one or more required exitways serve more than one tier\nor place of public assembly, the aggregate width of such exitways shall be\ndetermined as in the preceding paragraph for the combined capacities of the\ntiers or places served by such exitways. (3)\n\nTwo or more exitways. Where more than one exitway is required, the total necessary aggregate width\nshall be apportioned approximately equally among them. (4)\n\nStairs ending on main\nfloor. Where required interior stairways from any tier or floor\nterminate on the main floor, the aggregate width of exitways from the main\nfloor shall be increased so as to provide for not less than 100 per cent of the\npersons served by such stairways. (5)\n\nStairs serving two or more\nfloors. The aggregate required width of stairways serving two or more\nsuccessive floors or tiers shall be determined by adding 50 percent of the\nlesser required width to 100 percent of the greater required width of the two\nmost distant tiers and thereafter 50 percent of each successive tier.

All passageways and hallways shall\nhave clear widths at least equal to that required for the exits they serve at\nthe beginning but in no case less than 44 inches. If serving more than the\nbeginning exits their widths shall be increased sufficiently to serve at least\ntwo thirds of the aggregate number of persons served by the tributary exits. No\nreduction in width of passageway or hallway in the direction of exit travel is\npermitted. Exception: Existing passageways and hallways may have minimum widths\nof 36 inches. (5)\n\nWidth-how measured. The width of stairways shall be taken as\nthe length of the tread between stringers. The width of doorways shall be taken\nas the nominal width of the door leaves. (6)\n\nDoors in series. Doors\nin series may be used in exitways provided no single door between mullions is\nless than 22 inches. Mullions between doorways shall not exceed 15 inches and\nno credit for required exit width shall be allowed for fractional parts of 12\ninches in any doorway. A doorway shall be considered the space occupied by\nsingle or double doors between mullions or, for series doors without mullions, the space between doors when they are opened 90 degrees. (7)\n\nDoorway serving a\nstairway. The width of a doorway serving a required stairway shall be\nat least five sixths of the stairway width required for the tiers\nserved. (8)\n\nCourts.
