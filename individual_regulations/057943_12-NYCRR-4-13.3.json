A horizontal-return\ntubular boiler over 72 inches in diameter shall be supported from steel hangers\nby the outside suspension type of setting, independent of the boiler sidewalls. The hangers shall be so designed that the load is properly distributed between\nthe rivets attaching them to the shell and so that no more than two of these\nrivets come in the same longitudinal line on each hanger. The distance\ngirthwise of the boiler from the centers of the bottom rivets to the centers of\nthe top rivets attaching the hangers shall be not less than 12 inches. The\nother rivets used shall be spaced evenly between these points. If more than\nfour hangers are used they shall be set in four pairs. (b) Horizontal-return boilers 54 inches to 72\ninches in diameter. A horizontal-return tubular boiler over 54 inches and up to\nand including 72 inches in diameter shall be supported by the\noutside-suspension type of setting or at four points by not less than eight\nsteel or cast-iron brackets set in pairs. (c) Horizontal-return boilers 54 inches in\ndiameter or less. A horizontal-return tubular boiler up to and including 54\ninches in diameter shall be supported by the outside-suspension type of\nsetting, or by not less than two steel or cast-iron brackets on each\nside. (d) Lugs and hangers. Lugs\nand hangers, when used to support a boiler of any type, shall be properly\nfitted to the surfaces to which they are attached. Where it is impractical to\nattach them with rivets, studs with not less than 10 threads per inch may be\nused. If lugs, hangers or brackets are attached by fusion welding, they shall\nbe attached by fillet welds along the entire periphery or contact edges, and\nthe throat dimension of the attachment welds shall be at least 0.7 times the\nshell thickness.
