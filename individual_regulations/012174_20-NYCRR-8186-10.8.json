  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8186-10.8 - Special procedures for a new portion class\n\nState Regulations\n\nNotwithstanding any provision in this Subpart to the\ncontrary, where there was no taxable real property in a portion class on the\nbase assessment roll, and taxable real property appears in the portion class on\na subsequent assessment roll, the adjusted base proportions shall be determined\nas provided herein. (a) For the first\nassessment roll on which the portion class appears, the following applies: (1)\n\nThe current base proportion for the new\nportion class is zero. (2)\n\nThe\nadjusted base proportion for the portion class is the current base proportion\nadjusted for physical change as follows: (i) Determine the market value of the new portion class in the following manner: (a) Multiply the assessing unit class\nequalization rate for the appropriate class on the assessment roll immediately\npreceding the roll on which the new class first appears by the assessing unit\nclass change in level of assessment factor determined between the assessment\nroll immediately preceding the roll on which the portion class first appears\nand the assessment roll on which the portion class first appears. (b) Divide the taxable assessed value of the\nnew portion class on the assessment roll on which the new portion class first\nappears by the rate determined in clause (a) of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nDetermine the market value of\nthe existing class in the portion in the following manner: (a) Multiply the class equalization rate for\nthe portion class on the assessment roll immediately preceding the assessment\nroll on which the new portion class first appears by the appropriate class\nchange in level of assessment factor as determined in section\n8186-10.5\n(b)(1)\nof this Subpart. (b) Divide the\ntaxable assessed value of the class on the assessment roll on which the new\nportion class first appears by the appropriate rate determined in clause (a) of\nthis subparagraph. (iii)\n\nSum the market values obtained in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nDivide the class\nmarket value obtained in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph by the sum of the\nmarket values obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. The quotient\nobtained, expressed as a percentage to at least four decimal places to the\nright of the decimal point, is the adjusted base proportion for the new portion\nclass. (3)\n\nThe adjusted\nbase proportion for the other class is the remainder determined by subtracting\nthe adjusted base proportion for the new portion class determined in\nsubparagraph (2)(iv) of this subdivision from one. (b) For the assessment roll immediately\nsubsequent to the first assessment roll on which the new portion class appears, the following applies: (1)\n\nThe local base\nproportion for each portion class is the adjusted base proportion determined\nfor the first assessment roll on which the new portion class first\nappears. (2)\n\nThe current base\nproportion for each portion class is the local base proportion. (3)\n\nThe adjusted base proportion for each\nportion class is the current base proportion adjusted for physical change\noccurring between the first assessment roll on which the new portion class\nappears and the immediately subsequent assessment roll. The adjusted base\nproportions are determined in accordance with the procedures described in\nsection\n8186-10.5\nof this Subpart. (c) For\neach subsequent assessment roll the following applies: (1)\n\nThe base percentage for each portion\nclass shall be determined as follows: (i) Determine the estimated market value of the portion class, other than the new\nportion class, by dividing the taxable assessed value of the real property in\nthe portion class on the final assessment roll on which the new portion class\nfirst appears by the appropriate final class equalization rate determined by\nORPTS in accordance with the provisions of Subpart 8186-2 of this Part for such\nportion class on such roll. (ii)\n\nDetermine the estimated market value of the new portion class by dividing the\ntaxable assessed value of the real property in such portion class on the final\nassessment roll on which such portion class first appears by the final class\nequalization rate determined for the appropriate assessing unit class by ORPTS\nin accordance with the provisions of Subpart 8186-2 of this Part on such final\nassessment roll. (iii)\n\nDetermine\nthe total estimated market value of the portion by summing the estimated market\nvalue of each class obtained in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nDetermine the base\npercentage of each portion class by dividing the estimated market value of each\nclass obtained in subparagraph (i) or (ii) of this paragraph by the total\nestimated market value of the portion obtained in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. The base percentage shall be expressed as a percentage to at least\nfour places to the right of the decimal point. (2)\n\nThe current percentage for each portion\nclass shall be determined in the manner provided in section\n8186-10.3\nof this Subpart except that the class equalization rate used for the new\nportion class shall be the class equalization rate for the class in the\nassessing unit for the applicable assessment roll. The assessing unit class\nequalization rate shall be used until a class equalization rate for the new\nportion class is established. (3)\n\nThe local base proportion for each portion class is the adjusted base\nproportion determined for the first assessment roll on which the new portion\nclass first appears. (4)\n\nThe\ncurrent base proportions are determined in accordance with the procedures\ndescribed in section\n8186-10.3\nof this Subpart. (5)\n\nThe adjusted\nbase proportions are determined in accordance with the procedures described in\nsection\n8186-10.5\nof this Subpart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
