  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 404.6 - Fees for services\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The social services district must impose\nand provide for the collection of such fees for service as are required in the\nthen effective consolidated services plan or integrated county plan or, in the\ncase of child care services, the family share for such services required by\nsection\n415.3\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. Failure of the service recipient to pay a fee or family share as\nrequired in this section must lead to suspension or termination of the service\nfor which the fee or family share was imposed and not paid unless, in the case\nof child care services, satisfactory arrangements have been made, prior to the\nsuspension or termination of such services, for the service recipient to make\nfull payment of all delinquent family shares. No subsequent application nor any\nreapplication by the service recipient for any service suspended or terminated\nby reason of the failure to pay a required fee or family share will be\nconsidered until such time as all delinquent fees are paid or, in the case of\nchild care services, unless and until arrangements satisfactory to the social\nservices district are made for the service recipient to make full payment of\nall delinquent family shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing, failure of the\nservice recipient to pay a fee or family share must not be a basis for denial\nor discontinuance of services as part of a plan of protective services for an\nadult or a child or for preventing placement of a child in foster\ncare. (b) Methods of\ncollection. (1)\n\nThe social services\ndistrict must advise the recipient in writing, at the time of the initial\neligibility determination and each redetermination, of the required fee amount, the date(s) such fee is due and the payment procedures to be followed. The\nnotice of the fee requirements must be included in the written notice of\neligibility. A provider must also be notified when a recipient is required to\npay a fee, if the provider is required to collect the fees for the service. Such notification to the provider must contain the amount of the fee and the\ndate(s) such fee is due. (2)\n\nIf a\nfee is not paid by the specified date, the social services district, or the\nprovider, when appropriate, must immediately give a written notice of the fee\npast due in person or by mail to the service recipient. Such notice must\ninclude a warning of impending termination of the service for continued\nnonpayment and specify the time period within which such payment must be made\nor, in the case of child care services, the time period within which\nsatisfactory arrangements for such payment must be made. Such time period may\nbe no less than seven days and no more than 30 days. If payment is not received\nor, in the case of child care services if arrangements, satisfactory to the\nsocial services district, for full payment of all delinquent fees by the\nservice recipient, have not been made within the time period specified in the\nwritten notice that the fee is past due, then the social services district must\ngive written notice of termination of service in person or by mail to the\nservice recipient. The notice of termination of service must state that the\nservice will be terminated 10 days subsequent to the date of the notice unless\npayment of all delinquent fees is received prior to the date of termination or, in the case of child care services, unless and until arrangements, satisfactory\nto the social services district, are made for the service recipient to make\nfull payment of all delinquent fees. Copies of the warning and termination\nnotices must be maintained in the recipient's basic data file. (c) Claiming. Fees imposed upon service recipients in accordance with\nthis section shall be deducted from the amount of expenditures for such\nservices for which Federal and State reimbursement is claimed.
