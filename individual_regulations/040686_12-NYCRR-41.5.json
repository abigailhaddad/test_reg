  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 41.5 - Safety requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Obstructions. During a performance the space through which, and the area upon\nwhich a performer may fall shall be kept free of hard, rigid or sharp\nobstructions. Essential parts of the apparatus used in the performance shall\nnot be deemed to constitute obstructions unless they are of a character and in\na location likely to cause serious injury to a falling performer. (b) Unnecessary persons. During the\nperformance all persons except necessary performers and assistants shall be\nstationed outside the zone and area of possible fall. (c) Safety belts and harnesses. Every safety\nbelt or harness shall be attached to the person of the performer using it in\nsuch manner that it cannot seriously injure the performer in a fall or become\ndetached by a fall or become inadvertently detached during the performance. It\nshall be connected during the performance to a safe support either directly or\nby means of a life line secured at both ends so that it cannot be inadvertently\ndetached. The length of such life line shall be such as to prevent the\nperformer from striking any hard, rigid or sharp obstruction or the surface\nbeneath the apparatus if he should fall therefrom. (d) Loops. Loops shall not be deemed to\nconstitute safety devices unless they be closely and securely attached to the\napparatus and so attached to the performer that they cannot be inadvertently\ndetached during the performance. (e) Life nets. Every life net used as safety\ndevice shall have an area not less than the area of possible fall of all\nperformers for whose protection it is used. It shall be located throughout the\nperformance so as to cover the total area of possible fall. It shall be\nsupported at a height sufficient to prevent sagging to the surface beneath when\ncushioning the fall of the performers. If supported manually, a sufficient\nnumber of competent persons shall be assigned to hold it securely at such\nheight. If supported mechanically, the supports shall be located entirely\noutside of and beyond the area of possible fall. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n41.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
