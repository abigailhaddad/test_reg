  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.11 - Decision-making and findings requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior to the lead agency's decision on an\naction that has been the subject of a final EIS, it shall afford agencies and\nthe public a reasonable time period (not less than 10 calendar days) in which\nto consider the final EIS before issuing its written findings statement. If a\nproject modification or change of circumstance related to the project requires\na lead or involved agency to substantively modify its decision, findings may be\namended and filed in accordance with section\n617.12\n(b) of this Part. (b) In the case of an\naction involving an applicant, the lead agency's filing of a written findings\nstatement and decision on whether or not to fund or approve an action must be\nmade within 30 calendar days after the filing of the final EIS. (c) No involved agency may make a final\ndecision to undertake, fund, approve or disapprove an action that has been the\nsubject of a final EIS, until the time period provided in subdivision (a) of\nthis section has passed and the agency has made a written findings statement. Findings and a decision may be made simultaneously. (d) Findings must: (1)\nconsider the relevant environmental\nimpacts, facts and conclusions disclosed in the final EIS; (2)\nweigh and balance relevant environmental\nimpacts with social, economic and other considerations; (3)\nprovide a rationale for the agency's\ndecision; (4)\ncertify that the\nrequirements of this Part have been met; and\n(5)\ncertify that consistent with social, economic and other essential considerations from among the reasonable\nalternatives available, the action is one that avoids or minimizes adverse\nenvironmental impacts to the maximum extent practicable, and that adverse\nenvironmental impacts will be avoided or minimized to the maximum extent\npracticable by incorporating as conditions to the decision those mitigative\nmeasures that were identified as practicable. (e) No state agency may make a final decision\non an action that has been the subject of a final EIS and is located in the\ncoastal area until the agency has made a written finding that the action is\nconsistent with applicable policies set forth in 19 NYCRR\n600.5. When the\n\nSecretary of State has approved a local government waterfront revitalization\nprogram, no state agency may make a final decision on an action, that is likely\nto affect the achievement of the policies and purposes of such program, until\nthe agency has made a written finding that the action is consistent to the\nmaximum extent practicable with that local waterfront revitalization\nprogram.
