  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 §§ 30-3.4 - Standards and criteria for conducting annual professional performance reviews of classroom teachers under Education Law section 3012-d\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annual\nprofessional performance reviews conducted under this section shall\ndifferentiate teacher effectiveness resulting in a teacher being rated highly\neffective, effective, developing or ineffective based on multiple measures in\ntwo categories: the student performance category and the teacher observation\ncategory. (b) Student performance\ncategory. The student performance category shall have one required\nsubcomponent and one optional subcomponent as follows: (1)\n\nRequired first subcomponent. (i) Each teacher shall have a student\nlearning objective (SLO) using a form prescribed by the commissioner, consistent with the SLO process determined or developed by the commissioner, that results in a student growth score based on a State-created or\n-administered assessment or other approved student assessment. The SLO process\ndetermined by the commissioner shall include a minimum growth target of one\nyear of expected growth. Such targets may take the following characteristics\ninto account: poverty, students with disabilities, English language learner\nstatus, and prior academic history; provided, however, that the selection and\nuse of the assessment for the SLO shall be subject to collective bargaining. SLOs shall include the following SLO elements, as defined by the commissioner\nin guidance: (a) student\npopulation; (b) learning\ncontent; (c) interval of\ninstructional time; (d) evidence; (e) baseline; (f) target; (g) criteria for rating a teacher highly\neffective, effective, developing or ineffective (HEDI); and\n(h) rationale. (ii)\n\nDistricts shall collectively bargain the\nselection and use of a State-created or administered assessment or other\napproved student assessment as the underlying evidence for a teacher's SLO. Such SLO may be either teacher- and course-specific or based on school-, program-, district-, or BOCES-wide group, team, or linked results. (2)\n\nOptional second subcomponent. (i) A district may collectively bargain a\nsecond measure that shall be applied in a consistent manner, to the extent\npracticable, across the district based on a State-created or administered\nassessment or State-designed supplemental assessment. Such second measure shall\nbe either: (a) A second SLO, provided that\nthis SLO is different than that used in the required subcomponent of the\nteacher's evaluation; (b) a growth\nscore based on a statistical growth model, where available, for either a\n\nState-created or -administered assessment or a State-designed supplemental\nassessment; (c) a measure of\nstudent growth, other than an SLO, based on State-created or - administered\nassessments or State-designed supplemental assessments; (d) a performance index based on\n\nState-created or administered assessments or approved student\nassessments; (e) an achievement\nbenchmark on State-created or administered assessments or approved student\nassessments; or\n(f) any other\ncollectively bargained measure of student growth or achievement included in the\ndistrict's evaluation plan as approved by the commissioner. (ii)\n\nWhere appropriate, growth or\nachievement targets may consider the following student-level characteristics: poverty, English language learner status, disability status, and/or prior\nacademic history. (iii)\n\nThe\ndistrict shall measure student growth or achievement in the optional\nsubcomponent using the same measure(s) for all classroom teachers in a course\nand/or grade level in a district. (3)\n\nWeighting of subcomponents within student\nperformance category. (i) If a district does\nnot locally select to use the optional second student performance subcomponent, then the required subcomponent shall be weighted at 100 percent. (ii)\n\nIf the optional second student\nperformance subcomponent is selected, then the weighting of the required and\noptional subcomponents shall be determined locally, subject to approval by the\ncommissioner in the submitted evaluation plan. Each measure used in the student performance category\n(i.e., required SLOs, collectively bargained second student performance\nmeasures) must result in a score between 0 and 20. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs in accordance with the\nminimum percentages prescribed in the table below; provided, however, that for\nteachers with courses with small \"n\" sizes as defined by the commissioner in\nguidance, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs using a methodology\nprescribed by the commissioner in guidance and for teachers in the City School\n\nDistrict of the City of New York, districts shall calculate scores for SLOs\nusing the methodology approved by the commissioner in its APPR plan. For all\nother measures that are not SLOs, scores of 0-20 shall be computed pursuant to\na process described in the district's annual professional performance review\nplan as approved by the commissioner. SLOs\n\nPercent of Students Meeting Target Scoring Range\n0-4% 0\n5-8% 1\n9-12% 2\n13-16% 3\n17-20% 4\n21-24% 5\n25-28% 6\n29-33% 7\n34-38% 8\n39-43% 9\n44-48% 10\n49-54% 11\n55-59% 12\n60-66% 13\n67-74% 14\n75-79% 15\n80-84% 16\n85-89% 17\n90-92% 18\n93-96% 19\n97-100% 20\n(iii)\n\nFor the City School District of the\n\nCity of New York, scores for SLOs that are based on the percentage of students\nmeeting a target shall be calculated in accordance with the minimum percentages\nbelow: SLOs\n\nPercent of Students Meeting Target Scoring Range\n0-9% 0\n10-19% 1\n20-29% 2\n30-39% 3\n40-49% 4\n50-59% 5\n60-62% 6\n63-65% 7\n66-68% 8\n69-71% 9\n72-74% 10\n75-77% 11\n78-80% 12\n81-83% 13\n84-86% 14\n87-89% 15\n90-91% 16\n92-93% 17\n94-95% 18\n96-97% 19\n98-100% 20\n\nAny other district may submit a variance request to the\ndepartment pursuant to section\n30-3.16\nof this Subpart to use the\nscoring ranges described in this subparagraph. (4)\n\nOverall rating on student performance\ncategory. (i) Multiple student performance\nmeasures shall be combined using a weighted average pursuant to paragraph (3)\nof subdivision (b) of this section to produce an overall student performance\ncategory score of 0 to 20. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, based on such score, an overall student performance category\nrating shall be derived from the table below: Minimum Maximum\nH 18 20\nE 15 17\nD 13 14\nI 0 12\n(ii)\n\nFor the City School District of the City\nof New York, an overall student performance category rating shall be derived\nfrom the table below: Minimum Maximum\nH 16 20\nE 11 15\nD 6 10\nI 0 5\n\nAny other district may submit a variance request to the\ndepartment pursuant to section\n30-3.16\nof this Subpart to use the\ntable above to compute the overall student performance rating category\nrating. (c) Teacher observation category. The\nobservation category for teachers shall be based on at least two observations, one of which must be unannounced. (1)\n\nTwo\nrequired subcomponents. (i) At least one\nobservation shall be conducted by a principal or other trained administrator; and\n(ii)\n\nAt least a second\nobservation shall be conducted by one or more impartial independent trained\nevaluator(s) selected and trained by the district or in cases where a hardship\nwaiver is granted by the department pursuant to clause (a) of this\nsubparagraph, a second observation shall be conducted by one or more evaluators\nselected and trained by the district, who are different than the evaluator(s)\nwho conducted the evaluation pursuant to subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or\nin cases where a hardship waiver is granted by the department pursuant to\nclause (b) of this subparagraph, a second observation shall be conducted as\nprescribed in clause (b) of this subparagraph. An independent trained evaluator\nmay be employed within the district but may not be assigned to the same school\nbuilding as the teacher being evaluated. (a) a rural school district, as defined by the commissioner in guidance, or a\nschool district with only one registered school pursuant to section\n100.18\nof the commissioner's\nregulations may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual\nbasis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by the commissioner, if due to the\nsize and limited resources of the school district, it is unable to obtain an\nindependent evaluator within a reasonable proximity without an undue burden to\nthe school district; (b) a school\ndistrict may apply to the department for a hardship waiver on an annual basis, in a timeframe and manner prescribed by the commissioner, if the school\ndistrict believes that compliance with this requirement would create an undue\nburden on the school district in one or more of the following areas: compliance\nwith the independent evaluator requirement would result in financial hardship; the district lacks professionally trained staff to comply with the independent\nevaluator requirement; the district has a large number of teachers; and/or\ncompliance with the independent evaluator requirement could impact safety and\nmanagement of a building. A hardship waiver granted by the department under\nthis clause shall excuse, but not prohibit, school districts from conducting\nobservations by impartial independent trained evaluators for teachers who\nreceived a rating of highly effective, effective, or developing in the\npreceding school year (e.g., school districts would be excused, but not\nprohibited, from conducting observations by impartial independent trained\nevaluators for the 2019-2020 school year for teachers who receive a rating of\nhighly effective, effective, or developing for the 2018-2019 school year; school districts would be required to conduct observations by impartial\nindependent trained evaluators for the 2019-2020 school year for, at a minimum, teachers who receive a rating of ineffective for the 2018-2019 school year). For teachers who are excused from the impartial independent trained evaluator\nrequirement pursuant to a hardship waiver granted by the department under this\nclause, school districts shall conduct a second observation, provided that such\nsecond observation may be conducted by the building principal/supervisor or any\nindividual selected and trained by the school district. The two observations\nfor such teachers could be performed by the same individual. As part of its\nhardship waiver request, a school district shall submit a plan for conducting\nobservations by the building principal or other individual selected and trained\nby the school district in lieu of the impartial independent trained evaluator\nsubcomponent. For the other teachers in the district who must still receive a\nsecond observation by an impartial, independent trained evaluator (teachers\nwho, at a minimum, received an ineffective rating in the preceding school\nyear), the district must submit a plan for conducting such observations. Once a\nhardship waiver is approved by the department, it shall be considered part of\nthe school district's annual professional performance review plan for such\nschool year. (2)\n\nOptional third subcomponent. The\nobservation category may include a third optional subcomponent based on\nclassroom observations conducted by a trained peer teacher rated effective or\nhighly effective on their overall rating in the prior school year from the same\nschool or from another school in the district. (3)\n\nFrequency and duration of observations. The frequency and duration of observations shall be determined\nlocally. (4)\n\nAll observations must\nbe conducted using a teacher practice rubric approved by the commissioner\npursuant to a request for qualification (RFQ) process, unless the district has\nan approved variance from the commissioner. (i) Variance for existing rubrics. A variance\nmay be granted to a district that seeks to use a rubric that is either a close\nadaptation of a rubric on the approved list, or a rubric that was\nself-developed or developed by a third-party, upon a finding by the\ncommissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the request for\nqualification and the district has demonstrated that it has made a significant\ninvestment in the rubric and has a history of use that would justify continuing\nthe use of that rubric. (ii)\n\nVariance for use of new innovative rubrics. A variance may be granted to a\ndistrict that seeks to use a newly developed rubric, upon a finding by the\ncommissioner that the rubric meets the criteria described in the RFQ, has\ndemonstrated how it will ensure inter-rater reliability and the rubric's\nability to provide differentiated results over time. (5)\n\nAll observations for a teacher for the\nschool year must use the same approved rubric; provided that districts may\nlocally determine whether to use different rubrics for teachers who teach\ndifferent grades and/or subjects during the school year. (6)\n\nAt least one of the required observations\nmust be unannounced. (7)\n\nObservations may occur either live or via recorded video, as determined\nlocally. (8)\n\nNothing in this\n\nSubpart shall be construed to limit the discretion of a board of education, superintendent or a principal or other trained administrator to conduct\nobservations in addition to those required by this section for non-evaluative\npurposes. (9)\n\nThe evaluator may\nselect a limited number of rubric subcomponents for focus within a particular\nobservation, so long as all observable subcomponents are addressed across the\ntotal number of annual observations. (10)\n\nNew York State teaching\nstandards/domains that are part of the rubric but not observable during the\nclassroom observation may be observed during any optional pre-observation\nconference or post-observation review or other natural conversations between\nthe teacher and the evaluator and incorporated into the observation\nscore. (11)\n\nPoints shall not be\nallocated based on any artifacts, unless such artifact constitutes evidence of\nan otherwise observable rubric subcomponent (e.g., a lesson plan viewed during\nthe course of the observation may constitute evidence of professional\nplanning). (12)\n\nEach subcomponent\nof the selected practice rubric shall be evaluated on a 1-4 scale based on a\n\nState-approved rubric aligned to the New York State teaching standards and an\noverall score for the observation subcomponents and category shall be generated\nbetween 1-4. Such subcomponent and category scores shall incorporate all\nevidence collected and observed over the course of the school year. Scores for\neach subcomponent of the observation category shall be combined using a\nweighted average pursuant to paragraph (13) of this subdivision, producing an\noverall observation category score between 1-4. In the event that a teacher\nearns a score of 1 on all rated components of the practice rubric across all\nobservations, a score of 0 will be assigned. (13)\n\nWeighting of subcomponents within\nteacher observation category. The weighting of the subcomponents within the\nteacher observation category shall be established locally within the following\nconstraints: (i) observations conducted by a\nprincipal or other trained administrator shall be weighted at a minimum of 80\npercent; (ii)\nobservations\nconducted by independent impartial observer(s), or other evaluators selected by\nthe district if a hardship waiver is granted, shall be weighted at a minimum of\n10 percent; (iii)\nif a district\nselects to use the optional third observation subcomponent, then the weighting\nassigned to the optional observations conducted by peers shall be established\nlocally within the constraints outlined in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph. (14)\n\nOverall\nrating on the teacher observation category. The overall observation score\ncalculated pursuant to this subdivision shall be converted into an overall\nrating, using cut scores determined locally for each rating category; provided\nthat such cut scores shall be consistent with the permissible ranges identified\nbelow: Overall Observation Category Score and Rating\n\nMinimum Maximum\nH 3.5 to 3.75 4.0\nE 2.5 to 2.75 3.49 to 3.74\nD 1.5 to 1.75 2.49 to 2.74\nI 0 1.49 to 1.74\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
