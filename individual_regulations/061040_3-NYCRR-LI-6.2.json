  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 6.2 - Time of payment of service charge on premium advanced by insurance premium finance agency\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department\nwas asked whether it was legally permissible for a premium finance agency to\ntake the service charge authorized by section\n568\n(4)\nof the Banking Law in one lump sum at the\nbeginning of the related transaction or whether it must, on the contrary, pro-rate such charge over the life of the repayment contract and collect it\nperiodically along with installments of principal. (b) The department, after a careful review of\nthe legislative history of article XII-B of the Banking Law and with particular\nemphasis on section 568(1), forbidding agencies from taking any greater charges\nthan are permitted by that article, concluded that payment of the full service\ncharge at the beginning of the contract rather than in installments over its\nterm would constitute an expense to the borrower greater than that contemplated\nby the statute, since a \"front end\" payment of the service charge would\nimmediately deprive the borrower of the use of the money concerned. Such an\nincrease in the actual cost of the financing to the consumer was not, in the\ndepartment's view intended by the Legislature and hence is legally\nimpermissible. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\nLI 6.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
