  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1025.26 - Index of hazardous materials\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To determine which restrictions, if any, apply to the transportation of a hazardous material known by name--e.g., acetone: (1)\n\nLocate name of hazardous\nmaterial (as noted on shipping papers) in the alphabetical listing of hazardous\nmaterials which follow (section\n1025.27\n[g]\nof\nthis Part). (2)\n\nIn column 3, note\nhazard class. (Acetone is classified as a flammable liquid.)\n(3)\n\nIn column 4, note the UN and NA numbers, used in emergency response actions, and refer to the publication HAZARDOUS\nMATERIALS--1980 EMERGENCY RESPONSE HANDBOOK. (For example, acetone has UN\nnumber 1090.)\n(4)\n\nIn column 5, find\nsection and subdivision numbers which refer directly to applicable\nrestrictions. For acetone, references are 1025.14 (g), (j), that is, section\n1025.14, subdivisions (g) and\n(j) (5)\n\nTurn to section number\nreferences in column 5. (In our example, it is section\n1025.14, flammable liquids.) Then, going down the left-hand margin of the referenced section, locate the\nsubdivision number or numbers also indicated in column 5. In our example, subdivision (g) limits the capacity and type of container that may be\ntransported via the Queens Midtown Tunnel, the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel or the\n\nVerrazano-Narrows Bridge Lower Level, while making due provision for the\npassage of empty containers, and prohibiting the passage of loaded or empty\ntank vehicles. Subdivision (j) has slightly different restrictions, based upon\nthe use of inside containers. (b) To determine which restrictions, if any, apply to the transportation of a hazardous material whose specific name is not\nknown, but whose general class is indicated in the shipping papers: (1)\n\nLocate, in the alphabetical index column\n2, the name of the general class of material with which the unnamed article is\nnormally identified, e.g., \"Flammable liquids, n.o.s.,\" \"Corrosive liquid, n.o.s.,\" etc. (2)\n\nProceed as in\nparagraphs (a)(3)-(5) of this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1025.26\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
