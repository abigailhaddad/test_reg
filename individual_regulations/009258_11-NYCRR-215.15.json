  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 215.15 - Introductory, initial or special offers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAn advertisement of an individual policy shall not directly or by implication represent that a contract or combination of contracts is an introductory, initial or special offer, or that applicants will receive substantial advantages not available at a later date, or that the offer is available only to a specified group of individuals, unless such is the fact. An advertisement shall not describe an enrollment period as \"special\", or \"limited\", or use similar words or phrases when the insurer uses enrollment periods as the usual method of advertising accident and sickness insurance. (2)\n\nAn enrollment period during which a particular insurance product may be purchased on an individual basis shall not be offered within the same marketing area unless there has been a lapse of not less than six months between the close of the immediately preceding enrollment period for the same product and the opening of the new enrollment period. The advertisement shall indicate the date by which the applicant must mail the application which shall be not less than 10 days and not more than 40 days from the date that such enrollment period is advertised for the first time. This rule applies to all advertising media, i.e., mail, newspapers, radio, television, magazines and periodicals, by any one insurer. It is inapplicable to solicitations of employees or members of a particular group or association which otherwise would be eligible under specific provisions of the New York Insurance Law for group, blanket or franchise insurance. The phrase \"any one insurer\" includes all the affiliated companies of a group of insurance companies under common management or control. (3)\n\nThis rule prohibits any statement or implication to the effect that only a specific number of policies will be sold, or that a time is fixed for the discontinuance of the sale of the particular policy advertised because of special advantages available in the policy, unless such is the fact. (4)\n\nThe phrase \"a particular insurance product\" in paragraph (2) of this subdivision means an insurance policy which provides substantially different benefits than those contained in any other policy. Different terms of renewability; an increase or decrease in the dollar amounts of benefits; an increase or decrease in any elimination period or waiting period from those available during an enrollment period for another policy shall not be sufficient to constitute the product being offered as a different product eligible for concurrent or overlapping enrollment periods. (b) An advertisement shall not offer a policy which utilizes a reduced initial premium rate in a manner which overemphasizes the availability and the amount of the initial premium. (c) Special awards, such as a \"safe drivers' award\" shall not be used in connection with the advertisements of accident and health insurance. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
