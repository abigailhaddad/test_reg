  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 334.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSubdivision (c)(3) of section\n51\nof the Retirement and Social Security Law\nprovides that excess contributions may be withdrawn by a member at any time\nprior to retirement; if not so withdrawn, excess contributions are used to\npurchase additional annuity. To assist retiring members in the selection of an\noptional settlement of their retirement benefit, the Retirement System prepares\nand forwards to the member an estimate of benefit plans available upon\nretirement. The estimate also sets forth the amount of the additional annuity\nwhich may be purchased with excess contributions not withdrawn before\nretirement. When available prior to the effective date of retirement, the\nestimate will bear on a member's decision to either withdraw excess\ncontributions or accept the annuity. In some instances, however, a member may\nreceive the estimate too near the effective date of retirement to permit an\nintelligent, informed decision to be made and communicated to the Retirement\n\nSystem; or, the estimate may not be received until after the effective date of\nretirement, in which case the member is precluded from withdrawing the excess\ncontributions and must accept the annuity, however disadvantageous it may be. The proposed regulation is promulgated to grant those members who do not\nreceive a timely retirement estimate the opportunity to withdraw excess\ncontributions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n334.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
