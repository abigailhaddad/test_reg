  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 516.6 - Referral, service, amendment and withdrawal of charges\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Referral. (1)\n\nIn general. Referral is an order of a\nconvening authority that charges against an accused will be tried by a\nspecified court-martial. (2)\n\nWho\nmay refer. Any convening authority may refer charges to a court-martial\nconvened by that convening authority or a predecessor, unless the power to do\nso has been withheld by superior competent authority. (3)\n\nDisqualification. An accuser may not\nrefer charges to a general or special court-martial. (4)\n\nWhen charges may be referred. (i) Basis for referral. If the convening\nauthority finds or is advised by a judge advocate that there are reasonable\ngrounds to believe that an offense triable by a court-martial has been\ncommitted and that the accused committed it, and that the specification alleges\nan offense, the convening authority may refer it. The finding may be based on\nhearsay in whole or in part. The convening authority or judge advocate may\nconsider information from any source and is not limited to the information\nreviewed by any previous authority, but a case may not be referred to a general\ncourt-martial except in compliance with subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. The convening authority or judge advocate is not required before charges are\nreferred to resolve legal issues, including objections to evidence, which may\narise at trial. (ii)\n\nGeneral\ncourts-martial. The convening authority may not refer a specification under a\ncharge to a general court-martial unless: (a) there has been substantial compliance with the pretrial investigation\nrequirements of N.Y.R.C.M. 405; and\n(b) the convening authority has received the\nadvice of the staff judge advocate required under N.Y.R.C.M. 406. These requirements may be waived by the accused. (5)\n\nHow\ncharges are referred. (i) Order, instructions. Referral is made by the personal order of the convening\nauthority. The convening authority may include proper instructions in the\norder. (ii)\n\nJoinder of offenses. In\nthe discretion of the convening authority, two or more offenses charged against\nan accused may be referred to the same court-martial for trial, whether serious\nor minor offenses or both, regardless whether related. Additional charges may\nbe joined with other charges for a single trial at any time before arraignment\nif all necessary procedural requirements concerning the additional charges have\nbeen compiled with. After arraignment of the accused upon charges, no\nadditional charges may be referred to the same trial without consent of the\naccused. (iii)\n\nJoinder of accused. Allegations against two or more accused may be referred for joint trial if the\naccused are alleged to have participated in the same act or transaction or in\nthe same series of acts; or transactions constituting an offense or offenses. Such accused may be charged in one or more specifications together or\nseparately, and every accused need not be charged in each specification. Related allegations against two or more accused which may be proved by\nsubstantially the same evidence may be referred to a common trial. (6)\n\nSuperior convening\nauthorities. Except as otherwise provided in these rules, a superior competent\nauthority may cause charges, whether or not referred, to be transmitted to that\nauthority for further consideration, including, if appropriate, referral. (b) Service of\ncharges. The trial counsel detailed to the court-martial to which charges have\nbeen referred for trial must cause to be served upon each accused a copy of the\ncharge sheet. In time or peace, no person may, over objection, be brought to\ntrial, including a session under ML, 130.39(a) before a general court-martial\nwithin a period of five days after service of charges, or before a special\ncourt-martial within a period of three days after service of charges. In\ncomputing these periods, the date of service of charges and the date of trial\nare excluded; holidays and Sundays are included (ML, 130.35). (c) Changes to charges and specifications. (1)\n\nMinor changes defined. Minor changes in\ncharges and specifications are any except those which add a party, offense, or\nsubstantial matter not fairly included in those previously preferred, or which\nare likely to mislead the accused as to the offenses charged. (2)\n\nMinor changes before arraignment. Any\nperson forwarding, acting upon, or prosecuting charges on behalf of the State\nexcept an investigation officer appointed under N.Y.R.C.M. 405 may make minor\nchanges to charges or specifications before arraignment. (3)\n\nMinor changes after arraignment. After\narraignment the military judge may, upon motion, permit minor changes in the\ncharges and specifications at any time before findings are announced if no\nsubstantial right of the accused is prejudiced. (4)\n\nMajor changes. Changes or amendments to\ncharges or specifications other than minor changes may not be made over the\nobjection of the accused unless the charge or specification affected is\npreferred anew. (d) Withdrawal of charges. (1)\n\nWithdrawal. The\nconvening authority or a superior competent authority may for any reason proper\ncause any charges or specifications to be withdrawn from a court-martial at any\ntime before findings are announced. (2)\n\nReferral of withdrawn charges. Charges\nwhich have been withdrawn from a court-martial may be referred to another\ncourt-martial unless the withdrawal was for an improper reason. Charges\nwithdrawn after the introduction of evidence on the general issue of guilt may\nbe referred to another court-martial only if the withdrawal was necessitated by\nurgent and unforeseen military necessity.
