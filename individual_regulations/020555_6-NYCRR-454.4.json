(b) Plan view\ndiagrams of nonstandard test sites are shown in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3\nillustrates a test site which is larger than a standard test site and is based\nupon a 60-foot (18.3 m) distance between the microphone location point and the\nmicrophone target point. (See section\n454.5\n[b][1]\nof\nthis Part for an example of\n\nImage\nthe application of the correction factor to a sound level\nreading obtained at such a site.)
