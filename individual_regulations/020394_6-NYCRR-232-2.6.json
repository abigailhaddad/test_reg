  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 232-2.6 - Operation and maintenance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Perc dry\ncleaning facilities must be maintained and operated to minimize the release of\nperc to the environment. (b) Trained\noperators must operate and maintain all components of the perc dry cleaning\nsystem in accordance with the requirements of this Subpart and the conditions\nspecified in the facility's operating permit. For operations not specifically\naddressed in this Subpart, the components must be operated and maintained in\naccordance with the manufacturer's recommendations. (c) Trained operators must complete all\nfunctions on the operational and maintenance checklist supplied by the\ndepartment and note the action taken, the date it was performed and the trained\noperator's initials on the form. Completed checklists must be maintained\non-site for at least five years from the last inspection date\nrecorded. (d) Trained operators must\ncomply with the following operation and maintenance requirements, as\napplicable: (1)\n\nThird and fourth generation\nperc dry cleaning machines. (i) Refrigerated\ncondensers must be operated and maintained in compliance with section\n232-2.4\n(a)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart and otherwise in accordance with manufacturer's\nspecifications. (ii)\n\nCarbon\nadsorbers installed on fourth generation machines must be operated to ensure\nthat exhaust gases are recirculated at the operating temperature designed for\nthe equipment, or specified by the manufacturer, for optimum\nadsorption. (iii)\n\nCartridge filters\nand adsorptive cartridge filters must be handled using one of the following\nmethods prior to disposal: (a) Drained in the\nfilter housing for no less than 24 hours for cartridge filters and 48 hours for\nadsorptive cartridge filters. If the filters are then transferred to a separate\ndevice to further reduce the volume of perc, this treatment must be done in a\nsystem that routes any vapor to a primary closed-loop control system, with no\nexhaust to the atmosphere. When performing such a transfer, the general exhaust\nventilation system must be operating and the filter housing must be closed as\nsoon as possible to minimize vapor leaks. (b) Dried, stripped, sparged, or otherwise\ntreated, within the sealed filter housing, to reduce the volume of perc\ncontained in the filter. (iv)\n\nAll steam and condensing coils must be\nmaintained free of lint and hard lint build-up on interior surfaces. (v) Button and lint traps must be cleaned on\nthe manufacturer's suggested intervals and at least once each working day and\nthe lint must be placed in a tightly sealed container. Operations must be\nperformed so that the opening of such traps is done as quickly as possible with\nthe local or general exhaust ventilation system operating to minimize perc\nemissions. (2)\n\nAncillary\nequipment. (i) Stills and muck cookers must\nnot vent emissions into the facility nor be operated in a manner that exceeds\n75 percent of the rated capacity or other alternate value recommended by the\nmanufacturer. Stills and muck cookers must be cooled to 100° F (38° C) or less\nbefore being emptied or cleaned. (ii)\n\nWastewater treatment units treating\nperc-contaminated waste. (a) Carbon\nfiltration units - carbon cartridges must be replaced in accordance with\nmanufacturer's specifications. (b) Evaporators - evaporators treating perc-contaminated wastewater must meet the\nrequirements of section\n232-2.7\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart and be operated to ensure that no liquid perc or visible emulsion is\nallowed to vaporize. (3)\n\nThe following equipment must be\nmaintained according to the recommended manufacturer's specifications: (i) hose and pipe connections, fittings, couplings, and valves; (ii)\ndoor\ngaskets and seatings; (iii)\nfilter\ngaskets and seatings; (iv)\npumps; (v) water\nseparators; (vi)\nstills; (vii)\ncartridge filter housings; and\n(viii)\ndrying\nsensors. (4)\n\nPreparedness\nand prevention. (i) All perc dry cleaning\noperations must be equipped with the following: (a) adequate spill control equipment\nincluding sorbent materials, or an alternative method for absorbing\nspills; (b) vapor-proof containers\nfor storing spill-contaminated material; and\n(c) fire control\nequipment. (ii)\n\nSufficient aisle space must be maintained to allow proper inspection of the dry\ncleaning equipment. (iii)\nA\nreasonable supply of commonly replaced spare parts for repairing perc dry\ncleaning equipment must be available at the dry cleaning\nfacility. (5)\n\nAll parts\nof the perc dry cleaning system, including solvent containers where perc may be\nemitted to the atmosphere, must be kept closed at all times except when access\nis required for proper operation and maintenance. (6)\n\nPerc process tanks must be refilled using\na closed-loop delivery system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n232-2.6\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register February 28, 2018/Volume XL, Issue 09, eff. 3/9/2018\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
