Tit. 3 § 6.10 - Investment in a public deposit bank subsidiary by a savings bank or savings and loan association\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Banking Board hereby finds that the\npromulgation of this section is consistent with the policy of the State of New\n\nYork as declared in section 10 of the New York Banking Law and thereby protects\nthe public interest, including the interests of depositors, creditors, shareholders, stockholders and consumers and is necessary to achieve or\nmaintain parity between savings banks and savings and loan associations\n(hereafter thrift institutions) and Federal savings associations with respect\nto rights, powers, privileges, benefits, activities, loans, investments or\ntransactions. (b) The Banking Board\nhereby finds that title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, section 559(3)(3) and\n(g), promulgated pursuant to title\n12\n\nUnited States Code, section\n1462\net seq., permit a Federal savings association to invest without limitation as to amount\nin the shares of a subsidiary which is an insured depository institution, including an insured depository institution which may accept deposits of public\nmoneys. (c) For purposes of this\nsection, public deposit bank subsidiary means a bank as that term is defined in\ntitle\n12\n\nUnited States Code, section\n1841(c)(1): (1)\nmore than 50 percent of the voting shares\nof which are owned, directly or indirectly, by the thrift institution with no\nother person or entity exercising effective operating control; and\n(2)\nwhich accepts only deposits of public\nmoneys and the other types of deposits as enumerated in title\n12\n\nUnited States Code, section\n1841(a)(5)(E)(ii). (d) Subject to receipt of any\nrequired regulatory approvals, a thrift institution may invest in a public\ndeposit bank subsidiary without limitation as to amount; provided, however, that if such investment would cause the aggregate amount invested by such\nthrift institution in such subsidiary to exceed one per centum of the assets of\nsuch thrift institution, it may do so upon 30 days prior written notice to the\nsuperintendent unless the superintendent notifies the thrift institution within\nsuch 30-day period that: (1)\nhe or she\nrequires additional time or information in connection with the proposed\ninvestment; or\n(2)\nthe proposed\ninvestment may not be made. The proposed investment must be permitted by the\norganization certificate of the public deposit bank subsidiary. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
