  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.30 - Containment buildings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to owners or\noperators who store or treat hazardous waste in units designed and operated\nunder subdivision (b) of this section. The owner or operator is not subject to\nthe definition of land disposal in section\n370.2\n(b) of this\n\nTitle provided that the unit: (1)\nis a\ncompletely enclosed, self-supporting structure that is designed and constructed\nof human made materials of sufficient strength and thickness to support\nthemselves, the waste contents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that\noperate within the unit, and to prevent failure due to pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift, physical contact with the hazardous wastes\nto which they are exposed; climatic conditions; and the stresses of daily\noperation, including the movement of heavy equipment within the unit and\ncontact of such equipment with containment walls; (2)\nhas a primary barrier that is designed to\nbe sufficiently durable to withstand the movement of personnel, wastes, and\nhandling equipment within the unit; (3)\nif the unit is used to manage liquids, has: (i) a primary barrier designed and\nconstructed of materials to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into\nthe barrier; (ii)\na liquid\ncollection system designed and constructed of materials to minimize the\naccumulation of liquid on the primary barrier; and\n(iii)\na secondary containment system designed\nand constructed of materials to prevent migration of hazardous constituents\ninto the barrier, with a leak detection and liquid collection system capable of\ndetecting, collecting, and removing leaks of hazardous constituents at the\nearliest practicable time, unless the unit has been granted a variance from the\nsecondary containment system requirements under subparagraph (b)(2)(iv) of this\nsection; (4)\nhas controls\nsufficient to prevent fugitive dust emissions to meet the no visible emission\nstandard in clause (b)(3)(i)(\nd\n) of this section; and\n(5)\nis designed and operated to ensure\ncontainment and prevent the tracking of materials from the unit by personnel or\nequipment. (b) Design and operating standards. (1)\n\nAll containment buildings must comply\nwith the following design standards: (i) The\ncontainment building must be completely enclosed with a floor, walls, and a\nroof to prevent exposure to the elements (\ne.g., precipitation, wind, run-on), and to assure containment of managed wastes. (ii)\n\nThe floor and containment walls of the\nunit, including the secondary containment system if required under paragraph\n(2) of this subdivision, must be designed and constructed of materials of\nsufficient strength and thickness to support themselves, the waste contents, and any personnel and heavy equipment that operate within the unit, and to\nprevent failure due to pressure gradients, settlement, compression, or uplift, physical contact with the hazardous wastes to which they are exposed; climatic\nconditions; and the stresses of daily operation, including the movement of\nheavy equipment within the unit and contact of such equipment with containment\nwalls. The unit must be designed so that it has sufficient structural strength\nto prevent collapse or other failure. All surfaces to be in contact with\nhazardous wastes must be chemically compatible with those wastes. DEC will\nconsider standards established by professional organizations generally\nrecognized by the industry such as the American Concrete Institute (ACI) and\nthe American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM) in judging the structural\nintegrity requirements of this paragraph. If appropriate to the nature of the\nwaste management operation to take place in the unit, an exception to the\nstructural strength requirement may be made for light-weight doors and windows\nthat meet these criteria: (a) they provide an\neffective barrier against fugitive dust emissions under clause\n(3)(i)(\nd\n) of this subdivision; and\n(b) the unit is designed and operated in a\nfashion that assures that wastes will not actually come in contact with these\nopenings. (iii)\n\nIncompatible hazardous wastes or treatment reagents must not be placed in the\nunit or its secondary containment system if they could cause the unit or\nsecondary containment system to leak, corrode, or otherwise fail. (iv)\nA containment building must have a\nprimary barrier designed to withstand the movement of personnel, waste, and\nhandling equipment in the unit during the operating life of unit and\nappropriate for the physical and chemical characteristics of the waste to be\nmanaged. (2)\n\nFor a\ncontainment building used to manage hazardous wastes containing free liquids or\ntreated with free liquids (the presence of which is determined by the paint\nfilter test, a visual examination, or other appropriate means), the owner or\noperator must include: (i) a primary barrier\ndesigned and constructed of materials to prevent the migration of hazardous\nconstituents into the barrier (\ne.g., a geomembrane covered by\na concrete wear surface); (ii)\na\nliquid collection and removal system to minimize the accumulation of liquid on\nthe primary barrier of the containment building: (a) the primary barrier must be sloped to\ndrain liquids to the associated collection system; and\n(b) liquids and waste must be collected and\nremoved to minimize hydraulic head on the containment system at the earliest\npracticable time; (iii)\na\nsecondary containment system including a secondary barrier designed and\nconstructed to prevent migration of hazardous constituents into the barrier, and a leak detection system that is capable of detecting failure of the primary\nbarrier and collecting accumulated hazardous wastes and liquids at the earliest\npracticable time. (a) The requirements of the\nleak detection component of the secondary containment system are satisfied by\ninstallation of a system that is, at a minimum: (1)\nconstructed with a bottom slope of one\npercent or more; and\n(2)\nconstructed of a granular drainage material with a hydraulic conductivity of 1\n×- 10\n-2\ncm/sec or more and a thickness of 12\ninches (30.5 cm) or more, or constructed of synthetic or geonet drainage\nmaterials with a transmissivity of 3 ×- 10\n-5\nm\n2\n/sec or more. (b) If treatment is to be conducted in the\nbuilding, any area in which such treatment will be conducted must be designed\nto prevent the release of liquids, wet materials, or liquid aerosols to other\nportions of the building. (c) The\nsecondary containment system must be constructed of materials that are\nchemically resistant to the waste and liquids managed in the containment\nbuilding, and of sufficient strength and thickness to prevent collapse under\nthe pressure exerted by overlaying materials and by any equipment used in the\ncontainment building. (Containment buildings can serve as secondary containment\nsystems for tanks placed within the building under certain conditions. A\ncontainment building can serve as an external liner system for a tank, provided\nit meets the requirements of section\n373-2.10\n[d][5][i]\nof this Subpart. In addition, the containment building must meet the\nrequirements of section\n373-2.10\n[d][2], and [3][I] and [ii] of this Subpart to be considered an acceptable secondary\ncontainment system for a tank). (iv)\n\nFor existing units other than 90-day\ngenerator units, the commissioner may accept a determination made by the EPA\nadministrator to delay the secondary containment requirement for up to two\nyears, based on a demonstration by the owner or operator that the unit\nsubstantially meets the standards of this section. In making this\ndemonstration, the owner or operator must: (a) have provided written notice to the EPA administrator of such request by\n\nNovember 16, 1992. This notification must describe the unit and its operating\npractices with specific reference to the performance of existing containment\nsystems, and specific plans for retrofitting the unit with secondary\ncontainment; (b) respond to any\ncomments from the EPA administrator on these plans within 30 days; and\n(c) fulfill the terms of the\nrevised plans, if such plans are approved by the EPA administrator. (3)\n\nOwners or operators\nof all containment buildings must: (i) use\ncontrols and practices to ensure containment of the hazardous waste within the\nunit; and, at a minimum: (a) maintain the\nprimary barrier to be free of significant cracks, gaps, corrosion, or other\ndeterioration that could cause hazardous waste to be released from the primary\nbarrier; (b) maintain the level of\nthe stored/treated hazardous waste within the containment walls of the unit so\nthat the height of any containment wall is not exceeded; (c) take measures to prevent the tracking of\nhazardous waste out of the unit by personnel or by equipment used in handling\nthe waste. An area must be designated to decontaminate equipment and any\nrinsate must be collected and properly managed; and\n(d) take measures to control fugitive dust\nemissions such that any openings (doors, windows, vents, cracks, etc.) exhibit\nno visible emissions (see 40 CFR part\n60, Appendix A, Method 22-Visual\n\nDetermination of Fugitive Emissions from Material Sources and Smoke Emissions\nfrom Flares [see section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle]). In addition, all associated particulate collection devices (e.g., fabric filter, electrostatic precipitator) must be operated and maintained with\nsound air pollution control practices (see 40 CFR part\n60\nsubpart 292 for\nguidance [see section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle]). This state of no visible emissions must be maintained effectively at\nall times during routine operating and maintenance conditions, including when\nvehicles and personnel are entering and exiting the unit; (ii)\nobtain, and keep on-site, certification\nby an independent, qualified professional engineer registered in New York State\nthat the containment building design meets the requirements of paragraphs (1)\nthrough (3) of this subdivision. (iii)\nthroughout the active life of the\ncontainment building, if the owner or operator detects a condition that could\nlead to or has caused a release of hazardous waste, the owner or operator must\nrepair the condition promptly, in accordance with the following procedures: (a) upon detection of a condition that has\nled to a release of hazardous waste (e.g., upon detection of leakage from the\nprimary barrier) the owner or operator must: (1)\nenter a record of the discovery in the\nfacility operating record; (2)\nimmediately remove from service the portion of the containment building\naffected by the condition; (3)\ndetermine what steps must be taken to repair the containment building, remove\nany leakage from the secondary collection system, and establish a schedule for\naccomplishing the cleanup and repairs; and\n(4)\nwithin seven days after the discovery of\nthe condition, notify the commissioner of the condition, and within 14 working\ndays, provide a written notice to the commissioner with a description of the\nsteps taken to repair the containment building, and the schedule for\naccomplishing the work; (b) the commissioner will review the\ninformation submitted, make a determination regarding whether the containment\nbuilding must be removed from service completely or partially until repairs and\ncleanup are complete, and notify the owner or operator of the determination and\nthe underlying rationale in writing; (c) upon completing all repairs and cleanup\nthe owner or operator must notify the commissioner in writing and provide a\nverification, signed by a qualified professional engineer registered in New\n\nYork State, that the repairs and cleanup have been completed according to the\nwritten plan submitted in accordance with subclause (a)(4) of this\nsubparagraph; and\n(iv)\ninspect and record in the facility's operating record, at least once every\nseven days, data gathered from monitoring equipment and leak detection\nequipment as well as the containment buildings and the area immediately\nsurrounding the containment building to detect signs of releases of hazardous\nwaste. (4)\n\nFor a\ncontainment building that contains both areas with and without secondary\ncontainment, the owner or operator must: (i) design and operate each area in accordance with the requirements enumerated in\nparagraphs (1) through (3) of this subdivision; (ii)\ntake measures to prevent the release of\nliquids or wet materials into areas without secondary containment; and\n(iii)\nmaintain in the\nfacility's operating log a written description of the operating procedures used\nto maintain the integrity of areas without secondary containment. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding any other\nprovision of this section, the commissioner may waive requirements for\nsecondary containment for a permitted containment building where the owner or\noperator demonstrates that the only free liquids in the unit are limited\namounts of dust suppression liquids required to meet occupational health and\nsafety requirements, and where containment of managed wastes and liquids can be\nassured without a secondary containment system. (c) Closure and post-closure\ncare. (1)\n\nAt closure of a containment\nbuilding, the owner or operator must remove or decontaminate all waste\nresidues, contaminated containment system components (liners, etc.)\ncontaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste and\nleachate, and manage them as hazardous waste unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for\nclosure, and financial responsibility for containment buildings must meet all\nof the requirements specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nIf, after removing or decontaminating all\nresidues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or decontamination\nof contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the owner or operator finds that not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed or decontaminated, the owner\nor operator must close the facility and perform post-closure requirements that\napply to landfills (see section\n373-2.14\n[g]\nof\nthis Subpart). In addition, for the purposes of closure, post-closure, and\nfinancial responsibility, such a containment building is then considered to be\na landfill, and the owner or operator must meet all of the requirements for\nlandfills specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart.
