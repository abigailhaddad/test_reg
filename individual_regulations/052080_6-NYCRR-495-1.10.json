  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 495-1.10 - SF[6] Phase-Out Exemption and GIE Failure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Pursuant to section 495-1.4(a)(1) of this\n\nPart, a GIE owner who wishes to acquire SF\n6\nGIE after\nthe applicable phase-out date indicated in sections 495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part\nmay submit, in a manner to be determined by the department, an\nSF\n6\nphase-out exemption request that, if approved, would\nallow the GIE owner to acquire the requested SF\n6\nGIE. (1)\n\nBeginning September 1, 2026, a GIE owner\nmay submit an SF\n6\nphase-out exemption request if, based\non bids received, one of the following conditions are met: (i) non-SF\n6\nGIE of the\nequipment type and GIE characteristics necessary for the particular project(s)\nor application(s) are unavailable from at least two original equipment\nmanufacturers; (ii)\navailable\nnon-SF\n6\nGIE cannot meet the size requirements for the\nparticular project(s) or application(s), taking into consideration the physical\nsize of the GIE, the physical constraints of the project location(s), including\nrequired clearance; (iii)\navailable\nnon-SF\n6\nGIE cannot be used for the specific project(s)\nor application(s) due to incompatibility with existing equipment, wiring, or\nconnectors; or\n(iv)\navailable\nnon-SF\n6\nGIE cannot meet required technical\nspecifications and/or are not suitable based on the GIE owner's documented\nsafety or reliability requirements. (2)\n\nMultiple GIE. Whenever a GIE owner\nintends to apply for an exemption for multiple SF\n6\nGIE\nof the same equipment type and GIE characteristics, for which the justification\nis identical, the GIE owner may submit a single request to cover all associated\nSF\n6\nGIE. In this case, the GIE owner must specify the\nnumber of SF\n6\nGIE it is requesting to acquire under the\nexemption and list the locations where the SF\n6\nGIE would\nbe installed but does not need to identify which specific\nSF\n6\nGIE device would be installed at each\nlocation. (3)\n\nRequired Information. The SF\n6\nphase-out exemption request must contain the\nfollowing information. If the department determines that the information\nprovided as part of the request is insufficient to serve as the basis for an\nexemption under this section, the department may request additional information\nand/or deny the request. (i) GIE owner's name\nand identification number (if assigned). (ii)\n\nAuthorized representative's name, official title, mailing address, phone number, and email address. (iii)\nA description of the specific\nproject(s) to which the SF\n6\nphase-out exemption would\napply including location(s); a description of the type of location(s) such as\nunderground vaults with a certain configuration or all substations with a\ncertain configuration; whether it is an existing or new facility; if it has\nbeen subject to a process that significantly changes the in-place\ninfrastructure such as through overhaul or re-powering; and the number of each\ntype of GIE device that would be installed in each location. (iv)\n\nWhether or not the requested GIE would\ninitially be Spare GIE. (v) Description and quantity of SF\n6\nGIE to be exempted, including but not limited to the GIE characteristics per sections\n495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part, equipment type, seal type, manufacturer and model, and nameplate capacity. (vi)\n\nManufacturer information including the names of manufacturers that were\ncontacted about the availability of non-SF\n6\nGIE that\nmight be appropriate for use in the type of project(s) and the dates contact\nwas initiated; manufacturers that submitted bids; and a description of the\nuniverse of entities eligible to bid based on the bidding process used by the\nGIE owner (e.g., public solicitation, qualified vendor list). (vii)\n\nThe appropriate attestation statement\nfrom section 495-1.8(c) of this Part, including that the requirements pursuant\nto section 495-1.10(a)(4) of this Part were met. (viii)\n\nThe section number under which the\nexemption is being submitted, or Part 495-1(a)(1)(i)-(iv), and the applicable\njustifications for the exemption pursuant to section 495-1.10(a)(4) of this\n\nPart. (4)\n\nApplicable\n\nJustifications. The following justifications may be provided as follows: (i) For exemptions submitted under section\n495-1.10(a)(1)(i) of this Part, the specific GIE characteristics per section\n495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part that cannot be met by at least two original\nequipment manufacturers. (ii)\n\nFor\nexemptions submitted under section 495-1.10(a)(1)(ii) of this Part, the\ncomplete dimensions of each space within which requested\nSF\n6\nGIE would reside; the complete dimensions of each\navailable non-SF\n6\nGIE that meets the GIE characteristics\nper sections 495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part identified by the equipment\nmanufacturer(s); the complete dimensions of the SF\n6\nGIE; and a picture showing the space where the SF\n6\nGIE would\nbe installed. If the dimensions of the non-SF\n6\nGIE are\nsmaller than the dimensions of the space available, but the device cannot be\nplaced into the space for another reason (e.g., the space lacks the necessary\nclearance, another obstacle prevents transport of the device to the space), the\njustification should also include a description of the constraint that clearly\ndemonstrates why the device cannot be placed in the available space. (iii)\n\nFor exemptions submitted under section\n495-1.10(a)(1)(iii) of this Part, a list of available\nnon-SF\n6\nGIE that meet the GIE characteristics per\nsections 495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part identified by the equipment\nmanufacturer(s) and a justification that clearly explains why each of the\navailable non-SF\n6\nGIE identified are incompatible and\nhow the SF\n6\nGIE described in section 495-1.10(a)(1)(iv)\nof this Part is compatible. (iv)\n\nFor exemptions submitted under section 495-1.10(a)(1)(iv) of this Part, a list\nof available non-SF\n6\nGIE that meets the GIE\ncharacteristics per sections 495-1.4(b)-(c) of this Part identified by the\nequipment manufacturer(s) and a justification that clearly explains why each of\nthe available non-SF\n6\nGIE identified fail to meet the\ntechnical specifications and/or the GIE owner's documented safety or\nreliability requirements and how the SF\n6\nGIE described\nin section 495-1.10(a)(1)(iv) of this Part does meet the requirements. If\nfailure rates or other indicators of reliability are used, specific details\nmust be provided. If the GIE owner's justification cites a company-specific\npolicy or procedure that available non-SF\n6\nGIE does not\ncurrently meet and that is within the control of the GIE owner (e.g., the\ncompany requires three years of testing for new equipment), the justification\nmust also provide an explanation as to how the GIE owner will address the\nsituation to enable the transition to non-SF\n6\nalternatives in a timely manner. (5)\n\nAny information submitted that relies on\ndocumentation provided by an equipment manufacturer must be dated less than 180\ndays prior to the submission of the SF\n6\nphase-out\nexemption request. (6)\nA GIE owner\nwith an approved SF\n6\nphase-out exemption may order the\nspecific SF\n6\nGIE described in the\nSF\n6\nphase-out exemption within 12 months of the\ndepartment's approval of the request. If the SF\n6\nGIE is\nnot ordered within the specified timeframe, the GIE owner must submit another\nSF\n6\nphase-out exemption request. SF\n6\nGIE acquired utilizing an SF\n6\nphase-out exemption must be active GIE within 24 months of delivery to the GIE\nowner. (b) In the event\nof a failure of an active GIE device that, in the estimation of the GIE owner\nmay only be resolved through the activation of a spare GIE or acquisition of\nSF\n6\nGIE that would otherwise require an\nSF\n6\nexemption, the GIE owner may acquire an\nSF\n6\nGIE device with the same GIE characteristics as the\nfailed or spare GIE without prior approval from the department but must\nmaintain a record as part of the GIE inventory pursuant to section 495-1.6 of\nthis Part for the data year in which the failure occurred.
