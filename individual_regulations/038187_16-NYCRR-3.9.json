The notice shall contain the following: (i) a general description of the issues that\nmay be settled; (ii)\na list of the\npersons or parties to the negotiations; and\n(iii)\na certification by a duly authorized\nrepresentative of the utility that all appropriate persons and parties have\nbeen or will be notified of the pendency of negotiations in a manner so as to\npermit a reasonable time for preparation. (2)\n\nThe Administrative Law Judge assigned to\nthe case shall review the notice to ensure all persons who reasonably should\nhave been notified of the pendency of the negotiations have been afforded a\nreasonable opportunity to participate. The Administrative Law Judge may take\nany action necessary to protect the rights of persons participating or desiring\nto participate in the negotiations or who reasonably should have been notified\nof the pendency of negotiations. The Administrative Law Judge shall report the\nresults of the procedural review to the commission. (b) Notification required for settlement\ndiscussions in pending proceedings involving small utilities.[FN2] The\nprocedures for notification of impending negotiations in cases involving small\nutilities shall be the same as set forth in subdivision (a) of this section\nexcept, that if an Administrative Law Judge has not been assigned to the\nproceeding, the director of the appropriate division will carry out those\nresponsibilities assigned to the Administrative Law Judge in paragraph (a)(2)\nof this section. (c) Notification\nrequired for settlement discussions in anticipation of a formal proceeding. (1)\n\nIn the event the potential to settle\nissues between adverse entities arises outside the context of a formal\nproceeding or in anticipation of a formal filing, a utility shall file a notice\nof intention to negotiate with the secretary and shall give notice to all\npersons who participated in either of the subject utility's two most recent\nproceedings of the same or similar type as that in which the settlement\nnegotiations are proposed and to any other person reasonably known to have an\ninterest in the outcome of negotiations and can reasonably be expected to\nengage actively in the negotiations. The notice shall contain the same\ninformation as required by paragraph (a)(1) of this section. (2)\n\nThe utility shall be responsible to\ndetermine the list of potential parties and, in the event of uncertainty, may\nseek guidance through the secretary's office. (3)\n\nThe responsibilities outlined in\nparagraph (a)(2) of this section shall be carried out by the Administrative Law\n\nJudge, if one is assigned, or by the director of the appropriate division, if\nan Administrative Law Judge is not assigned. (d) Confidentiality of settlement\ndiscussions. No discussion, admission, concession or offer to stipulate or\nsettle, whether oral or written, made during any negotiation session concerning\na stipulation or settlement shall be subject to discovery, or admissible in any\nevidentiary hearing against any participant who objects to its admission. Participating parties, their representatives and other persons attending\nsettlement negotiations shall hold confidential such discussions, admissions, concessions, and offers to settle and shall not disclose them outside the\nnegotiations except to their principals, who shall also be bound by the\nconfidentiality requirement, without the consent of the parties participating\nin the negotiations. The Administrative Law Judge assigned to the case, or the\ndirector of the appropriate division if no Administrative Law Judge has been\nassigned, may impose appropriate sanctions for the violation of this\nsubdivision which may include exclusion from the settlement process. (e) Confidentiality in mediations. The\nconfidentiality provisions set forth in subdivision (d) of this section shall\napply to a neutral and any agent or employee of the Department of Public\n\nService participating in a mediated proceeding.

In particular, any oral or written communication prepared for the\npurpose of a mediated proceeding (mediation communication), shall not be\nrequired to be disclosed. A written agreement to enter into a mediated\nproceeding or reached as a final result of such proceeding, or any\ncommunication the parties agree is public information, is not a mediation\ncommunication.
