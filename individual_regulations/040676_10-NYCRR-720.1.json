Tit. 10 § 720.1 - General hospital accreditation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nhospitals must comply with the operational standards set forth in Part 405 of\nthis Title. The commissioner may accept as evidence of compliance with the\nminimum operational standards of Part 405 of this Title accreditation by an\naccreditation agency to which the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services\nhas granted deeming status and which the commissioner has determined has\naccrediting standards sufficient to assure the commissioner that hospitals so\naccredited are in compliance with such operational standards.

A list of accreditation agencies with which the\ndepartment has a collaborative agreement will be posted on the department's\nwebsite. These provisions shall apply provided that: (1)\nthere are no constraints placed upon\nrelease of the accreditation agency survey report, plan of correction, interim\nself-evaluation report, certificate of accreditation, notice on noncompliances, or such other material which the commissioner has accepted under this section; and\n(2)\nthe hospital is at all\ntimes subject to a survey for compliance with Part 405 of this Title as deemed\nnecessary by the commissioner.
