  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-2.31 - Hazardous waste munitions and explosives storage\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. The requirements of this section apply to owners or\noperators who store munitions and explosive hazardous wastes, except as section\n373-2.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (\nNote: Depending on explosive\nhazards, hazardous waste munitions and explosives may also be managed in other\ntypes of storage units, including containment buildings [section\n373-2.30\nof this Subpart], tanks[section\n373-2.10\nof this Subpart], or\ncontainers [section\n373-2.9\nof this Subpart]; see\nsection\n374-1.13\n(f) of\nthis Title for storage of waste military munitions). (b) Design and operating\nstandards. (1)\n\nHazardous waste\nmunitions and explosives storage units must be designed and operated with\ncontainment systems, controls, and monitoring, that: (i) minimize the potential for detonation or\nother means of release of hazardous waste, hazardous constituents, hazardous\ndecomposition products, or contaminated run-off, to the soil, ground water, surface water, and atmosphere; (ii)\nprovide a primary barrier, which may be a container (including a shell) or\ntank, designed to contain the hazardous waste; (iii)\nfor wastes stored outdoors, provide\nthat the waste and containers will not be in standing precipitation; (iv)\nfor liquid wastes, provide a secondary\ncontainment system that assures that any released liquids are contained and\npromptly detected and removed from the waste area, or vapor detection system\nthat assures that any released liquids or vapors are promptly detected and an\nappropriate response taken (\ne.g., additional containment, such\nas overpacking, or removal from the waste area); and\n(v) provide monitoring and inspection\nprocedures that assure the controls and containment systems are working as\ndesigned and that releases that may adversely impact human health or the\nenvironment are not escaping from the unit. (2)\n\nHazardous waste munitions and explosives\nstored under this section may be stored in one of the following: (i) Earth-covered magazines. Earth-covered\nmagazines must be: (a) constructed of\nwaterproofed, reinforced concrete or structural steel arches, with steel doors\nthat are kept closed when not being accessed; (b) designed and constructed: (1)\nto be of sufficient strength and\nthickness to support the weight of any explosives or munitions stored and any\nequipment used in the unit; (2)\nto\nprovide working space for personnel and equipment in the unit; and\n(3)\nto withstand movement activities that\noccur in the unit; and\n(c) located and designed, with walls and\nearthen covers that direct an explosion in the unit in a safe direction, so as\nto minimize the propagation of an explosion to adjacent units and to minimize\nother effects of any explosion. (ii)\n\nAbove-ground magazines. Above-ground\nmagazines must be located and designed so as to minimize the propagation of an\nexplosion to adjacent units and to minimize other effects of any\nexplosion. (iii)\n\nOutdoor or open\nstorage areas. Outdoor or open storage areas must be located and designed so as\nto minimize the propagation of an explosion to adjacent units and to minimize\nother effects of any explosion. (3)\n\nHazardous waste munitions and explosives\nmust be stored in accordance with a standard operating procedure specifying\nprocedures to ensure safety, security, and environmental protection. If these\nprocedures serve the same purpose as the security and inspection requirements\nof section\n373-2.2\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart, the preparedness and prevention procedures of section\n373-2.3\nof this Subpart, and the\ncontingency plan and emergency procedures requirements of section\n373-2.4\nof this Subpart, then these\nprocedures will be used to fulfill those requirements. (4)\n\nHazardous waste munitions and explosives\nmust be packaged to ensure safety in handling and storage. (5)\n\nHazardous waste munitions and explosives\nmust be inventoried at least annually. (6)\n\nHazardous waste munitions and explosives\nand their storage units must be inspected and monitored as necessary to ensure\nexplosives safety and to ensure that there is no migration of contaminants out\nof the unit. (c) Closure and post-closure care. (1)\n\nAt closure of a magazine or unit which\nstored hazardous waste under this section, the owner or operator must remove or\ndecontaminate all waste residues, contaminated containment system components, contaminated subsoils, and structures and equipment contaminated with waste, and manage them as hazardous waste unless section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title applies. The closure plan, closure activities, cost estimates for\nclosure, and financial responsibility for magazines or units must meet all of\nthe requirements specified in sections 373-2.7 and\n373-2.8\nof this Subpart, except\nthat the owner or operator may defer closure of the unit as long as it remains\nin service as a munitions or explosives magazine or storage unit. (2)\n\nIf, after removing or decontaminating all\nresidues and making all reasonable efforts to effect removal or decontamination\nof contaminated components, subsoils, structures, and equipment as required in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the owner or operator finds that not all\ncontaminated subsoils can be practicably removed or decontaminated, he or she\nmust close the facility and perform post-closure care in accordance with the\nclosure and post-closure requirements that apply to landfills (see section\n373-2.14\n[g]\nof\nthis Subpart).
