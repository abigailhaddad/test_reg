Tit. 14 § 681.10 - Buildings and equipment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [\nReserved\n]\n(b) Additional design and space considerations applicable to SRU's as\nidentified in section\n681.1\n(f) of this\n\nPart. (1)\n\nSmall residential units\nshall be designed with outward appearances comparable to typical single-family\nresidences. If more than one SRU is constructed on a single piece of\n\nState-owned land, the placement of such facilities shall be consistent with\nlocal zoning requirements and surrounding home placements. (2)\n\nPersons served in such facilities shall\nparticipate in community-based day and recreational programs. Exceptions to\nthis requirement may only be made for documented need of the person based on\nthe annual review, and approval of the commissioner. (3)\n\nSpecial attention shall be given in the\ndesign of these facilities so that they are fully accessible in all features\nand equipment to persons with physical disabilities. (4)\n\nTo the extent practicable, SRU's shall be\nphysically separate from existing developmental center buildings and not in\nclose proximity to other SRU's. Thus, siting of these facilities shall be on\npublic roads bordering the community at large to ensure that the facilities are\ndistant and unrelated to the developmental center. (5)\n\nThe maximum allowable capacity shall be\nno more than 12 beds. Lower SRU capacities shall be designed for whenever\nfeasible. (6)\n\nSmall residential\nunits shall be operated using their own support services and shall, whenever\npossible, obtain those support services from resources in the community at\nlarge. (7)\n\nLandscaping\nconsiderations shall be incorporated into the overall design of each facility\nso as to promote community integration. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
