  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 360.22 - Financial assurance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. Except as otherwise provided in this Part or in Parts 361, 362, 363, 365, or Subpart 374-2 of this Title, the owner or operator of a facility\nthat requires financial assurance must comply with the requirements of this\nsection. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in 360.4 of\nthis Part, each owner or operator of a facility required to obtain financial\nassurance must provide continuous coverage beginning no later than 60 days\nprior to the initial receipt of waste and until released by the department from\nfinancial assurance requirements by demonstrating compliance with the\napplicable closure, post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures\nrequirements pertaining to the facility, and demonstrating that the facility\nand any waste remaining at the facility do not pose a threat to public health\nor the environment. (b) Closure, post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures cost\nestimates. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of any\nfacility required to obtain financial assurance, other than a landfill, must\nhave a detailed written estimate, in current dollars, of the cost of hiring a\nthird party to perform closure in compliance with the requirements in section\n360.21\nof this Part and Subpart\n374-2 of this Title. (i) At a minimum, the\nclosure cost estimate must include the cost to load, transport and dispose of\nthe maximum permitted storage capacity at that facility. Cost estimates must\nalso include or reflect the design, materials, equipment, labor, administration, and quality assurance for closure in accordance with the\nfacility-specific closure plan. Additional financial assurance may be required\non a site-specific basis if the potential exists for storage beyond the\npermitted storage capacity. (ii)\n\nThe closure cost estimate must not incorporate any salvage value that may be\nrealized with the sale of materials, facility structures or equipment, land, or\nother assets associated with the facility at the time of closure. (iii)\n\nThe total closure cost estimate must be\nincreased by a contingency factor of at least 15 percent for estimates up to\n$100,000, 10 percent for estimates between $100,000 and $1 million, and five\npercent for estimates above $1 million. (iv)\n\nThe supporting documentation used to\nsubstantiate the closure cost estimates must be submitted to the department for\nreview with the cost estimates. (v) The closure cost estimates must be submitted to the department for\napproval. (2)\n\nThe owner\nor operator of a landfill must have a detailed written estimate, in current\ndollars, of the cost of hiring a third party to perform closure, post-closure\ncare, custodial care, and, if necessary, corrective measures in compliance with\nthe requirements in this Part, Part 363 of this Title, and a\ndepartment-approved closure plan, post-closure care plan, custodial care plan\nand corrective measures plan. (i) At a\nminimum, the closure cost estimate must equal the cost to close the greatest\nnumber of landfill cells which, at any given point during the lifetime of the\nfacility, have received waste but have not undergone final closure, as\nindicated by the closure plan. (a) The\nclosure cost estimates must include or reflect the design, materials, equipment, labor, administration, and quality assurance for closure in\naccordance with the facility-specific closure plan. (b) The closure cost estimate for a\nlandfill's preliminary closure plan must include the costs of developing final\nclosure, post closure care and custodial care plans as well as the costs to\nprepare engineering drawings and specifications, bidding documents, and other\nconstruction-related documents. (c) The closure cost estimate must not incorporate any salvage value that may be\nrealized with the sale of materials, facility structures or equipment, land, or\nother assets associated with the facility at the time of closure. (ii)\n\nAt a minimum, the\npost-closure care cost estimate must be based on the number of landfill cells\nthat are actively receiving waste and those that have undergone final closure, as indicated by the post-closure care plan. The post-closure care cost estimate\nmust account for the total costs of conducting post-closure care, including\nannual and periodic costs, as well as replacement costs related to the\npredicted service life of landfill components as described in the post-closure\ncare plan, over a rolling 30-year post-closure care period. (iii)\n\nAt a minimum, the custodial care cost\nestimate must be based on the number of landfill cells that have undergone\nfinal closure, as indicated by the custodial care plan. The custodial care cost\nestimate must account for the total costs of conducting custodial care after\nthe landfill concludes post-closure care activities, including annual and\nperiodic costs, as well as replacement costs related to the predicted service\nlife of landfill components as described in the custodial care plan, over a\nrolling 30-year custodial care period. The initial custodial care cost estimate\nmust be submitted to the department as part of the demonstration that the\nthreat to public health or the environment has been reduced to a level where\nenvironmental monitoring and maintenance can be reduced. (iv)\n\nThe corrective measures cost estimate\nmust account for the total costs of corrective measures as described in the\ncorrective measures work plan for the entire corrective measures period as\ndescribed in Subpart 363-10 of this Title. (v) The total cost estimate must be increased\nby a contingency factor of at least 15 percent for estimates up to $100,000, ten percent for estimates between $100,000 and $1 million, and five percent for\nestimates above $1 million. (vi)\n\nThe supporting documentation used to substantiate the cost estimates must be\nsubmitted to the department for review with the cost estimates. (vii)\n\nThe closure, post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures cost estimates must be submitted to the\ndepartment for approval. (3)\n\nAnnual cost estimate adjustments. (i) During the active life of a facility, other than a landfill that requires financial assurance, the owner or operator\nmust annually submit to the department for review and approval adjusted closure\ncost estimates, including supporting justification to account for inflation and\nchanges in facility conditions. (ii)\n\nDuring the active life of a landfill and\nduring its closure, post-closure care, and custodial care periods, the owner or\noperator must annually submit to the department for review and approval\nadjusted closure, post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures\ncost estimates including supporting justification to account for inflation and\nchanges in facility conditions. (iii)\n\nThe adjusted cost estimates can be made\nby: (a) recalculating the maximum costs\nestimates in current dollars, or\n(b) using an inflation factor derived from\nthe most recent Implicit Price Deflator for Gross Domestic Product published by\nthe U.S Department of Commerce in its Survey of Current Business, as specified\nin subclauses (1) and (2) of this clause. The inflation factor is the result of\ndividing the latest published annual deflator by the deflator for the previous\nyear. (1)\n\nThe first adjustment is made by\nmultiplying the closure cost estimate by the inflation factor. The result is\nthe adjusted estimate. (2)\n\nSubsequent adjustments are made by multiplying the latest adjusted closure cost\nestimate by the latest inflation factor. (iv)\n\nEach annual adjustment to the\npost-closure care cost estimate and the custodial care cost estimate must\nreflect the cost for a combined 30-year period from the date of each annual\nadjustment. (v) For owners and\noperators that use a local government financial test or guarantee, the cost\nestimates must be updated for inflation within 90 days after the close of the\nmunicipality's fiscal year. (4)\n\nDiscounting. The department may approve\ndiscounted estimates of post-closure care, custodial care costs and/or of\ncorrective measures costs up to the rate of return for essentially risk-free\ninvestments, net of inflation, under the following conditions: (i) the department determines that the cost\nestimates are complete and accurate and the owner or operator of the facility\nthat is the subject of the cost estimates has submitted a certification from a\nprofessional engineer that the estimates are complete and accurate; (ii)\nthe department finds the facility that\nis the subject of the cost estimates is in compliance with applicable permit or\nother department conditions, this Part, and with Parts 361, 362, 363, or 365, or Subpart 374-2 of this Title as they pertain to the facility; (iii)\nthe department determines that the\nclosure date is certain and the owner or operator certifies that there are no\nforeseeable factors that will change the estimate of the remaining active life\nof the facility; and\n(iv)\ndiscounted cost estimates must be adjusted annually to reflect inflation and\nyears of remaining active life and/or years remaining in the period covered by\nthe estimate. (5)\n\nSubmission. The owner or operator must include the cost estimates in the\nfacility annual report submitted to the department and keep a copy at the\nfacility or other approved location. (c) Financial assurance requirements. (1)\n\nThe terms of any financial assurance\nmechanisms provided to the department to satisfy compliance with any financial\nassurance obligation imposed by this Part or Parts 361, 362, 363, and 365 of\nthis Title must ensure that: (i) The amount\nof funds assured is sufficient to cover the costs of closure, and in the case\nof landfills, post-closure care, custodial care, and corrective measures for\nknown releases when needed. The amount of coverage must be revised whenever\nnecessary to cover a revised cost estimate. (ii)\n\nThe funds will be available when\nneeded. (iii)\n\nFor landfills, mechanisms for custodial care must be effective no later than 60 days after the\ndetermination that the landfill's post-closure care period is\ncomplete. (iv)\n\nMechanisms for\ncorrective measures must be effective no later than 120 days after the\ndepartment's approval of the corrective measures remedy. (v) The mechanisms must be legally valid, binding, and enforceable under state and federal law. (vi)\n\nIf the financial assurance mechanism is\nprovided by the private operator of a municipally owned landfill, the\npost-closure mechanism must be one that is transferrable and the fully funded\npost-closure mechanism must be transferred to the municipality upon closure of\nthe landfill or when the operator is no longer responsible for the facility\nunder agreement with the municipality. (2)\n\nThe department may reduce, to zero if\nappropriate, the amount of financial assurance required under this section by\nthe amount of financial assurance obtained by a facility for the benefit of the\nmunicipality for closure, post-closure, custodial care or corrective measures, provided this financial assurance is sufficient to meet the requirements of any\nclosure, post-closure, custodial care or corrective measures plan required\nunder this Part or Parts 361, 362, 363 and 365 and Subpart 374-2 of this Title. In the event that the amount of financial assurance obtained by a facility for\nthe benefit of the municipality is sufficient to meet the requirements of these\n\nParts, no additional financial assurance mechanism is required under\nsubdivision\n360.22\n(d). In the\nevent that the financial assurance obtained for the benefit of the municipality\nis not sufficient to meet the requirements of these Parts, a separate financial\nassurance mechanism meeting the requirements of subdivision\n360.22\n(d) is\nrequired. (d) Allowable\nfinancial assurance mechanisms. Except where otherwise indicated in paragraph\n(c)(2) of this section, owners and operators must choose from the options\nspecified in paragraphs (1) through (9) of this subdivision for closure. (1)\n\nTrust fund. (i) An owner or operator of a facility\nrequired to provide financial assurance may satisfy the requirements of\nsubdivision (c) of this section by establishing an irrevocable trust fund that\nconforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The trustee must be an entity\nthat is authorized by the State of New York, another state, or the federal\ngovernment to act as a trustee. A document indicating such authorization must\nbe submitted to the department. If an attorney is acting as a trustee, then the\nattorney must not represent the owner or operator in other legal matters. An\noriginal, signed duplicate of the trust agreement must be submitted to the\ndepartment along with evidence or a certification by the trustee that the\ntrustee meets the requirements of this paragraph. (ii)\n\nPay-in period. (a) For a trust fund used to demonstrate\nfinancial assurance for closure at a facility required to provide financial\nassurance, other than a landfill, the pay-in period may be no more than one\nyear. (b) The owner or operator of\na landfill constructed on or after November 4, 2017 must make payments into the\ntrust fund at least annually over the term of ten years after the initial\npermit is issued. (1)\n\nClosure. For a trust\nfund used to demonstrate financial assurance for closure, the first payment\ninto the fund must be made no later than 60 days before the initial receipt of\nwaste and must be at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure, except as provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, divided by the number\nof years of remaining operating life of the facility if less than ten years or\nby ten if the remaining operating life is more than ten years. The amount of\nsubsequent payments must be determined by the following formula: Next Payment = (CE - CV)/ Y\nwhere CE is the cost estimate for closure (updated for\ninflation or other changes), CV is the current value of the trust fund, and Y\nis the number of years remaining in the pay-in period. For pay-in periods less\nthan one year, the amounts of each payment into the trust fund must be approved\nby the department. (2)\n\nPost-closure and custodial care. For a trust fund used to demonstrate financial\nassurance for post-closure and custodial care, the first payment into the fund\nmust be at least equal to the current cost estimate for post-closure care and\ncustodial care, except as provided in paragraph (9) of this subdivision, divided by the number of years of remaining operating life of the facility if\nless than ten years or by ten if the remaining operating life is more than ten\nyears. The amount of subsequent payments must be determined by the following\nformula: Next Payment = (PCE - CV)/ Y\nwhere PCE is the cost estimate for post-closure care and\ncustodial care (updated for inflation or other changes), CV is the current\nvalue of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the pay-in\nperiod. For pay-in periods less than one year, the amounts of each payment into\nthe trust fund must be approved by the department. The initial payment into the\ntrust fund for post-closure care and custodial care must be made no later than\n60 days before the initial receipt of waste. (3)\n\nCorrective measures. For a trust fund\nused to demonstrate financial assurance for corrective measures at a landfill, the owner or operator must make payments into the trust fund at least annually\nover one-half of the estimated length of the corrective measures program. The\nfirst payment into the trust fund must be at least equal to one-half of the\ncurrent cost estimate for corrective measures, except as provided in paragraph\n(9) of this subdivision, divided by the number of years in the corrective\nmeasures pay-in period. The amount of subsequent payments must be determined by\nthe following formula: Next Payment = (RB - CV)/ Y\nwhere RB is the most recent estimate of the required trust\nfund balance for corrective measures (i.e., the total costs that will be\nincurred during the second half of the corrective measures period), CV is the\ncurrent value of the trust fund, and Y is the number of years remaining in the\npay-in period. For pay-in periods less than one year, the amounts of each\npayment into the trust fund must be approved by the department. The initial\npayment into the trust fund for corrective measures must be made no later than\n120 days after the department's approval of the corrective measures\nremedy. (c) If the\nowner or operator establishes a trust fund after having used one or more\nalternate mechanisms specified in this section, the initial payment into the\ntrust fund must be at least the amount that the fund would contain if the trust\nfund were established initially and payments made according to the\nspecifications of this paragraph and paragraph (9) of this subdivision, as\napplicable. (d) The owner or\noperator, or other person authorized to conduct closure, post-closure care, custodial care, or corrective measures activities, may request reimbursement\nfrom the trustee for these expenditures by submitting itemized bills and\nsupporting documentation to the department for review and approval. If\napproved, the department will instruct the trustee to make reimbursements in\nthose amounts the department specifies in writing. Requests for reimbursement\nwill be granted only if sufficient funds are remaining in the trust fund to\ncover the remaining costs of closure, post-closure care, custodial care or\ncorrective measures. The owner or operator or other person authorized must\nnotify the department that reimbursement has been received. (e) The owner or operator may terminate the\ntrust fund only if: (1)\nthe department\nauthorizes termination in advance and in writing and the owner or operator\nsubstitutes alternate financial assurance as identified in this section that\nprovides for continuous financial assurance being in effect until the owner or\noperator is no longer required to demonstrate financial assurance; or\n(2)\nthe owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to demonstrate financial assurance. (2)\n\nSurety bond guaranteeing\npayment. (i) An owner or operator of a\nfacility required to provide financial assurance may satisfy the requirements\nof subdivision (c) of this section by obtaining a payment surety bond that\nconforms to the requirements of this paragraph. Except as required under\nsubdivision\n360.4\n(j) of this\npart, the bond for closure and in the case of a landfill, post-closure care, and custodial care must be effective no later than 60 days before the initial\nreceipt of waste; and, the bond for corrective measures at a landfill must be\neffective no later than 120 days after the department's approval of the\ncorrective measures remedy. The surety company issuing the bonds described in\nthis subparagraph must, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable\nsureties on Federal bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the\n\nTreasury. The original bond must be submitted to the department along with\nevidence or a certification by the surety company that the surety company meets\nthe requirements of this subparagraph. (ii)\n\nThe penal sum of the bond must be an\namount at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure, post-closure\ncare, custodial care, or corrective measures, if applicable, except as provided\nin paragraph (9) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the surety\nwill become liable on the bond obligation if the owner or operator fails to\nperform as guaranteed by the bond, or fails to provide alternate financial\nassurance as specified in this section and obtain the department's written\napproval of the assurance provided within 90 days after the owner or operator\nand the department receive a notice of cancellation of the bond from the\nsurety. (iv)\n\nFor bonds which are\nvalued at $50,000 or more for an individual facility, the owner or operator\nmust establish a standby trust fund. The standby trust fund must meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision except the requirements for\ninitial payment and subsequent payments specified in subparagraph (ii) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision. The provisions in the trust agreement, as\nspecified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, for submitting annual\nvaluations and notices of nonpayment also do not apply to a standby trust\nagreement established pursuant to this subparagraph until payments from the\nbond or other sources are deposited into the trust fund. (v) Payments made under the terms of the bond\nwill be deposited by the surety directly into the standby trust fund, or as\notherwise directed by the department. Payments from the standby trust fund must\nbe approved in advance by the department in writing. (vi)\n\nUnder the terms of the bond, the surety\nmay cancel the bond by sending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the\nowner and operator and to the department 120 days in advance of cancellation. If the surety cancels the bond, the owner or operator must obtain alternate\nfinancial assurance as specified in this section. Any notice of cancellation, reinstatement, or renewal of the bond, or any other notice relating to the\nbond, must clearly identify the owner or operator and each facility for which\nthe bond provides financial assurance, including the name and address of the\nowner or operator, and the name, address and amount guaranteed for each\nfacility. (vii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator may cancel the bond only if: (a) the\ndepartment authorizes cancellation in advance and in writing and the owner or\noperator substitutes alternate financial assurance as identified in this\nsection that provides for continuous financial assurance being in effect until\nthe owner or operator is no longer required to demonstrate financial assurance; or\n(b) the owner or operator is no\nlonger required to demonstrate financial assurance. (3)\n\nLetter of Credit. (i) An owner or operator of a facility\nrequired to provide financial assurance may satisfy the requirements of\nsubdivision (c) of this section by obtaining an irrevocable letter of credit\nthat conforms to the requirements of this paragraph. The letter of credit for\nclosure, post-closure care and custodial care must be effective no later than\n60 days before the initial receipt of waste, and the letter of credit for\ncorrective measures at a landfill must be effective no later than 120 days\nafter the department's approval of the corrective measures remedy. The issuing\ninstitution must be an entity that has the authority to issue letters of\ncredit. The original letter of credit must be submitted to the department for\nreview and approval along with evidence or a certification by the institution\nissuing the letter of credit that the institution meets the requirements of\nthis subparagraph. (ii)\n\nThe letter\nof credit must be accompanied by a letter from the owner or operator referring\nto the letter of credit by number, issuing institution, and date, and providing\nthe following information: name and address of the facility and the amount of\nfunds assured. (iii)\n\nThe letter of\ncredit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least one year in an\namount at least equal to the current cost estimate for closure, post-closure\ncare, custodial care, or corrective measures, if applicable, except as provided\nin paragraph (9) of this subdivision. The letter of credit must provide that\nthe expiration date will be automatically extended for a period of at least one\nyear unless the issuing institution has cancelled the letter of credit by\nsending notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner and operator and\nto the department 120 days in advance of cancellation. If the letter of credit\nis cancelled by the issuing institution, the owner or operator must obtain\nalternate financial assurance. Any notice of cancellation, reinstatement, or\nany other changes to the letter of credit must clearly identify each owner or\noperator and facility for which the letter of credit provides financial\nassurance, including the name and address of the owner or operator, and the\nname, address and amount guaranteed for each facility. (iv)\n\nIf the letter of credit is valued at\n$50,000 or more for an individual facility, the owner or operator must\nestablish a standby trust fund. The standby trust fund must meet the\nrequirements of paragraph (1) of this subdivision, except for initial payment\nand subsequent annual payments specified in subparagraph (ii) of paragraph (1)\nof this subdivision. The provisions in the trust agreement, as specified in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, for submitting annual valuations and notices\nof nonpayment also do not apply to a standby trust agreement established\npursuant to this paragraph unless and until payments from the letter of credit\nor other sources are actually deposited into the trust fund. (v) The owner or operator may request\ncancellation of the letter of credit. The letter of credit may only be\ncancelled under the following conditions: (a) the department authorizes that cancellation in advance and in writing and the\nowner or operator substitutes alternate financial assurance as identified in\nthis section that provides for continuous financial assurance being in effect\nuntil the owner or operator is no longer required to demonstrate financial\nassurance; or\n(b) the owner or\noperator is no longer required to demonstrate financial assurance. (vi)\n\nFollowing a department\ndetermination that the owner or operator has failed to perform closure, post-closure care, custodial care, or corrective measures, the department may\ndraw on the letter of credit. (vii)\n\nIf the owner or operator does not establish alternate financial assurance as\nspecified in this subdivision and does not obtain written approval of alternate\nassurance from the department within 90 days after both the owner or operator\nand the department receive a notice from the issuing institution that it has\ndecided not to extend the letter of credit beyond the current expiration date, the department will draw on the letter of credit. The department may delay the\ndrawing if the issuing institution grants an extension of the term of credit. During the last 30 days of any extension the department will draw on the letter\nof credit if the owner or operator has failed to provide alternate financial\nassurance as specified in this subdivision and obtain written approval of the\nassurance from the department. (viii)\n\nUnder the terms of the letter of\ncredit, all amounts paid pursuant to the draft will be deposited directly into\nthe standby trust fund, or as otherwise directed by the department. Payments\nfrom the standby trust fund must be approved in advance by the department in\nwriting. (4)\n\nLocal\ngovernment financial test. (i) A municipality\nthat is an owner or operator of a facility required to provide financial\nassurance that satisfies the requirements of subparagraph (ii) through (iv) of\nthis paragraph may demonstrate financial assurance up to the amount specified\nin subparagraph (v) of this section. (ii)\n\nFinancial component. (a) The municipality must satisfy subclause\n(1) or (2) of this clause as applicable: (1)\nif the municipality has outstanding rated general obligation bonds that are not\nsecured by insurance, a letter of credit, or other collateral or guarantee, it\nmust have a current rating of Aaa, Aa, A, or Baa, as issued by Moody's, or AAA, AA, A, or BBB, as issued by Standard and Poor's on all general obligation\nbonds; or\n(2)\nthe municipality must\nsatisfy each of the following financial ratios based on the municipality's most\nrecent audited annual financial statement: (i) a ratio of cash plus marketable\nsecurities to total expenditures greater than or equal to 0.05; and\n(ii)\na ratio of annual debt service to total\nexpenditures less than or equal to 0.20. (b) The municipality must prepare its\nfinancial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting\nprinciples for governments and have its financial statements audited by an\nindependent certified public accountant. (c) The municipality is not eligible to\nassure its obligations under this subparagraph if it: (1)\nis currently in default on any\noutstanding general obligation bonds; or\n(2)\nhas any outstanding general obligation\nbonds rated lower than Baa as issued by Moody's or BBB as issued by Standard\nand Poor's; or\n(3)\noperated at a\ndeficit equal to five percent or more of total annual revenue in each of the\npast two fiscal years; or\n(4)\nreceives an adverse opinion, disclaimer of opinion, or other qualified opinion\nfrom the independent certified public accountant auditing its financial\nstatement as required under clause (b) of this subparagraph. However, the\ndepartment may evaluate qualified opinions on a case-specific basis and allow\nuse of the financial test in cases where the department deems the qualification\ninsufficient to warrant disallowance of use of the test. (iii)\n\nPublic notice component. The\nmunicipality must place a reference to any closure costs, post-closure care\ncosts, or custodial care costs that may apply and that are assured through the\nfinancial test into its next comprehensive annual financial report (CAFR) after\n\nNovember 4, 2017 or before the initial receipt of waste at the facility, whichever is later. Disclosure must include the nature and source of closure, post-closure care and custodial care requirements, the reported liability at\nthe balance sheet date, the estimated total closure, post-closure care, and\ncustodial care cost remaining to be recognized, and, in the case of a landfill, the percentage of landfill capacity used to date and the estimated remaining\nlandfill life in years. In the instance where the local government financial\ntest is used to satisfy the requirements of any corrective measures required at\na landfill, a reference to corrective measures costs must be placed in the CAFR\nno later than 120 days after the corrective measures have been approved in\ncompliance with the requirements of Part 363 of this Title. For the first year\nthe financial test is used to assure costs at a particular facility, the\nreference may instead be placed in the operating record until issuance of the\nnext available CAFR, if timing does not permit the reference to be incorporated\ninto the most recently issued CAFR or budget. (iv)\n\nRecordkeeping and reporting\nrequirements. (a) Within 270 days following\nthe close of the municipality's fiscal year, the municipality must submit the\nfollowing items to the department and must place the following items in the\nfacility's operating record. (1)\nA letter\nsigned by the municipality's chief financial officer that: (i) lists all the current cost estimates\ncovered by the local government financial test, as described in subdivision (b)\nof this section; (ii)\nprovides\nevidence and certifies that the municipality meets the conditions of clauses\n(ii) (a - c) of this paragraph; and\n(iii)\ncertifies that the municipality meets\nthe conditions of subparagraphs (4)(iii) and (4)(v) of this subdivision. (2)\n\nThe municipality's\nindependently audited year-end financial statements for the latest fiscal year\n(except for municipalities where audits are required every two years and where\nunaudited statements are allowed to be used in years when audits are not\nrequired), including the unqualified opinion of the auditor who must be an\nindependent, certified public accountant that conducts equivalent comprehensive\naudits. (3)\nA report to the\nmunicipality from the municipality's independent certified public accountant\n(CPA) based on performing an agreed upon procedures engagement relative to the\nfinancial ratios required by subclause (ii)(a)(2) of this subparagraph, if\napplicable, and the requirements of clause (ii)(b) and subclauses (ii)(c)(3)\nand (ii)(c)(4) of this subparagraph. The CPA or state agency's report should\ndescribe the procedures performed and the CPA or state agency's findings and\nstate that the chief financial officer's letter required by subclause (1) of\nthis clause was reviewed and the data in the letter derived from the financial\nstatements for the latest completed fiscal year were compared with the amounts\nin the financial statements. (4)\nA\ncopy of the CAFR used to comply with subparagraph (iii) of this\nparagraph. (b) The items\nrequired in clause (a) of this subparagraph covering closure, post-closure care\nand custodial care must be placed in the facility's operating record no later\nthan 60 days before the initial receipt of waste; and the items required in\nclause (a) of this subparagraph covering corrective measures must be placed in\nthe facility's operating record no later than 120 days after the department's\napproval of the corrective measures remedy. (c) After the initial placement of the items\nin the facility's operating record, the municipality must update the\ninformation and submit it to the department and place the updated information\nin the operating record within 270 days following the close of the\nmunicipality's fiscal year. (d) The\nmunicipality is no longer required to meet the requirements of subparagraph\n(iv) of this paragraph when: (1)\nthe\ndepartment authorizes termination in advance and in writing and the\nmunicipality substitutes alternate financial assurance as identified in this\nsection that provides for continuous financial assurance being in effect until\nthe municipality is no longer required to demonstrate financial assurance; or\n(2)\nthe municipality is no\nlonger required to demonstrate financial assurance. (e) A municipality must satisfy the\nrequirements of the local government financial test at the close of each fiscal\nyear. If the municipality no longer meets the requirements of the local\ngovernment financial test it must, within 300 days following the close of the\nmunicipality's fiscal year, establish alternative financial assurance that\nmeets the requirements of this section, place the required submissions for that\nassurance in the operating record, and notify the department that the\nmunicipality no longer satisfies the requirements of the local government\nfinancial test and that alternate financial assurance has been obtained. If the\nalternative financial assurance is a trust fund or reserve fund, the\nmunicipality may consider the facility to have been constructed on or after\n\nNovember 4, 2017 for purposes of the pay-in period calculations of subparagraph\n360.22(d)(1)(ii) of this subdivision. (f) The department, based on a reasonable\nbelief that the municipality may no longer meet the requirements of the local\ngovernment financial test, may require additional reports of financial\ncondition from the municipality at any time. If the department finds, on the\nbasis of these reports or other information, that the municipality no longer\nmeets the requirements of the local government financial test, the municipality\nmust provide alternate financial assurance in compliance with this section. (v) Calculation of costs\nto be assured. The portion of the closure, post-closure, custodial care, and\ncorrective measures costs for which a municipality can assure under this\nparagraph is determined as follows. (a) If\nthe municipality does not assure other environmental obligations through a\nlocal government financial test and provides no other financial assurance\ninstrument, it may assure closure, post-closure, custodial care and corrective\nmeasures costs that equal up to 43 percent of the municipality's total annual\nrevenue. (b) If the municipality\nassures other environmental obligations through a local government financial\ntest, including those associated with Underground Injection Control (UIC)\nfacilities under 40 CFR\nsection\n144.62\nor 6 NYCRR Part\n750, petroleum\nunderground storage tank facilities under 40 CFR Part\n280\nor 6 NYCRR Part\n612, PCB storage facilities under 40 CFR Part\n761\nor 6 NYCRR Subpart\n373-2, and\nhazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities under\n40 CFR\nParts\n264 and 265 or 6 NYCRR Subparts\n373-2\nor\n373-3, as incorporated by reference in\nsection\n360.3\nof this Title, it must add\nthose costs to the closure, post-closure, custodial care and corrective\nmeasures costs it seeks to assure under this paragraph. The total that may be\nassured in the absence of a financial assurance instrument must not exceed 43\npercent of the municipality's total annual revenue. (c) The municipality must obtain an alternate\nfinancial assurance instrument for those costs that exceed the limits set in\nclauses (a) and (b) of this subparagraph. (5)\n\nLocal government guarantee. (i) An owner or operator required to provide\nfinancial assurance may demonstrate financial assurance for closure, post-closure, custodial care, and corrective measures, as required by this\n\nPart, by obtaining a written guarantee provided by a municipality. The\nguarantor must meet the requirements of the local government financial test in\nparagraph (d)(4) of this subdivision, and must comply with the terms of a\nwritten guarantee. (ii)\n\nTerms of a\nlocal government guarantee. The guarantee covering closure, post-closure care, and custodial care, whichever is applicable, must be placed in the facility's\noperating record no later than 60 days before the initial receipt of waste; and\nthe guarantee covering corrective measures must be placed in the facility's\noperating record no later than 120 days after the department's approval of the\ncorrective measures remedy. The guarantee must provide that: (a) if the owner or operator fails to perform\nclosure, post-closure care, custodial care and/or corrective measures of a\nfacility covered by the guarantee, the guarantor will: (1)\nperform, or pay a third party to perform, closure, post-closure care, custodial care and/or corrective measures as\nrequired; or\n(2)\nestablish a fully\nfunded trust fund as identified in paragraph (d)(1) of this subdivision in the\nname of the owner or operator. (b) The guarantee will remain in force unless\nthe guarantor sends notice of cancellation by certified mail to the owner or\noperator and to the department. Cancellation may not occur, however, during the\nfirst 120 days beginning on the date of receipt of the notice of cancellation\nby both the owner or operator and the department, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. (c) If the guarantor\nseeks to cancel the guarantee, the owner or operator must, within 90 days\nfollowing receipt of the cancellation notice by the owner or operator and the\ndepartment, obtain alternate financial assurance, place evidence of that\nalternate financial assurance in the facility operating record, and notify the\ndepartment. If the owner or operator fails to provide alternate financial\nassurance within the 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that alternate\nassurance within 120 days following the guarantor's notice of cancellation, place evidence of the alternate assurance in the facility operating record, and\nnotify the department. (d) The\nowner or operator may cancel the guarantee only if: (1)\nthe department authorizes cancellation in\nadvance and in writing and the owner or operator substitutes alternate\nfinancial assurance as identified in this section that provides for continuous\nfinancial assurance being in effect until the owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to demonstrate financial assurance; or\n(2)\nthe owner or operator is no longer\nrequired to demonstrate financial assurance. (iii)\n\nRecordkeeping and reporting. (a) In the case of closure, post-closure\ncare, and custodial care, the owner or operator must submit to the department\nand place into the facility's operating record, no later than 60 days before\nthe initial receipt of waste, a certified copy of the guarantee covering\nclosure, post-closure care, and custodial care and the items required under\nsubparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this paragraph. In the case of corrective measures\nat a landfill, the owner or operator must submit to the department and place\ninto the facility's operating record, no later than 120 days after the\ndepartment's approval of the corrective measures remedy for a landfill, a\ncertified copy of the guarantee covering the corrective measures and the items\nrequired under subparagraph (d)(4)(iv) of this paragraph. (b) If a local government guarantor no longer\nmeets the requirements of paragraph (d)(4) of this subdivision, the owner or\noperator must, within 90 days, establish alternate financial assurance, place\nevidence of the alternate assurance in the facility's operating record, and\nnotify the department. If the owner or operator fails to obtain alternate\nfinancial assurance within that 90-day period, the guarantor must provide that\nalternate financial assurance within the next 30 days. If the alternative\nfinancial assurance is a trust fund or reserve fund, the municipality may\nconsider the facility to have been constructed on or after November 4, 2017 for\npurposes of the pay-in period calculations of subparagraph 360.22(d)(1)(ii) of\nthis section. (6)\n\nReserve fund. A capital reserve fund or a\nsolid waste management facility reserve fund established and funded pursuant to\nthe General Municipal Law satisfies these requirements provided the pay-in\nperiod is consistent with paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nThe full faith and credit of New York\n\nState or the Federal government shall be used for facilities owned or operated\nby New York State or the Federal government. (8)\n\nUse of multiple financial mechanisms. An\nowner or operator required to provide financial assurance may satisfy the\nrequirements of this subdivision by establishing more than one financial\nassurance mechanism per facility. The mechanisms established must be those\nidentified in paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subdivision and the total\namount of the mechanisms must be at least equal to the sum of the current cost\nestimates for closure, post-closure care, custodial care or corrective\nmeasures, whichever is applicable. If the owner or operator uses a trust fund\nin combination with a surety bond or a letter of credit, the trust fund may be\nused as the standby trust fund for the other mechanisms. A single standby trust\nfund, if required, may be established for two or more mechanisms. The\ndepartment may allow the use of any or all of the mechanisms to provide for\nclosure, post-closure care, custodial care or corrective measures of the\nfacility. (9)\n\nUse of a financial\nmechanism for multiple facilities. An owner or operator required to provide\nfinancial assurance may use a financial assurance mechanism identified in\nsubdivision (d) of this section to meet the requirements of this section for\nmore than one facility. Evidence of financial assurance submitted to the\ndepartment must include a list showing, for each facility, the name, address, and the amount of funds assured by the mechanism. The amount of funds available\nthrough the mechanisms must be no less than the sum of funds that would be\navailable if a separate mechanism had been established and maintained for each\nfacility. If the owner or operator uses a surety bond or a letter of credit for\nmultiple facilities, a standby trust fund must be established for any\nindividual facility having a cost estimate of $50,000 or more. In directing\nfunds available through the mechanisms for closure, post-closure care, custodial care or corrective measures of any of the facilities covered by the\nmechanism, the department may direct only the amount of funds designated for\nthe facility, unless its owner or operator agrees to the use of additional\nfunds available under the mechanism. (e) Wording of instruments. (1)\n\nFor instruments covering one or more\nfacilities required to provide financial assurance located entirely within one\nadministrative region of the department, the owner or operator of the facility\nor facilities must submit each original instrument to the director of the\nadministrative region of the department in which the facility or facilities are\nlocated, and submit a copy to the director of the Division of Materials\n\nManagement or successor administrative unit.
