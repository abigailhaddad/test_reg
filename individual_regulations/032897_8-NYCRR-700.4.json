  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 700.4 - Teacher Certification Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe committee acknowledges that many schools and education\ncorporations it oversees that have demonstrated strong student performance have\nhad difficulty hiring teachers certified in accordance with the requirements of\nthe regulations of the commissioner of education. The committee, therefore, through its authority to adopt regulations with respect to the governance, structure and operations of the charter schools it oversees, desires to provide\nan alternative teacher certification pathway to charter schools in meeting the\nrequirements of paragraph (a-1) of subdivision three of section\n2854\nof the\neducation law. (a) Teacher\n\nCertification Compliance. An education corporation may submit to the institute\nan Instructional Program (as defined in subparagraph b, below) for teachers\nthat meet the requirements of this Section. The requirements of an approved\n\nInstructional Program under this Section are to be considered equivalent to the\ncertification requirements applicable to other public schools of the state for\nthe purposes of paragraph a-1 of subdivision three of section\n2854\nof the\neducation law. (b) Instructional\n\nProgram. An applicant may at any time submit a proposed Instructional Program\n(the \"Instructional Program\") to the institute for approval. If the institute\nhas denied an application or revoked or closed an Instructional Program, the\napplicant must wait at least 120 days before any reapplication. In order to be\neligible to apply, an applicant must be approved to operate at least one\nschool. An Instructional Program shall not be eligible for approval unless it\nmeets the following minimum requirements: (1)\n\nThe applicant shall have a demonstrated record of academic success as follows: (i) For an education corporation, 60 percent\nof applicant's schools with students participating in grades 3 through 8 state\nexaminations must have performed better on those examinations than the district\nschools in the school districts in which the charter schools are located. If an\neducation corporation serves high school grades, such schools shall have met\n60% of their accountability plan measures. If an education corporation serves\nboth sets of grades, the institute shall weight the grades accordingly. For\npurposes of this paragraph, the school district in which a charter school is\nlocated shall mean, for the city school district of the city of New York, the\ncommunity district in which a charter school is located. For schools that\nprimarily serve a special population, including students with disabilities or\nELL students, the schools must have performed better than the students of the\napplicable special population in the school districts in which the charter\nschools are located; and\n(a) at least one of\nthe applicant's schools must have received a renewal of at least five\nyears. (b) If two or more education\ncorporations are applying together, at least one school from each education\ncorporation must meet the standard in subparagraph (b)(1) of this\n\nSection.

A certified\nintern teacher's certificate shall be valid for no longer than six months from\nthe date it is granted, provided that such certificate may be renewed if the\ncandidate is still enrolled in the Instructional Program. To receive such\ncertificate, an approved applicant shall submit the names of teachers so\nqualified to the institute, whereupon those teachers will be issued such\ncertificate. The applicant shall certify as to the truthfulness of such\nsubmission and shall retain all responsibility and liability resulting from\nsuch approval. (ii)\nA teacher who\nhas met the requirements of an approved Instructional Program in one or more of\nthe titles designated in paragraph 3 of subdivision b of this Section shall be\neligible to receive a teacher's certificate for such title(s). To receive such\ncertificate, the teacher shall submit documentation thereof to an approved\napplicant, which shall approve or deny the teacher for certification within 60\ndays of submission. Such determination will be based on: (a) A review of submitted documentation\ndemonstrating that the teacher has completed an approved Instructional Program\nfor the title sought; (b) A review\nof the results of a criminal history record search of the teacher performed by\nNYSED at the direction of an education corporation as required under paragraph\n(a-2) of subdivision three of section\n2854\nof the\neducation law.

For\nteachers seeking certification as a students with disabilities teacher or an\nESOL teacher, such recommendation will specifically certify that the teacher\nhas satisfactorily demonstrated the competencies required by the Instructional\n\nProgram to teach students with disabilities or ELL students, respectively. (2)\n\nCertificates.

The\napplicant shall certify as to the validity of such approval for certification\nunder this Subpart and shall retain all responsibility and liability resulting\nfrom such approval. (3)\n\nTeachers\n\nCertified in another State. Notwithstanding subdivision 1 above, a teacher\nholding a valid teaching certificate in good standing issued by another state\nthat substantially complies with all other requirements of this Section shall\nbe eligible to receive a teacher's certificate under this Section without\nparticipation in an approved Instructional Program. (4)\n\nTransferability. The certification\ncreated by this Section shall be transferrable to another school within the\napplicant and to another education corporation / school authorized by the board\nof trustees even if the transferee education corporation does not have an\napproved Instructional Program. (5)\n\nExpiration. A teacher's certificate issued under this Section shall expire\nthree years from the date it is granted. In the case of a teacher who obtains\nan intern teacher's certificate prior to obtaining a teacher's certificate, the\nperiod of time teaching under the intern teacher's certificate prior to\nobtaining a full teacher's certificate shall be included for purposes of\ncalculating the three year period. Such certification may be renewed and remain\nvalid provided that: (i) the teacher is\nemployed by a board of trustees' authorized charter school; and, (ii)\nthe employing education corporation\nsubmits to the institute a recommendation for certification renewal based on\nits review of the teacher's performance over the course of his or her\nemployment at the education corporation. (6)\n\nTeacher Acknowledgement. Applicant shall\nobtain a signed affirmation from each candidate acknowledging that the\ncandidate has been informed by the applicant and is aware that the\ncertification the candidate will receive pursuant to this Section is not\ntransferrable to any education corporation / charter school not authorized by\nthe board of trustees or to any district school, and may not be recognized as a\nteacher certification under regulations of the state commissioner of education. Such executed affirmation shall be obtained upon enrollment in an approved\n\nInstructional Program and shall be retained by the applicant for a period of\nnot less than 10 years from the date of the latest certificate\nissuance. (e) Accounting. Each applicant with an approved Instructional Program must reflect\nthe budgeted costs for the Instructional Program separately in its annual\nbudget, and specifically account for the costs thereof in its financial\nstatements. Applicants may not charge employees or others for access to their\n\nInstructional Programs. (f) Accountability and Revocation. Applicant shall be accountable for the quality\nof its Instructional Programs leading to exemption from certification. The\ninstitute reserves the right to independently assess and monitor all approved\n\nInstructional Programs and may revoke its approval at any time. Failure to\ncomply with any provision of this Section may result in revocation of the\napproval. (1)\n\nNotice of intent to revoke\napproval shall be provided to the applicant at least 30 days prior to the\neffective date of the proposed revocation. Such notice shall include a\nstatement of reasons for the proposed revocation. A school closure for academic\nreasons shall be deemed notice of intent to review and possibly revoke the\napproval of an Instructional Program. (2)\n\nIf applicable, the applicant shall be\nallowed at least 30 days to correct the problems associated with the proposed\nrevocation. Non-curable causes of revocation include, but are not limited to, fraud, creation of false business records and obstruction of investigation or\nmonitoring by the institute. Prior to revocation of the approval, an applicant\nshall be provided an opportunity to be heard by the institute, consistent with\nthe requirements of due process.
