  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 79.4 - Inspection information\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon application to the commissioner, the\nowner of a motor vehicle required to be inspected may request an extension of\ntime to have the inspection made. Such extension of time, not to exceed 10\ndays, may be granted by the commissioner if, in his discretion, reasonable\ngrounds exist for its issuance. The extension must be affixed to the motor\nvehicle in the lower left corner of the inside of the windshield or kept with\nthe vehicle registration if the vehicle has no windshield, or is a trailer or\nmotorcycle. (b) Where a nonresident\nbecomes a resident of this State, a certificate of inspection issued by any\nother jurisdiction to a motor vehicle owned by him will be accepted in lieu of\na certificate of inspection issued in this State. Such a certificate will be\nvalid until the expiration date of the out-of-state certificate, or one year\nfrom the date of New York registration, whichever occurs first. Upon expiration\nof the out-of-state certificate, the motor vehicle must be inspected and bear a\ncertificate of inspection from an official New York inspection\nstation. (c) A certificate of\ninspection issued by any other jurisdiction which has a compulsory periodic\ninspection program to a motor vehicle which is concurrently registered (vehicle\nregistered in more than one jurisdiction) in this State and in the state or\nprovince of Canada which issued the certificate of inspection will be accepted\nin lieu of a certificate of inspection issued in this State. Such a certificate\nwill be valid until the expiration date of the out-of-state certificate, provided the motor vehicle remains registered in such other state or province\nof Canada. For purposes of this Part, a vehicle with an International\n\nRegistration Plan registration will be deemed registered in every jurisdiction\nin which it may legally be operated. (d) The owner of a motor vehicle that is\nregistered in the NYMA and that is subject to a diesel emissions inspection, whose motor vehicle inspection certificate will expire while outside the NYMA\nor who purchases a vehicle from outside the NYMA may apply to the commissioner\nfor a temporary certificate of emissions waiver (form VS-1078) prior to\nreceiving an inspection. The temporary certificate of emissions waiver will be\nvalid with a valid New York State safety inspection certificate (form VS-1082)\nor heavy vehicle safety inspection certificate (form VS-1082HV) for as long as\nthe registered vehicle is outside the NYMA. A diesel-powered motor vehicle that\nis registered in the NYMA and that is exempt from emissions inspection does not\nrequire a temporary waiver, may be inspected at any inspection station licensed\nto inspect such vehicles, and does not need to be reinspected upon return to\nthe NYMA. (1)\nA temporary certificate of\nemissions waiver that had been issued for a motor vehicle that had been subject\nto the high enhanced emissions inspection (dynamometer or idle test) shall be\nvalid until the time that the motor vehicle is no longer subject to the high\nenhanced emissions inspection. (2)\nA vehicle subject to the diesel emissions inspection that is presented for\ninspection with a VS-1078 outside the NYMA must receive the appropriate safety\ninspection and, when it passes said inspection, shall receive the appropriate\nsafety inspection certificate. (3)\n\nThe temporary certificate of emissions waiver will be valid for 10 days after\nentry into the NYMA by the motor vehicle. Upon re-entry to the NYMA, and prior\nto the expiration of the 10 days, the subject vehicle must receive the complete\nappropriate diesel emissions/safety inspection. (4)\n\nAll nonexempt 1996 or newer passenger\ncars and light duty trucks which are nondiesel- and nonelectric-powered, subject to an OBD II inspection and registered in the NYMA, that are inspected\noutside the NYMA, shall receive a complete safety and OBD II inspection and\nwhen such a vehicle passes said inspection, shall receive a safety/emissions\ninspection certificate (form VS-1082SE). This certificate shall be valid in the\nNYMA; the vehicle does not require reinspection, and a VS-1078 is not\nrequired. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
