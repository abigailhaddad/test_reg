  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 92.4 - Index\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General\nprovisions. Retail sellers or holders may use any single index from among the\nindices approved by the Superintendent of Banks pursuant to Part 334 of this\n\nTitle. The rate on the contract or obligation may be based directly on the\nindex values or upon the index values plus or minus additional percentage\npoints; provided, however, that variations in the rates shall correspond\ndirectly to the movements of the index. While only a single index shall be used\nfor the term of a contract or obligation, the retail seller or the holder may\nprovide for the use of a substitute index similar to the initial index in the\nevent that the initial index should become unavailable during the term of the\ncontract or obligation. This Part imposes no requirement on retail sellers or\nholders to place limitations on the adjustment in the rate, as such adjustment\nwould otherwise be allowed by movements in the index. Rate adjustments may be\nrounded, as determined by the retail seller or the holder, to the nearest\npercentage point or fraction thereof, provided that rounding applies equally to\ndecreases and increases in rates. Subject to the rounding provisions, increases\nin the index need not be used at each rate calculation date but may be\naccumulated once to the next rate calculation date, but decreases in the index\nmust be reflected at each rate calculation date. (b) Information and disclosures with respect\nto the history of the index. The disclosure shall identify the index and shall\ncontain a statement that past changes in the index are not necessarily\npredictive of future changes in the index. The retail seller shall provide the\nhigh and low figures for the index and the dates at which these levels were\nreached, for each of the three calendar years preceding the calendar year in\nwhich the contract or obligation is entered into. In addition, if the contract\nor obligation is entered into after August 31st of any calendar year, the\ndisclosure shall include the high and low figures for the index's performance\nthrough June 30th of that year, and such disclosure may be used as the\ndisclosure of the high and low in index performance for the calendar year next\npreceding that calendar year in which the contract or obligation is entered\ninto, for any contract or obligation entered into prior to March 1st of that\nyear. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n92.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
