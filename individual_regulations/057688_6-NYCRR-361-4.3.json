In addition to the criteria in Part 360 of this Title, each\nfacility must comply with the operating requirements specified in this section. (1)\nA facility with more than 10,000 cubic\nyards but less than 25,000 cubic yards of material onsite, including storage of\nincoming material and processed material, provided the following design and\noperating criteria are followed. (b) For registered facilities, the following\ndesign and operating criteria apply. (1)\n\nFor\nwood debris, the facility has a program to preclude the acceptance of\ncontaminated wood for mulch production and to inspect and remove any\ncontaminated wood that arrives at the site. If the facility accepts pallets, the facility must have equipment to remove nails or other metal fasteners and\nmust operate the equipment whenever pallets are being processed. (2)\n\nThe facility does not accept C&D\ndebris, unless managed on a separate part of the property, in accordance with\ndepartment criteria. (3)\n\nMaterial\ndoes not remain on-site unprocessed for more than 12 months. (4)\n\nAll piles of material do not exceed 25\nfeet high and 30 feet wide at the base, except in Nassau and Suffolk Counties. In Nassau and Suffolk Counties, the piles of material do not exceed 15 feet\nhigh and 30 feet wide at the base. (5)\n\nThe mulch product is not stored for more\nthan 180 days. (6)\n\nFor all piles of\ndouble or finely ground mulch, the temperature in the piles must be monitored\nat least twice per week. For all other piles, the temperature in the piles must\nbe monitored twice per month. Multiple points in the piles are monitored with\nemphasis placed on areas that appear to be the hottest, such as vents and areas\nof fungal growth. Probing must be done cautiously to avoid introducing air into\na hot spot and causing a flash fire. If the temperature is above 140 degrees\n\nFahrenheit or a portion of the pile shows an increasing trend in temperature, the affected material must be immediately broken down and cooled. (7)\n\nAll piles of material, both unprocessed\nand processed, are separated by at least ten feet. (8)\n\nRestacking of piles must occur when winds\nare blowing away from sensitive receptors. (9)\n\nPiles of processed material must be\nrestacked as necessary to avoid temperatures above 140 degrees\n\nFahrenheit. (10)\n\nPiles of processed\nmaterial are piled loosely and not compacted in any manner. (11)\n\nIf a fire occurs, the affected portion\nof the pile must be dismantled and watered to douse the fire or managed in a\nmanner recommended by a local fire department. (12)\n\nStanding water on the storage area is\nminimized. (13)\n\nFor the purposes of\n\nPart 360 and this Part, precipitation, surface water, and groundwater that has\ncome in contact with wood debris, tree debris, and yard trimmings, both\nincoming and processed, is not considered leachate, but must be managed in a\nmanner acceptable to the department. The facility must have a written run-on\nand run-off plan, submitted with the registration request, that is acceptable\nto the department that outlines the methods that will be used to prevent run-on\nfrom entering and run-off from leaving the site and to minimize the movement of\norganic matter into the soil at the site. (14)\n\nThe following buffer areas from\nprocessing and storage are followed: Property line............... 25\n\nResidence*............... 200\n\nPotable water well........... 200\n\nSurface water and\n\nState regulated wetland......... 200\n*Excludes owner's or operator's residence or a facility\nthat existed prior to November 4, 2017. The facility is required to comply\nwith this requirement at the time the facility applies for a registration or\npermit.
