Tit. 18 § 387.24 - New York State Combined Application Project (NYSCAP)\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe NYSCAP is a federally-approved demonstration project\nwhich uses an automatic SNAP case enrollment and conversion process for certain\nsingle, live-alone Supplemental Security Income (SSI) recipients. Information\nfrom the Social Security Administration (SSA) provided to the Office of\n\nTemporary and Disability Assistance (Office) is used to identify individuals\neligible to receive SNAP benefits under the NYSCAP. The operation of the\nNYSCAP, as set forth in this section, is subject to continued federal approval\nand funding. (a) Eligible\n\nHouseholds. The process for enrollment of eligible households in the\nNYSCAP is set forth below: (1)\n\nAutomatically\n\nEnrolled Eligible Households. (i) Single SSI, live-alone households, not currently receiving SNAP benefits, designated with\nan SSI federal living arrangement Code A, and a State SSI Supplemental Code A. These are individuals that SSA and the Office have determined to be separate, independent households; even if they are physically living with others. These\nhouseholds are automatically enrolled in the NYSCAP, except as otherwise\nprovided by this section. (ii)\n\nAutomatic enrollment of a NYSCAP case for an individual will be stopped if an\n\"Exception\" situation exists for that individual. The NYSCAP case will not be\nautomatically enrolled. The Exception reason must be reviewed and resolved, and\nits effect on eligibility for SNAP and for participation in the NYSCAP must be\ndetermined prior to manually opening a NYSCAP case. Exception situations\ninclude but are not limited to: (a) The\nindividual is a member of a household that has a pending application for SNAP\nbenefits. (b) The individual is\nsanctioned or disqualified from participation in the SNAP due to a SNAP\nIntentional Program Violation (IPV). (c) The last case action recorded in the\n\nWelfare Management System, (WMS) or any system of record that succeeds WMS, for\na SNAP household of which the individual was a member, was the closure of the\ncase due to the request of the household. (d) The last case action recorded in WMS, for\na SNAP household of which the individual was the only member, is the\ntermination of an automatic NYSCAP enrollment because the individual failed to\nredeem SNAP benefits following the automatic enrollment in the NYSCAP, as\nprovided by this section. (2)\n\nConversion of NYSCAP-Eligible Current\nSNAP Recipient Households to the NYSCAP. (i) Current SNAP recipients who are determined eligible for SSI will be converted\nto the NYSCAP. (ii)\n\nAutomatic\nconversion of a currently active regular SNAP case to the NYSCAP will be\nstopped if an \"Exception\" situation exists for that household. The NYSCAP case\nwill not be automatically enrolled, and the Exception Reason must be reviewed\nby the social services district for possible resolution and subsequent NYSCAP\nenrollment. Exceptions include but are not limited to: (a) Case Exception Reasons: (1)\n\nThe individual is a member of a household\nthat has a pending application for SNAP benefits. (2)\n\nThe individual is sanctioned or\ndisqualified from participating in the SNAP due to a SNAP IPV. (3)\n\nThe individual is an active member of\nanother SNAP household. (4)\n\nInformation about the individual failed a date of birth or sex validation match\nbetween the SSA and the WMS. (5)\n\nThe individual is listed as residing in more than one social services\ndistrict. (6)\n\nThe individual is\nlisted as deceased in the WMS. (7)\n\nThe last SNAP case transaction for the household in the WMS was case closure\nfor having moved out-of-state. (b) Budget Exception Reasons: (1)\n\nThe individual is sanctioned or\ndisqualified from participating in the SNAP due to a SNAP IPV. (2)\n\nThe SNAP case has no stored\nbudget.

All individuals eligible to participate in the NYSCAP who\nwish to participate in the SNAP must receive SNAP through the\nproject. (b) Ineligible Households. Households ineligible to participate in\nthe NYSCAP are as follows: (1)\n\nIndividuals in\nreceipt of SSI who are not designated with a federal living arrangement Code A, and a State SSI Supplemental Code A. (2)\nSSI individuals residing in Group Living\n\nArrangements as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part. (3)\nNYSCAP-eligible SNAP recipients aged 18\nthrough 21 who are currently receiving SNAP benefits as part of a multi-person\nSNAP household are ineligible to participate and must remain part of the\nmulti-person household if they otherwise would be a required member of the\nhousehold as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part.
