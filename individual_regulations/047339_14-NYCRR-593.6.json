The physician's authorization must: (1)\nbe based upon appropriate clinical\ninformation and assessment of the individual. The initial authorization must\ninclude a face-to-face assessment; (2)\ndelineate the maximum duration of the\nauthorization to receive such services; and\n(3)\nspecify that the individual is in need of\ncommunity rehabilitation services as defined in section\n593.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart.

The\nauthorization renewal must, in the case of a transfer from congregate to\napartment, occur upon the expiration date of the current authorization or in\nthe case of a transfer from apartment to congregate, within six months of\nadmission to the new program or the expiration of the current authorization, whichever comes first. (c) Community rehabilitation services shall\nbe provided in accordance with a service plan developed within four weeks of\nadmission to the program. At the time of admission an admission note must be\nprepared by a qualified mental health staff person which, at a minimum, indicates a description of the needs of the individual as well as a brief\ndescription of the community rehabilitation services necessary to meet these\nneeds during the initial period after admission.
