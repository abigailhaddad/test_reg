  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 §§ 635-6.4 - Costs of ownership of real property\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Unless specifically otherwise provided\nfor in this Title, costs of ownership of real property shall be allowable in\nthe amount of depreciation, interest, costs of alteration, construction, rehabilitation and/or renovation to real property, and costs attributable to\nthe negotiation or settlement of sale or purchase of real property in cases\nwhere: (1)\nOPWDD and the Division of the\n\nBudget first approved the property costs before June 1, 2010; or\n(2)\nOPWDD and the Division of the Budget\nfirst approved the property costs on or after June 1, 2010, but the costs were\npreviously funded, in whole or in part, by New York State, any other state or\nthe Federal government. (b) Unless specifically otherwise provided\nfor in this Title and except as provided in paragraph (a)(2) of this section, costs of ownership of real property shall be allowable in the amount of\ninterest and principal or provider equity (see Subpart 635-99 of this Part), in\ncases where OPWDD and the Division of the Budget first approved the property\ncosts on or after June 1, 2010. (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subdivision (a) or (b) of this section, costs\nof ownership of real property shall be allowable in the amount of costs related\nto loans from the Dormitory Authority of the State of New York (see Subpart\n635-99 of this Part). (d) Reimbursement for principal and interest or provider equity and interest is an\nallowance in lieu of reimbursement of interest and depreciation associated with\nthe property, and in lieu of reimbursement of the underlying allowable costs, which may include allowable start-up costs, for which the mortgage, loan, or\nother financing is received. (e) Depreciation is based upon the historical cost and useful life of buildings, fixed equipment and/or capital improvements, alterations, rehabilitation and/or\nrenovations. (f) Principal shall be\nthe amount which the provider borrows for the purchase, alteration, construction, rehabilitation and/or renovation of real property, for costs\nattributable to the negotiation or settlement of sale or purchase of the real\nproperty and for other reasonable and necessary costs related to such purchase, alteration, construction, rehabilitation and/or renovation, including, but not\nlimited to, design fees and short term interest. Principal shall be allowable\nin the amount approved by OPWDD and the Division of the Budget, but shall not\nbe greater than the lesser of: (1)\nthe\nhistorical cost; or\n(2)\nthe amount\nthe provider actually borrowed. (g) The commissioner may allow provider\nequity in an amount not to exceed fair market value if the provider\ndemonstrates that allowing such provider equity: (1)\nis necessary in order for the facility or\nprogram in question to continue to operate, or is necessary in order for the\nfacility or program to open; (2)\nwould be an economic and efficient use of resources; and\n(3)\nwould be in the best interests of the\npersons who are receiving or will receive services at the facility or program\nin question. (h) Historical cost shall be determined as follows: (1)\n\nThe historical cost of any real property\nwhich is transferred, purchased, altered, constructed, rehabilitated and/or\nrenovated shall be equal to the amount approved by the OPWDD and the Division\nof the Budget. In deciding whether to approve any such cost, OPWDD shall\nconsider whether the provider's reimbursement as a whole for the services in\nquestion, including the cost of purchase, transfer, construction, alteration, rehabilitation and/or renovation to be approved, would result in payment which\nis consistent with efficiency and economy. In no event shall OPWDD or the\n\nDivision of Budget approve an historical cost which exceeds the lesser of fair\nmarket value or the provider's or individual's actual cost. (2)\n\nThe historical cost of any real property\nwhich is transferred or purchased from a party related to the provider or\nindividual is the lesser of fair market value or the acquisition cost of the\nreal property to the transferor or the seller. (3)\n\nThe historical cost of any real property\nwhich is altered, constructed, rehabilitated and/ or renovated by a party\nrelated to the provider or individual is the lesser of: (i) the fair market value of such alteration, construction, rehabilitation or renovation; or\n(ii)\nthe related party's cost of the\nalteration, construction, rehabilitation or renovation. (4)\n\nWhere the previous owner of the real\nproperty had the costs of such property funded, in whole or in part, by OPWDD, (i) the historical cost of the property shall\nbe the least of: (a) the acquisition cost of\nthe property to the new owner; (b) the seller's net book value (see glossary, Subpart 635-99 of this Part); or\n(c) fair market value; or\n(ii)\nnotwithstanding\nthe provisions of subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, where the previous owner\nof the real property had its costs of ownership of the real property approved\nby OPWDD, and a substitute provider is designated to operate the program at the\nsame physical location, the substitute provider may take the place of the\nprevious owner under the terms of OPWDD's approval of the previous owner's\ncosts. (5)\n\nIf the\nprevious owner is related to the provider or individual purchasing the\nproperty, any amount paid by the State to the provider or individual for rent\nequal to depreciation on the property shall be counted as paid depreciation and\nas funding for the costs of such property. (6)\n\nIf the seller or transferor of the real\nproperty to the provider or individual is not a party related to the provider\nor individual, but any prior owner of the property in question is a party\nrelated to the provider or individual, and the sale or transfer from the prior\nrelated party occurs within five years of the sale or transfer to the provider\nor individual, the transaction shall be deemed to be between the provider or\nindividual and the prior owner related to the provider or individual. (7)\n\nIf OPWDD cannot determine the historical\ncost of real property, OPWDD shall use an appraisal value as the basis for\ndepreciation. The appraisal value shall be based upon an appraisal which is\ndone by OPWDD or by an appraiser approved by OPWDD, which uses an appraisal\nmethodology which is generally accepted within the profession and which is\nfactually correct in all significant matters. OPWDD shall approve an appraiser\nif one of the following tests is met: (i) the\nappraiser is a New York State certified or licensed appraiser; or\n(ii)\nno licensed or certified appraiser is\navailable in the geographic area in which the property is located; the\nappraiser is recommended by another State agency and, in OPWDD's opinion, the\nappraiser has the professional experience and qualifications to do the\nappraisal in question. (8)\n\nThe commissioner may allow an alternative\nhistorical cost of ownership of real property obtained from a related party. (i) The commissioner may allow such\nalternative historical cost if following conditions are met: (a) the provider or individual demonstrates\nthat allowing such alternative historical cost would make property available to\nindividuals or providers which would not otherwise be available; (b) such alternative historical cost is\nsubstantially less than the cost which would be allowed under this Subpart for\nproperty which is obtained from an unrelated party and which is of similar\nfunction and value to OPWDD and to the provider or individual; (c) the seller or transferor has owned the\nproperty in question for at least five years; and\n(d) the fair market value of such property is\ngreater than the seller's cost. (ii)\n\nSuch alternative historical cost may be\ngreater than the cost of the property to the transferor or seller, but shall\nnot be greater than the lesser of: (a) the\nacquisition cost of the property to the provider or individual; or\n(b) the cost of the property to the seller or\ntransferor, increased by one-half of the percentage increase (as measured from\nthe date of acquisition by the seller to the date of the change of ownership)\nin the Consumer Price Index for New York - Northeastern New Jersey (all items), as reported by the United States Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor\n\nStatistics. (iii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner may allow an alternative historical cost only for transfers, purchases, alteration, construction, renovation or rehabilitation, the terms of\nwhich were agreed to after July 12, 2000. (9)\n\nAlternative historical cost for a\nsubstitute provider. Where the previous owner of the real property had the\ncosts of the property funded, in whole or in part, by OPWDD, and a substitute\nprovider is designated to continue operation of a program at the same physical\nlocation, OPWDD may allow an alternative historical cost of the property to\nexceed the seller's net book value (see glossary, section\n635-99.1\nof this Part). The\nalternative historical cost may not exceed the acquisition cost of the property\nto the new provider as approved and determined to be reasonable by OPWDD. The\nalternative historical cost allowed under this paragraph is only available if\nOPWDD determines that allowing such alternative historical cost: (i) is an economic and efficient use of\nresources; and\n(ii)\nis necessary to\nprotect the health, safety, or welfare of the persons who are receiving or will\nreceive services at the facility or program in question. (i) Useful life and\namortization period. (1)\n\nThe useful\nlife of depreciable assets shall be the higher of the reported useful life or\nthe useful life from the Estimated Useful Lives of Depreciable Hospital Assets\n(current edition), published by the American Hospital Association. This\ndocument is available from: (i) the American\n\nHospital Association, 840 Lake Shore Drive, Chicago, IL 60611; (ii)\nit may also be reviewed in person during\nregular business hours at the: (a) NYS\nDepartment of State, 99 Washington Avenue, Albany, NY 12231; or\n(b) by appointment at the NYS Office for\n\nPeople With Developmental Disabilities, 44 Holland Avenue, Albany, NY\n12229. (2)\n\nThe amortization period for principal repayment and provider equity shall be\nthe lesser of: (i) the term of the\nindebtedness, as approved by OPWDD and Division of the Budget, related to the\nreal property in question; or\n(ii)\nthe remaining useful life on the asset. (3)\nA provider or an individual receiving\nservices may use a different useful life or amortization period if such\ndifferent useful life or amortization period is approved by OPWDD. OPWDD shall\nbase such approval upon historical experience, documentary evidence, loan\nagreements (if any) and need for the services for which the depreciable or\nfinanced assets are used. (j) The provider or individual shall use the\nstraight-line method of depreciation. (k) Interest costs. (1)\n\nInterest costs shall be allowable if the\nfollowing criteria are met: (i) The interest\nrate is not in excess of the amount a prudent borrower would pay at the time\nthe loan was incurred. (ii)\n\nThe\nloan agreement is entered into between the provider or individual and a party\nnot related to the provider or individual. The commissioner may waive this\nprovision based on a demonstration of need for the services and cost savings\nresulting from the transaction. (iii)\n\nIf the interest expense results from\neither start-up costs and/or the initial financing of the capital indebtedness, the capital indebtedness shall represent all or part of the current OPWDD and\n\nDivision of the Budget approved value of the property, after subtracting any\nequity contributions such as, but not limited to, grants applied to the\nproperty. (iv)\n\nIn the case of\ninterest expense, or a portion of interest expense, resulting from the\nrefinancing of the capital indebtedness, the refinancing has the prior approval\nof the commissioner and the Division of the Budget, and the interest is in the\namount associated with the outstanding principal balance prior to\nrefinancing. (2)\n\nInterest expense resulting from the inclusion of the reasonable closing costs, such as, but not limited to, attorneys' fees, recording costs and points, is\nallowable in the initial financing and start-up costs, and in the refinancing\nof the capital indebtedness. (3)\n\nInterest income generated from the provider's revenues for the operation of the\nservices shall be used to offset interest expense incurred during the same\nreporting period. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a provider is not required to\nuse the following to offset interest expense: income earned on qualified\npension funds, income from gifts or grants which are donor- restricted, or\nincome earned on secure investments pursuant to section\n680.12\n(d)(10), 681.11\n(f)(1)(xi), (3)(iii) and\n(iv), 681.12\n(c)(10)(xi), (xii), (12), 686.13\n(i), 690.7\n(d)(2)(ii)\n(\nd\n), (\ne\n) or (e)(9) of this Title. (l) Where any real property for\nwhich previous Medicaid payment has been made is transferred by sale, purchase, acquisition or merger (other than as a result of a receivership under New York\n\nMental Hygiene Law, section 16.27), the costs (including legal fees, accounting\nand administrative costs, travel costs and the costs of feasibility studies)\nattributable to the negotiation or settlement of sale or purchase are not\nallowable. (m) Costs related to\n\nDormitory Authority loans shall be allowable as follows: (1)\n\nThe cost of principal and interest\npayments on loans from the Dormitory Authority pursuant to subdivision 13-d of\nsection 5 of the Facilities Development Corporation Act, net of the portion of\nsuch payments attributable to operating costs, are allowable; provided that the\nreimbursement of such costs is an allowance in lieu of reimbursement of\ninterest and depreciation associated with the property, and in lieu of\nreimbursement of the underlying allowable costs, which may include allowable\nstart-up costs, for which the Dormitory Authority loan is received. A provider\nwhich receives a Dormitory Authority loan shall not have the option of having\nincluded, in the calculation of its rate, fee or price, the loan's underlying\ncosts instead of the loan principal and interest payments. (2)\n\nOperational period fees imposed by OPWDD\nand annual administrative fees imposed by the Dormitory Authority in connection\nwith Dormitory Authority mortgage loans shall be allowable costs. (3)\n\nInterest payments on Dormitory Authority\nloans pursuant to this subdivision for capital indebtedness and start-up costs\nwill be considered allowable where interest expense results from capital\nindebtedness and start-up costs in an amount equal to the OPWDD and Division of\n\nBudget approved value of the loan. (4)\n\nInterest payments on Dormitory Authority\nloans pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision are allowable in excess of\nthe amount associated with the outstanding principal balance prior to\nrefinancing, if the purpose of the debt is to acquire assets to be used for\ncare of the persons served by the program or services and all other applicable\nrequirements of this Part are met.
