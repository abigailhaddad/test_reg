  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 46.3 - Inclusions in gross operating income\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Gross operating income includes receipts\nfrom sales of gas, electricity, steam, water, refrigeration, telephony or\ntelegraphy, and from the furnishing of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service, for ultimate consumption or use\nwithin this State. It also includes receipts from transportation originating\nin, terminating in or traversing this State, by omnibuses having a seating\ncapacity of more than seven persons, allocated within this State on a passenger\nmileage basis. Question 66: Manufacturing plants sometimes have a surplus of gas, electricity, steam, water or refrigeration, which they dispose of by selling to\nothers. Are such plants within the definition of utilities and subject to tax\non the receipts from such sales?\nAnswer: Yes. Question 67: The owner or lessee of an apartment house or office\nbuilding purchases gas, electricity, steam, water or refrigeration and resells\nthe same to tenants either at flat or metered rates. Is the owner or lessee\nsubject to tax on the receipts from such sales?\nAnswer: Yes. Question 68: Does it make any difference whether the owner or lessee of\nthe apartment house or office building resells the entire quantity purchased, or only a portion thereof consuming the balance?\nAnswer: No. Where the owner or lessee uses or consumes a portion of the commodity or\nservice purchased, his vendor is taxable on its receipts from such\nportion. (b) Utilities in\nthe second class are required to report all purchases of commodities which form\nthe basis for the tax, regardless of whether they resell all that they purchase\nor only a portion thereof. If they resell any part of the quantity they\npurchase, they will be required to show in the detailed schedule of the tax\nreturn the places where sales were made or services rendered, together with the\nquantities sold and the amounts received on account of such sales, as well as\nthe quantities consumed by them. (c) In order that the apartment house, office\nbuilding or other utility, which resells some part or all of the utility\nservice purchased, may support its claim that all such service was not resold\nand that the utility which made the original sale may support its deduction of\nthe quantity resold by its purchaser, it is necessary for the apartment house, office building or other utility so reselling utility services to report to its\nvendor, as of the end of its billing period, the quantity resold. In the city\nof New York, sales tax remission certificates may be accepted as such a report. Question 69: A utility sells 15,000 kilowatt hours of electricity to an\noffice building between June 29, 1950, and July 25, 1950, which is billed as\nfollows: Demand charge....... $100\n10,000 K.W.H. at four cents....... 400\n5,000 K.W.H at two cents....... 100\n$600\n\nThe average price per K.W.H. is, therefore, four cents. The\noffice building, during a period ended in July, 1950, uses 6,000 K.W.H. and\nresells 8,000 K.W.H. to its tenants for $400. What amount is taxable as gross\noperating income of the office building?\nAnswer: The office\nbuilding will be subject to tax on its receipts of $400. (d) Where a hotel or apartment house\nsupplements for its guests or tenants the telephone service supplied them by\nthe telephone company and makes a charge therefor, the amount of such charge, i.e., the excess above the charge of the telephone company, is\nrequired to be included in gross operating income of the hotel or apartment\nhouse. Where the telephone company graduates its charges for local messages\naccording to the number emanating from the hotel or apartment house, the\naverage charge of the telephone company for the reporting period shall be\nemployed in determining the amount of the supplemental charge made by the hotel\nor apartment house. Question 70: A hotel or apartment house makes available to its guests or\ntenants telephone service furnished by the telephone company. If the telephone\ncompany charges five cents for its services in connection with a local message\nand the hotel or apartment house 10 cents for its supplemental services, what\namount is the hotel or apartment house required to include in its gross\noperating income?\nAnswer: Ten cents per message. Question 71: A guest of a New York City hotel calls San Francisco, Cal., and Buffalo, N. Y. The telephone company charges $12 for the San Francisco call\nand $1.80 for the Buffalo call. The hotel, for its supplemental service, adds\n60 cents to the telephone charge for the San Francisco call and 10 cents to the\ncharge for the Buffalo call. What amount is the hotel required to include in\nits gross operating income?\nAnswer: Seventy cents, that being\nits supplemental charge for telephone services rendered its guest. (e) (1)\n\nIn determining gross operating income, as\nin determining gross income, receipts include \"cash, credits and property of\nany kind or nature, with-out any deduction therefrom on account of the cost of\nthe property sold, the cost of materials used, labor or services or other\ncosts, interest or discount paid, or any other expenses whatsoever\".
