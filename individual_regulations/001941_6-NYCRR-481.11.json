  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 481.11 - Reasonable cause\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nfollowing exemplify grounds for reasonable cause, where clearly established by\nthe person requesting a redetermination of a penalty, consideration of a late\nchallenge, or reconsideration of a determination made in the challenge process\nwhen a timely response was not made: (1)\n\nThe\ndeath or serious illness of the person owing the regulatory fee or a\nresponsible officer, employee or other representative of such person which\nprecluded timely payment of the fees owed or timely challenge to the fees owed\nprovided that the fee is paid within a justifiable period of time after the\ndeath, illness or absence. A justifiable period of time is that period which is\nsubstantiated by the person or the person's representative as a reasonable\nperiod of time for paying the fee owed. Example:It was established that illness incapacitated the\nowner and sole stockholder of a small business concern during the period when a\nregulatory fee was owed and penalty was accruing. The owner further established\nthat no other person had access to sufficient information which would have\nresulted in fee payment. The fee was paid with interest due within a\njustifiable time after the owner returned to work. This constitutes reasonable\ncause for failure to pay the fee. (2)\n\nThe destruction of the person's or the\nperson's representative's place of business or business records by a fire or\nother documented casualty, which precluded timely payment of a regulatory fee\nowed or timely challenge to a fee owed provided that the fee is paid within a\njustifiable period which is substantiated by the person or the person's\nrepresentative as a reasonable period of time for paying the fee owed based on\nthe facts and circumstances of each case. Example:The place of business, together with the business\nrecords and the regulatory fee bill were destroyed by a documented casualty at\nthe period of time when the fee was due and penalty was accruing. The fee was\npaid within a justifiable period of time after the casualty took place. This\nconstitutes reasonable cause for failure to pay the fee due. (3)\n\nThe fee bill was sent to an incorrect\naddress, delaying the time when the bill was received by the person who owes\nthe fee which precluded timely payment of the fee owed or timely challenge to\nthe fee owed. The fee was paid within a justifiable period of time from when\nthe bill was received and the person can prove that the incorrect address was\nnot a result of the person's failure to notify the department of a change of\naddress. Example:A fee bill was normally sent to a subsidiary of a\ncompany. The subsidiary was closed and it took one month for the post office to\nforward the bill to the parent company. The parent company paid the bill within\na justifiable period of time from when the bill was received. This constitutes\nreasonable cause for failure to pay the fee due provided that the parent\ncompany can prove that it notified the department of the address change. (4)\n\nAny other cause for\ndelinquency which would appear to a person of ordinary prudence and\nintelligence as a reasonable cause for delay and which clearly indicates an\nabsence of willful neglect may be determined to be reasonable cause. Ignorance\nof law, however, will not be considered as a basis for reasonable cause. Reasonable cause may be determined to exist only where the person owing the fee\nacted in good faith. A criminal conviction or commissioner's order, in which a\nperson has been found to violate the ECL, its regulations or permits, is\nevidence of the lack of good faith. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n481.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
