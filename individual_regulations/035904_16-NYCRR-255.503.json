Tit. 16 § 255.503 - General requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No\nperson may operate a new segment of pipeline, or return to service a segment of\npipeline that has been reconstructed, relocated, replaced, or reactivated until\nit has been tested in accordance with this Part to substantiate the proposed\nmaximum allowable operating pressure and each leak has been located and\neliminated. (b) The test medium\nmust be liquid, air, natural gas or inert gas that is: (1)\ncompatible with the material of which the\npipeline is constructed; (2)\nrelatively free of sedimentary materials; and\n(3)\nexcept for natural gas, nonflammable. (c) If\nair, natural gas, or inert gas is used as the test medium, the following\nmaximum hoop stress limitations apply: Maximum hoop stress allowed\nas\npercentage of\nSMYS\nClass\n\nNatural\n\nAir or inert\n\nLocation\ngas\ngas\n1....... 80....... 80\n2....... 30....... 75\n3....... 30....... 50\n4....... 30....... 40\n(d) Each weld used to tie-in a test segment\nof pipeline is excepted from the test requirements of this Part. (e) If a component other than pipe is the\nonly item being replaced or added to a pipeline, a strength test after\ninstallation is not required, if the manufacturer of the component certifies\nthat: (1)\nthe component was tested to at least\nthe pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being added; (2)\nthe component was manufactured under a\nquality control system that ensures that each item manufactured is at least\nequal in strength to a prototype and that the prototype was tested to at least\nthe pressure required for the pipeline to which it is being added; or\n(3)\nthe component carries a pressure rating\nestablished through applicable ASME/ANSI, Manufacturers Standardization Society\nof the Valve and Fittings Industry, Inc. (MSS) specifications, or by unit\nstrength calculations as described in section\n255.143\nof this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.503\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
