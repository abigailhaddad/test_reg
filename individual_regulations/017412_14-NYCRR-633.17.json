  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 633.17 - Medication (including vitamins)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nThe management and administration of medication (see glossary) shall take place\nin the safest possible manner, while at the same time enabling facilities to\naccess the services of health care professionals (see glossary) and pharmacists\nin the community without imposing undue or unenforceable requirements on such\nparties or the facility itself. However, the very fact that a person (see\nglossary) who is developmentally disabled is entrusted to the care and\nsupervision of a facility (see glossary) operated or certified by OPWDD means\nthat certain precautions must be taken and certain procedures observed that\nmight not be considered necessary in a familial home environment. (2)\n\nAdherence to this section shall be\nrequired of all residential facilities after January 1, 1990. (3)\n\nAfter January 1, 1990, adherence to this\nsection shall be required of any nonresidential facility that is responsible\nfor the administration of medication while a person is in attendance. For those\nnonresidential facilities which are not required, by regulation, to be\nresponsible for the administration of medication and whose governing body has\nadopted a policy not to administer medication, the following shall apply: (i) There is written policy/procedure to this\neffect. (ii)\n\nThere is written\npolicy/procedure as to the responsibilities of persons in attendance, and/or\nthose where such persons reside, to ensure the administration of medication, should it become necessary (\ne.g., the person in attendance\nwill be responsible for self-administration of medication [see glossary] and\ntherefore must be capable of independent self-administration of medication; arrangements are made for someone from a person's place of residence to\nadminister medication or supervise or assist in the self-administration of\nmedication). (iii)\n\nThe above\npolicies/procedure are conveyed to applicants, persons in attendance, parents, guardians or correspondents in conformance with section\n633.4\n(a)(7)\nof\nthis Part. (iv)\n\nThe facility\nperiodically assesses its policy relative to the needs of persons currently\nserved. (4)\n\nThis section\napplies to the management and administration of medication to individuals (see\nglossary) while in a facility or while under the facility's direct\nsupervision. (5)\n\nEach\nagency/facility shall develop its own policies/procedures relative to\nprescribed (see glossary) and over-the-counter medication (see glossary) as is\nrelevant to its needs. Family care homes shall adhere to policies/procedures as\ndeveloped by their sponsoring agency. All such policies/procedures shall be in\nconformance with this Part. ICF/DD's shall also ensure compliance with Part\n681. (6)\n\nThis section does not\naddress the requirements to be met by a pharmacy located in a\nfacility. (7)\n\nAll medication shall\nbe prescribed or ordered, obtained, provided, received, administered, safeguarded, documented, refilled and/or disposed of in a manner that ensures\nthe health, safety, and well-being of the people being served and in\nconformance with all applicable Federal and State statute or regulations. Where\nrequirements are more restrictive in Part 681 (for ICF/DD's), they shall be\ncontrolling. (8)\n\nEvery person has\nthe right to be free from the unnecessary use of medication. (9)\n\nEvery effort shall be made to ensure that\nmedication is prescribed or ordered in the lowest dosage possible to achieve\nthe desired effect(s). (10)\n\nNo\nmedication shall be used for the convenience of staff or as a substitute for\nprogramming. (11)\n\nSpecial attention\nshall be given to those individuals receiving psychotropic medication to detect\nand prevent possible medical problems. (12)\n\nMedication purchased with an\nindividual's own personal funds shall be used by or for that person only. A\nfacility may purchase an over-the-counter medication for use by more than one\nperson. (13)\n\nThe use of\nover-the-counter medication is permitted when administered in accordance with\nthe following to ensure that the medication is appropriate and that there will\nbe no expected contraindications: (i) Approval\nfor a specific individual to use or be administered a medication is received in\nwriting on no less than an annual basis (but in conformance with any other\nfacility specific controlling regulations) from that individual's\npractitioner(s) (see glossary). (ii)\n\nThere is information in an individual's\nrecord, and available to staff or the family care provider, as to the condition\nfor which a medication is to be used, the dosage, the frequency with which it\nmay be administered, and any specific instructions related to the\nmedication. (iii)\n\nAdministration of\nan over-the-counter medication does not exceed two days unless so specified by\na practitioner; or the practitioner is contacted for instructions for extended\nuse. Exceptions are certain vitamins and over-the-counter medications that a\npractitioner instructs to be given on a daily basis. (iv)\n\nNothing in this section shall prevent a\nperson residing in a supportive community residence or a family care home, who\nis capable of independent self-administration of medication, from obtaining and\nusing over-the-counter medication at his or her discretion. However, the\nindividual shall be given appropriate guidance relative to obtaining and self-\nadministering over-the-counter medications. (14)\n\nAdministration of prescribed and\nover-the-counter medication shall be in conformance with the following: (i) A prescribed medication shall be\nadministered only to the person for whom it is prescribed, and in compliance\nwith the prescribing practitioner's instructions. (ii)\n\nIf there is a significant adverse\nreaction, a significant change in behavior, or any other significant\nindication(s) of a problem that may be related to a medication currently being\nadministered to or by an individual, the use of the medication is to be\nsuspended. The indicated problem is to be reported to the prescribing\npractitioner immediately. If the prescribing practitioner is not available, medical treatment is to be obtained elsewhere, if indicated. However, the\nprescribing practitioner shall receive notification as soon as possible of all\nadverse reactions, behavior changes, etc., that may be related to a medication\nadministered to or by an individual, and any treatment received for the adverse\nreaction. (iii)\n\nMedication shall be\nself-administered or administered only by the following: (a) a person capable of independent\nself-administration of medication; (b) a health care professional (a physician, dentist, physician's assistant, registered nurse, or licensed practical nurse\nholding current New York State licensure); (c) staff (see glossary) providing direct\ncare services (see glossary), as documented by job description, who have: (1)\nsuccessfully completed an OPWDD approved\ntraining course in medication; and\n(2)\nsuccessfully completed the required\npracticum; and\n(3)\nbeen certified\nor recertified within the year to administer medication; or\n(d) a family care provider whose\nname appears on the operating certificate for the family care home, and who has\nreceived training in medication administration in conformance with an OPWDD\napproved curriculum; or a sponsoring agency approved substitute, in the absence\nof the family care provider. (iv)\n\nNothing in this section shall prevent a\nperson residing in a supportive community residence or a family care home, who\nis capable of independent self-administration of medication, from obtaining and\nusing prescribed and/or over-the-counter medications. However, the individual\nshall be given appropriate guidance relative to obtaining and\nself-administering medications. (15)\n\nSupervision and monitoring of staff. (i) Medical or nursing supervision of those\nstaff responsible for administering medication shall be provided. (ii)\n\nSupervision and monitoring shall be in\naccordance with agency/facility policies/procedures. (16)\n\nEvaluation of persons for\nself-administration of medication (see glossary). (i) If, upon admission, a person has not been\nevaluated as to his or her ability to self-administer medication, staff or the\nfamily care provider are responsible for the administration of\nmedication. (ii)\n\nEach person at a\nresidential facility is to be evaluated by a program planning team (with input\nfrom a registered nurse, physician, or physician's assistant) at the first case\nreview, but no later than three months after admission, to determine his or her\ncurrent ability to self-administer medication. Other providers of services to\nthe person, and his or her physician, shall be informed of the person's\ndesignation. A nonresidential facility that assumes responsibility for the\nadministration of medication while a person is in attendance shall: (a) accept the determination made at a\nperson's place of residence in accordance with subparagraph (ii) of this\nparagraph, if the facility is OPWDD operated or certified; or\n(b) evaluate the person; and\n(c) evaluate all persons' who do not reside\nin an OPWDD operated or certified facility. (iii)\n\nEvaluations shall be part of each\nperson's plan of services and shall designate whether the person is: (a) capable of independent\nself-administration of medication; or\n(b) capable of self-administration of\nmedication with supervision; or\n(c) capable of self-administration of medication with assistance; or\n(d) incapable of self-administration of\nmedication (administration of medication must be done by others). (iv)\n\nEvaluations shall be reviewed\nno less than annually and may be incorporated into the program planning review\nprocess. (v) For a person who is\nnot capable of independent self-administration of medication, a plan shall be\ndeveloped by his or her program planning team. A nonresidential facility that\nassumes the responsibility for the administration of medication, shall assume\nthis obligation for those persons not residing in an OPWDD operated or\ncertified facility. The purpose of the plan is to assist the person to\nultimately reach his or her optimum level of capability in the\nself-administration of medication, unless: (a) the program planning team determines that other programmatic needs are of\ngreater priority and are to be addressed first; or\n(b) the program planning team determines that\nsuch a plan is not appropriate; or\n(c) a physician determines that a plan should\nnot be developed for the person, and the program planning team concurs. All such determinations, and the justification, shall be\ndocumented in each person's plan of services. (vi)\n\nThe method used to verify a person's\nlevel of self-administration and the documentation required shall be determined\nby agency/facility policy/procedures. (vii)\n\nWhen a person, designated as capable of\nindependent self-administration of medication, must be frequently reminded to\ntake his or her medication, or there are other indications of lessening of\nskills related to self-administration, there shall be a reevaluation of the\nperson's ability and a decision made as to whether the degree of supervision or\nassistance is to be increased. (17)\n\nRecords. (i) Except as provided for in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, there shall be a separate record for the administration\nof medication for each person receiving medication. The record documenting\nadministration shall specify at least the following: (a) name of person receiving the\nmedication; (b) name of medication, dosage, and route of administration; (c) time and date of administration; and\n(d) signature of the party who\nsupervised, assisted, administered, or independently self-administered the\nmedication (or initials that correspond to those on a signature\nsheet). (ii)\n\nIn\nsupportive community residences and family care homes: (a) there shall be documentation as described\nin subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; or\n(b) for persons who are capable of\nindependent self-administration there shall be documentation in the person's\nclinical record of the supervision provided to ensure that the person is taking\nmedication as required. Such supervision may be in the form of occasional\nverbal checks, checks on the amount of medication remaining, or in any manner\nor frequency deemed appropriate by the program planning team. (iii)\n\nFor the safety of the people\nresiding in or attending a facility and as a support to those staff who have\nmedication administration related responsibilities, there shall be information\nspecific to each person on all medications to be administered to that person\nwhile at or under the supervision of the facility and its staff. The sponsoring\nagency shall ensure maintenance of this information for people in family care\nhomes and provide the information to the family care provider. For each\nmedication a person is taking, this information shall include: (a) name of person taking the\nmedication; (b) name of\nmedication; (c) directions with\nregard to correct dose, form, method/route of administration, time of\nadministration; (d) start and stop\ndates, if applicable; (e) expected\ntherapeutic effects for the person taking the medication; (f) possible side effects to the person\ntaking the medication; and\n(g) name\nof prescribing, ordering or approving practitioner. (18)\n\nMedication regimen review. (i) Residential facilities shall ensure that\na review of a person's medication regimen is conducted on no less than an\nannual basis, or more frequently as needed. The review shall be made by a\nregistered nurse, physician, physician's assistant or pharmacist. (ii)\n\nThe medication regimen review shall\ninclude, at a minimum: (a) A review of the\nperson's medication record for potential adverse reactions, allergies, interactions, contraindications, or irregularities; related laboratory work\nshall be included in this review. (b) An assessment of the person's response to\nmedication therapy to determine if the medication is achieving the stated\nobjectives established by the prescribing practitioner. (c) Recommendations to the primary and/or\nconsulting practitioner of any indicated changes in the person's medication\nregimen. (d) Determination of the\nneed for a more frequent review depending upon the person's medical\nstatus. (e) Documentation of the\nreview, findings, and any recommendations made. (iii)\n\nTo the extent that requirements of\nsection\n633.16\n(j)(5)\nof\nthis Part are more rigorous than the requirements of this paragraph, the\nrequirements of section\n633.16\n(j)(5)\nof\nthis Part are controlling. (19)\n\nStorage of medication at the facility. (i) Medication shall be maintained in the\noriginal container in which it was received. All containers shall be labeled. Labels shall be clear and legible. (ii)\n\nSafe, secure, appropriate, and adequate\nstorage space shall be provided. (a) Other\nthan in a supportive community residence or a family care home, medication\nshall be kept in a secure, locked storage area. (b) Persons who are capable of independent\nself-administration of medication may have their medication stored so as to be\npersonally accessible to themselves and staff who are currently certified to\nadminister medication, those who are health care professionals and family care\nproviders, or their substitutes, if such a procedure does not expose other\nresidents to harm. (c) Other than\nin a supportive community residence or a family care home, medication stored in\na refrigerator containing food shall be placed in a separate locked container\nclearly marked to indicate that it contains medication. (d) Other than in a supportive community\nresidence a family care home, or as specified in clause (e) of this\nsubparagraph, all medication packaged and labeled by the issuing pharmacy as a\n\"controlled substance,\" and syringes and needles, shall be kept in secure, double-locked storage unless all persons in the residence are capable of\nindependent self-administration of medication, and such a procedure does not\nexpose other residents to harm. In family care homes, controlled substances and\nsyringes and needles shall be kept in locked storage. (e) In all facilities other than supportive\ncommunity residences, when all persons in the residence are capable of\nindependent self-administration of medication, a controlled substance, syringes, and needles shall be stored in a locked area or container so as to be\naccessible only to the person for whom it was prescribed, staff who are\ncurrently certified to administer medication or who are health care\nprofessionals, and family care providers or their substitutes. (iii)\n\nOutdated medication shall\nnot be retained by a facility. (iv)\n\nDiscontinued medication shall not be retained by a facility unless specific\ninstructions are received from a prescribing practitioner to do so. (v) Medication removed from a storage area\nshall never be left unattended. (20)\n\nDisposal. (i) Noncontrolled medication. Medication\nshall be destroyed on the premises in conformance with agency/facility specific\npolicy and procedure which ensures that disposal is carried out only by\nphysicians, physician's assistants, registered nurses, licensed practical\nnurses, or staff who are certified in medication administration, and (in family\ncare homes) family care providers; the disposal shall be documented. (ii)\n\nControlled medication. For facilities\nnot holding a Health Department dispensing license, the disposal of controlled\nsubstances is to be carried out by two persons. These persons must either be a\nphysician, physician's assistant, registered nurse, licensed practical nurse, a\npharmacist, a staff person certified in medication administration, or (in a\nfamily care home) a family care provider with a nurse or the family care case\nmanager. One person is to dispose of the medication and the other is to\ncomplete the documentation. For facilities holding a Health Department\ndispensing license, controlled substances are to be either sent directly to the\n\nBureau of Controlled Substances at the New York State Department of Health, using the current controlled substance surrender form; or destroyed on site\nafter receiving written approval from the bureau in conformance with its\ncurrent requirements. (iii)\n\nNeedles\nand syringes. All needles and syringes are to be placed in puncture resistant\ncontainers immediately after use. When filled, the container should be taken or\nsent to an approved site for incineration. The disposal shall be\ndocumented. (b) Standards of certification. (1)\n\nIf a nonresidential facility does not administer medication, there is\ndocumentation that the persons in attendance, parents, guardians or\ncorrespondents have been notified of this fact and the expectations should the\nadministration of medication be necessary while a person is at the\nfacility. (2)\n\nThere is\ndocumentation that at least annually, each person at a residential facility has\nbeen evaluated as to his or her ability to self-administer medication. If a\nnonresidential facility assumes the responsibility for the administration of\nmedication, there is documentation that those persons who do not live in an\nOPWDD facility have been evaluated by the nonresidential facility, at least\nannually, as to their ability to administer medication. (3)\n\nExcept as specified in paragraph (4) of\nthis subdivision, there is a record for each person in any facility where\nmedication is administered which documents the administration of medication. The record contains: (i) name of the\nperson; (ii)\nname of medication, dosage, and route of administration; (iii)\ntime and date of administration; and\n(iv)\nsignature or initials of\nthe party who supervised, assisted or administered the medication; or of the\nperson who independently self-administered medication. If initials are used, there is a corresponding signature sheet. (4)\n\nIn supportive community residences and\nfamily care homes: (i) there is a record as\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision; or\n(ii)\nfor persons who are capable of\nindependent self-administration, there is documentation of the supervision\nprovided by the agency/facility to ensure that the person is taking medication\nas required.

(6)\n\nThere is documentation that all\nmedication being taken by a person residing in an OPWDD operated or certified\nfacility or attending a nonresidential facility where medication is\nadministered has been prescribed, ordered, or approved by a practitioner\n(except that in a supportive community residence, a family care home, or\nnonresidential facility, over-the-counter medication may be taken without a\nphysician's prescription, order, or approval if the person taking the\nmedications is capable of independent self-administration of\nmedication). (7)\n\nThere is\ndocumentation in supportive community residences and family care homes that\npersons who are capable of independent self-administration of medication have\nreceived guidance on the obtaining and use of prescribed and over-the-counter\nmedication. (8)\nOPWDD shall verify\nthat the medication regimen of each person in a certified residential facility\nhas been reviewed at least annually by a registered nurse, physician, physician\nassistant, or pharmacist. (9)\nOPWDD\nshall verify that in residential facilities and nonresidential facilities that\nassume the responsibility for the administration of medication, there is\ninformation on each medication being used by each person and that the\ninformation is specific to that person, the information is available to staff\nor the family care provider, and it includes: (i) name of person taking the\nmedication; (ii)\nname of\nmedication; (iii)\ndirections with\nregard to correct dose, form, method/route of administration, time of\nadministration; (iv)\nstart and stop\ndates, if applicable; (v) expected\ntherapeutic effects for the person taking the medication; (vi)\npossible side effects to the person\ntaking the medication; and\n(vii)\nname of prescribing, ordering, or approving practitioner. (10)\nOPWDD shall verify that, except in a\nsupportive community residence or a family care home, all medication is kept in\na secure, locked storage area; and controlled substances and syringes and\nneedles are kept in a double locked storage area (unless all persons residing\nat the facility are capable of independent self-administration of medication, in which case the controlled medication is kept in a locked area or\ncontainer). (11)\nOPWDD shall verify\nthat all medication is stored in its original container. (12)\nOPWDD shall verify that all medication\ncontainers are labeled and that labels on medication containers are clear and\nlegible. (13)\nOPWDD shall verify\nthat there are no outdated medications in designated medication storage areas\nin the facility. (14)\nOPWDD shall\nverify that there are no discontinued medications in designated storage areas\nin the facility, unless a prescribing practitioner has specifically instructed\nthat a medication be retained for possible future use; or the agency/facility, under the Department of Health dispensing license, is waiting for authorization\nfrom the Department of Health to destroy the medication. (15)\n\nExcept in a supportive community\nresidence or family care home, OPWDD shall verify that medication, stored in a\nrefrigerator also used for food, is kept in a separate locked container labeled\nto indicate that it contains medication. (16)\n\nThere is documentation that the training\nmaterial used to teach medication administration to appropriate staff or family\ncare providers is either: (i) the OPWDD\ncurriculum; or\n(ii)\na curriculum\napproved by OPWDD.
