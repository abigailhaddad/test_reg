  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 233.3 - Control requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Process equipment requirements. The owner or operator of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic\nmanufacturing process subject to this Part must control the volatile organic\ncompound emissions from reactors, extractors, distillation operations, crystallizers, centrifuges, and vacuum dryers which have an emission rate\npotential of more than 15 pounds per day as follows: (1)\n\nWhen surface condensers are used, the\ncondenser outlet gas temperature must not exceed the allowable temperature\nlimit described for each associated vapor pressure in the Table 1. Table 1\nVOC vapor pressure at 20° C\n(psi)\n\nAllowable condenser outlet gas\ntemperature (° C)\n> 5.8\n- 25\n> 2.9\n- 15\n> 1.5\n0\n> 1.0\n10\n> 0.5\n25\n(2)\n\nIf the operation of a condenser at the\nexit temperature specified above results in freezing and consequent plugging of\nthe condenser, the allowable exit temperature may be raised to a maximum of 2°C\nabove the freezing point of the volatile organic compound. (3)\n\nIn cases where the condenser outlet gas\ntemperature is not readily measurable due to negligible gas flow rate, the\ntemperature of the condenser coolant may be used in lieu of condenser outlet\ngas temperature as long as the temperature of the condenser coolant does not\nexceed the allowable condenser outlet gas temperature shown in Table\n1. (b) Air dryer\nand production equipment exhaust system requirements. Except as provided under subdivision (a) of this section, the owner or operator of a pharmaceutical or cosmetic manufacturing process\nsubject to this Part must not operate, cause, allow or permit the operation of\nany air dryer or production exhaust system which conducts fugitive volatile\norganic compounds from a work area unless the emissions to the outdoor\natmosphere are controlled as follows: (1)\nfor air dryers and production equipment\nexhaust systems with an emission rate potential of volatile organic compounds\nof 330 pounds per day or more, 90 percent control is required; (2)\nfor air dryers and production equipment\nexhaust systems with an emission rate potential of volatile organic compounds\nof less than 330 pounds per day, an emission reduction to 33 pounds per day is\nrequired. (c) VOC\ntransfer requirements. For the transfer of volatile organic compounds with vapor\npressures greater than 4.1 psi at 20°C from trucks or railcars to storage tanks\nwith capacities greater than 2,000 gallons, other than tanks with floating\nroofs, vapor recovery or equivalent controls, a vapor balance system or\nequivalent control that provides at least 90.0 percent control of the volatile\norganic compound emissions is required. (d) Storage tank requirements. For all storage tanks that store volatile organic compounds\nwith vapor pressures greater than 1.5 psi at 20°C, pressure/vacuum conservation\nvents set at 0.03 psi must be installed, unless more effective control\nequipment is used. (e) Centrifuge and filter requirements. All centrifuges containing volatile organic compounds, rotary vacuum filters processing volatile organic compounds and any other\nfilters having an exposes liquid surface where the liquid contains volatile\norganic compounds and exerts a total vapor pressure of 0.5 psi or more at 20°C\nmust be enclosed unless production, sampling, maintenance, or inspection\nprocedures require operator access. (f) In-process tank\nrequirements. For in-process tanks containing a volatile organic\ncompound, covers must be installed on openings to these tanks. Tank openings\nmust remain covered unless production, sampling, maintenance, or inspection\nprocedures require operator access. (g) Leak requirements. All leaks from which a liquid containing volatile organic\ncompounds can be observed running or dripping must be repaired the first time\nthe equipment is off-line for a period of time long enough to complete the\nrepair, but not later than 15 days after the leak is discovered. If the leaking\ncomponent cannot be repaired until the process is shut down, and a shut down\ncannot be done within the 15 days after the leak is detected, the leaking\ncomponent must then be repaired before the process is restarted. (h) (1)\n\nThe commissioner may allow processes\nsubject to this Part to operate with a lesser degree of control than what is\nrequired per subdivisions (a)-(g) of this section provided that a process\nspecific reasonably available control technology (RACT) demonstration has been\nmade to the satisfaction of the commissioner. Process specific RACT\ndemonstrations must be submitted with the application for a permit to\nconstruct, a certificate to operate, or renewal of a certificate to operate for\nan existing source under the provisions of Part 201 of this Title. Such process\nspecific RACT demonstrations must be submitted to the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency as a revision to the State Implementation Plan\nand must address the technical and economic feasibility of: (i) utilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would achieve the degree of control\nrequired in subdivision (a)-(g) of this section; (ii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would not achieve the degree of control\nrequired in subdivision (a)-(g) of this section; (iii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nproduction modification methods which would result in real, documented, and\nenforceable reductions in the volatile organic compound emissions from the\nprocess. (2)\n\nFacilities\nwith processes subject to this Part with an annual potential to emit less than\nfive tons of volatile organic compounds will only be required to comply with\nsubparagraphs (1)(i) and (1)(iii) of this subdivision in order to demonstrate\nthat a lesser degree of control is RACT for these processes. (3)\n\nThe commissioner may allow sources which\nuse natural gas fired afterburners as control devices for processes subject to\nthis Part, to shut down these natural gas fired afterburners from November 1st\nthrough March 31st for the purposes of natural gas conservation, provided that\nthe commissioner has determined that this action will not jeopardize air\nquality. Such evidence must be submitted with the application for a permit to\nconstruct, a certificate, or renewal of a certificate to operate for an\nexisting source under the provisions of Part 201 of this Title.
