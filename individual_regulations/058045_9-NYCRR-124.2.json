(d) Distributors, microbusinesses, cooperatives, RODs, or RONDs shall: (1)\nreport retailers who are delinquent in\npayment for cannabis products to the Office; and\n(2)\nnot sell cannabis products on credit to\nany retailer reported and found by the Office to have a delinquent payment due, as provided in this section. (e) Delinquent List. (1)\n\nDistributor, microbusiness, cooperative, ROD, or ROND licensees shall, on or before the respective notification dates, as determined by the Office, for each retail dispensary license, give written\nnotice of default, by first class mail or by such other method as contemplated\nor permitted by or under the applicable agreement, to all such licensees\ntherein who have failed to make payment to them on or before their final\npayment date for cannabis products sold or delivered to them during a credit\nperiod ending on their final payment date. No retail licensee shall be placed\nin default if the distributors, microbusinesses, cooperatives, ROD, or ROND has\nissued an account credit to the licensee, which after application to all debts\nowed by the retail dispensary licensee, is equal to or greater than the amount\nof the default. Any such retail dispensary licensee receiving a notice of\ndefault shall not thereafter purchase cannabis products, except for by paying\nwith cash, until such time as the Office determines that their name shall not\nbe published on the delinquent list as provided in subdivision (d) of this\nsection, or until such time as the Office permits sales or deliveries to them\nas provided in subdivision (g) of this section. Each such distributor, microbusiness, cooperative, ROD, or ROND is hereby required to file with the\n\nOffice, on or before each notification date, copies of the notices sent by them\nto all delinquent retail dispensary licensees as required in this subdivision, and in addition, if the Office shall so require, a written list setting forth\nthe names and addresses of all such delinquent licensees. The Office, in its\ndiscretion, may extend for a period not exceeding three (3) days, the date for\ngiving written notice of default to delinquent retail dispensary licensees and\nextend for three (3) days, the date for filing with the Office the copies of\nnotices sent to such licensees and/or the written list of delinquent retail\ndispensary licensees as required in this subdivision.

(3)\n\nThe\nreceipt of a delinquent list by a distributor, microbusiness, cooperative, ROD, or ROND shall constitute knowledge of the names of the retail dispensaries\nlicensees who have failed to make payment for cannabis as required by this\nsection. (4)\n\nThe Office may publish\nthe delinquent list on its website; provided, however, that full access shall\nbe restricted to those distributors, microbusinesses, cooperatives, ROD, or\nROND licensed under this Title and access to their specific status shall be\nprovided to retail dispensaries licensed under this Title.

The licensee may appeal this determination and request a hearing pursuant\nto Part 133 of this Title. (g) The\n\nOffice, in the case of a retail dispensary licensee who has made payment for\ncannabis products, or on good cause shown, may permit sales or deliveries to\nany retail dispensary licensee who has received notice of default, or who is\nnamed on any delinquent list, on terms other than for cash, but within the\nlimitations of this section, prior to the publication of the next appropriate\ndelinquent list. (h) The Board may\nimpose any penalty or condition otherwise authorized by this section in the\ncase of any such retail dispensary licensee who fails or refuses to liquidate\nand pay unpaid balance becoming due under this subdivision.
