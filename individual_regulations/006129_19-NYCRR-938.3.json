  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 938.3 - Contribution Reporting Requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Commencing with the Client Semi-Annual\n\nReport due on January 15, 2013, and for each Client Semi-Annual Report\nthereafter, a Client Filer is required to disclose Contributions received in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivisions (b), (c) (d), and (e) of this\nsection. (b) For the purpose of\nsatisfying Legislative Law § 1-h(c)(4), a Client Filer whose lobbying\nactivity is performed on its own behalf and not pursuant to retention by a\nclient need only report Contribution(s) received from each Source in a Client\n\nSemi-Annual Report and is not additionally required to report such\n\nContribution(s) on a Lobbyist Bi-Monthly Report. (c) When a Client Filer has met the\n\nExpenditure Threshold during the first client semi-annual reporting period of\nthe calendar year (January 1st - June 30th), the Client Filer shall aggregate\nall such Contributions, regardless of the amount, received from each Source. If\nthe sum of such Contributions is more than $2,500, then a Client Filer is\nrequired to disclose the information in subdivision (e) of this section for\neach Contribution. If the sum of the Contributions received from each Source is\n$2,500 or less, then a Client Filer is not required to disclose any\n\nContribution(s) from the Source in the Client Semi-Annual Report that covers\nthe first reporting period of the calendar year. (d) When a Client Filer has met the\n\nExpenditure Threshold during the second client semi-annual reporting period of\na calendar year (July 1st - December 31st), the Client Filer uses the following\nto determine whether any Contribution(s) received from a Source shall be\ndisclosed in the Client Semi-Annual Report covering the second reporting period\nof the calendar year: (1)\nif during the\nprevious reporting period (January 1st - June 30th), the Client Filer did not\nmeet the Expenditure Threshold, then no Contribution(s) received from any\n\nSource during that first reporting period are to be added to Contribution(s)\nreceived from any Source during the second reporting period. (2)\nif during the previous reporting period\n(January 1st - June 30th), the Client Filer did not receive any Contribution(s)\nfrom the Source, a Client Filer shall add all Contributions, regardless of the\namount, received from the Source during the second reporting period of the\ncalendar year. If the sum of such Contributions is more than $2,500, then a\n\nClient Filer is required to disclose the information in subdivision (e) of this\nsection for each Contribution. If the sum of the Contributions received from a Source is\n$2,500 or less, then a Client Filer is not required to disclose any\n\nContribution(s) from the Source in the Client Semi-Annual Report that covers\nthe second reporting period of the calendar year; (3)\nif during the previous reporting period\n(January 1st - June 30th), the Client Filer met the Expenditure Threshold and\nreceived Contributions(s) from a Source in excess of $2,500, then the Client\n\nFiler shall disclose all Contributions, regardless of the amount, received from\nthe Source during the second client semi-annual reporting period of the\ncalendar year; (4)\nif during the\nprevious reporting period (January 1st - June 30th), the Client Filer met the\n\nExpenditure Threshold and received Contributions(s) from a Source in an amount\ntotaling $2,500 or less, then the Client Filer shall add all Contributions, regardless of the amount, received from a Source over the calendar year. If the\nsum of such Contributions is more than $2,500, then a Client Filer is required\nto disclose the information in subdivision (e) of this section for each\n\nContribution received during the calendar year. If the sum of the Contributions\nreceived from each Source is $2,500 or less, then a Client Filer is not\nrequired to disclose any Contribution(s) from the Source. Example 1: Jane Doe contributes $1,000 on May 4, 2017 to\n\nClient Filer. Source Jim Smith, contributes $2,000 on October 30, 2017. Client\n\nFiler knows that Jane and Jim live in the same household. For the purpose of filing the Client Semi-Annual Report due\non July 16, 2017 (covering the period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017), Client Filer is not required to report the Contribution from Jane Doe. For the purpose of filing the Client Semi-Annual Report due\non January 15, 2018 (covering the period July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017), if the Client Filer met the Expenditure Threshold during both reporting\nperiods, the Client Filer must aggregate the Contributions from Jane Doe and\n\nJim Smith as one Source because they have an Affiliate Relationship. The two\n\nContributions exceed $2,500 when aggregated, therefore the Client Filer must\ndisclose each Contribution in the Client Semi-Annual Report due on January 15, 2018. Example 2: XYZ Corp. contributes $1,500 on March 3, 2017. ABC\nCorp is XYZ Corp's parent and contributes $1,500 on May 6, 2017. On November\n12, 2017, ABC Corp contributes an additional $500. On December 2, 2017, XYZ\nCorp. contributes an additional $1,500. The Client Filer is aware of the\ncorporate relationship between ABC Corp and XYZ Corp. For the purpose of filing the Client Semi-Annual Report due\non July 15, 2017 (covering the period January 1, 2017 through June 30, 2017), XYZ Corp and ABC Corp have an Affiliate Relationship and therefore are deemed a\n\nSource. The Contributions from XYZ Corp and ABC Corp must be aggregated. The\nsum of the Contributions received from the one Source consisting of ABC Corp\nand XYZ Corp between January 1, 2017 and June 30, 2017 exceeds $2,500. Therefore, if the Client Filer met the Expenditure Threshold for this period, it must disclose both the Contributions received on March 3 and May 6 in Client\n\nSemi-Annual Report due on July 15, 2017. For the purpose of filing the Client Semi-Annual Report due\non January 15, 2018 (covering the period July 1, 2017 through December 31, 2017), if the Client Filer met the Expenditure Threshold for this second\nperiod, the Client Filer must disclose the November 12 and December 2\n\nContributions even though these two Contributions are less than $2,500\nindividually and in total. The requirement to disclose the November 12 and December 2\n\nContributions arises from the facts that (i) the Source (comprised of XYZ Corp\nand ABC Corp, because they have an Affiliate Relationship) made aggregate\n\nContributions in excess of $2,500 during the prior reporting period in the same\ncalendar year and (ii) the Client Filer met the Expenditure Threshold during\nboth reporting periods in the calendar year. Therefore, the Client Filer must\nlist as one Source each of those two Contributions made by XYZ Corp and ABC\nCorp in the second reporting period of the calendar year on the Client\n\nSemiAnnual Report, together with the information required in 938.3(e). If the Client Filer did not meet the Expenditure Threshold\nduring the second reporting period of the calendar year, then the Client Filer\nis not required to disclose the November 12 and December 2\n\nContributions. (e) Each Contribution required to be\ndisclosed in any Client Semi-Annual Report on the form provided by the\n\nCommission shall contain the information identified below: (1)\n\nInformation Required to be Disclosed: (i) The name of the Source; (a) A disclosure that identifies an\nintermediary or any other entity that obscures the name of the person, corporation, partnership, organization, or entity actually making the\n\nContribution, does not qualify as the Source; and\n(b) The name of a Source cannot be reported\nas \"anonymous\" unless the Client Filer affirms to the Commission that the\n\nClient Filer is not able to determine the identity of the Source. (ii)\n\nName and address of principal\nplace of business, if any; (iii)\n\nDate the Client Filer received the Contribution(s); and\n(iv)\n\nReportable Amount of the\n\nContribution(s). Note: If a contribution includes only membership dues, fees, or assessments, the Client Filer should disclose the contribution as $0. If\nmembership dues, fees, or assessments make up a portion of a contribution, the\n\nReportable Amount of the Contribution is calculated as described in section\n938.2\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWhen a Source is\ncomprised of more than one person, corporation, partnership, organization, or\nentity with an Affiliate Relationship, the required information must be\nsupplied for each such person, corporation, partnership, organization, or\nentity. (3)\n\nWhen a corporation, partnership, organization, or entity is a Source whose Contribution is required\nto be disclosed, and meets any one of the requirements in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision, the Client Filer must disclose, in addition to the information in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the following: (i) name, address and principal place of\nbusiness of at least one natural person (such as an officer, director, partner\nor proprietors) who shares or exercises discretion or control over the\nactivities of the corporation, partnership, organization, or entity; or\n(ii)\nthe sources of the funds\ncontributed by the corporation, partnership, organization, or entity to the\n\nClient Filer. (4)\n\nConditions for Additional Required Disclosure\n(i) The Client Filer makes decisions or\nestablishes policy for the corporation, partnership, organization, or\nentity; (ii)\n\nThe corporation, partnership, organization, or entity makes decisions or establishes policy for\nthe Client Filer; (iii)\n\nThe Client\n\nFiler has the authority to hire, appoint, discipline, discharge, demote, remove, or otherwise influence other persons who make decisions or establish\npolicies for the corporation, partnership, organization, or entity; (iv)\n\nThe corporation, partnership, organization, or entity has the authority to hire, appoint, discipline, discharge, demote, remove, or otherwise influence other persons who make\ndecisions or establish policies for the Client Filer; or\n(v) The Client Filer and the corporation, partnership, organization, or entity, share a majority of directors on their\ngoverning boards, or share a majority of executive management, or maintain bank\naccounts with shared signatories. (f) Notwithstanding subsections\n938.2\n(b)(1)\nand\n943.9\n(h)(1) and\n(3)\nof this Title, a Coalition that files its\nown Client Semi-Annual Report pursuant to subsection\n943.9\n(h)(3)(ii)\nshall nevertheless be required to disclose its own Sources pursuant to this\nsection if the Coalition reaches the Expenditure Threshold. (g) Pursuant to sections 1-h(c)(4) and\n1-j(c)(4) of the Lobbying Act, source of funding disclosure shall not apply to\nany corporation registered pursuant to article seven-A of the executive law\nthat is qualified as an exempt organization by the United States Department of\nthe Treasury under I.R.C. § 501(c)(3) (a \"501(c)(3)\"); provided, however, that this disclosure shall apply to any in-kind donations of staff, staff time, personnel, offices, office supplies, financial support of any kind or any other\nresources to any corporation or entity that is qualified as an exempt\norganization by the United States Department of the Treasury under I.R.C. 501(c)(4) when such in-kind donations are over two thousand five hundred\ndollars and from any corporation or entity that is qualified as a 501(c)(3).
