Tit. 10 §§ 713-3.22 - Construction, including fire-resistive requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every building and every portion thereof\nshall be designed and constructed to sustain all dead and live loads in\naccordance with accepted engineering practices and standards, including seismic\nforces where they apply. (b) Foundations shall rest on natural solid bearing if a satisfactory bearing is\navailable at reasonable depths. Proper soil-bearing values shall be established\nin accordance with recognized standards. If solid bearing is not encountered at\npractical depths, the structure shall be supported on driven piles or drilled\npiers designed to support the intended load without detrimental settlement, except that one-story buildings may rest on a fill designed by a soils\nengineer. When engineered fill is used, site preparation and placement of fill\nshall be done under the direct full-time supervision of the soils engineer. The\nsoils engineer shall issue a final report on the compacted fill operation and\ncertification of compliance with the job specifications. All footings shall\nextend to a depth not less than one foot below the estimated maximum frost\nline. (c) An emergency radio\ncommunication system shall be provided in each facility. This system shall be\nself-sufficient in time of emergency and capable of operation without reliance\non the building service or emergency electric power supply. It shall also be\nlinked with the available community or State emergency communication network, including connections with police and fire department or system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
