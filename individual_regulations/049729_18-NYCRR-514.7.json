  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 514.7 - Clearing of orders for care, services or supplies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department may direct a provider who\nfurnishes ordered MA care, services or supplies to obtain authorization to\nfurnish such care, services or supplies through inquiry to EMEVS (\"clearing\"). A provider may be directed to clear prescriptions or fiscal orders is the\ndepartment determines that the clearing provider's claims or orders for MA\ncare, services or supplies satisfy one or more of the criteria set forth in\nsection\n514.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart, or the clearing provider is furnishing care, services or supplies ordered\nby a provider required to post, or patterns or volumes of MA transactions by\nordering or furnishing providers within a specified geographic area or within a\nspecific provider type warrant the imposition of this additional control to\nassure the validity of prescriptions or fiscal orders. (b) When a provider who furnishes ordered\ncare, services or supplies ordered by a provider required to post orders for\ncare, services or supplies clears a prescription or fiscal order, EMEVS will\nrespond with a message indicating whether the payment of claims for care, services or supplies will be made. (c) If a provider who is directed by the\ndepartment to clear prescriptions or fiscal orders fails to clear a\nprescription or fiscal order which is required to be posted to EMEVS and which\neither has not been posted or has been posted and already filled, the\ndepartment will deny payment for the ordered care, services or supplies. If the\ndepartment finds a significant number of unjustified failures by the provider\nto clear orders, the department may treat such provider failures as an\nunacceptable practice under Part 515 of this Title.
