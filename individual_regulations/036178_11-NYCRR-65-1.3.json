However, where the person has been convicted of violating section 1192 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic Law while operating a motor vehicle in an intoxicated condition or while his or her ability to operate such vehicle is impaired by the use of a drug, and the conviction is a final determination, the company has a cause of action against such person for the amount of first party benefits that are paid or payable; 17\nor\n(h) any person while: (i) committing an act which would constitute a felony, or seeking to avoid lawful apprehension or arrest by a law enforcement officer; 16\n(ii)\noperating a motor vehicle in a race or speed test; 16\n(iii)\noperating or occupying a motor vehicle known to that person to be stolen; or\n16\n(iv)\nrepairing, servicing, or otherwise maintaining a motor vehicle if such conduct is within the course of a business of repairing, servicing or otherwise maintaining a motor vehicle and the injury occurs on the business premises; 16\n(i) any person who is injured while, pursuant to article 44-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, the insured motor vehicle is being used or operated by a transportation network company driver; 18\nor\n(j) any person who is injured while the insured motor vehicle is being used or operated by a shared vehicle driver pursuant to article 40 of the General Business Law. 19\n\nAdditional First-Party Benefits\n\nAdditional first-party benefits are payments equal to extended economic loss reduced by: (a) 20 percent of the eligible injured person's loss of earnings from work, to the extent that the extended economic loss covered by this (Endorsement)\n19\nincludes such loss of earnings; (b) amounts recovered or recoverable on account of personal injury to an eligible injured person under State or Federal laws providing social security disability or workers' compensation benefits or disability benefits under article 9 of the New York Workers' Compensation law, which amounts have not been applied to reduce first-party benefits recovered or recoverable under basic economic loss; (c) amounts recovered or recoverable by the eligible injured person for any element of extended economic loss covered by this (Endorsement)\n19\nunder any mandatory source of first-party automobile no-fault benefits required by the laws of any state (other than the State of New York) of the United States of America, its possessions or territories, or by the laws of any province of Canada. Extended Economic Loss\n\nExtended economic loss shall consist of the following: (a) basic economic loss sustained on account of an accident occurring within the United States of America, its possessions or territories, or Canada, which is not recovered or recoverable under a policy issued in satisfaction of the requirements of article 6 or 8 of the New York Vehicle and Traffic law and article 51 of the New York Insurance Law; (b) the difference between\n(i) basic economic loss; and\n(ii)\nbasic economic loss recomputed in accordance with the time and dollar limits; 19\nand\n(c) an additional death benefit in the amount set out in the declarations)\n20\n\nTwo or More Motor Vehicles Insured Under This Policy\n\nThe limit of liability under this (Endorsement)\n19\napplicable to injuries sustained by an eligible injured person while occupying, or while a pedestrian through being struck by, the insured motor vehicle shall be as stated (in the declarations)\n19\nfor that insured motor vehicle.

Arbitration\n\nIn the event any person making a claim for additional first-party benefits and the Company do not agree regarding any matter relating to the claim, such person shall have the option of submitting such disagreement to arbitration pursuant to procedures promulgated or approved by the Superintendent of Financial Services. Subrogation\n\nIn the event of any payment for extended economic loss, the Company is subrogated to the extent of such payments to the rights of the person to whom, or for whose benefit, such payments were made. Such person must execute and deliver instruments and papers and do whatever else is necessary to secure such rights. Such person shall do nothing to prejudice such rights. Other Coverage; Nonduplication\n\nThe eligible injured person shall not recover duplicate benefits for the same elements of loss covered by this (Endorsement)\n22\nor any other optional first-party automobile or no-fault automobile insurance coverage. If an eligible injured person is entitled to New York mandatory and additional personal injury protection benefits under any other policy, and if such eligible injured person is not entitled to New York mandatory personal injury protection benefits under this policy, then the coverage provided under this Additional Personal Injury Protection Endorsement (New York) shall be excess over such other New York mandatory and additional personal injury protection benefits. When coverage provided under this (Endorsement)\n22\napplies on an excess basis, it shall apply only in the amount by which the total limit of liability of New York mandatory and additional personal injury protection coverage available under this policy exceeds the total limit of liability for any other applicable New York mandatory and additional personal injury protection coverage\n\nSubject to the provisions of the preceding three paragraphs, if the eligible injured person is entitled to benefits under any other optional first-party automobile or no-fault automobile insurance for the same elements of loss covered by this (Endorsement)\n22\nthis Company shall be liable only for an amount equal to the proportion that the total amount available under this\n22\nbears to the sum of the amounts available under this (Endorsement)\n23\nand such other optional insurance, for the same element of loss. _______\n14\n\nCompanies may substitute the appropriate term, reference or language for the matter set out in parenthesis. 15\n\nIf the policy is being used to satisfy the financial responsibility requirements of article 44-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, then the Company may substitute the following language: The company will pay first-party benefits to reimburse for basic economic loss sustained by an eligible injured person on account of personal injuries caused by an accident arising out of the use or operation of a motor vehicle, pursuant to article 44-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law, by a transportation network company driver during the policy period and within the United States of America, its territories or possessions, or Canada.
