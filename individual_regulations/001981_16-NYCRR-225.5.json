  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 225.5 - Special provision for residential customers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For the purposes of this\nsection, and when used in section\n225.6\nof this Part, the following\ndefinitions shall apply: (1)\n\nExisting\nresidential customer is a customer who receives gas service to a dwelling unit\nwhich such customer uses for his residential purposes and where business rates\ndo not apply to the service. An existing residential customer includes an\napplicant for gas service who has transferred dwelling units within a utility's\nservice territory and for whom there is a recent payment history. (2)\n\nNew residential customer is an applicant\nfor gas service to a dwelling unit which such customer uses for his residential\npurposes and where business rates do not apply to the service, and who does not\nqualify as an existing residential customer. (3)\n\nDelinquent in payment means, unless a\nmore liberal standard is adopted by the utility, that a residential customer\nhas not paid in full a duly rendered bill, or an agreed-upon partial payment, for gas service 25 days after the \"to date\" of the bill or within a longer\nperiod agreed to by the utility. A residential customer who has not paid in\nfull a bill, or an agreed-upon partial payment, for gas service in\ncircumstances where disconnection for nonpayment is precluded under utility\ncomplaint procedures established under section\n275.8\nof this Title or commission\ncomplaint procedures under Part 11 of this Title, shall not be considered\ndelinquent in payment; (4)\n\nPayment\nshall be considered accomplished on the date when the full amount of the bill\nor an agreed-upon partial payment is received by the gas corporation or gas and\nelectric corporation or by any of such corporation's agents; provided, however, that if payment is mailed to such corporation or its agents, payment shall be\nconsidered accomplished as of the mailing by the consumer. (b) Credit risk standards. (1)\n\nAn existing residential customer may not\nbe considered a bad credit risk unless such customer has been delinquent in\npayment two or more times within a recent 12-month period, or unless such\ncustomer's gas service has been discontinued for nonpayment during the\npreceding 12 months. (2)\nA new\nresidential customer may not be considered non-credit-rated unless such\ncustomer is unable to provide, to the satisfaction of the utility, affirmative\nanswers to three or more of the six questions contained in Appendix 15-B of\nthis Title. Each gas corporation and gas and electric corporation shall adopt\nprocedures which provide for use of the six questions appearing in Appendix\n15-B of this Title. A gas corporation or gas and electric corporation may\ndetermine whether to require a deposit from a new residential customer in\naccordance with the credit risk standards provided in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision if sufficient information is available from a New York utility\nrendering comparable service to determine whether such customer is a bad credit\nrisk as defined in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. If a new residential\ncustomer can establish prior satisfactory credit history with a utility\nrendering gas service at the customer's most recent address, the gas\ncorporation may not obtain a security deposit from such new residential\ncustomer. (c) Residential customer deposits. No gas corporation or gas and electric\ncorporation may require a deposit from a residential customer unless such\ncorporation shall establish that the residential customer is a bad credit risk\nor non-credit-rated in accordance with the definitions and standards prescribed\nin this section. (d) No gas\ncorporation or gas and electric corporation may require a deposit from a\nresidential customer in excess of two times the estimated average monthly bill\nfor a calendar year, except in the case of electric or gas space heating\ncustomers where deposits may not exceed two times the estimated average monthly\nbill for the heating season.
