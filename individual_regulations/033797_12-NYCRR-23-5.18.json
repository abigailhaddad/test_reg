Scaffold platforms for manually-propelled mobile scaffolds\nshall be tightly planked for the full width of the scaffolds except for\nnecessary access openings. Such planking shall consist of planks not less than\ntwo inches thick full size, exterior grade plywood at least three-quarters inch\nthick or material of equivalent strength. (b) Safety railings required. The platform of\nevery manually-propelled mobile scaffold shall be provided with a safety\nrailing constructed and installed in compliance with this Part\n(rule). (c) Platform access. A\nladder or stairway shall be provided for proper access to every\nmanually-propelled mobile scaffold. Such ladder or stairway shall be affixed to\nor built into the scaffold and so located that when in use it will not have a\ntendency to tip the scaffold. Landing platforms shall be provided at intervals\nnot to exceed 35 feet. (d) Scaffold\nheight. For any free-standing manually-propelled mobile scaffold the ratio of\nthe platform height above the ground, grade, floor or equivalent surface to the\nminimum base dimension shall assure scaffold stability when in use, but in no\ncase shall such height be more than four times the minimum base\ndimension. (e) Casters. Casters\nshall be properly designed for strength and dimensions to support four times\nthe maximum load intended to be imposed thereon. All casters shall be provided\nwith positive locking devices to hold the scaffolds in position. (f) Scaffold bracing. Manually-propelled\nmobile scaffolds shall be properly braced by cross-bracing or diagonal-bracing, or both, to secure vertical members together laterally. Cross-braces shall be\nof such length as will automatically square and align vertical members so that\nthe erected scaffold is always plumb, square and rigid. All brace connections\nshall be made secure. (g) Scaffold\nfooting. Whenever any such scaffold is in use and is occupied by any person, such scaffold shall rest upon a stable footing, the platform shall be level and\nthe scaffold shall stand plumb. All casters or wheels shall be locked in\nposition. (h) Moving the scaffold. Provisions shall be made to prevent such scaffolds from tipping or falling\nduring their movement from one location to another. Scaffolds shall be moved\nonly on level floors or equivalent surfaces free from obstructions and\nopenings. No person shall be suffered or permitted to ride on any\nmanually-propelled mobile scaffold while it is being moved. (i) Bridging prohibited. Bridging between two\nor more manually-propelled mobile scaffolds or between any such scaffold and\nother supports is prohibited. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n23-5.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
