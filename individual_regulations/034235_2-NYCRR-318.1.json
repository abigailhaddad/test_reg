  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 318.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n\nSections\n60\n(f), 60-a, 60-b, 360\n(g), 360-a, 360-a, 441\n(c), 446\n(c)(i), 448\n(e), 508\n(e), 513\n(b)(i), 606\n(e) and\n609\n(b) of the Retirement and Social Security Law\nrelating to eligibility for retirement and death benefits contain or refer to\nthe terms \"continuous service\" or \"during which employment\". The strict\nrequirement of continuous service or during which employment can have very\ninequitable consequences, as the result of which members of the retirement\nsystems can lose eligibility for retirement or death benefits. Sections 11 and\n311 of the New York State and Local Employees' Retirement System and the New\n\nYork State and Local Police and Fire Retirement System, respectively, permit\nthe State Comptroller to adopt and amend rules and regulations for the\nadministration of such retirement systems. Furthermore, the provisions of\nsections\n446\n(e) and\n513\n(d) of the Retirement and Social Security Law\npermit the State Comptroller to adopt rules and regulations, interpreting the\nprovisions of sections 446 and 513 which are consistent with the intent\nthereof, subject to approval by the Permanent Commission on Public Employee\n\nPension and Retirement Systems. As appears more particularly from the appended\nletters dated May 19, 1975, May 21, 1975, May 18, 1978, May 25, 1978 and\n\nDecember 19, 1991 (see Appendices 15, 15- A, 15-B, 15-C and 15-D infra), such\napproval has been issued, and this Part is hereby promulgated. Effective April\n1, 1992, such pension commission is no longer in existence. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n318.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
