Employees that experience a qualifying event while\nthey are already out of work on another leave must be cleared to return to work\nfrom such leave of absence in order to be eligible for PPL. The timeframes for\ncommencing PPL and for filing an application, as set forth in subsection\n24.6\n(m)(2)\nof\nthis Part, still apply. (4)\n\nContinuing benefits while on paid leave.
