  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 686.8 - Program for supportive community residences\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Principles of compliance. (1)\n\nEach person in a supportive community\nresidence shall have sufficient oversight and guidance to ensure that his or\nher health, safety and welfare are addressed. The amount and type of oversight\nand guidance provided shall be directly related to systematic formal assessment\nand ongoing review of all persons' need for such supervision. A person\nrequiring long-term residential oversight and guidance in excess of an average\n21 hours per week is considered inappropriate for placement in a supportive\ncommunity residence. (2)\n\nThe\nprovision of needed oversight and guidance for each person may range from daily\nface-to-face contact and supportive assistance to the minimum of a\nonce-per-week site visitation with the person present, except that an\nindividual on transitional status (see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) is to be seen\nat least once a month at the site. Other face-to-face contact and/or phone\ncontacts shall be provided in accordance with each person's need for\noversight. (3)\n\nThe agency is\nresponsible for identifying the degree of risk at each site surrounding the\nperson's use of prescription and nonprescription medications and is responsible\nfor ensuring that such risks do not inordinately affect the health, safety and\nwelfare of any of the people. (4)\n\nThe agency/facility shall develop policies/procedures governing referral, intake and admission. (5)\n\nThese\npolicies and procedures shall specifically address how the agency/facility will\nassess and meet the applicant's need for supervision in the supportive\ncommunity residence, and shall include criteria justifying admission as listed\nin paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (6)\n\nAdmission to a supportive community\nresidence shall be based primarily on the applicant having a diagnosis of\ndevelopmental disability and that his/her needs for supervision can be\nadequately addressed in the setting. (7)\n\nThere shall be discharge criteria which: (i) describe the level of independent\nfunctioning that would appropriately permit a person to live independently; and\nidentify those activities and experiences which would promote such increased\nindependence; (ii)\ndescribe\npotential problem circumstances or degenerating person functioning level which\nmight result in discharge to a more restrictive program; and\n(iii)\npreclude discharge except to a setting\nwhich can more appropriately meet the person's needs and such a setting is\nactually available at the time of projected discharge. (8)\n\nThose responsible for the program\nplanning shall meet within 30 days of a person's admission to the supportive\ncommunity residence to review the person's adjustment to the placement, the\nadequacy of the implemented oversight and visitation schedule and the\nsufficiency of any in-house guidance and training activities. (9)\n\nThe agency, in accordance with its\npolicies, may allow for occupancy by persons designated as being on\nnon-resident status (see glossary, section\n686.99\nof this Part) or by\nindividuals of the supportive community residence who have been designated as\nbeing on transitional status. Such occupancy shall be in the best interest of\nthe individual on transitional status and any other individuals residing at the\nsite. OPWDD shall be notified at least 45 days prior to an individual's\ndesignation as being on transitional status. In addition, such occupancy shall\nbe in accordance with the limitations described in paragraph (11) of this\nsubdivision. (10)\n\nPersons on\ntransitional status may remain at the supportive community residence if they\nmeet the following criteria: (i) they have\nacquired the skills necessary for independent living; (ii)\nthe residency continues only to the\nextent necessary to complete alternative living arrangements; but\n(iii)\nthe residency cannot continue for\nlonger than two years. (11)\n\nIf an agency provides the option of\npermitting a person on transitional status or non-resident status to reside in\nthe supportive community residence, the following shall apply: (i) persons on transitional status shall\noccupy a certified bed; (ii)\npersons on non-resident status shall not occupy a certified bed. When it is\nnecessary to use a certified bed for a person on non-resident status, the\nagency shall notify OPWDD and the certified capacity of the site shall be\nchanged appropriately. (iii)\nthe\nagency shall charge and collect from individuals on transitional status and\nnon-residents their financial share of the occupancy, as determined by the\nagency, and shall appropriately report the receipt of this money to OPWDD in\nthe form and format required by the commissioner. (iv)\nwhen an individual on transitional\nstatus permanently leaves the certified site, the space shall only be filled by\na person who meets the admission standards; (v) when more than half of the persons\nresiding in a supportive community residence are on transitional or\nnon-resident status, one of the following options shall be followed: (a) the individuals remain at the certified\nsupportive community residence and persons on transitional or non-resident\nstatus are moved to alternative living arrangements; or\n(b) the individuals are moved to another\ncertified supportive community residence, and the site is converted from a\ncertified supportive community residence to an independent living\narrangement; (vi)\nthe\nabove provisions of this paragraph may be modified or waived by the\ncommissioner upon notice and satisfactory explanation justifying why adherence\nto the requirements would be detrimental to the individuals living in the\nsupportive community residence. (12)\n\nThe policy and procedure manual, as\nrequired in section\n686.6\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Part shall also incorporate: (i) the\nrequirement that a trained person shall be available to make visitations to a\nperson in a supportive community residence in the absence of the assigned case\nmanager; (ii)\nthe requirement that\na person shall be informed of the persons to call in the event of an emergency\nor other unusual or unsettling circumstances; (iii)\nthe requirement that all occupants of a\nsupportive community residence shall be trained to evacuate the facility in\nemergency situations; and\n(iv)\nany\nother necessary information specific to the operation of a supportive community\nresidence. (13)\n\nOnly an\nincorporated entity shall hold the lease to the physical plant of a supportive\ncommunity residence. Where programmatically appropriate, the incorporated\nentity may sublease the certified site to the individual(s). However, if the\nproperty to be leased is subject to the requirements of the New Construction\n\nRegulation issued by the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, then the individual(s) shall be the holder of the lease. (b) Standards of certification. (1)\nOPWDD shall verify for each individual\n(other than those 17 years of age or under) newly admitted since the last\nsurvey, that such person(s); prior to admission: (i) had reached at least his or her 18th\nbirthday; (a) persons who are under 18 years\nof age, with a developmental disability, and who are the offspring or legal\nwards of individuals who are appropriately admitted, may also be admitted as\npart of the family unit without meeting the supportive community residence\nadmission criteria specified below; and\n(b) agencies/facilities operating programs\nwhere those as identified in clause (\na\n) of this subparagraph\nare admitted, shall make provisions to meet their health, safety and welfare\nneeds; (ii)\nhad the\ncapability to self-administer medication, or adequate provisions have been made\nto ensure adherence to his/her medication regimen; (iii)\nhad the ability to evacuate the\npremises without staff assistance in the event of a fire emergency, or take\nother appropriate action in such emergency; (iv)\nhad not evidenced instances of a severe\nbehavior problem within the year previous to admission which threatened the\nlife or limb of themselves or others; (v) had not manifested a chronic health care\nor self care need which could not be addressed independently by the applicant\nor by limited oversight and guidance; (vi)\nhad the ability to use a telephone or\nother communications device to obtain assistance; and\n(vii)\nhad no need for more face-to-face\noversight and guidance than can be accomplished within a schedule approximating\nan average of 21 hours per week. This shall not be taken to preclude the\nprovision of intermittent additional supervision necessary to assist a given\nindividual in such situations as placement adjustment, illness recovery, or\ncrisis resolution. (2)\n\nThere is documentation of a formalized assessment of each person's needs for\noversight or guidance. (3)\n\nIf any\nchanges have been made as to the type and/or amount of oversight or guidance of\na person by those having oversight responsibilities for the person, there is\ndocumentation in the plan of services that the appropriateness of the change\nprovided has been reviewed within 30 days of the change by the party designated\nto coordinate the person's plan of services. (4)\n\nThe person's plan of services includes a\nwritten assessment, at least annually, of the person's ability to utilize\nprescription and nonprescription medications. If any person is unable to\nindependently utilize medication, there is a written plan to ensure adherence\nto the medication regimen. (5)\n\nThere shall be identification of a person as being on transitional status, if\nsuch a determination has been made. (6)\nOPWDD shall verify the receipt of any\nspecial services obtained in the community. (7)\n\nThere is a schedule of\noversight/visitation by the party designated responsible. (8)\nOPWDD shall verify that scheduled\noversight and guidance visitations by the designated party or substitute are\nbeing made as scheduled. (9)\n\nThe\nphone numbers of staff on call are posted near the phone at the person's place\nof residence. (10)\nOPWDD shall\nverify that each person knows where the phone numbers of the staff on call are\nlocated. (11)\n\nIf a person is\ndesignated as being on transitional status, OPWDD shall verify that it was\nnotified at least 45 days prior to the change on the forms and format approved\nby the commissioner. (12)\n\nIf a\nperson is designated as being on transitional status, there is documentation\nthat he or she has not been on that status for more than two years. (13)\n\nIf a person is designated as being on\ntransitional status, or a non-resident is in a residence, OPWDD shall verify\nthat the agency determined a charge for that party's share of the occupancy, did charge and collect or made reasonable effort to collect such money from\nsaid parties and appropriately reported the receipt of this money to OPWDD in\nthe form and format required by the commissioner, unless there is documentation\nthat any or all of these requirements have been modified or waived by the\ncommissioner. (14)\n\nIf the site is\nsubject to the requirements of the new construction regulation issued by the\n\nFederal Department of Housing and Urban Development, there is a documentation\nthat the person(s) is/are the leaseholder(s).
