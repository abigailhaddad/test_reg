  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.47 - Bonus games\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Bonus game\nrequirements. Games that have awards calculated that occur from game play\nwithin the base game's cycle (e.g., bonus features, including free games) shall\nmeet the following: (1)\nthe game shall\ndisplay clearly to the player which game rules apply to the current game state. Such rules shall be made available to the player prior to the start of the\nbonus game (rather than during the bonus game); (2)\nthe game shall clearly display to the\nplayer the possible win-amount ranges, multiplier ranges and so on that can be\nobtained from bonus play; (3)\na\ngame that offers a bonus game, other than those that occur randomly, shall\ndisplay to the player sufficient information to indicate the current status\ntowards the triggering of the next bonus game; (4)\nif the game requires obtaining several\nevents or symbols toward a feature, the number of events or symbols needed to\ntrigger the bonus shall be indicated along with the number of events or symbols\ncollected to any point; (5)\nthe\ngame shall not adjust the likelihood of a bonus occurring based on the history\nof prizes obtained in previous games (i.e., games shall not adapt their\ntheoretical return to the player based on past payouts); (6)\nif a game's bonus is triggered after\naccruing a certain number of events or symbols or combination of events or\nsymbols of a different kind over multiple games, the probability of obtaining\nlike events or symbols shall not deteriorate as the game progresses (e.g., for\nidentical events or symbols it is not permitted that the last few events or\nsymbols needed are more difficult to obtain than the previous events or symbols\nof that kind); (7)\nthe game shall\nmake it clear to the player that the player is in a bonus mode, in order to\nminimize the possibility of the player walking away from the gaming device not\nknowing that the game is in a bonus mode; (8)\nbonus game awards are part of the game\ncycle with predetermined award values. Bonus play award contributions to the\nprogram payout percentage are calculated consistent with awards of the regular\ngame cycle. Specifically, if the cycle for bonus play awards is different from\nthe base game cycle, then the bonus play awards, occurring within the base\ngame's cycle, shall be calculated as part of the game's payout; and\n(9)\nthe game shall display the rules of play\nfor the bonus game awards, the rewards associated with each bonus play award\nand the character combinations that will result in the specific payouts. For\nbonus play awards achieved by obtaining specific game results, the progress of\nthe award shall be displayed. (b) Player selection or interaction in bonus\ngames. A gaming devices that offers a bonus game or extended feature that\nrequires player selection or interaction is prohibited from automatically\nmaking selections or initiating games or features unless such gaming device\nmeets the requirements set forth in paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\nsubdivision and explains the mechanism for auto-initiation or selection on the\ndevice glass or video display. (1)\nA player\nshall be presented with a choice and shall acknowledge specifically an intent\nto have the gaming device auto-initiate the bonus or extended play feature by\nmeans of a button press or other physical or machine interaction. (2)\n\nThe bonus or extended feature shall\nprovide only one choice to the player (i.e., press button to spin wheel). In\nsuch a case, the device may auto-initiate the bonus or extended feature after a\ntime-out period of at least two minutes. (3)\n\nThe bonus or extended feature shall be\noffered as part of community play that involves two or more patrons and where\nthe delay of an offered selection or game initiation will impact directly the\nability for other players to continue their bonus or extended features. Prior\nto making selections automatically or initiating a community-based bonus or\nfeature, a player shall be made aware of the time remaining in which the player\nshall make a selection or initiate play.
