  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 446.3 - Reclassification for cost finding purposes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reclassifications for Medicaid cost\nfinding purposes. (1)\n\nIn many instances the\nreclassifications made to conform to the principles of functional reporting\n(see section\n446.2\nof this Part) are not\nconducive to the proper allocation of cost during the cost finding process. For\nexample, nonroutine maintenance must be assigned to the Plant Maintenance\n(account 8400) cost center to accomplish the functional reporting of expense. The basis to be used for cost finding is Net Square Feet. If the cost of\nnonroutine maintenance is allocated on the basis of Net Square Feet, the\nresulting distribution of this expense would include cost centers for which no\nnonroutine maintenance was performed. A better allocation of the cost of\nnonroutine maintenance would be accomplished by reclassifying this cost out of\nthe functional cost center to the cost centers for which nonroutine maintenance\nwas performed, prior to utilizing Net Square Feet to allocate the remaining\ncost to the other appropriate functional cost centers. (2)\n\nTherefore, reclassifications of the\ndirect expenses of functional cost centers may be made to other functional cost\ncenters for cost finding purposes when that direct expense is obtainable. Estimates, time studies, sampling or other means may not be used as a basis for\nreclassification. The required Cost Allocation statistics must be used to\nallocate costs remaining in the functional cost centers after reclassifications\nare made. (b) Reclassifications for Medicare cost finding purposes. (1)\n\nOther Health Profession Education\n(account 8260). This expense account consists of the direct costs of organized\neducational programs such as school of medical technology, school of X-ray\ntechnology, administrative intern program, etc. The total direct expenses\nincluded in Other Health Profession Education must be reclassified to the costs\ncenters directly affected by the educational programs; for example, the cost of\nthe school of X-ray technology must be reclassified to the appropriate\nradiology cost centers. (2)\n\nMedical\n\nCare Review (account 8740). This expense account consists of the costs incurred\nin providing peer review, quality assurance, utilization review, professional\nstandards review, and medical care evaluation functions. Only utilization\nreview costs of the hospital-based skilled nursing facility should be\nreclassified as follows: If the scope of the review covers all patients, all\nallowable costs should be reclassified in this column to Other Administrative\nand General. If the scope of the review covers only Medicare patients or\n\nMedicare title V and title XIX patients, reclassify to Other Administrative and\n\nGeneral all allowable costs other than physicians' compensation. The reasonable\ncompensation paid to the physicians for their services on utilization review\ncommittee is to be allocated 100 percent to the health care programs. The\nreasonable compensation paid to the physicians will be adjusted out by the\n\nWorksheet--Adjustment Prior to Cost Finding, and will be included on the\n\nWorksheet--Computation of Net Cost of Covered Services. (3)\n\nInsurance--Hospital and Professional\n\nMalpractice (account 8840). This expense account consists of the direct costs\nincurred by the provider for hospital and professional malpractice insurance. This provides for reclassifying the general and administrative expense directly\nrelated to malpractice losses. All allowable and nonallowable uninsured\nmalpractice losses and related expenses, either through deductible or\ncoinsurance provision, or as a result of an award in excess of reasonable\ncoverage limits, or as a governmental provider, must be reclassified to the\nmalpractice insurance account. (4)\n\nInsurance--Other (account 8850). This expense account consists of expenses\nincurred in maintaining insurance policies, except for professional and\nhospital malpractice insurance and employee benefit insurance. Insurance cost\napplicable to fixed assets and movable equipment must be reclassified to the\napplicable cost center. Any insurance expense which cannot be identified to a\nspecific cost center will be reclassified to Administrative and\n\nGeneral. (5)\n\nLicenses and Taxes\n(other than income taxes) (account 8860). This expense account consists of the\nbusiness license expense and tax expense incidental to the operation of the\nhospital. Licenses and taxes (other than income taxes) applicable to fixed\nassets and movable equipment must be reclassified to the applicable cost\ncenter. Any licenses and taxes which cannot be identified to a specific cost\ncenter and are related to the general overall operation of the hospital must be\nreclassified to the Administrative and General account. (6)\n\nInterest Short-Term (account 8870). This\nexpense account consists of interest expense related to borrowings for hospital\noperations. The full amount of cost must be reclassified to Administrative and\n\nGeneral. (7)\n\nInterest Long-Term\n(account 8880). This expense account consists of all interest incurred on\ncapital, mortgages and other loans for the acquisition of property, plant and\nequipment. Interest on Mortgage Loans will be reclassified to Depreciation, Amortization, Fixed Assets. Interest on Movable Equipment will be reclassified\nto Depreciation, Amortization, Movable Equipment.
