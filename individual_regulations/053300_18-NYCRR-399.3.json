Tit. 18 § 399.3 - Administrative food stamp fraud, pre-August 1, 1983\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Administrative food stamp fraud is fraud\nas defined in section\n399.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (b) Upon discovery that an\noverpayment in food stamps has occurred based upon the act or omission to act\nof a recipient or former recipient which occurred prior to August 1, 1983, in\nthe absence of the written authorization set forth in section\n399.2\n(b) of this\n\nPart, the local social services district shall initiate collection action by\nsending a written demand letter, approved by the department, to the household\ncharacterizing the act or acts as inadvertent household error. (c) The local district shall continue with\nits investigation of the act or acts to reach a determination as to whether or\nnot the act or acts constitute fraud within the meaning of section\n399.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart. (d) The local social services\ndistrict shall refer all cases in which it believes the facts of the individual\ncase warrant civil or criminal prosecution through the appropriate court system\nto the local district attorney (DA) (or other local equivalent) in the initial\ninstance and not to the department for an administrative food stamp fraud\nhearing. This subdivision shall not apply in instances in which the local\nsocial services district has received prior notification from the district\nattorney (or other local equivalent) that the amount of the overpayment\ndetermined by the district is less than the amount which the local official has\ndeemed sufficient for prosecution. The department shall not reverse a\ndetermination following an administrative food stamp fraud hearing for lack of\ncompliance with the provisions of this subdivision. (e) Should the district attorney (or other\nlocal equivalent) either decline prosecution following receipt of a referral\noccasioned by this section or fail to proceed with prosecution within a\nreasonable time, then the local social services district may formally withdraw\nthe referral in writing. (f) Subsequent to formal withdrawal the local services district may make an\nelection to proceed with an administrative food stamp fraud hearing pursuant to\nsection\n399.6\nof this Part. Should the\ndistrict elect not to do so, its collection of the claim will continue to\nproceed as an inadvertent household error pursuant to the provisions of\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (g) Should the local social services district\nelect to initiate procedures for an administrative food stamp fraud hearing\npursuant to section\n399.6\nof this Part, it must\nformally withdraw the referral in writing to the local official before\nreferring the case to the department. Failure to present evidence of such\nformal written withdrawal either in its evidentiary transmittal to the\ndepartment or at the hearing may result in an administrative food stamp fraud\nhearing decision adverse to the district. (h) Should the local social services district\nelect to process a case for an administrative food stamp fraud hearing, it\nshall assemble documentary evidence which the district believes is sufficient\non its face to support its determination of fraud and forward the evidence in\nthe form of an evidentiary packet to the Office of Administrative Hearings, New\n\nYork State Department of Social Services.
