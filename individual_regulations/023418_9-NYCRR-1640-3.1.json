  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-3.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll expenditures made by a local agency are subject to\naudit and review by the division before being admitted as charges to project\nrevenue or to funds (in the form of loans or subsidies) advanced or to be\nadvanced by the State. Expenditures not admitted are termed ineligible\nexpenditures. Before incurring expenditures, local agencies should\npredetermine, as far as possible, their eligibility as development costs or\noperation expenses, in order to avoid the necessity of making adjustments at a\nlater date. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1640-3.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
