(b) The point reduction program shall not\napply to any of the negative units listed in subdivision (a) of this\nsection. (c) For the purpose of\nthis Part, the time periods for the computation of safety factors shall\ncommence as of the date on which the incident occurred. (d) In any case where two or more safety\nfactors which are not independent of each other arise out of a single incident, only one of these safety factors shall be taken into consideration. The safety\nfactor which shall be taken into consideration in these cases shall be the\nsafety factor having the greater weight, except that where two safety factors\nare of equal weight, either one may be taken into consideration. Examples: (1)\n\nWhere an accident and a conviction for\nreckless driving arise out of the same incident, only the reckless driving\nconviction, which is the safety factor having the greater weight, is\nconsidered, because these safety factors are not independent of each\nother. (2)\n\nWhere a conviction of\nany subdivision of section\n1192\nof the Vehicle and Traffic Law and a finding of a chemical test refusal arise\nout of the same incident, only one of these two safety factors having equal\nweight is considered, because these safety factors are not independent of each\nother. (3)\n\nWhere a person is\nconvicted of reckless driving and the incident occurred during a period of\nlicense revocation, both of these safety factors shall be taken into\nconsideration because these safety factors are independent of each\nother. (4)\n\nWhere a person is\nconvicted of speeding and failure to keep right, where both violations occurred\nat the same time, both of these safety factors shall be taken into\nconsideration, because these safety factors are independent of each\nother. (e) Where a\nperson is convicted of or adjudicated for an offense committed outside of this\n\nState, and where such offense has been made part of the person's New York State\ndriving record, such offense shall carry the equivalent safety factor assigned\nunder subdivision (a) of this section, as if the offense was committed in this\n\nState.
