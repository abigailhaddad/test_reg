  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 418.6 - Transfer of a license as a terminal operator\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 283(9), 283-b(6)\n(a) The license granted to a terminal\noperator by the Department of Taxation and Finance is personal to the person to\nwhom it is granted. (b) The\ntransfer of a license as a terminal operator to another person without the\nprior written approval of the department is invalid and will not be recognized\nby the department and is grounds for the immediate cancellation or suspension\nof the license. (c) In addition to\nthe usual meaning, a\ntransfer of a license\nhas occurred if: (1)\na new partner is added to the entity\nlicensed as a terminal operator or a new person replaces an existing partner in\nsuch entity; or\n(2)\nshares of stock\nare acquired by any person so that such person owns or controls, directly or\nindirectly, more than 10 percent of the number of shares of voting stock of an\nentity licensed as a terminal operator (in the case of a licensee which has\nfour or fewer shareholders owning such voting stock, \"25 percent or more\" is\nsubstituted for \"more than 10 percent\" in applying this paragraph). (d) An application for approval of\ncontemplated transfer must be made to the department. Such application is made\nin the same manner as an application for a license to operate as a terminal\noperator. The same information and documents required upon the application for\nlicense to operate as a terminal operator must be submitted. In addition, a\nstatement describing the transaction which will constitute the transfer, including the date of the proposed transfer, the identities of the parties to\nthe transaction, the interests which are proposed to be transferred and\nresponsible persons (officers, directors, partners, shareholders owning more\nthan 10 percent of voting stock, employees under a duty to act for such\napplicant in complying with any requirement of article 12-A of the Tax Law) of\nthe entity which is the subject of the application for approval of contemplated\ntransfer must also be provided. (e) Within 75 days after the Department of Taxation and Finance has been supplied\nwith the properly completed application and any other documents or additional\ninformation requested, it will issue a determination either granting or denying\nthe application for approval of transfer. The determination of the department\nmust be based on the same criteria used in making a determination with respect\nto an application for a license as a terminal operator. If the department fails\nto issue a determination within 75 days, it is required to give its approval to\nthe application. Any determination issued pursuant to this subdivision may only\nbe protested in the same manner and upon the same conditions as a determination\nrespecting an application for a registration or license. (f) Upon approval of the application, the\ndepartment may either issue a new license as a terminal operator or reissue the\nexisting license, provided a bond or other security, in the required amount, is\nfiled or deposited with the department. (g) (1)\n\nThere is an exception to the requirement of prior approval for transfers of\nlicenses in the case of transfers by way of bequest or inheritance from the\ndecedent directly to: (i) an ancestor of the\ndecedent; (ii)\nthe spouse of the\ndecedent; (iii)\na lineal descendent\nof the decedent, of the decedent's spouse, or of a parent of the decedent; or\n(iv)\nthe spouse of any lineal\ndescendent described in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (2)\n(i) A transfer of a license as a terminal\noperator occasioned by a bequest to or inheritance received by the individuals\ndescribed in paragraph (1) of this subdivision will not, of itself, be\nconsidered a transfer which will operate as grounds to cancel such license if a\nrevised application for license is submitted to the department within 90 days\nof the death of the decedent. The failure to submit a revised application\nwithin such 90 days will be grounds for immediate cancellation or suspension of\nthe license as a terminal operator. (ii)\n\nSuch application for a license may be\nfiled in all cases by an interested relative enumerated in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision or by the personal representative of the decedent and in the\ncase of a corporation or partnership by the entity licensed as the terminal\noperator. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment will review such application in the same manner as an application\nfor license as a terminal operator and any of the grounds for denying, cancelling or suspending an application for a license as a terminal operator as\nspecified in article 12-A of the Tax Law, are grounds for the department to\ndeny the revised application. A denial issued pursuant to this paragraph may\nonly be protested in the same manner and upon the same conditions as a denial\nof an application for a registration or license. (4)\n\nUpon approval of the revised application, the department may either issue a new license as a terminal operator or reissue\nthe existing license, provided a bond or other security, in the required\namount, is filed or deposited with the department.
