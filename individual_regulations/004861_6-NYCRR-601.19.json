  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 601.19 - Monitoring requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any water use authorized by a water\nwithdrawal permit shall be subject to such requirements for monitoring the\nintake, waters of the state or other source as may be required by the\ndepartment to determine compliance with permit limitations and water quality\nstandards that are or may be affected by the water withdrawal. These\nrequirements include the installation, use, and maintenance of monitoring\nequipment or methods, and if imposed shall be included as provisions of the\nwater withdrawal permit. (b) All\nwater withdrawal sources shall be equipped with totalizing flow meters, which\nshall be properly calibrated within the year prior to permit application and at\nleast once every five years thereafter. If the water withdrawal is used solely\nfor the purpose of fire protection or if the department determines that the\ninstallation of a totalizing flow meter is impractical or unnecessary, the\npermittee may estimate water withdrawal quantities using an accurate method\napproved by the department. (c) The\nwater withdrawal rate for any water use authorized by a water withdrawal permit\nshall be monitored by the permittee. (d) Each parameter required to be monitored\npursuant to this subpart shall be monitored at intervals to be determined by\nthe department as sufficiently frequent to yield data that characterizes the\nnature of the monitored flow or water levels. Variable water withdrawal rates\nmay require monitoring at more frequent intervals than relatively constant\nwithdrawal rates. (e) For any\npublic water supply system subject to this Part and constructed or placed in\noperation after April 1, 2013, water meters shall be installed for all service\nconnections. For public water supply systems operating prior to April 1, 2013, water meters may be required to be installed where the department determines it\nis necessary to protect the environment, public health, safety and welfare and\nto ensure the proper management of the waters of the State. (f) Any groundwater well installed after\n\nApril 1, 2013 shall be equipped with apparatus for measuring and recording\nwater levels and the apparatus shall be properly calibrated at least once every\nfive years thereafter. Any surface water impoundment installed after April 1, 2013 shall be equipped with apparatus to measure water levels and corresponding\nstorage volumes. (g) For any water\nwithdrawal system, the permittee shall monitor, and maintain in good order all\nrecords pertaining to, the permittee's performance in implementing water\nconservation and efficient use goals and objectives.
