  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1625-2.3 - Responsibility to tenants\n\nState Regulations\n\nFinally, members have an obligation to tenants of their\nprojects. They should seek and demand the most economical operation of projects\nto attain the lowest possible rents for the tenants, whose incomes are\nnecessarily limited. They also should interest themselves in tenant activities\nas these afford opportunities for learning the tenants' problems as well as\nexplaining the authority's position on matters of mutual\ninterest. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1625-2.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
