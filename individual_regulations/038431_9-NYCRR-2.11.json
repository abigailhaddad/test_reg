Tit. 9 § 2.11 - Executive order no. 11: relating to equal employment opportunity for women in state government\n\nState Regulations\n\nIt is the policy of New York State to encourage employment\nopportunities for women at all levels of State government and to make State\ngovernment fully reflective of the needs, interests and talents of all of our\npopulation. Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me as\n\nGovernor of the State of New York, and in order to promote the active\nrecruitment, training and advancement of women in State departments and\nagencies, I, Malcolm Wilson, do hereby establish the following steps to be\nfollowed by each State agency. I. Agency and Department Actions. Each State agency or department, with the assistance and\nguidance of the State Department of Civil Service, shall: develop and implement a recruitment and informational\ncampaign directed at encouraging women to enter State service. Each agency and\ndepartment shall review its current recruitment procedures to insure that these\nprocedures do not discourage such entry, especially at middle and top\nmanagement levels; insure that women are fairly represented in all training\nprograms, whether technical, professional or administrative; assess the eligibility for advancement of current employees\nto assure the objective consideration of women for promotional opportunities\nand training opportunities. Each agency and department shall review the\nemployment records of employees excluded in the past from movement into\nadministrative and management positions to determine if a lack of opportunity\nto participate in training programs has contributed to their non-advancement, and shall to the maximum extent feasible provide for new training opportunities\nin such cases; remove barriers to the entry of women into State government\nand to their promotion in State service by reviewing and analyzing the\nrelevance of current job qualification requirements and removing any\nrequirements that are not specifically related to the job to be performed and\nthat serve only to limit full and flexible job opportunity; designate personnel responsible for the development and\neffectiveness of programs aimed at achieving equitable representation of women\nat all levels within that agency or department. II. Reports to the Governor. The head of every State agency shall report to the Governor\nbiannually on the specific efforts such agency has undertaken to achieve an\nequitable representation of women at all job levels within that agency. The\nagency heads shall supply to the Governor any information which the Governor or\nthe Secretary to the Governor requests to demonstrate implementation of this\norder and any further orders directed at fair employment in State\ngovernment.
