  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 2500.6 - Determinations and protective disclosures for New York reportable transactions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A taxpayer may, on or before the date that disclosure would otherwise be required under this\n\nPart, submit a request to the Department of Taxation and Finance for a\ndetermination as to whether a transaction is subject to the disclosure\nrequirements of this Part. The request for a determination shall be submitted\nto the address designated by the department for such purpose. If the request\nfully discloses all relevant facts relating to the transaction, the potential\nobligation of that taxpayer to disclose the transaction will be suspended\nduring the period that the determination request is pending and, if the\ndepartment subsequently concludes that the transaction is a New York reportable\ntransaction subject to disclosure under this Part, until the 60th day after the\nissuance of the determination (or, if the request is withdrawn, 60 days after\nthe date that the request is withdrawn). Furthermore, in the determination, the\ncommissioner may determine that the submission satisfies the disclosure rules\nunder this Part for that particular transaction or type of\ntransaction. (b) Protective\ndisclosures. If a taxpayer is uncertain whether a transaction must be disclosed\nunder this Part, the taxpayer may disclose the transaction in accordance with\nthe requirements of this Part, and indicate on the appropriate forms that the\ntaxpayer is uncertain whether the transaction is required to be disclosed under\nthis Part and that the disclosure is being filed on a protective\nbasis. (c) Determination on the\nmerits of a transaction. If a taxpayer requests a determination on the merits\nof a specific New York reportable transaction on or before the date that\ndisclosure would otherwise be required under this Part, and receives a\nfavorable determination as to the transaction, the disclosure rules under this\n\nPart will be deemed to have been satisfied by that taxpayer with regard to that\ntransaction, so long as the request fully discloses all relevant facts relating\nto the transaction which would otherwise be required to be disclosed under this\n\nPart. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n2500.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
