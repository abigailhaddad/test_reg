  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-5.10 - Medically determined drug addicts and alcoholics\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the\npurposes of MA disability, an individual will be medically determined to be a\ndrug addict or alcoholic only if he/she is under a disability in accordance\nwith section\n360-5.3\nof this Subpart, and drug\naddiction and alcoholism is a contributing factor to a finding of disability. An individual who is under a disability independent of his/her drug addiction\nor alcoholism will not be medically determined to be a drug addict or\nalcoholic, for the purpose of MA disability. (b) Treatment required for medically\ndetermined drug addicts and alcoholics. No disabled person will be\ncategorically eligible for MA if he/she is medically determined to be a drug\naddict or alcoholic, unless he/she is undergoing treatment that is appropriate\nfor his/her condition as a drug addict or alcoholic at an approved institution\nor facility, so long as such treatment is available and the person demonstrates\nthat he/she is complying with the terms, conditions and requirements of such\ntreatment. (c) What constitutes\nappropriate treatment. Appropriate treatment is a recognized medical or other\nprofessional procedure for the individual's condition as a drug addict or\nalcoholic and carried out at, or under the supervision of, an approved\ntreatment facility. This treatment may include medical examination and\ntreatment, psychiatric, psychological and vocational counselling, or other\nappropriate services. It may be furnished through one or more facilities as\npart of an individualized treatment plan intended to insure that the individual\nis receiving treatment appropriate to his/her specific needs. (d) Institutions or facilities which can\nprovide this treatment. An institution or facility that furnished medically\nrecognized treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism, and is licensed to\noperate such a program by the State, is approved to provide treatment. This\ndefinition includes, but is not limited to, Division of Substance Abuse\n\nServices facilities and alcoholic services from the Department of Mental\n\nHygiene. (e) Availability of\ntreatment. Whether treatment is available to a particular individual depends on\nthe existence of an obtainable treatment vacancy in an approved institution or\nfacility; the condition and circumstances of the individual; the treatment\nrequired and the location of the treatment institution or facility, or the\nservices or resources provided by the institution or facility. In determining\nthe availability of treatment, consideration will also be given to the\nindividual's general health, including his/her mobility and capacity to\ncomprehend the essential specification of appropriate treatment, and also the\navailability and cost of public and private transportation. If an individual is\nnot undergoing treatment for drug addiction or alcoholism because he/she is\nrequired to pay therefor at the time of his/her application, and no appropriate\nfacility providing appropriate treatment is available to him/her without\ncharge, such individual will not be categorically ineligible for MA only for\nthe reasons of his/her failure to undergo appropriate treatment. If it is the\nagency's opinion, based on the above criteria, that treatment is not feasible\nfor a particular individual, this individual would be exempt from required\ntreatment in order to maintain his/her disability status.
