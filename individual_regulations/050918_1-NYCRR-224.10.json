Tit. 1\n§\n224.10\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 20, 2019/Volume XLI, Issue 47, eff. 11/20/2019\n\nRenumbered from 224.12\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register April 23, 2025/Volume XLVII, Issue 16, eff. 4/23/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) If you are a retailer, you must post the minimum cetane number rating of all diesel fuel you sell to consumers. You must do this by putting at least one label on each face of each dispenser through which you sell diesel fuel. (b) The label, or labels must be placed conspicuously on the dispenser so as to be in full view of consumers and as near as reasonably practical to the price per gallon of the diesel fuel. (c) You must post either the cetane number certified to you or the cetane number determined by you according to the methods prescribed in\nASTM\nD 975-18. In all cases above, the cetane number rating must be shown as a whole or half number equal to or less than the cetane number rating certified to you or determined by you. (d) (1)\n\nYou must maintain and replace labels as needed to make sure consumers can easily see and read them. (2)\n\nIf the labels you have are destroyed or are unusable or unreadable for some unexpected reason, you can satisfy the requirements by posting a temporary label as much like the required label as possible. You must still get and post the required label without delay. (e) [\nReserved\n]\n(f) You must keep for six months any delivery tickets or letters of certification on which you based your posting of cetane number rating. You must also keep for six months records of any cetane number rating determinations you made. These records shall be kept at the retail station and they must be open for inspection by weights and measures officials during normal business hours. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
