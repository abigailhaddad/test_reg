  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 151.10 - New York State personal income tax returns of husband and wife\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 651(b)\n(a) Separate Federal income tax\nreturns. If a husband and wife file separate Federal income tax\nreturns, they must also file separate New York State personal income tax\nreturns on separate forms. For this purpose, they must use form IT-201 or form\nIT-203, whichever is applicable, and their tax liabilities shall be\nseparate. (b) Joint\n\nFederal income tax returns. (1)\n\nGeneral. The Federal rules for determining whether a husband and\nwife qualify for filing a joint Federal income tax return also apply for New\n\nYork State personal income tax purposes. However, where a change of residence\noccurs during the taxable year, see Part 154 of this Article. If a husband and\nwife (other than a husband and wife described in subdivision [c] of this\nsection) file a joint Federal income tax return, or if neither spouse files a\n\nFederal income tax return, they may either: (i) file a joint New York State personal\nincome tax return (on form IT-200, IT-201 or IT-203), even though one spouse\nhas no income, in which event their income tax liabilities will be joint and\nseveral and each will be liable for the entire income tax on such joint return, except as provided in subdivision (e) of this section and subsection (e) of\nsection\n685\nof the Tax Law; or\n(ii)\nelect to file separate New York State\npersonal income tax returns, provided they do so on a single form IT-201 or\nIT-203 and comply with the requirements of the Tax Commission relative to the\ndetermination of their separate income taxes on such single form. In this\nevent, their income tax liabilities will be separate, except as provided in\nsubdivision (d) of this section. (2)\n\nFor purposes of tax computation only, the\n\nInternal Revenue Code permits the Federal income tax to be determined on a\njoint Federal income tax return as though the taxable income reported on such\nreturn were split equally between husband and wife and the income tax computed\nseparately on each half. Since article 22 of the New York State Tax Law does\nnot include a similar provision, a husband and wife are not permitted to\ndetermine their New York State personal income tax on either joint or separate\n\nNew York State personal income tax returns on the basis of splitting their\ncombined income. (c) Husband and wife with different resident status. (1)\n\nIf either the husband or wife is a\nresident and the other is a nonresident of New York State, they must file\nseparate New York State personal income tax returns on separate form IT-201 or\nIT-203, regardless of whether they file a joint or separate Federal income tax\nreturn, unless both elect to file a joint New York State resident personal\nincome tax return in which their joint New York taxable income is determined as\nif both were residents. They may elect to do this only if they meet the\nfollowing requirements: (i) they filed a joint\n\nFederal income tax return for the same taxable year; and\n(ii)\neach spouse maintained his or her status\nas a resident or nonresident during the entire taxable year. If they file such a joint New York State resident\npersonal income tax return, their income tax liabilities will be joint and\nseveral, except as provided in subdivision (e) of this section and in\nsubsection (e) of section\n685\nof the Tax Law. If they file separate\n\nNew York State personal income tax returns, their income tax liabilities will\nbe separate. (2)\n\nIf, for Federal income tax purposes, a joint Federal income tax return cannot\nbe made because either the husband or wife, at any time during the taxable\nyear, was a nonresident alien, it follows that in accordance with subparagraph\n(1)(i) of this subdivision, a joint New York State personal income tax return\ncannot be filed in such a case. (d) Separate New York State personal\nincome tax returns filed on a single form; application of payments; refunds. If a husband and wife file separate New York State\npersonal income tax returns on a single form pursuant to subparagraph\n(b)(1)(ii) of this section, any excess payment by either spouse (including\nwithheld and estimated income taxes) may be applied against any balance of\nincome tax due from the other spouse, and refund of any excess not so applied\nmay be made payable to both spouses or, if either is deceased, to the executor\nor administrator for the estate of the decedent or to the surviving spouse, as\nthe case may be (see subsection [d] of section\n686\nof the\n\nTax Law). However, the provisions of this subdivision will not apply if such\nreturn of either spouse includes a demand that any overpayment made by him or\nher be applied only on account of his or her separate\nliability. (e) Relief\nof spouse from New York State personal income tax liability on joint New York\n\nState personal income tax returns. (1)\n\nIf a joint New York State personal income tax return has been filed pursuant to\nthe provisions of subdivision (b) or (c) of this section for a taxable year, and on such return there is a substantial understatement of New York State\npersonal income tax attributable to grossly erroneous items of one spouse, the\nother spouse will be relieved of liability for New York State personal income\ntax (including interest, penalties and other amounts) for such taxable year to\nthe extent that such liability is attributable to such substantial\nunderstatement of New York State personal income tax attributable to grossly\nerroneous items if: (i) the other spouse\nestablishes that, in signing such return, he or she did not know, and had no\nreason to know, that there was such substantial understatement; and\n(ii)\ntaking into account all the facts and\ncircumstances, including whether or not the other spouse benefited directly or\nindirectly from the grossly erroneous items, it is inequitable to hold the\nother spouse liable for the deficiency in New York State personal income tax\nfor such taxable year attributable to such substantial\nunderstatement. (2)\nA\nspouse may make application for the relief provided for in this subdivision by\nfiling with the Tax Commission a sworn statement stating all the facts and\ncircumstances set forth in subparagraphs (1)(i)-(ii) of this subdivision in\nsupport of such application. The Tax Commission may request additional sworn\nstatements, testimony under oath or any other proof that it requires to\ndetermine whether the applicant should be relieved of liability for New York\n\nState personal income tax as provided for in this subdivision. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of this subdivision: (i) the term\ngrossly erroneous\nitems\nmeans, with respect to any spouse, any item of New York adjusted\ngross income attributable to such spouse which is omitted from New York\nadjusted gross income and any claim of a New York deduction, exemption, credit\nor basis by such spouse in an amount for which there is no basis in fact or\nlaw; (ii)\nthe term\nsubstantial understatement\nmeans the excess of the amount of\nthe New York State personal income tax required to be shown on the New York\n\nState personal income tax return for the taxable year, over the amount of New\n\nYork State personal income tax imposed which is shown on the New York State\npersonal income tax return, reduced by any rebate (within the meaning of\nsection\n681[g] of the Tax Law), which exceeds $100; and\n(iii)\nthe\ndetermination of the spouse to whom items of New York adjusted gross income\n(other than New York adjusted gross income from property) are attributable will\nbe made without regard to community property laws. (4)\n\nNew York State personal income tax\nliability attributable to substantial understatement must exceed specified\npercentage of innocent spouse New York adjusted gross income. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph, the provisions of this subdivision shall apply: (a) if the innocent spouse's New York\nadjusted gross income for the most recent taxable year ending before the date\nthe deficiency notice is mailed is $20,000 or less, only if the liability for\n\nNew York State personal income tax described in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision (including interest, penalties and other amounts) attributable to\nthe substantial understatement is greater than 10 percent of such New York\nadjusted gross income; (b) if the\ninnocent spouse's New York adjusted gross income for the most recent taxable\nyear ending before the date the deficiency notice is mailed is more than\n$20,000, only if the liability for New York State personal income tax described\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision (including interest, penalties and other\namounts) attributable to the substantial understatement is greater than 25\npercent of such New York adjusted gross income. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph, if the\ninnocent spouse is married to another spouse at the close of such year, the\nspouse's New York adjusted gross income must include the New York adjusted\ngross income of the new spouse, whether or not they file a joint New York State\npersonal income tax return. (iii)\n\nException. The requirement contained in this paragraph that New York State\npersonal income tax liability (including interest, penalties and other amounts)\nattributable to substantial understatement must exceed either 10 percent of the\ninnocent spouse's New York State adjusted gross income if such spouse's\nadjusted gross income for the most recent taxable year ending before the\ndeficiency notice is mailed is $20,000 or less; or 25 percent of the innocent\nspouse's New York State adjusted gross income if such spouse's adjusted gross\nincome for the most recent taxable year ending before the deficiency notice is\nmailed is more than $20,000, shall not apply to a substantial understatement\nattributable to an omission from New York adjusted gross income. Therefore, these relief of spouse provisions will be available without the need to meet\nthe applicable percentage limitation specified in this paragraph where there is\na substantial understatement attributable to an omission from New York adjusted\ngross income. (5)\n\nIf a\njoint New York State personal income tax return has been made by a husband and\nwife for a taxable year and on such return there is a substantial\nunderstatement of tax attributable to grossly erroneous items of one spouse, and if, pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision, the other spouse is\nrelieved of liability for New York State personal income tax (including\ninterest, penalties and other amounts) for such taxable year to the extent that\nsuch liability is attributable to such substantial understatement, and if a\njoint New York City personal income tax return or a joint City of Yonkers\nincome tax surcharge return is made by the spouse for the same taxable year, then such other spouse shall be relieved of liability for the New York City\npersonal income tax or the City of Yonkers income tax surcharge, whichever is\napplicable, for the taxable year to the extent that such liability is\nattributable to such substantial understatement. (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this\n\nSubchapter to the contrary, if a husband and wife file a joint New York State\npersonal income tax return, any excess payment and interest thereon by either\nspouse may be applied against any past-due support or against any amount of a\ndefault in repayment of a guaranteed student, State University or city\nuniversity loan attributable to the other spouse, of which the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance has been notified pursuant to the provisions of section\n171-c, 171-d\nor\n171-e\nof the Tax Law. In calculating the amount of excess\npayment and interest thereon which may be applied against past-due support or\nagainst a default in repayment of a guaranteed student, State University or\ncity university loan of a spouse, the excess payment will first be applied\nagainst any liability of such spouse in respect of any tax imposed by or\npursuant to the authority of the Tax Law or administered by the Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance and against estimated tax for the succeeding taxable year\nif the taxpayer claims such overpayment or a portion thereof as a credit\nagainst estimated tax for such succeeding taxable year. However, the provisions\nof this subdivision will not apply to the excess payment of a spouse if such\nspouse affixes to the joint New York State personal income tax return a written\ndemand providing that any overpayment made by him or her be applied only on\naccount of his or her separate liability and furnishes such other information\nas the Tax Department may deem necessary and prescribe by forms and\ninstructions. (See form IT-280, Nonobligated Spouse\n\nAllocation. ) A spouse may not file an amended New York State personal\nincome tax return to make such a demand. If a spouse makes a demand that any\noverpayment made by him or her be applied only on account of his or her\nseparate liability, then: (1)\namounts\nattributable to withholding from wages of such spouse will be applied only\nagainst the separate liability of such spouse; (2)\namounts attributable to separate payments\nof estimated income tax by such spouse will be applied only against the\nseparate New York State personal income tax liability of such spouse; and\n(3)\namounts attributable to\njoint payments of estimated income tax and amounts attributable to any other\npayment will be applied against the separate New York State personal income tax\nliability of each spouse in such proportion as is agreed upon by both spouses; provided, however, that in the absence of any such agreement, such amounts will\nbe applied against the separate New York State personal income tax liability of\neach spouse in the same proportion which the separate New York State personal\nincome tax liability of each spouse bears to the total New York State personal\nincome tax liability of both spouses. In the absence of an agreement between\nspouses, the amounts of joint estimated income tax payments and other payments\nwill be apportioned based upon the following formula: separate New York State personal income tax\nliability of spouse\n/\ntotal New York State personal\nincome tax liability of both spouses\n× amount of estimated income\ntax payments\n\nFor purposes of this subdivision, the separate New York\n\nState personal income tax liability of each spouse will be determined by the\nfollowing formula: New York adjusted gross income of each\nspouse\n/\ncombined New York adjusted gross income of both\nspouses\n× total New York State personal income tax liability of\nboth spouses\n\nExample 1: Assume that for the calendar year 1987, H had New York\n\nState personal income tax withheld from his wages in the amount of $600. W, his\nspouse, received no income during the year. Additionally, H and W made joint\npayments of estimated income tax totaling $900. H and W subsequently filed a\njoint New York State personal income tax return showing a New York State\npersonal income tax liability of $1,300. W had defaulted in repayment of a\nguaranteed student loan in the amount of $300 and the Department of Taxation\nand Finance was so notified in accordance with the provisions of section\n171-d\nof the Tax Law. H did not affix to\ntheir joint New York State personal income tax return a written demand\nproviding that any overpayment made by him be applied only on account of his\nseparate New York State personal income tax liability. The overpayment of H and\nW in the amount of $200 ($1,500 less $1,300) will be applied against W's\nliability for her defaulted student loan. Since the amount owed on the\ndefaulted student loan exceeded the amount of the overpayment, neither H nor W\nwill receive any refund of New York State personal income tax. Example 2: Assume that for the calendar year 1987, H had New York\nadjusted gross income of $20,000 and had New York State personal income tax\nwithheld from his wages in the amount of $1,600. W, his spouse, had New York\nadjusted gross income of $5,000 and had New York State personal income tax\nwithheld from her wages in the amount of $500. Additionally, H and W made joint\npayments of estimated tax totaling $200. H and W filed a joint New York State\npersonal income tax return showing a combined New York adjusted gross income of\n$25,000 and a total New York State income tax liability of $836. H had\ndefaulted in repayment of a guaranteed student loan in the amount of $1,200 and\nthe Department of Taxation and Finance was so notified in accordance with the\nprovision of section\n171-d\nof the Tax Law. W affixed to their\njoint New York State personal income tax return a written demand providing that\nany overpayment made by her be applied only on account of her separate New York\n\nState income tax liability. The overpayments made by each spouse will be\ntreated as follows: Joint return\nH\nW\nNY adjusted gross income\n$25,000\n$20,000\n$5,000\n\nTotal NYS income tax liability\n$ 836\n\nSeparate NYS income tax liability\n$20,000\n× $836 =\n$20,000 + $5,000\n$ 669\n$ 5,000\n× $836 =\n$20,000 + $5,000\n$ 167\n\nShare of joint estimated income tax payment\n200\n$20,000\n× $200 =\n$20,000 + $5,000\n$ 160\n$ 5,000\n× $200 =\n$20,000 + $5,000\n40\n\nAmount of NYS personal income tax withheld\n2,100\n1,600\n500\n\nOverpayment\n$ 1,464\n$ 1,091\n$ 373\n\nAmount applied against guaranteed student loan\n1,091\n1,091\n0\n\nAmount refunded\n$ 373\n$ 0\n$ 373\n(g) Any reference in subdivision (f) of this\nsection to \"New York State personal income tax\" shall be deemed, for purposes\nof such subdivision, to include reference to the New York City personal income\ntax on residents, the New York City earnings tax on nonresidents, the City of\n\nYonkers income tax surcharge on residents and the City of Yonkers earnings tax\non nonresidents.
