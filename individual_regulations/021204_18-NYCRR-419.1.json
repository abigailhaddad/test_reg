  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 419.1 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis Part shall apply to the special day care services\nprogram authorized and funded by chapter 53 of the Laws of 1983 which\nauthorizes the department to provide 87 1/2 percent reimbursement for social\nservices district expenditures for day care services provided to encourage and\npromote self-sufficiency. The department shall be authorized to provide\nreimbursement to the social services districts pursuant to the special day care\nservices program so long as funds are appropriated to the department for such\npurpose. The expanded day care opportunities developed through this program\nwill be for the development of day care services and a range of support\nservices directly linked to day care services such as transportation to support\ntraining and employment of parents who have children in day care. This program\nwill benefit current or recent public assistance recipients and persons who\nhave lost day care because of budget reductions in services programs to insure\nthat persons in these groups have access to employment and training\nopportunities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n419.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
