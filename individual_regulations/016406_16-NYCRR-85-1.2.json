[FN5] Concerning agricultural land use, the applicant\nshall, in cooperation with the landowner(s) and Soil and Water Conservation\n\nDistrict, consider both active and inactive fields. Active and inactive fields, by definition, are cropland, rotation hayland and cropland, hayland, livestock\ngrazing areas, orchards and vineyards. The applicant shall also identify those\nareas containing practices for agricultural resources management, including\nstrip-cropping, diversion terraces, underground tile drain lines, surface\ndrainage ditches, and waste management conveyance and storage systems.
