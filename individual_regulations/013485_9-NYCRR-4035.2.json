  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4035.2 - Foul riding penalized\n\nState Regulations\n(a) When\nclear, a horse may be taken to any part of the course provided that crossing or\nweaving in front of contenders may constitute interference or intimidation for\nwhich the offender may be disciplined. (b) A horse crossing another may be\ndisqualified, if in the judgment of the stewards, it interferes with, impedes\nor intimidates another horse, or the foul altered the finish of the race, regardless of whether the foul was accidental, willful, or the result of\ncareless riding. The stewards may also take into consideration mitigating\nfactors, such as whether the impeded horse was partly at fault or the crossing\nwas wholly caused by the fault of some other horse or jockey. (c) If a horse or jockey jostles another\nhorse, the aggressor may be disqualified, unless the impeded horse or jockey\nwas partly in fault or the jostle was wholly caused by the fault of some other\nhorse or jockey. (d) A jockey shall\nnot ride carelessly or willfully such that the jockey's mount, equipment, or\nany item or object under his or her control interferes with, impedes, intimidates, or injures another horse or jockey in the race, including that a\njockey shall not carelessly or willfully strike another horse or jockey or such\nother jockey's equipment with his or her whip. The stewards may disqualify the\nhorse ridden by the jockey who committed the foul if the foul was willful or\ncareless or may have altered the finish of the race. The stewards may also take\ninto consideration mitigating factors such as whether the impeded horse was\npartly at fault or if the foul was caused by the fault of some other horse or\njockey. (e) (1)\n\nIf two or more horses are coupled in the\nbetting as an entry, and one or more of them shall be disqualified for\nviolation of the rules of racing, the balance of the entry shall also be\ndisqualified if in the judgment of the stewards such violation prevented any\nother horse or horses from finishing ahead of the other part of the entry. If\nsaid violation is without such effect upon the finish of the race, penalty\ntherefor may be applied against the offender and the balance of the entry may\ngo unpunished. (2)\n\nIf any horses\ntrained by the same trainer race uncoupled in any race, and one or more of them\nshall be disqualified for violation of the rules of racing, any other horses\nentered by that same trainer shall also be disqualified if in the judgment of\nthe stewards such violation prevented any other horse or horses from finishing\nahead of the other part of the entry. If said violation is without such effect\nupon the finish of the race, penalty therefore may be applied against the\noffender only. (f) Complaints under this section may be received only from the owner, trainer or\njockey of the horse alleged to be aggrieved and must be made to the clerk of\nthe scales or to the stewards before or immediately after the jockey of the\nhorse alleged to be aggrieved has passed the scales. But nothing in this\nsection shall prevent the stewards taking cognizance of foul riding. (g) Any jockey against whom a foul is claimed\nshall be given the opportunity to appear before the stewards before any\ndecision is made by them. (h) A\njockey whose horse has been disqualified or who unnecessarily causes his or her\nhorse to shorten its stride with a view to complaint, or an owner, trainer or\njockey who complains frivolously that his or her horse was crossed or jostled, may be punished. (i) The extent of\ndisqualification shall be determined by the stewards as in this article\nprovided. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
