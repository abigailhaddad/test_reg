  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 401.6 - Place of business; conduct of business\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nThe\nplace of business designated in the license shall be open each business day\nduring normal business hours except where otherwise authorized by the\nsuperintendent. If the superintendent authorizes a licensed location to be open\nfor business only during certain days or hours, the licensee shall post on the\nwindow the days and hours such office is open. (2)\nA closed-end loan agreement shall provide\nfor payments of principal, or principal and interest combined, to be made not\nless frequently than one each month beginning not more than one month and 15\ndays after the date the loan is made. (b) (1)\nA\nlicensee may enter into an open-end loan agreement with a borrower which shall\nprovide for a credit in a principal amount not exceeding the maximum amount\npermitted by Banking Law, section 340 against which one or more advances to or\nfor the account of the borrower may be made, either at the time the credit is\nestablished or thereafter from time to time, or both, by means of honoring or\ncausing to be honored one or more written orders or requests of the borrower, or one or more checks or drafts negotiated by the borrower. Interest shall be\ncomputed on the unpaid aggregate principal amount of advances determined by\nadding the amounts unpaid for each day of the monthly billing cycle and\ndividing the sum by the number of days in the billing cycle. The term billing\ncycle shall have the same meaning as set forth in section 226.2(a)(4) of\n\nRegulation Z of the Federal Reserve Board. (2)\n\nAn open-end loan agreement shall provide\nfor payments at intervals at least monthly for such term as agreed upon by the\nlicensee and the borrower and may provide that the payments to be made after an\nadvance shall be larger than those made before the advance. (3)\n\nAt least 14 days before the date each\npayment pursuant to an open-end loan agreement is due, the licensee shall\ndeliver to the borrower, or mail to the borrower at the mailing address last\nknown to the licensee, a statement of account covering the period for which\npayment will be due. Such statement shall contain all disclosures required by\nthe Act of Congress entitled Truth-in-Lending Act (15 USC section\n1501\net seq.) and the regulations and rules\nthereunder. (4)\n\nNothing in this\n\nPart is intended to authorize financings of the type permitted pursuant to the\n\nNew York Retail Instalment Sales Act. (c) When a cash payment is made pursuant to\nany closed-end loan agreement, the lender shall give to the person making it, at the time the payment is made, a receipt which specifies the amount applied\nto the outstanding loan balance and any other charges. In any case of an\nopen-end loan agreement, the receipt shall specify the amount applied as\nfinance charge, the amount applied to insurance premiums, if any, the amount\napplied to the previous balance and the amount of the new balance. If the\nlicensee provides the borrower with a periodic billing statement which contains\nthe information required by this paragraph, a receipt may be issued which\nspecifies only the amount of the cash payment. (d) (1)\n\nEvery loan agreement which is sold or otherwise transferred by a licensee shall\ncontain printed in a size equal to at least 10-point bold type the statement: If this agreement is sold or otherwise transferred, the\nborrower's rights under the law or under this agreement are in no way altered\nor impaired. (2)\nA licensee\nis prohibited from selling or otherwise transferring an open-end loan agreement\nwhich it originates unless at least 15 days before such sale or transfer takes\nplace the licensee which originated the open-loan agreement mails or delivers\nto the borrower at the mailing address last known to the licensee notice of\nsuch sale or transfer. Such notice shall contain a statement to the effect that\nthe borrower may terminate the open-end loan agreement at any time and repay\nthe outstanding unpaid balance in accordance with the terms of the loan\nagreement. (3)\n\nEvery licensee shall\npromptly notify the superintendent in writing of the date any licensed office\nhas discontinued business and shall surrender the license for such office\nwithin fifteen days of such discontinuance. (4)\n\nIf the 10th day of a default in the\npayment of any scheduled installment of a precomputed interest loan falls on a\n\nSunday, a legal holiday, or a Saturday (if the office of the licensee at which\npayment is to be made is closed on Saturday), the borrower shall have all of\nthe next business day in which to pay said installment before a default charge\nmay be imposed. (5)\n\nExcept upon\nwritten request of the borrower, no licensee shall impose a deferment charge on\na precomputed interest loan if the amount tendered is sufficient to pay the\nfull amount in default plus any default charge owing thereon.
