The corporation and the agency shall\ndetermine the mechanism for collecting the assessed fee no less frequently than\nannually, as prescribed in section\n692\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (2)\n\nAn entity other\nthan a student or borrower may be permitted to pay the college default fee on\nbehalf of a college consistent with applicable laws. The corporation shall\ndetermine how such funds will be transferred, subject to the approval of the\nagency, or other public benefit corporation authorized to issue bonds under the\n\nPublic Authorities Law for purpose of this program, with respect to loans that\nare expected to be financed by such entity. (3)\n\nIf the college pays the default fee, the\ncorporation's electronic funds transfer (EFT) process will proportionately\nreduce the amount of the borrower's disbursement(s) to reflect payment of the\ncollege's default fees. Colleges shall, if applicable, credit the student's\naccount to reflect reimbursement of the college default fee. The corporation's\nEFT process will reflect the amount of the borrowers' disbursements including\nthe college's default fees. The college's default fees will be deducted from\nthe amount deposited in the college's bank account. (b) Borrower default fees. (1)\nA borrower fee may be included in the\ncalculation of the student's cost of attendance. This fee shall be deducted\nproportionately from each disbursement made on a program loan through the\ncorporation's electronic funds transfer process to be deposited into the\nappropriate default reserve fund. Any entity may pay or subsidize all or a\nportion of the borrower's default fee on behalf of the borrower as approved by\nthe corporation consistent with applicable laws. (2)\n\nThe corporation shall determine the\namount of the fee to be deducted, subject to approval by the agency, as\nprescribed in section\n692\nof the\n\nEducation Law. (3)\n\nFees shall be\ndeposited into a separate account, held solely for the purposes of this\nprogram, for timely deposit into the applicable default reserve fund. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
