Tit. 4§ 4.4 - Appointment to seasonal positions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Positions in the competitive class where the nature of service is such that it\nis not continuous through out the year, but recurs in each successive year, except as herein otherwise provided, shall be designated as seasonal positions\nand shall be subject to the provisions of these rules applicable generally to\npositions in such class. (b) Upon\nthe expiation of the employment season, the names of all persons employed in\nsuch seasonal positions shall be entered upon a seasonal reemployment list in\nthe order of their first appointment to the title vacated by them at the\nexpiration of such employment season. Such seasonal reemployment list shall be\ncertified to the appointing authority at the commencement of or during the next\nemployment season, and the persons whose names appear thereon as still\nqualified shall be entitled to reemployment in such positions in the order in\nwhich their names appear on such list. Any such person may be reexamined by the\ndepartment with respect to his physical fitness for the performance of the\nduties of the position, and may be disqualified for reemployment in the same\nmanner and for any of the reasons applicable to the disqualification of an\neligible on an eligible list resulting from open competitive\nexamination.
