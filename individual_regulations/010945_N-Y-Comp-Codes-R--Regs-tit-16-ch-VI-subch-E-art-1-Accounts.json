Capital\n\nLeases\n(A)\n\nThis account shall include\nall property acquired under a capital lease. (Note section\n661.18\nof this Title.) A lease\nqualifies as a capital lease when one or more of the following criteria is met: By the end of the lease term, ownership of the leased\nproperty is transferred to the lessee. The lease contains a bargain purchase option. The lease term is substantially (75% or more) equal to the\nestimated useful life of the leased property. However, if the beginning of the\nlease term falls within the last 25% of the total estimated economic life of\nthe leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not\nbe used for purposes of classifying the lease. At the inception of the lease, the present value of the\nminimum lease payments, excluding that portion of the payments representing\nexecutory costs to be paid by the lessor, including any profit thereon, equals\nor exceeds 90% or more of the fair value of the leased property. However, if\nthe beginning of the lease term falls within the last 25% of the total\nestimated economic life of the leased property, including earlier years of use, this criterion shall not be used for purposes of classifying the lease. (The\nlessee utility shall compute the present value of the minimum lease payments\nusing its incremental borrowing rate, unless [1] it is practicable for the\nutility to learn the implicit rate computed by the lessor, and [2] the implicit\nrate computed by the lessor is less than the lessee's incremental borrowing\nrate. If both of those conditions are met, the lessee shall use the implicit\nrate.)\n(B)\n\nAll other leases\nare operating leases. (C)\n\nThe\namounts recorded in this account at the inception of a capital lease shall be\nequal to the original cost, if known, or to the present value not to exceed\nfair value, at the beginning of the lease term, of minimum lease payments\nduring the lease term, excluding that portion of the payments representing\nexecutory costs to be paid by the lessor, together with any profit\nthereon. (D)\n\nIf at any time the\nlessee and lessor agree to change the provisions of the lease, other than by\nrenewing the lease or extending its term, in a manner that would have resulted\nin a different classification of the lease under the criteria in paragraph A\nhad the changed terms been in effect at the inception of the lease, the revised\nagreement shall be considered as a new agreement over its term, and the\ncriteria in paragraph A shall be applied for purposes of classifying the new\nlease. Likewise, any action that extends the lease beyond the expiration of the\nexisting lease term, such as the exercise of a lease renewal option other than\nthose already included in the lease term, shall be considered as a new\nagreement and shall be classified according to the above provisions. Changes in\nestimates (for example, changes in estimates of the economic life or the\nresidual value of the leased property) or changes in circumstances (for\nexample, default by the lessee) shall not give rise to a new classification of\na lease for accounting purposes. (E)\n\nFor corporate ledger and balance sheet\npurposes this account shall be treated as a single composite account. For\npurposes of analysis, the company shall maintain subsidiary records in which\nthis account is broken down into component parts corresponding to the primary\ntelecommunications plant accounts or subdivisions thereof which include leased\nplant.
