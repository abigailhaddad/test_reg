  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 73.1 - Registration of retail dealers and vending machines\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 475 and 480-a\n(a) General. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in this subdivision, every retail dealer of cigarettes as defined in section\n70.2\n(h) of this Title and every retail dealer of tobacco products as defined in section\n89.2\n(d) of this Title must be registered with the Department of Taxation and Finance. In addition, every vending machine through which cigarettes or tobacco products\nare sold in New York State must be registered with the department. For purposes\nof this Part only, a person will not be considered to be a retail dealer by\nvirtue of any sales of cigarettes or tobacco products made through vending\nmachines, but shall instead be considered a vending machine owner or operator\nwith respect to such sales. (2)\n\nRetail dealers. Every retail dealer must register and publicly display a\ncertificate of retail dealer registration (hereafter referred to as a\nregistration certificate), issued by the department, in each place of business\nlocated in this State through which the dealer sells cigarettes or tobacco\nproducts at retail. A retail dealer who does not have a regular place of\nbusiness must register and publicly display such a certificate on each of its\ncarts, stands, trucks or other merchandising devices through which it sells\ncigarettes or tobacco products in this State. In the event that a retail dealer\nhas both regular places of business and such merchandising devices through\nwhich cigarettes or tobacco products are sold, such dealer must publicly\ndisplay a registration certificate at each place of business and upon each\nmerchandising device, regardless of proximity. Registration certificates must\nbe conspicuously displayed for the purposes of inspection and enforcement of\nthe provisions of article 20 of the Tax Law. Where a retail dealer also sells\ncigarettes or tobacco products in this State through vending machines, such\nretail dealer is also subject to the registration provisions of this Part as a\nvending machine owner or operator. (3)\n\nVending machines. Every person who owns\none or more vending machines through which cigarettes or tobacco products are\nsold in this State, regardless of whether located on the premises of the\nvending machine owner or on the premises of any other person, must register\neach such vending machine with the department. However, if the owner is not the\noperator of the vending machine, then any person who operates the machine, regardless of whether located on the premises of the vending machine owner or\noperator or on the premises of any other person, must register such machine. A\nvending machine registration certificate (hereafter referred to as a\nregistration certificate), in such form as the department shall prescribe, must\nbe conspicuously affixed to each vending machine that is subject to\nregistration, for the purposes of inspection and enforcement of the provisions\nof article 20 of the Tax Law. Where a vending machine owner or operator also\nsells cigarettes or tobacco products in this State at retail other than through\nvending machines, such vending machine owner or operator is also subject to\nregistration as a retail dealer. (4)\n\nSeparate registrations are not required\nif both cigarettes and tobacco products will be sold in New York State. That\nis, a retail dealer or a vending machine who or which sells both cigarettes and\ntobacco products from a single location or machine, as the case may be, need\nonly be registered with the department once for such location or\nmachine. (b) Initial registration. (1)\n\nAn\napplication for registration of a retail dealer or of a vending machine must be\nmade on a form prescribed by the Department of Taxation and Finance for such\npurpose and must fully disclose all of the information required therein. Every\nretail dealer and every vending machine owner or operator subject to the\nprovisions of this section who: (i) commences\nbusiness in this State; (ii)\ncommences selling cigarettes or tobacco products at retail through new or\ndifferent places of business in this State; or\n(iii)\ncommences selling cigarettes or tobacco\nproducts through new or different vending machines in this State; as the case may be, must file such an application with\nthe department at least 30 days prior to the commencement of such business or\nthe commencement of such sales. Provided, however, the department will accept\nas being timely filed such an application received at least 20 days prior to\nthe commencement of such business or the commencement of such sales, in order\nto facilitate the joint administration of the registration procedures provided\nfor under article 28 of the Tax Law and under article 20 of such law and this\n\nPart (see section\n1134\nof\nthe Tax Law and Part 539 of this Title for the requirements for registering as\na sales tax vendor and obtaining a certificate of authority). Each retail\ndealer must pay with the filing of an application for registration, an\napplication fee as provided in section\n480-a (2)(b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw, for each retail place of business or merchandising device through which\nthe dealer will sell cigarettes or tobacco products in the State. Each vending\nmachine owner or operator must pay with the filing of such an application, an\napplication fee as provided in section\n480-a (2)(b)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw, for each vending machine through which cigarettes or tobacco products will\nbe sold in the State. The application fees should be paid by check, money\norder, or electronically, as prescribed by the department. In no event shall\nthe application fees be prorated for a portion of a calendar year or for any\nother purpose. (2)\n\nWithin 10 days after the receipt of an\napplication for registration, in completed form, and payment of the proper fee\nor fees, the department will issue the appropriate registration certificates. All registration certificates issued pursuant to this Part on and after\n\nDecember 1st in each year shall be applicable to the following calendar year, in addition to the month of December. (See subdivision [d] of this section\nconcerning registration renewals and the issuance of renewal registration\ncertificates in December of each year.)\n(3)\n\nWhen registration certificates are\nreceived, the retail dealer or the vending machine owner or operator, as the\ncase may be, must designate each certificate for use in a particular place of\nbusiness or on a particular merchandising device or vending machine. The retail\ndealer or vending machine owner or operator must maintain and make available\nfor inspection by the department, complete and accurate records of such\ndesignations. The records must clearly associate each individual registration\ncertificate number with the address of the place of business in which it is\ndisplayed or the manufacturer's serial number of the merchandising device or\nvending machine on which it is displayed or affixed. In the absence of a\nmanufacturer's serial number, the merchandising device or vending machine must\nbe inscribed with a permanent identifying number to which the registration\ncertificate number may be associated. (c) Assignment and surrender. (1)\n\nThe registrations of retail dealers and\nindividual vending machines are not assignable to other persons, as provided in\nsection\n72.1\n(d) of this Title nor are such registrations, or certificates evidencing such\nregistrations, transferable among retail locations or merchandising devices of\nretail dealers or among vending machines of vending machine owners or\noperators. (2)\n\nIn the event that a\nretail dealer never commences business or ceases to do business as specified in\na registration certificate, such certificate must be surrendered to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance immediately. Similarly, if a vending machine\nowner or operator never commences business or ceases to do business as\nspecified in a registration certificate, such certificate must be immediately\nreturned to the department unless the registration certificate has been affixed\nto a vending machine, in which case such certificate must be immediately\ndestroyed. (d) Annual renewals. The registrations of retail dealers and individual\nvending machines are valid for a single calendar year and must be renewed each\nyear if cigarettes or tobacco products will continue to be sold in this State. Every retail dealer and every vending machine owner or operator who, pursuant\nto section\n1136\nof the\n\nTax Law, is required to file a sales tax return for the quarterly period ending\non the last day of August must file a new application for registration under\nthis section with such quarterly return in every calendar year. The Department\nof Taxation and Finance may require that the applications for renewal be mailed\nto a designated address, separate from the sales tax returns. In which case, such applications must be filed on or before September 20th. In addition, where\nthe department has permitted or required sales tax returns to be made covering\nother periods and upon such dates as it has specified, such applications for\nrenewal must also be filed on or before September 20th. The yearly applications\nfor renewal must be accompanied by the appropriate application fees as\ndescribed in subdivision (b) of this section. In December of each year, after\nreceiving such registration renewal applications and the proper fees, the\ndepartment will issue new, distinctively colored registration certificates. Such certificates must be publicly displayed, or affixed to individual vending\nmachines, as of January 1st. Registration certificates for the succeeding\ncalendar year may, however, be lawfully displayed and affixed as early as the\npreceding December 1st. Expired certificates are not required to be surrendered\nto the department. (e) Replacement certificates. (1)\n\nUpon written request, the Department of Taxation and Finance may issue, without\ncharge, replacement registration certificates to be used in place of\nregistration certificates that have been in some manner lost, mutilated or\ndestroyed and for certificates that will unavoidably be destroyed as a result\nof a purposeful act; for example, the refurbishing of a vending machine. A\nrequest for such a replacement certificate must provide the following\ninformation: (i) the name and address of the\nretail dealer, or vending machine owner or operator; (ii)\nthe identification number of the\noriginal registration certificate to be replaced; (iii)\nthe exact location of the place of\nbusiness, merchandising device (if possible) or vending machine to which the\nregistration certificate related; (iv)\nthe manufacturer's serial number or\nother authorized identifying number of the merchandising device or vending\nmachine; and\n(v) a detailed\nexplanation as to why a replacement certificate is being requested, including\nthe date any loss, mutilation or destruction was first discovered or the\nintended date of the purposeful act resulting in destruction. (2)\nA retail dealer or a vending\nmachine owner or operator will not be in violation of the Tax Law or of this\n\nPart for failure to display or affix a registration certificate, if the retail\ndealer or vending machine owner or operator can establish that the department\nwas notified within five days after the retail dealer or vending machine owner\nor operator first discovered any loss, mutilation or destruction of the\noriginal registration certificate, and that the replacement certificate was\npublicly displayed or affixed to the vending machine within 10 days after the\ndate it was issued by the department. When a retail dealer or vending machine\nowner or operator receives a replacement certificate, the records concerning\nthe designation of registration certificates required by subdivision (b) of\nthis section must be immediately amended to reflect such receipt. (f) Consignment\ncertificates. (1)\n\nAny vending machine\nowner or operator who requires registration certificates throughout the year in\nvolume and who has 100 or more vending machines registered with the Department\nof Taxation and Finance may apply to the department for consignment\nregistration certificates. Consignment certificates are registration\ncertificates entrusted to a vending machine owner or operator for such owner or\noperator's expedient use in the future. (2)\n(i) An\napplication for consignment certificates must be made on a form prescribed by\nthe department for such purpose. Consignment certificates may not be requested\nin units of less than 10 nor more than 100 certificates. In addition, the\nnumber of consignment certificates requested and the number of such\ncertificates to be issued at any one time may not exceed 10 percent of the\nnumber of vending machines then registered by the owner or operator under\narticle 20 of the Tax Law. Moreover, successive applications for consignment\ncertificates will not be accepted by the department until 75 percent of the\nowner or operator's previous order for such certificates has been assigned to\nvending machines, and until the owner or operator has no more than 25\nconsignment certificates outstanding. Accordingly, taking into consideration\nthe 25 consignment certificates outstanding and the maximum request for 100\ncertificates, a vending machine owner or operator may have no more than 125\nconsignment registration certificates at any given time. (ii)\n\nApplication fees of $25 for each\nconsignment certificate must be paid in full with the filing of the\napplication. Unless the application is denied by the department, the\napplication fees are not refundable. However, at the time of annual renewal, any consignment certificates outstanding may be converted to new consignment\ncertificates at no additional fee. (iii)\n\nAn application for consignment\ncertificates may be denied, and the authority to use consignment registration\ncertificates may be withdrawn at any time, if the owner or operator has\nviolated any of the provisions of article 20 of the Tax Law or any rule or\nregulation adopted pursuant thereto. (3)\n\nOnce the vending machine owner or\noperator has received consignment certificates, the owner or operator is\ndirectly accountable to the department for such certificates. Immediately upon\nassignment of a registration certificate to a particular machine, the owner or\noperator must make a detailed record of such assignment as provided in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. A copy of such records must be submitted to\nthe department upon any request for additional consignment\ncertificates. (g) Construction. Nothing in this Part nor Title shall be construed to\nrequire registration in any circumstances in which the State is without power\nto do so by reason of the United States Constitution or any laws enacted\npursuant thereto.
