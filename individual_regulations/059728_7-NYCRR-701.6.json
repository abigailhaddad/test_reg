  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.6 - Procedural safeguards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Advisors. An inmate may present or appeal a grievance unaided, or may be\nadvised or assisted by a staff member or another inmate of his/her choosing\nsubject to the restrictions set forth in sections\n701.2\n(h) and\n701.7\n(c)(3)\nof this Part. At the discretion of the superintendent, inmate advisors for\nkeeplocked inmates may be limited to inmate clerks or inmate representatives on\nthe IGRC and keeplocked inmates may be prohibited from serving as advisors to\nother inmates. (b) Reprisals\nprohibited. No reprisals of any kind shall be taken against an inmate or\nemployee for good faith utilization of this grievance procedure. An inmate may\npursue a complaint that a reprisal occurred through the grievance mechanism. A\ngrievant shall not receive a misbehavior report based solely upon an allegedly\nfalse statement made by the inmate to the grievance committee. (c) Objection to IGRC representative. No\ninmate will take part in the resolution of a grievance over a grievant's\nobjection. If a grievant objects to both inmate representatives and both\nalternate inmate representatives, then the two staff representatives shall hold\nthe hearing. An inmate representative may not function as a voting\nrepresentative at a hearing on his/her grievance. An alternate inmate\nrepresentative must be utilized. A staff representative may not function as a\nvoting representative at a hearing on a grievance in which that staff person is\na direct party. An alternate staff representative must be utilized. (d) IGRC access/movement within the\ninstitution. (1)\nA pass system (institutional\nor point to point) which permits inmate representatives, and grievance clerks\nto perform their IGP duties shall be developed in accordance with\nspecifications established by the superintendent. Security restrictions will\npreclude inmates from entering certain areas of the facility. (2)\n\nAt any facility where a pass system is\nnot feasible, the superintendent must develop a procedure to ensure that the\nIGRC can obtain necessary information, keep within established time frames and\nmaintain confidentiality. This procedure must be in writing and approved by the\ndirector, IGP. (3)\n\nUpon written\nrecommendation of the IGP supervisor and with the approval of the director, IGP, the superintendent may restrict or remove a specific inmate's IGRC pass\nprivileges. (e) IGRC\ninterviews of employees. (1)\n\nFormal\ninterviews with staff members, if necessary to an IGRC investigation, should be\nconducted jointly by an inmate and a staff representative whenever feasible. Employees should be questioned in a diplomatic and non-adversarial\nmanner. (2)\n\nIf inmate\nrepresentatives cannot accompany staff representatives on an investigation\nbecause of security restrictions, and if interviews cannot be conducted in the\ngrievance office or through less formal means (e.g., by telephone), the inmate\nrepresentatives shall provide the staff representatives with the questions they\nwould like answered. The staff representatives shall make every effort to\nobtain answers for the inmate representatives. (f) Code of ethics. (1)\nA code of ethics (see section\n701.11\nof this\n\nPart) for IGRC staff and inmate representatives, clerks, and chairpersons has\nbeen established to strengthen the credibility and effectiveness of the IGP. Violations of this code may result in removal from the IGP. (2)\n\nInmate representatives may be removed\nfrom the committee only in accordance with procedures set forth in section\n701.4\n(c) of this Part. (3)\n\nThe IGP\nsupervisor is responsible for insuring that the full-time and alternate IGRC\nrepresentatives have read, understand and received a copy of the code of\nethics. (g) Time limit\nexceptions and extensions. (1)\n\nTime limit for\nfiling a grievance or appeal: (i) An inmate\nmay request an exception to the time limit for filing a grievance, or for\nfiling an appeal to the superintendent or to CORC. Such a request shall be in\nwriting and shall be submitted to the grievance clerk with the grievance or\nappeal the inmate wishes to file. (a) The IGP\nsupervisor may grant an exception to the time limit for filing a grievance\nbased on mitigating circumstances (e.g., timely attempts to resolve a complaint\ninformally by the inmate, etc.). An exception to the time limit may not be\ngranted if the request was made more than 45 days after an alleged\noccurrence. (b) The IGP supervisor\nmay grant an exception to the time limit for filing an appeal of an IGRC or\nsuperintendent's decision based on mitigating circumstances (e.g., failure to\nimplement action required by the IGRC or superintendent's decision within 45\ndays, etc.). An exception to the time limit may not be granted if the request\nwas made more than 45 days after the date of the decision unless the late\nappeal asserts a failure to implement the decision. (ii)\n\nAn inmate may pursue a complaint that an\nexception to the time limit was denied by filing a separate\ngrievance. (2)\n\nTime\nlimit for IGP action. Time limit extensions may be requested at any level of\nreview (e.g., time limits for holding an IGRC hearing, answering a grievance or\nan appeal, etc.), but such extensions may be granted only with the written\nconsent of the grievant. Absent such extension, matters not decided within the\ntime limits may be appealed to the next step. (h) Processing grievances and appeals after\ntransfer. (1)\n\nAny response to a grievance\nfiled by an inmate who has been transferred shall be mailed directly to that\ninmate, via privileged correspondence, at his/her new facility or\nlocation. (2)\n\nAn inmate transferred\nto another facility may continue an appeal of any grievance. If the grievant\nwishes to appeal, he or she must mail the signed appeal form back to the IGP\nsupervisor at the facility where the grievance was originally filed within\nseven calendar days after receipt. The IGP supervisor will refer it to the\nfacility grievance clerk for processing. (i) Processing grievances pending at release\nor parole. A grievance pending at the time an inmate has been released or\nparoled shall be processed as follows: (1)\n\nIf\nthe IGRC majority determines that the grievance affects other members of the\nfacility population and encompasses an issue that has not been reviewed by CORC\nwithin a year, the IGRC shall provide a recommendation and forward the case to\nthe superintendent for a determination. If the grievance affects only the\ngrievant and encompasses an issue that has been reviewed by CORC within a year, it is subject to dismissal under section\n701.5\n(b)(4)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe\nsuperintendent shall answer any grievance received pursuant to paragraph 1\nabove and any appeal pending at the superintendent's level. The superintendent\nshall make a recommendation in the case of any departmental grievance (as\ndefined in section\n701.5\n[c][3][i]\nof this Part) and forward it to the IGP supervisor. The superintendent shall\nmake a determination in all other cases. (3)\n\nUpon receipt of the superintendent's\nresponse, the IGP supervisor shall forward all case materials to the CORC for a\nfinal disposition. (j) Procedures for transient inmates. Each correctional facility housing a\nreception/classification/transit inmate population must develop and implement a\nwritten procedure insuring all inmates access to the IGP. This procedure must\nbe approved by the director, IGP. (k) File maintenance/confidentiality. (1)\n\nGrievance files will be maintained in a\nspecific area for use by the IGRC and the grievance clerk. No copies of\ngrievance documents may go into the grievant's central file or facility file\nwithout the grievant's direct written consent. Likewise, no copies of grievance\ndocuments may go into an employee's file without the direct written consent of\nthe employee. No grievance documents shall be disseminated to persons other\nthan the grievant, a direct party, or an individual involved in the review\nprocess without the approval of the IGP supervisor. Any requests for grievance\ndocuments by the grievant or any direct party may be addressed through the\n\nFreedom of Information Law (FOIL) as outlined in Part 5 of this\n\nTitle. (2)\n\nThe superintendent is\nresponsible to ensure the confidentiality and maintenance of grievance records. Complete grievance records must include the original grievance, responses from\neach level of review, the investigation, referenced documentation and\nverification of implementation, when appropriate. (3)\n\nGrievance files shall be preserved for\nthe current calendar year, plus the previous four calendar years. (l) IGRC reference materials. The\nIGRC at each facility is responsible for maintaining an up-to-date set of code\n\"A B\" departmental directives and a set of the IGP monthly index of written\nopinions. A copy of the IGP monthly index of written opinions must also be\nmaintained in the facility law library. (m) Emergencies. The IGP supervisor shall\nrefer any grievance of an emergency nature directly to the appropriate response\nlevel (superintendent or CORC) having authority to issue an immediate or\nexpeditious and meaningful response. An emergency shall include, but is not\nlimited to, a situation, action, or condition in which an inmate's or an\nemployee's health, safety, or welfare is in serious threat or danger. The\nsupervisor will determine if a grievance falls within this category. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
