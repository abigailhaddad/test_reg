  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 515.7 - Preparation, preferral and forwarding of charges\n\nState Regulations\n(See chapter 4, FM 27-1, Legal Guide for\n\nCommanders.)\n(a) Preparation of\ncharges. Where a commander determines that non-judicial punishment is\ninadequate, yet the offense does not warrant a general or special\ncourt-martial, a summary court-martial may be utilized. The commander will use\nDMNA form 1050 (Charge Sheet), a sample copy of which is contained in Appendix\nL-2. This form must be prepared in an original and four copies. (1)\n\nWhile a commander is responsible for\npreparation of the charge sheet, there is no legal requirement that he do it\npersonally. The preparation of the charge sheet is a critical function of the\ncommander. Whenever possible, the commander will seek the assistance of a judge\nadvocate officer. Once the charges and specifications have been prepared and\nsigned under oath, they are a public record and should not be altered except on\nthe advice of a judge advocate. (2)\n\nThe accuser (i.e., the person who believes that the charges and specifications\nare true) will sign in Part III, DMNA form 1050. While the accuser is usually\nthe commander, it may be any person subject to the State Military Law. A\nsuperior authority may not order anyone to act as an accuser. The signing of\nthe charge sheet must be made before a commissioned officer authorized to take\noaths (see Military Law, section 131.2). The accuser must take the\noath. (3)\n\nThe next step in the\nprocess; i.e., preferral of the charges against the accused, requires that the\ncommander or his or her representative read the charges and specifications to\nthe accused. The commander or commander's representative will then complete\n\nPart III, paragraph 12, DMNA form 1050. (4)\n\nThe commander or his or her designated\nrepresentative will next forward the charge sheet and all allied information as\nwell as exhibits to the commander exercising summary court jurisdiction (see\nsubdivision [b] of this section). (b) Forwarding and referral of charges. (1)\n\nLetter of transmittal. A letter of\ntransmittal is used to forward the charge sheet and allied information to the\ncourt-martial convening authority (see Appendix L-2 [A12]). This letter\ncontains information about the accused and the commander's specific\nrecommendations for disposition of the charges. The commander must personally\nsign the letter of transmittal and attach one copy to each set of the charge\nsheet and allied material. When making a recommendation for the disposition of\nthe charges, the commander should consider the nature of the offenses, the\npersonal history of the accused, and whether the accused should be eliminated\nfrom the service. After considering these matters, the company commander should\nrelate the punishment to the type of court-martial which may impose it. The\ncommander must keep in mind that charges against an accused should be tried by\nthe lowest court which has power to adjudge an appropriate and adequate\npunishment. (2)\n\nAllied papers. Military Police or CID reports of investigation, if available, should be\nforwarded with the charges. If these investigation reports are not completed\nwhen the company commander is ready to forward the charges, the charges should\nbe forwarded with a statement saying that the reports will follow when they\nbecome available. Initial and interim reports received by the commander may be\nforwarded with the charge sheet. Under no circumstances should a commander\ndelay the forwarding of charges until completion of the final CID or Military\n\nPolice report. (3)\n\nWitness\nstatements. All available witness statements should be forwarded with the\ncharge sheet. Witness statements and summaries of expected testimony may be\nsworn or unsworn. While in most cases it is best to attach written statements\nfrom all available witnesses, it is not necessary to delay forwarding the\ncharges to obtain them. Handwritten statements may be attached to the charges\nif the typing will cause unnecessary delay. (4)\n\nAvailable documentary evidence. In order\nto safeguard documentary evidence, originals should not be forwarded with the\ncharge sheet. It is sufficient to forward copies of the documents. For example, if the case is based on a forged check, it would be unwise to forward the\noriginal and risk its loss in transmittal. (5)\n\nExtracts of military records of previous\nconvictions (DD form 493). This document is prepared by the personnel officer\nat the request of the company commander and should be forwarded with the\ncharges. (6)\n\nPersonal evaluation\nsheet. The personal evaluation sheet, a local form, contains information\nconcerning the accused's military record and the company commander's evaluation\nof the accused's conduct and efficiency. (7)\n\nTime limits. The prompt disposition of\ncharges is essential to our system of military justice. An unexplained delay in\nthe processing of charges at any stage may result in the dismissal of charges. When a question concerning a delay is brought up at trial, the burden is on the\n\nState to justify the delay and show that it was not intentional or due to an\noppressive design or neglect on the part of the command. The period of time for\nwhich the State is accountable starts when the accused is placed in restraint\nor when charges have been preferred. (8)\n\nAt any stage of the proceedings, the\ncompany commander should call a judge advocate for advice if there are any\nquestions or doubts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
