  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 346.9 - Tax refund offset process\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe SCU shall administer the process established by the\n\nState Office of Child Support Enforcement (State OCSE) pursuant to section\n111-b\nof\nthe Social Services Law, for the purpose of satisfying past-due child support\nobligations through the offset of Federal income tax refunds, New York State\nincome tax refunds and city income/earnings tax refunds due as a result of\noverpayments made to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and/or New York State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. (a) Eligible cases. The following cases are\neligible for the tax refund offset process if the court order is payable to the\nSCU and the tax refund offset criteria established by the State OSCE have been\nmet: (1)\n\nAid to Dependent Children (ADC) and\n\nFoster Care (FC) maintenance cases in which court-ordered past-due support is\nowed to local social services districts and the State. (2)\n\nNon-ADC cases in which court-ordered\npast-due child support is owed to persons who are receiving child support\nservices under section\n111-g\nof\nthe Social Services Law and section\n347.17\nof this Title. (b) Pre-offset notice to\nrespondents. Written notice that a tax refund offset certification of the\nrespondent's liability for past due child support will be submitted to the\n\nFederal Office of Child Support Enforcement and to New York State Department of\n\nTaxation and Finance shall be given to a respondent no later than 30 days prior\nto certification to the Federal Office of Child Support Enforcement or to State\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance. The notice shall advise the respondent that\nreview of the proposed certification must be requested, in writing, within 30\ndays of the date of the notice and shall include a list of the available\ndefenses and other information set forth below, and the manner in which a\nreview of the proposed certification based on such defenses may be obtained: (1)\n\nDefenses. Defenses include, but are not\nlimited to: (i) The person receiving notice\nof proposed tax refund offset is not the person identified as owing child\nsupport. (ii)\nA court order of\nsupport does not exist or has been vacated by the court. (iii)\n\nThe amount claimed by the SCU to be\nowed is incorrect because a payment which was made was not credited or the\nbalance due was not accurately computed, or the weekly/monthly amount due or\narrears balance is incorrect or was changed as a result of a modification of\nthe court order. (iv)\n\nThe proposed\ntax refund offset is the result of a failure to make court-ordered periodic\npayments toward an arrears amount established by a court order of support made\nbefore September 1, 1984, and the respondent was not, at any time after\n\nSeptember 1, 1984, delinquent in making such periodic payments. (v) The proposed tax refund offset is for an\narrears amount established by a court order of support made on or after\n\nSeptember 1, 1984, which includes a finding that any anticipated tax refunds\npursuant to the most recently filed State and Federal tax returns have been\nconsidered by the court and taken into account in determining the amount of\nperiodic payments to be made toward the arrears amount, or in determining the\namount of the current support order, and expressly provides that such arrears\nare not to be certified for tax refund offset. A defense under this clause will\nnot preclude tax refund offset for delinquencies in the making of periodic\npayments toward an arrears amount. (2)\n\nOther information. The written notice to\nthe respondent, or billing statement attached thereto, must also include the\nfollowing statements: (i) The SCU records\nindicate that you are overdue in making scheduled child support payments and/or\nhave an unpaid balance on court-ordered child support arrears collectible\nthrough the tax refund offset process. (ii)\n\nThe amount of the unpaid child support\npayments and/or arrearages is collectible through the tax refund offset\nprocess. (iii)\n\nFederal and State\nlaws permit the withholding of Federal and State income tax refunds and city\nincome/earnings tax refunds. (iv)\n\nYour name will be certified for the offset of Federal, State or city tax\nrefunds, if the child support arrears are not paid by a stated date. (v) Your tax refunds cannot be held, if the\narrears have been paid or are not owed. (vi)\n\nIn order to obtain a review of your\ncase, you must contact the SCU through the name, telephone number and address\nprovided in this notice and comply with any requests for information. (vii)\n\nIn the process of review of a proposed\ncertification, you may be represented by an attorney or other person. (viii)\n\nPrior to submitting any written\ndocumentation or appearing at any scheduled conference, you or your\nrepresentative may review SCU payment records relating to the proposed\ncertification and obtain a copy thereof. (ix)\n\nIn the process of review of a proposed\ncertification, you may submit written documentation in support of the alleged\ndefense(s), including your written explanation of why offset should not occur\nand you may request a conference with the SCU to present written and oral\nevidence supporting the alleged defense(s). (x) The decision of the SCU will be based\nsolely upon consideration of the SCU records, any written documentation\nsubmitted by you and any written and oral evidence presented at the conference\nwhich you requested. The written decision of the SCU will be the final\nadministrative determination. (xi)\n\nUpon the making of a final administrative determination that tax refund offset\nshould not occur, wholly or in part, the SCU will adjust the certification. In\nthe event the offset has already occurred, the SCU will repay you for amounts\nwhich were improperly offset. (xii)\n\nUpon receipt of the final administrative determination, you may seek judicial\nreview of the determination pursuant to article 78 of the Civil Practice Law\nand Rules within the time limits provided in law. (3)\n\nIn addition, the written notice or\nbilling statement will advise the respondent of: (i) the identity, business address and\ntelephone number of any employee of the SCU who may be contacted by him/her\nwith respect to review of the proposed certification or with respect to payment\nof support liability; (ii)\nthe\nexact amount of past-due support; and\n(iii)\nthe right to petition the appropriate\ncourt for a modification, because of a change in circumstances, of the terms of\nthe support order, including amount of support and payment of arrears, and may\nsimilarly seek enforcement of visitation rights. (c) SCU administrative review. When a respondent who has been certified for the tax refund offset process\nbelieves that there is a defense(s) against such offset and requests a review\nby the SCU which made the certification, the SCU shall conduct the review in\nthe following manner: (1)\n\nThe SCU shall\nreview its records relating to the respondent to determine whether any evidence\nexists for the alleged defense(s) or whether any other error was\nmade. (2)\n\nThe SCU shall accept and\nreview any written documentation from the respondent which may support the\nalleged defense(s), including a written explanation by the respondent of why\noffset should not occur, if the respondent chooses to offer such a written\nexplanation. (3)\n\nIf the respondent\nrequests a conference with the SCU, the SCU shall promptly schedule a\nconference at which the respondent may present written and oral evidence\nsupporting the alleged defense(s). (4)\n\nThe SCU shall render a written decision\nstating express findings of fact, the reason for its decision and the action\nrequired by the SCU, if any. Such decision shall be the final administrative\ndetermination and shall be based solely upon consideration of the SCU records, and any written and oral evidence presented at the conference. (5)\n\nThe SCU shall promptly send a copy of the\ndecision to the respondent with a statement of the respondent's right of review\nunder article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules and of the statute of\nlimitation applicable thereto. (6)\n\nIf the written decision of the SCU requires the total or partial deletion of\nthe amount of past-due support certified, the SCU shall immediately initiate\nsuch actions as are necessary to accomplish that result. If the tax refund\noffset has already occurred, the SCU will repay the respondent for amounts\nwhich are offset. (d) Notice to non-ADC clients. In a non-ADC case, prior to disbursing any part of\nthe refund to the custodial parent, the local SCU must inform the non-ADC\ncustodial parent, in advance, if the local district will use any Federal tax\nrefund offset amount to satisfy any unpaid past-due support owed to the social\nservices district and the State. (e) Distribution of tax refund offsets. Any\nand all monies received by the department as a result of certifications made to\nthe United States Department of Health and Human Services and/or to the New\n\nYork State Department of Taxation and Finance pursuant to this Part and section\n171-c of the New York Tax Law shall be distributed in accordance with\nparagraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nFederal tax offsets. Federal tax offsets\nshall be disbursed as follows: (i) Single\ncertifications. If a respondent is certified for a single case, the entire\namount offset shall be disbursed for the case for which the respondent was\ncertified. (ii)\n\nMultiple\ncertifications. If a respondent is certified for two or more cases, each case\nwill receive a pro rata share of the total amount offset, based on the amount\nof past-due support owed to that particular case as a percentage of the total\npast-due liability certified for the particular respondent. In all instances, past-due support owed in ADC and FC cases will be satisfied in full prior to\nany disbursement to a non-ADC case. (2)\n\nState tax offsets. State tax offsets\nshall be distributed as follows: (i) Single\ncertifications. If a respondent is certified for a single case, the entire\namount offset shall be disbursed for the case for which the respondent was\ncertified. (ii)\n\nMultiple\ncertifications. If a respondent is certified for two or more cases pursuant to\nthis section, or in combination with Part 345 of this Title, the amount offset\nshall be prorated among all cases included in the certification. Each pro rata\nshare shall be equal to the amount of past-due support owed to the particular\ncase as a percentage of the total past-due liability certified for the\nparticular respondent. (3)\n\nTransmittal. Disbursements under this\nsection to non-ADC clients shall be accompanied by a transmittal letter\nexplaining whether the amount disbursed is from Federal or State offset, and\nwhether it represents a pro rata share or the total amount offset. In cases\ninvolving prorated shares, individual non-ADC recipients of each share are not\nentitled to know the identity of any other recipient of a prorated share of the\ntotal amount offset.
