  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 36.1 - Statement of philosophy\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe long-term rehabilitation of mentally disabled persons\nis promoted by maintenance of relationships with other persons and agencies in\nthe community, avoidance of institutionalization, and minimization of\ndisruption of life rhythms. The civil rights of mentally disabled persons\nrequire that such persons be treated and served in the least restrictive\nsetting possible in which treatment or service goals can be met. Therefore, periods of inpatient service should be as short as possible in accordance with\nthe individual patient's plan of care and treatment. This philosophy will, in\nmany cases, require continued service to a patient on an outpatient basis at\nthe conclusion of inpatient service. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n36.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
