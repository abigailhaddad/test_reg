  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 577.8 - Standards for the review of rivers projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General rule. Rivers projects shall be reviewed according to the\nstandards set forth in this Part. Rivers projects which are class A or class B\nregional projects or wetland projects shall also be subject to the standards in\n\nParts 574 and 578 of this Title. (b) Standards applicable to all rivers\nprojects. The agency shall not issue a permit for any rivers project\nunless it shall determine that: (1)\nthe project would be consistent with the purposes and policies of the Wild, Scenic and Recreational Rivers System Act; (2)\nthe project would comply with the\napplicable restrictions and standards of section\n577.6\nof this Part; (3)\nthe project would not cause an undue\nadverse impact upon the natural, scenic, aesthetic, ecological, botanical, fish\nand wildlife, historic, cultural, archeological, scientific, recreational or\nopen space resources of the river area, taking into account the commercial, industrial, residential, recreational or other benefits that might be derived\nfrom the project. In making this determination, the agency shall consider those\nfactors contained in the development considerations of the land use and\ndevelopment plan which are pertinent to the project. (c) Specific standards applicable to\ncertain rivers projects. The agency shall not issue a rivers system permit for the\nfollowing rivers projects unless it shall determine that the following specific\ncriteria are met: (1)\n\nThe harvesting, cutting, culling, removal or other disturbance of timber or other vegetation\ninside the mean high water mark of the river or within 100 feet of the mean\nhigh water mark is: (i) for compelling\npurposes as would be consistent with recognized sound forestry or agricultural\npractices; or\n(ii)\nin recreational\nriver areas, selected and dispersed cutting of vegetation to the extent\nnecessary to create a view of the river from any new structure or from any\nlawfully existing structure lacking such a view. (2)\n\nNew public or private roads, wood roads\nand trails for motorized open space recreation uses will be so located and\nconstructed as to minimize visibility from the river, minimize alteration of\nthe natural environment, will be reasonable and necessary, and will be\neffectively restricted to those uses specified by the applicant. Within scenic\nriver areas, public roads, or private roads open to the general public, shall\nbe permitted if such road: (i) affords access\nto a part of the river area which is at least two miles from an existing road\nopen to the general public, and located on the same side of the river in the\nriver area; and\n(ii)\nwill be\nsubstantially invisible from the river. If there is no other vehicular access to a land use or\ndevelopment within a scenic river area, a new private road shall be\npermitted. (3)\n\nNew\ndocks or boathouses will not impede the natural flow of the river, and will be\nso located and constructed as to minimize intrusion into the water\nbody. (4)\n\nNew subdivisions in which\nthe intended use of any resulting lot, parcel or site is a single family\ndwelling or individual mobile home, or which otherwise involves the\nconstruction of principal buildings, will: (i) meet the following applicable minimum lot\nwidths, unless clustering is employed pursuant to paragraph (5) of this\nsubdivision: MINIMUM SHORELINE LOT WIDTHS (linear feet per\nprincipal building)\n\nLand use\narea\n\nScenic river\nareas\n\nRecreational river\nareas\n\nModerate intensity use\n100*\n100*\nLow intensity use\n150\n150\n\nRural use\n200\n200\n\nResource management\n750\n300\n\nIndustrial use\n\nNo minimum*\nNo minimum*\n* The same as those mandated by the land\nuse and development plan. (ii)\nbe consistent with the overall intensity\nguidelines of the land use and development plan, applied pursuant to section\n809(10)(c) of the Adirondack Park Agency Act and section\n574.7\nof these regulations, except\nthat in scenic river areas lands otherwise includible in the calculation which\nare more than one-half mile distant from the river shall not be included in\nsuch calculation. This subparagraph shall not apply to subdivisions in scenic\nand recreational river areas effected by bona fide gift, devise or inheritance\nwhere the donor owned the land involved as of April 19, 1976 and the donee is a\nmember of his immediate family. The minimum lot size of such subdivisions shall\nbe: in low intensity use areas, 50,000 square feet; in rural use areas, 80,000\nsquare feet; and in resource management areas, 160,000 square\nfeet. (5)\n\nNew\nsubdivisions involving shoreline clustering will have an average shoreline\nwidth of lots, parcels or sites equal to or exceeding the applicable minimum\nshoreline lot width requirement of paragraph (4) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nNew subdivisions in wild river areas are\nintended only for purposes of forest management or nonmotorized open space\nrecreation use. (7)\n\nModifications\nor disturbances of the course, bed or banks of recreational rivers or\nexcavation or placement of fill in recreational rivers will meet the applicable\ncriteria of the Wild, Scenic and Recreational Rivers System Act and of article\n15, title 5, of the Environmental Conservation Law.
