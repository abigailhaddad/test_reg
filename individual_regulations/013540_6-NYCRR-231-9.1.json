Tit. 6 §§ 231-9.1 - General provisions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Upon\nrequest of an applicant, the department shall establish a PAL at an existing\nmajor facility, provided that at a minimum, the following provisions are met: (1)\nthe PAL must impose a facility-wide\nannual emission limitation in tpy that is included in the Part 201 permit for\nthe facility; (i) for each month during the\nPAL effective period after the first 12 months following the PAL effective\ndate, the facility must show that the sum of the monthly emissions from each\nemission source under the PAL for the previous 12 consecutive months is less\nthan the PAL (a 12-month total rolled monthly); and\n(ii)\nfor each month during the first 11\nmonths following the PAL effective date, the facility must demonstrate that the\nsum of the preceding monthly emissions from the PAL effective date for each\nemission source under the PAL is less than the PAL; (2)\nthe PAL must include fugitive emissions, to the extent quantifiable, from all emission sources that emit or have the\npotential to emit the PAL contaminant; (3)\neach PAL shall establish an emission\nlimit for only one PAL contaminant; (4)\neach PAL shall have a PAL effective\nperiod as defined in section\n231-4.1\nof this Part; and\n(5)\nat no time (during or after the PAL\neffective period) are emissions reductions of a PAL contaminant that occur\nduring the PAL effective period creditable as decreases for purposes of\nestablishing emission offsets under this Part unless the level of the PAL is\nreduced by the amount of such emissions reductions and such reductions would be\ncreditable in the absence of the PAL. (b) Any physical change or change in the\nmethod of operation of a major facility that maintains its total facility wide\nemissions below the PAL level, and is otherwise consistent with the\nrequirements of this Subpart, will not be considered a NSR major modification\nfor the PAL contaminant and is not subject to this Part. (c) A facility must continue to comply with\nall applicable requirements, including any terms and conditions of the\nfacility's Part 201 permit that were in effect prior to the effective date of\nthe PAL.
