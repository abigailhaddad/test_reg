(b) The\nuse of prone restraints shall not be permitted in a limited secure\nfacility. (c) There must be an\nindividualized treatment or behavior support plan for each youth in care that\naddresses permissible and precluded means of restraint, taking into\nconsideration the medical, psychological and developmental conditions and needs\nof the youth. Staff responsible for the care of the youth must be provided with\ninformation on the permissible restraints for each youth and the reasons for\nany limitations in the type of restraints that may be used for each youth. The\nindividualized treatment or behavior support plan must be updated and revised\nwhenever there is any significant change in the physical, psychological or\ndevelopmental condition of the youth. (d) Mechanical restraints may be used in\nlimited secure facilities in accordance with the provisions of this section if\nsuch use is part of the facility's restraint policy which has been approved\npursuant to section\n441.17\nof this Title. Seat belts, shoulder harnesses or wheelchair locks used in vehicular transportation shall\nnot be considered types of mechanical restraint. (1)\n\nThe permissible uses of mechanical\nrestraints in limited secure facilities shall consist solely of handcuffs and\nfootcuffs and may only be used by staff who have been appropriately trained in\nthe use of such restraints. Handcuffs and footcuffs must be of a size\nappropriate for the youth on whom they are used. (2)\n\nMechanical restraints may be used on a\nyouth only if there has been a prior individualized assessment that has found\nthat the use of mechanical restraints is permissible for that youth. Any\nlimitations or prohibitions on the use of mechanical restraints for a youth\nmust be followed by staff. (3)\n\nMechanical restraints may be used on a youth inside a limited secure facility\nonly if, after all appropriate pro-active, non-physical behavior management\ntechniques followed by all less restrictive physical behavior management\ntechniques have been tried and failed, the youth continues to be out of control\nand presents a serious and evident danger to him or herself or others. Mechanical restraints must be removed as soon as the youth is sufficiently\nunder control so that the youth can be managed safely using other less\nrestrictive, approved methods. Mechanical restraints may be used to transport a\nyouth from a limited secure facility to court or other outside activities if an\nindividualized assessment conducted at the time of the transport determines\nthat the youth presents a clear danger to public safety or to him or\nherself. (4)\n\nStaff must provide\nconstant, direct, visual supervision of any youth in mechanical restraints for\nthe protection of the youth's safety, to evaluate that the youth is properly\nrestrained, and to determine the continued need for the use of mechanical\nrestraints. (5)\n\nIn no case may a\nyouth be handcuffed or footcuffed to any object. (6)\n\nHandcuffs and footcuffs may not be\nattached to each other. (7)\n\nUse of\nmechanical restraints for a youth must be initially authorized by the director\nof the facility or a person designated by the director. The authorization must\nbe obtained prior to the use of mechanical restraints and re-authorized\nthroughout the use of the restraints at specified intervals as set forth in the\nfacility's restraint policy. (8)\n\nStaff must be aware of, and follow, all therapeutic and medical restrictions\nfor individual youth as they pertain to the use of mechanical\nrestraints. (9)\n\nAt least one staff\nmember with a key to the mechanical restraints must be on the scene at all\ntimes when mechanical restraints are being used until the restraints are\nremoved. (10)\n\nAny injuries or\nhealth concerns found or observed by staff and any health concerns expressed by\nyouth after any use of mechanical restraint must be addressed\nappropriately. (e) Room\nisolation, as defined in section\n441.17\nof this Title, may be used\nin limited secure facilities in accordance with the provisions of this section, if such use has been approved in writing by the office as part of an authorized\nagency's restraint policy. Room isolation means confinement of a youth in a\nbedroom or other room specifically designed and designated for such use to calm\nand control acute physical behavior of that youth which presents an immediate\nrisk of physical injury to the youth or others or of escape from the facility\nor from custody. (1)\n\nRoom isolation may be\nused only after less restrictive interventions have been exhausted and found to\nbe ineffective. It may only be used for the least amount of time necessary for\nthe youth to regain self-control. (2)\n\nRoom isolation shall not be used for\nyouth who are on special supervision status for suicide, have significant\nintellectual or developmental disabilities, or have a seizure\ndisorder. (3)\n\nThe approval of the\nfacility director or designee must be obtained prior to placing a youth in room\nisolation unless the facility staff determines that immediate room isolation is\nnecessary for safety reasons. In such cases, the facility director or designee\nmust be notified as soon as possible, but no later than 15 minutes, after room\nisolation begins. Absent a showing of necessity, the duration of room isolation\nshall not be continued beyond two hours. Authorization for continuing room\nisolation must be obtained at least every two hours. (4)\n\nEach isolated youth shall have access to\nbathroom and toilet facilities. (5)\n\nEach isolated youth shall receive meals and fluids on the same schedule as\nyouth in the regular program. (6)\n\nAs soon as practicable after the commencement of room isolation, each isolated\nyouth must be seen by medical or clinical staff to determine whether the youth\nhas any known injury or medical condition requiring removal from room\nisolation. If such staff are unavailable, the shift supervisor shall determine\nwhether on-call medical personnel need to be contacted. (7)\n\nAt least one staff person must be\npositioned in a manner that enables the staff person to hear the youth should\nthe youth request assistance. Staff must visually observe the youth at least\nevery 15 minutes and shall vary the check-in times so that they are not\npredictable to the youth. At least every 15 minutes, staff must attempt to\nengage the youth in a release strategy in a manner consistent with the youth's\nbehavior services plan. (8)\n\nEach\nroom used for isolation shall be heated, lighted and ventilated as any other\nroom in the facility. An isolation room shall have: (i) a door that locks from the outside and\nthat has an observation window made of unbreakable material that allows a total\nview of the room; (ii)\nno exposed\nelectrical outlets; (iii)\nsufficient wall construction to withstand attacks from a violent youth of\nreasonable height and weight; and\n(iv)\nnormal bedroom furnishings unless the\nfacility director or designee has determined that some or all of the\nfurnishings must be removed for safety reasons. (9)\n\nEach facility shall maintain daily\nrecords regarding youth who are placed in locked isolation rooms including the\nname and age of each youth, the duration of each isolation, the reasons for\nusing isolation, the individual who approved the isolation, the methods of\nintervention that were tried and proved unsuccessful, the steps that were taken\nto reduce the amount of time the youth was in isolation, and attempts to\ncontact the parent/guardian of each youth. (f) Any use of restraints must be recorded\nand reported in the manner and format required by the office. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
