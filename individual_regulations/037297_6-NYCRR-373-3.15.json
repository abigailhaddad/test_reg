  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 373-3.15 - Incinerators\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nThe\nregulations in this section apply to owners and operators of hazardous waste\nincinerators (as defined in section\n370.2\n[b]\nof this\n\nTitle), except as section\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart provides otherwise. (2)\n\nAdditional regulations governing construction and operation of incinerators for\npurposes of air pollution control are set forth in Parts 200, 201, 212, 219, 225, 227 and 257 of this Title. (3)\n\nIntegration of the MACT standards. (i) except\nas set forth in subparagraphs (ii) through (iii) of this paragraph, the\nrequirements of this Subpart do not apply to a hazardous waste incineration\nunit when the owner or operator demonstrates compliance with the maximum\nachievable control technology (MACT) requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart\nEEE, as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title, by conducting a comprehensive performance test and submitting to\nthe department a Notification of Compliance under\n40 CFR sections\n63.1207(j)\nand\n63.1210(d)\nof subpart EEE documenting compliance with the requirements of 40 CFR part\n63, subpart EEE as incorporated by reference and implemented by section\n200.10\n(a) and (d)\nof this Title. (ii)\nthe MACT\nstandards do not replace the requirements of subdivision (e) of this section\nand the applicable requirements of sections\n373-3.1\n\"\"373-3.8, 373-3.28\"\"373-3.29 of this Subpart. (iii)\nthe requirements of section\n373-3.15\n(c) of\nthis Subpart generally prohibiting burning of hazardous waste during startup\nand shutdown remain in effect if the owner or operator elects to comply with\nsection\n373-1.12\n(a)(2)(i)\n(\na\n) of this Part to minimize emissions of toxic compounds from\nstartup and shutdown. (4)\n\nOwners and operators of incinerators\nburning hazardous waste are exempt from all of the requirements of this\nsection, except subdivision (e) (Closure), provided that the owner or operator\nhas documented, in writing, that the waste would not reasonably be expected to\ncontain any of the hazardous constituents listed in Appendix 23 of this Title, and such documentation is retained at the facility, if the waste to be burned\nis: (i) listed as a hazardous waste in\nsection\n371.4\nof this Title solely because\nit is ignitable (Hazard Code I), corrosive (Hazard Code C), or both; or\n(ii)\nlisted as a hazardous waste\nin section\n371.4\nof this Title solely because\nit is reactive (Hazard Code R) for characteristics other than those listed in\nsection\n371.3\n(d)(1)(iv) and\n(v) of this Title, and will not be burned\nwhen other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion zone; or\n(iii)\na hazardous waste solely because it\npossesses the characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, or both, as\ndetermined by the tests for characteristics of hazardous wastes under section\n371.3\nof this Title; or\n(iv)\na hazardous waste solely because it\npossesses any of the reactivity characteristics described by section\n371.3\n(d)(1)(i)-(iii), (vi)-(viii)\nof this Title, and will not be\nburned when other hazardous wastes are present in the combustion\nzone. (b) Waste analysis. In addition to the waste analyses required by section\n373-3.2\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must sufficiently analyze any waste which has\nnot previously been burned in the incinerator to enable the owner or operator\nto establish steady state (normal) operating conditions (including waste and\nauxiliary fuel feed and air flow) and to determine the type of pollutants which\nmight be emitted. At a minimum, the analysis must determine: (1)\nheating value of the waste; (2)\nhalogen content and sulfur content in the\nwaste; and\n(3)\nconcentrations in\nthe waste of lead and mercury, unless the owner or operator has written, documented data that show that the element is not present. Note: As required by section\n373-3.5\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart, the owner or operator must place the results from each waste analysis, or the documented information, in the operating record of the\nfacility. (c) General operating requirements. During start-up and shutdown of an incinerator, the owner\nor operator must not feed hazardous waste unless the incinerator is at steady\nstate (normal) conditions of operation, including steady state operating\ntemperature and air flow. (d) Monitoring and inspections. The owner or operator must conduct, as a minimum, the\nfollowing monitoring and inspections when incinerating hazardous waste: (1)\n\nExisting instruments which relate to\ncombustion and emission control must be monitored at least every 15 minutes. Appropriate corrections to maintain steady state combustion conditions must be\nmade immediately, either automatically or by the operator. Instruments which\nrelate to combustion and emission control would normally include those\nmeasuring waste feed, auxiliary fuel feed, air flow, incinerator, temperature, scrubber flow, scrubber pH, and relevant level controls. (2)\n\nThe complete incinerator and associated\nequipment (pumps, valves, conveyors, pipes, etc.) must be inspected at least\ndaily for leaks, spills and fugitive emissions, and all emergency shutdown\ncontrols and system alarms must be checked to assure proper\noperation. (e) Closure. At closure, the owner or operator must remove all\nhazardous waste and hazardous waste residues (including but not limited to ash, scrubber waters and scrubber sludges) from the incinerator. Note: At closure, as throughout the operating period, unless\nthe owner or operator can demonstrate, in accordance with section\n371.1\n(d)(4)\nof\nthis Title, that the residue removed from the incinerator is not a hazardous\nwaste, the owner or operator becomes a generator of hazardous waste and must\nmanage it in accordance with all applicable requirements of Parts 370 through\n376 of this Title. (f) Standards for particular hazardous wastes. (1)\n\nOwners or operators of incinerators\nsubject to this section may burn EPA hazardous waste F020, F021, F022, F023, F026 or F027 if they receive a certification from the commissioner that they\ncan meet the performance standards of section\n373-2.15\nof this Part when they\nburn the wastes. (2)\n\nIn addition to\nthe requirements of Part 621 of this Title, the following standards and\nprocedures will be used in determining whether to certify an incinerator: (i) The owner or operator must submit an\napplication to the commissioner containing applicable information in sections\n373-1.5\n(f) and\n373-1.9\n(a) of this\n\nPart demonstrating that the incinerator can meet the performance standards in\nsection\n373-2.15\nof this Part when they\nburn the wastes. (ii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner will issue a tentative decision whether the incinerator can meet\nthe performance standards in section\n373-2.15\nof this Part. Notification\nof this tentative decision will be provided by a newspaper advertisement and\nradio broadcast in the jurisdiction where the incinerator is located. The\ncommissioner will accept comment on the tentative decision for 60 days. The\ncommissioner also may hold a public hearing upon request or at his or her\ndiscretion. (iii)\n\nAfter the close\nof the public comment period, the commissioner will issue a decision whether or\nnot to certify the incinerator. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
