Central office approval for any long-term temporary release\nprogram also implies approval for all other temporary release programs at the\ndiscretion of the temporary release committee and the facility superintendent. No out-of-state continuous temporary release applications will be\napproved. (a) A\nwork release\nprogram\nis a continuous temporary release program under which approved\ninmates may be granted the privilege of leaving the premises of certain\ncorrectional facilities for a period not exceeding 14 hours in any day for the\npurpose of on-the-job training or employment, or for any matter necessary to\nthe furtherance of any such purpose. In order for an inmate to be approved for\nparticipation in a work release program, he must, in addition to the previously\nmentioned criteria in this manual, be physically, mentally and emotionally\ncapable of seeking and maintaining steady, gainful employment. (b) Educational release program. (1)\n\nAn\neducational release\nprogram\nis a continuous temporary release program offered at certain\ncorrectional facilities under which eligible and approved inmates may be\ngranted the privilege of leaving the premises of a correctional institution for\na period not exceeding 14 hours in any day for the purpose of educational or\nvocational training, or for any matter necessary to the furtherance of any such\npurpose. In order for an inmate to be approved to participate in an educational\nrelease program, he must meet the criteria previously mentioned in this manual. Further, if the inmate is proposing an educational release program to pursue an\nacademic (as opposed to a vocational) program of study in the New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester or Rockland County area, he must, prior to\nsubmitting his application for educational release, have: (i) completed six credit hours of college\nlevel study; (ii)\nsubmitted an\napplication for admission to a program of study at an accredited college or\nuniversity in that area which has agreed to maintain a record of the inmate's\nclass attendance as specified in section\n852.3 of the Correction Law; and\n(iii)\nsubmitted his temporary\nrelease application to his facility's temporary release committee by the first\nweek in July for the fall semester, the first week in November for the spring\nsemester, or by the first week of April for the summer semester. (2)\n\nInmates who are approved to\nparticipate in an educational release program and are transferred to a\ncorrectional facility in New York City in order to take part in such a program, but whose applications for admission are later rejected by their college or\nuniversity, shall be considered approved to participate in the work release\nprogram provided that they are physically capable of maintaining steady, gainful employment. (3)\n\nHowever, if\nthe inmate is proposing an educational release program from an upstate\ncorrectional facility, or if he is proposing a vocational training educational\nrelease program at any correctional facility either upstate or in the New York\n\nCity metropolitan area, he is not required to have first completed six credit\nhours of college level study prior to submitting an application for educational\nrelease. Nevertheless, the inmate must still have submitted an application for\nadmission at a school which agrees to maintain a record of his class attendance\nand must file his application by the dates stated above. (c) A\ncommunity services\nleave\nprogram is a continuous temporary release program offered at\ncertain correctional institutions under which eligible and approved inmates may\nbe granted the privilege of leaving the premises of a correctional institution\nfor a period not exceeding 14 hours in any day for the purpose of participating\nin volunteer or community service work projects. In order for an inmate to be\napproved to participate in a continuous community services leave program (as\nopposed to a one-day community services leave program) an inmate must, in\naddition to other criteria previously mentioned in this manual, score a minimum\nof 32 points in the point- scoring system for temporary release\napplicants. (d) An\nindustrial training leave\nprogram is a continuous temporary\nrelease program offered at certain correctional institutions under which\neligible and approved inmates may be granted the privilege of leaving the\npremises of a correctional institution on a daily basis for a period not\nexceeding 14 hours in any day for the purpose of participating in an industrial\ntraining leave program under which an inmate will be assigned to the\nsupervision of a Federal, State, county or local government employee who is not\na correction officer, and be permitted to assist such governmental employees in\nperforming their job assignments.
