  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 34.3 - Reporting motor vehicle liability insurance notices (transactions)\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An insurance\ncompany or servicing agent shall comply with the following requirements when\nreporting motor vehicle liability insurance notices: (1)\n\nInitial load (LOD). A one time\nnotification of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage in the form of a\ntransfer of an insurance company's book of business for all insured vehicles\nregistered in New York State. An additional notification is permitted to\ntransfer an insurance company's book of business for composite rated vehicles\nregistered in New York State. The effective date provided with an initial load\ntransaction shall be the actual policy effective date reflective of the last\npolicy level activity, e.g., issuance, reinstatement or renewal. (2)\n\nNew business (NBS). A notification or\nconfirmation of motor vehicle liability insurance coverage. Notices shall be\nsubmitted for the following business events: policy issuance (every vehicle\ncovered under the policy at the time of issuance); vehicle(s) added to an in\nforce policy; replacement vehicle(s) added to an in force policy; vehicle(s)\nmoved to another insurer within an insurance company group; renewal of a for\nhire policy (all for hire vehicles only); and confirmation of insurance in\nresponse to a DMV initiated mandatory verification (MVF) transaction. Note: NBS notices shall be reprocessed (matching retried)\nby DMV as described in section\n34.9\n(d) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nReinstatement\n(REI). A notification that motor liability insurance coverage has been\nreinstated or restored. A notification to rescind an erroneous cancellation\n(XLC) notice. The REI effective date is compared to the previously submitted\nXLC cancellation effective date to determine if there is any a lapse of\ncoverage. Note:A cancellation (except FH) shall be reported to DMV\nwithin 30 days of the cancellation effective date but only after any insurance\ncompany provided grace period for receipt of late payment has expired. It shall\nnot be an insurance company's or servicing agent's practice to report\ncancellation notices without regard to any subsequent volume of reinstatement\nnotices. In other words, cancellation notices reported one week shall not\nresult in a high percentage of reinstatement notices reported the next week. Such practice is not permitted since it will result in multiple unnecessary\nletters to policyholder registrants. The number of reinstatement notices\nsubmitted shall represent a small percentage of the number of cancellation\nnotices submitted. (4)\n\nCancellation (XLC). A notification that motor vehicle liability insurance\ncoverage has been canceled, terminated or suspended, whether initiated by the\ninsurance company or insured. Notices shall be submitted for the following\nbusiness events: policy cancellation or non-renewal (every vehicle covered by\nthe policy at the time of cancellation or non-renewal); vehicle dropped without\nreplacement from an in force policy; liability insurance suspended on a vehicle\nthat remains on an in force policy; and cancellation response to a DMV\ninitiated negative verification (NVF) transaction. (5)\n\nNo insurance (NIS). A repudiation of\nmotor vehicle liability insurance coverage in response to a DMV initiated\nmandatory verification (MVF) transaction. The insurance company is advising\nthat the paper proof of insurance accepted by DMV is invalid and/or fraudulent. An insurance company or servicing agent shall exercise due diligence when\nsubmitting a no insurance (NIS) notice to DMV in response to a DMV initiated\nmandatory verification (MVF) traction. An insurance company or servicing agent\nshall not submit a NIS notice to DMV if the vehicle is insured by said\ninsurance company. (6)\n\nResubmission\nof notices. An insurance company or servicing agent shall resubmit, using the\nsame transaction code, a corrected LOD, NBS, REI, XLC or NIS notice for an\nunmatched notice (edit error or unresolved no-hit exception) returned by DMV, within the time frame specified by this Part, unless the original submission\nwas excluded from being reported to DMV as set forth in sections\n34.1\n(d), 34.7 and\n34.12\nof this Part. (b) DMV shall initiate the\nfollowing notices: (1)\n\nMandatory verification\n(MVF). A transaction sent to an insurance company or servicing agent by DMV due\nto the absence of electronic insurance information in DMV's insurance\ninformation database. A MVF transaction requires a confirmation of liability\ncoverage (new business-NBS) or a repudiation of liability coverage (no\ninsurance-NIS) response from an insurance company. A MVF transaction requires\ninsurance company electronic verification of paper insurance information\nsubmitted to DMV as a result of: a registration transaction processed by DMV\nfor a registrant; an inquiry letter or suspension/revocation order sent to a\nregistrant; or an accident or traffic ticket issued to a registrant where\ninsurance status is at issue. (2)\n\nNegative verification (NVF). A transmission (annual or as otherwise permitted\nor required), using cartridge tape media, sent to an insurance company or\nservicing agent by DMV that provides a record of each registrant/vehicle in\nDMV's insurance information database that reflects that insurance company as\nthe insurer of record. Such transmission is based on the proof of insurance\npreviously provided electronically to DMV by an insurance company or servicing\nagent. NVF notices are not based on paper proof of insurance submitted to DMV\nby a registrant or an agent or broker on behalf of a registrant. A NVF\ntransaction requires a cancellation (XLC) response from an insurance company or\nservicing agent only if the insurance company no longer insures a\nregistrant/vehicle. An insurance company or servicing agent shall not submit\nany other type of notice to DMV in response to a NVF transaction. A NVF\ntransmission represents electronic proof of insurance notices (LOD, NBS or REI)\nposted in the insurance information database at a given point in time. Accordingly, NVF notices will not reflect: (i) any previously submitted cancellations\nreturned unmatched as edit errors or unresolved no-hit exceptions; and\n(ii)\ncancellations submitted by\nan insurance company or servicing agent after the effective date of the NVF\ntransmission. An insurance company or servicing agent shall not submit an\nadditional cancellation notice in response to a DMV initiated NVF notice if a\ncancellation notice was submitted or resubmitted and matched (hit or resolved\nno-hit exception) to DMV's insurance information database.
