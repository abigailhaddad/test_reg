Parts 486 and 343 of this Title shall apply. (n) The department may revoke, suspend, modify, or limit an operating certificate of a shelter for adults, residence\nfor adults or adult home upon determining that: (1)\nsuch action would be in the public\ninterest because: (i) in the case of\nrevocation, suspension or limitation, such action would conserve resources by\nrestricting the number of beds, or the level of services, or both, to those\nbeds or services which are actually needed, after taking into consideration the\ntotal number of beds necessary to meet the public need, and the availability of\nfacilities or services such as ambulatory, home care or other services which\nmay serve as alternatives or substitutes for the services provided by a\nresidence for adults or adult home; and\n(ii)\nin the case of modification, the level\nof care and the nature and type of services provided by a facility or required\nby all or some of the individuals seeking admission to such facility or\nrequired by all or some of the residents of such a facility, is inconsistent\nwith the operating certificate of the facility. (2)\n\nWhenever the department proposes to\nrevoke, suspend, modify or limit an operating certificate with respect to any\nparticular facility based upon any of the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision, the department must publish in a newspaper of general\ncirculation in the geographic area of the facility at least 30 days prior to\nmaking such a determination an announcement that such a determination is under\nconsideration and an address to which interested persons can write to make\ntheir views known.

The department must take all public comments into consideration in\nmaking its determination. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment must, upon making a determination described in this subdivision with\nrespect to any facility, notify such facility of the determination at least 30\ndays in advance of taking the proposed action to revoke, suspend, modify or\nlimit the facility's operating certificate. The department must schedule an\nadministrative hearing to provide the facility with an opportunity to contest\nthe department's determination. In no event will the revocation, suspension, modification or limitation take effect prior to the 30th day after the date of\nthe notice or prior to the effective date specified in the notice or prior to\nthe date of the hearing decision, whichever is later. (o) The operating certificate of any facility\nshall be revoked, suspended or limited if an operator is: (1)\nunable, by reason of loss of access or\nloss of right of possession to a facility, to continue to operate as\ncertified; (2)\nunable, by reason of\ncatastrophe such as fire or flood, to operate as certified for a period in\nexcess of 60 days. (p) (1)\n\nThe operating certificate of any facility\nmay be revoked, suspended or limited, or an application for an operating\ncertificate denied, if an individual operator, or a member of the board of\ndirectors, the executive director or chief administrative officer of a\nnot-for-profit operator is or has been within 10 years: (i) convicted of a class A, B or C\nfelony; (ii)\nconvicted, in another\nstate or in Federal court, of a crime which would, if committed in New York\n\nState, be considered a class A, B or C felony; or\n(iii)\nconvicted of a felony or class A\nmisdemeanor related to the provision of care to dependent adults or\nchildren. (2)\n\nSuch\nrevocation, suspension or limitation of an operating certificate, or denial of\nan application for an operating certificate, must be preceded by a\ndetermination that: (i) there is a direct\nrelationship between one or more of the criminal convictions and the fitness of\nthe individual to perform related duties or responsibilities; or\n(ii)\ngranting the individual a license would\ninvolve an unreasonable risk to property or to the safety or welfare of\nspecific individuals or the general public. (q) Each of the following factors must be\nconsidered in determining whether the findings stated in subparagraphs\n(o)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section. (1)\nthe\npublic policy of the State to encourage the licensure of persons previously\nconvicted of one or more criminal offenses; (2)\nthe specific duties and responsibilities\nnecessarily related to the license sought or held by the person; (3)\nthe bearing the criminal offense or\noffenses for which the individual was previously convicted will have on his or\nher fitness to perform related duties or responsibilities; (4)\nthe time which has elapsed since the\noccurrence of the criminal offense or offenses; (5)\nthe age of the individual at the time of\nthe occurrence of the criminal offense or offenses; (6)\nthe seriousness of the criminal offense\nor offenses; (7)\nany information\nproduced by the individual to demonstrate rehabilitation and good conduct, including but not limited to a valid certificate of relief from disabilities or\ncertificate of good conduct issued in accordance with the State Correction Law; and\n(8)\nthe interest of the\ndepartment in protecting the safety and welfare of residents or potential\nresidents of adult care facilities, as well as the general public. (r) Any operating certificate\nissued by the commissioner to the operator of an adult care facility shall\nremain the property of the department and upon voluntary or involuntary closure\nshall be surrendered to the department by personal delivery to a designated\nrepresentative or by certified or registered mail. (s) Continuation of facility operation after\nrevocation, suspension or limitation of an operating certificate shall be the\nbasis for imposition of sanctions in accordance with Part 486 of this\n\nTitle.
