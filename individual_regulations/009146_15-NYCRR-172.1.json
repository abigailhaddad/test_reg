  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 172.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Chapters 910\nand 913 of the Laws of 1981 added article 43-A to the Vehicle and Traffic Law, authorizing the establishment of county special traffic options programs for\ndriving while intoxicated (STOP-DWI). Such programs are funded by fines and\nforfeitures resulting from violations of sections\n1192\nand 511-2 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law. The stated purpose of the STOP-DWI\nprogram is to provide a plan for coordination of county, town, city and village\nefforts to reduce alcohol-related traffic injuries and fatalities. Each such\nprogram is organized by a coordinator who is responsible for the general\nadministration of the program, including the annual submission of a program\nplan to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Expenditures from STOP-DWI accounts\nmay only be made upon the approval of that plan. (b) The City of New York shall be considered\na county for the purposes of this Part. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n172.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
