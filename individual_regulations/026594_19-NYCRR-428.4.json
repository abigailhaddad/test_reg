  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 428.4 - Exemptions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Exemption by\nreason of inspection. The appropriate fire chief may grant an exemption by\nreason of inspection when an insured, within the period prescribed by section\n428.3\n(b), requests in writing that said chief or his representative make an inspection of\nthe insured's place of business. Such exemption may be made contingent upon an\ninspection occurring and a favorable report being rendered within 30 days of\nthe granting of the contingent exemption. Unless the chief and the insured have\nmutually agreed to an extension of the time in which to conduct the inspection, the failure to conduct the inspection and issue the report within the 30 days\nshall cause the contingent exemption to abate, and the insured shall then file\na completed report within 15 days. (b) General exemption. The appropriate fire\nchief may grant a general exemption where he is satisfied, based upon\nobservation and experience, that the firefighting capability of the insured is\nsufficient to defend against an emergency involving reportable\nmaterials. (c) Exemptions based\nupon the need for confidentiality. The appropriate fire chief may grant any\nexemption based upon the need for confidentiality from the reporting of\nspecific hazardous materials. This claim may only be asserted by an insured\nwhen the inclusion of the identity of a particular reportable material would\nreveal a trade secret fact related to that material. At the time of filing for\nan exemption based upon the need for confidentiality, the insured shall attest\nin writing to the truth of the following four statements: (1)\nthe insured has taken measures to protect\nthe confidentiality of the information, and intends to continue to take such\nmeasures; (2)\nthe information is\nnot, and has not been, reasonably available without the insured's\nconsent; (3)\nthe information is not\npublicly available elsewhere; and\n(4)\ndisclosure of the information would cause\nsubstantial harm to the insured's competitive position. In addition, the insured shall then attest, in writing, to\nthe truth of one or more of the following statements: (5)\nthe fact that the insured manufactures\nthe hazardous material at the reporting location is a trade secret; (6)\nthe fact that the insured imports the\nhazardous material is a trade secret; (7)\nthe amount of the substance which may be\npresent is a trade secret; (8)\nthe\nlink of the substance to the insured is a trade secret; and/or\n(9)\nthe link of the hazardous material to the\nreporting location is a trade secret. If a claim of confidentiality is made for a specific\nhazardous material, the term \"confidential\" must be entered on the form under\nthe class or classes within which the specific hazardous material falls. (d) Revocations. General exemptions and exemptions based upon a need for confidentiality may be\nrevoked if the conditions provided in subdivision (b) or (c) of this section no\nlonger exist. Such revocation shall be in writing, and upon notice thereof, the\ninsured shall within 15 days file a completed report form or such additional\ninformation as the fire chief may require to complete any form already on file\nwith said chief.
