Such treatment may continue only as long as\nnecessary to prevent dangerous behavior. (2)\n\nMinors. (i) Except as provided in subparagraph (ii)\nof this paragraph, a patient who is a minor may be provided treatment over his\nor her objection if the patient's parent, legal guardian or other legally\nauthorized representative has consented to the treatment, and the treatment is\nnot one for which the consent of a minor would be legally sufficient.

Such independent reviewer, designated by the clinical director, shall\nreview the patient's clinical record, meet with the patient, and provide a\nrecommendation to the clinical director based on an assessment of: (1)\nthe need for the proposed treatment in\nlight of the patient' s current condition, the goals for the treatment, the\npatient's treatment history, any alternatives to the treatment and the\ntherapeutic implications of treating the patient over his or her objection; and\n(2)\nthe patient's reasons for\nobjecting to the proposed treatment, his or her ability to understand the\nfactors described in subclause (1) of this clause, and the treatment staff's\nresponses to the patient's objection.

(c) The clinical director shall provide the\npatient and his or her parent, legal guardian or other legally authorized\nrepresentative with a full explanation of the clinical director's\ndetermination. If the determination is made to administer non-emergency\ntreatment over the patient's objection, the Mental Hygiene Legal Service shall\nbe notified and the initiation of the treatment shall be delayed at least four\ncalendar days thereafter. If, within the four-day period, the Mental Hygiene\n\nLegal Service files a legal action on behalf of the patient challenging the\nclinical director's determination as \"arbitrary and capricious\", the treatment\nmay be initiated three calendar days thereafter, unless otherwise ordered by\nthe court. (3)\n\nPatients on voluntary or informal status. Except as provided in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision, patients who\nare on a voluntary or informal status, other than those for whom application to\na court for involuntary retention has been made, may not be given treatment\nover their objection.

If the patient continues to object to the proposed treatment, the physician shall forward his evaluation and findings to the clinical\ndirector with a request for further review. He shall also notify in writing the\npatient, MHLS, and any other representative of the patient of his determination\nand request, if any, for further review.

(2)\n\nIf there is a substantial discrepancy between the opinions of the treating\nphysician and reviewing physician regarding the patient's capacity or whether\ntreatment is in the patient's best interests, the clinical director may, at his\noption, appoint a third physician to conduct an evaluation pursuant to this\nsubparagraph. (3)\n\nIf, after\ncompletion of the evaluation by the reviewing physician (or physicians), the\npatient continues to object to the proposed treatment, the clinical director\nshall make a determination on behalf of the facility whether the patient has\ncapacity to make a reasoned decision concerning treatment and whether treatment\nis in the patient's best interests. If the clinical director finds that the\npatient has capacity to make a reasoned decision concerning treatment or that\ntreatment would not be in the patient's best interests, he shall uphold the\npatient's objections and so notify the patient, MHLS, and any other patient\nrepresentative. If the clinical director's determination is that the patient\nlacks capacity, and treatment over objection is in the patient's best\ninterests, he may apply for court authorization of treatment, and so notify the\npatient, MHLS, and any other representative of the\npatient.

In making such determination, the clinical\ndirector, or his or her designee, shall ensure compliance with the procedures\ndescribed below. In the interest of prompt resolution of conflicts regarding\nadministration of psychotropic medication over objection, each of the\nevaluations of an inmate patient described below should be completed within 24\nhours.

If the physician finds that\nadministration of psychotropic medication is in the inmate patient's best\ninterests and the inmate patient lacks capacity to make a reasoned decision\nconcerning administration of such medication, he or she shall personally inform\nthe inmate patient of his or her determination. If the inmate patient continues\nto object to the proposed psychotropic medication, the physician shall forward\nhis or her evaluation and findings to the clinical director with a request for\nfurther review. He or she shall also notify in writing the inmate patient, Mental Hygiene Legal Service, and any other representative of the inmate\npatient of his or her determination and request, if any, for further\nreview. (b) Review by the clinical\ndirector or his or her designee. (1)\n\nUpon\nreceipt of the treating physician's request for further review, the clinical\ndirector shall appoint a physician to evaluate whether the proposed\nadministration of psychotropic medication is in the inmate patient's best\ninterests, and whether the inmate patient has the capacity to make a reasoned\ndecision concerning treatment. The reviewing physician may be any physician of\nsuitable expertise relative to the proposed administration of psychotropic\nmedication and may be an employee of the facility, including the clinical\ndirector, or independent of the facility. In performing his or her evaluation, such physician shall review the inmate patient's record and personally examine\nthe inmate patient. If the reviewing physician's determination is\nadministration of psychotropic medication over objection is appropriate, he or\nshe shall personally inform the inmate patient of his determination. (2)\n\nIf there is a substantial discrepancy\nbetween the opinions of the treating physician and reviewing physician\nregarding the inmate patient's capacity or whether administration of\npsychotropic medication is in the inmate patient's best interests, the clinical\ndirector may, at his or her option, appoint a third physician to conduct an\nevaluation pursuant to this subparagraph. (3)\n\nIf, after completion of the evaluation by\nthe reviewing physician (or physicians), the inmate patient continues to object\nto the proposed administration of psychotropic medication, the clinical\ndirector shall make a determination on behalf of the facility whether the\ninmate patient has capacity to make a reasoned decision concerning the\nadministration of psychotropic medication and whether such medication is in the\ninmate patient's best interests. If the clinical director finds that the inmate\npatient has capacity to make a reasoned decision concerning the administration\nof psychotropic medication or that such medication would not be in the inmate\npatient's best interests, he or she shall uphold the inmate patient's\nobjections and so notify the inmate patient, Mental Hygiene Legal Service, and\nany other representative of the inmate patient. If the clinical director's\ndetermination is that the inmate patient lacks capacity, and psychotropic\nmedication over objection is in the inmate patient's best interests, he or she\nmay apply for court authorization of administration of psychotropic medication, and so notify the inmate patient, Mental Hygiene Legal Service, and any other\nrepresentative of the inmate patient. (6)\n\nNothing in this subdivision\nshall prevent a treating physician, treatment team, or others involved in the\npatient's or inmate patient's care from continuing to explain the proposed\ntreatment to the patient as described in subdivision (a) of this section and to\nseek his or her voluntary agreement thereto. Further, the facility shall ensure\nthat any such efforts are made in a clinically appropriate manner.

If the Mental Hygiene Legal Service or\nthe patient's or inmate patient's attorney agrees, treatment may be commenced\nimmediately. Notwithstanding a patient's or inmate patient's withdrawal of his\nor her objection to a proposed treatment, nothing in this paragraph shall\ndiminish or supersede the need for obtaining informed consent for the proposed\ntreatment when so required under section\n27.9\nof this Title or under other\nprovisions of law.
