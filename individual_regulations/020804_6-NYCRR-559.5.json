  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 559.5 - Production rates\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions of this section supersede section\n556.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. (b) Absent a department\norder establishing oil production rates for a particular \"Bass Island\" pool and\nsubject to subdivision (c) of this section, the daily oil production allowable\nfor those days a \"Bass Island\" well is on production is 2 1/2 barrels of oil\nfor each acre which that well's application to drill, deepen, plug back or\nconvert shows is assigned to it, but not to exceed 200 barrels; and in gas\nproduction to whatever is produced in association with the well's daily oil\nproduction allowable. In the case of a \"Bass Island\" wildcat well, the daily\nproduction allowable is 200 barrels of oil per day, regardless of the number of\nacres assigned to it, for a period of one year from the date on which\nproduction from that well first begins. Subsequently, that well's daily oil\nproduction allowable will be determined by the method stated in the first\nsentence of this subdivision. Upon provision to the department of copies of\nbottom hole oil sample analyses and other data demonstrating that a \"Bass\n\nIsland\" well may produce oil at a daily rate greater than 200 barrels without\ngoing below the bubble point pressure at the midpoint of the production\ninterval, the department may, on an administrative basis, allow production at\nthat rate to occur until the bubble point is reached; subsequently, the daily\nproduction allowable will be determined by the methods stated in the first\nthree sentences of this subdivision. Data demonstrating that continued daily\nproduction in excess of 200 barrels of oil is warranted must be submitted to\nthe department monthly. Oil not actually produced under the daily production\nallowable cannot be produced at a later date. (c) If a \"Bass Island\" well is determined to\nhave a gas-oil ratio greater than 2,000 standard cubic feet of gas per barrel\nof oil measured at the stock tank based upon the gas-oil ratio tests under\nsections\n559.3\n(b) and\n559.4\n(b) of this\n\nPart, that well is limited in oil production to the amount determined by\nmultiplying the allowable as calculated under subdivision (b) of this section\nby a fraction, the numerator of which is 2,000 standard cubic feet of gas per\nbarrel of oil measured at the stock tank and the denominator of which is the\nlatest reported gas-oil ratio; and in gas production to whatever is produced\nwith the oil produced under the well's daily oil production allowable. If the\ngas-oil ratio aproaches infinity, the well is limited in daily gas production\nto the amount determined by multiplying the daily oil allowable as calculated\nunder subdivision (b) of this section by 2,000 standard cubic feet of gas. Gas\nnot actually produced under the daily production allowable cannot be produced\nat a later date. The department may increase the limiting gas-oil ratio on an\nadministrative basis to an amount greater than 2,000 standard cubic feet\nwhenever the operator presents data to the department which the department\ndetermines on an administrative basis is adequate justification for such\nincrease. (d) The operator of a\n\"Bass Island\" well may at any time petition the department for a change in\nproduction allowable for that well. In so doing, he must use the procedures set\nforth in section\n559.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart if gas-oil ratio test results are submitted with that request. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n559.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
