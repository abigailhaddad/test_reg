  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 471.5 - Farm motor vehicles\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 504, subd. 3\n(a) A motor vehicle which is both owned and\noperated by a farmer is exempt, provided it is used exclusively by him for any\nor all of the following purposes: (1)\nto\ntransport his own agricultural commodities, products, pulpwood or\nlivestock; (2)\nto transport the\npacked, processed or manufactured products which were grown or raised on his\nfarm, lands or orchards; (3)\nto\ntransport supplies to his own farm or orchard for consumption and use\nthereon; (4)\nto transport farm\nproducts from a farm contiguous to his own. (b) Any use of a motor vehicle, owned and\noperated by a farmer, for any other purpose than those set forth above destroys\nits exemption completely with the result that a permit and plate must be\nobtained for such vehicle and its entire mileage for the calendar month\nincluding mileage both for exempt and nonexempt purposes is taxable. Example 1: A farmer owns and operates a motor vehicle in which he\nhauls his own farm produce. In addition thereto he also carries milk to a dairy\nfrom farms not contiguous to his own. These two types of operations are\nperformed during the entire year. The motor vehicle is not exempt. A permit and\nplate must be obtained for it and its entire mileage is taxable. Example 2: A farmer leases from another a motor vehicle for use in\nhauling his farm produce to a canning factory. The motor vehicle is not\nexempt. Example 3: A farmer owns and operates a truck which he uses\nexclusively to haul his own farm produce. The truck is exempt from the statute. On August 15 he enters into a contract with a canning factory to transport\nproducts to it from farms not contiguous to his own during the period from\n\nAugust 15 to September 15. The use of the truck for this purpose destroys its\nexemption. A permit and plate must be obtained for it. Its entire mileage for\nthe months of August and September is subject to tax. After the termination of\nthe contract if the truck is again used exclusively to transport the farmer's\nown produce it is again exempt. (c) The exemption is limited by the statute\nto motor vehicles which are owned and operated by a farmer. It does not extend\nto motor vehicles owned or operated by co-operative associations or by persons\nengaged in the business of transporting farm products for others, even though\nthe motor vehicles are carrying farm products.
