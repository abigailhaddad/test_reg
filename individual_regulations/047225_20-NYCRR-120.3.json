  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 120.3 - Limitations where credit against ordinary tax is claimed for income taxes paid both to a state and also to one or more of its political subdivisions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 620(b)\n\nWhen both a state (other than New York State) and one or\nmore of that state's political subdivisions impose income taxes on the same or\ndifferent amounts of income derived from sources within such state and\npolitical subdivision, the maximum resident credit against ordinary tax is the\nlowest of the amounts determined after computing the following three\nlimitations: (a) The credit for the\ntaxable year cannot exceed the total of income taxes payable to the other state\nand the subdivision or subdivisions of such state. (For notification of a\nchange of tax payable to the other state or a subdivision thereof, see section\n120.2\n[a]\nof this Part.)\n(b) The credit for\nthe taxable year cannot exceed the amount obtained by multiplying the New York\n\nState tax payable (see section\n120.4\n[b]\nof this Part) by a percentage determined by dividing the portion of the\ntaxpayer's New York income subject to taxation in such other jurisdictions (the\nnumerator) by the taxpayer's total New York income (the denominator). Where\ndifferent amounts of income are subject to income tax by both the other state\nand by one or more of its subdivisions, the larger amount of income subject to\ntax by either the state or one or more of its subdivisions must be used in the\nnumerator of this computation. (c) The credit for the taxable year for total income taxes paid to both a state and\nto one or more of its political subdivisions cannot reduce the New York State\ntax payable to an amount less than would have been due if the income subject to\ntaxation by the other jurisdictions (or, where different amounts of income are\nsubject to income tax by the other jurisdictions, the larger of such amounts)\nwere excluded from the taxpayer's New York income. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n120.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
