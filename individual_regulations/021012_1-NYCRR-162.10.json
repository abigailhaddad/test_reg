  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 162.10 - Pascal celery standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. New York State Seal of Quality celery shall be stalks of celery of\nsimilar varietal characteristics which are well developed, well formed, clean, well trimmed, compact; free from blackheart, brown stem, soft rot and doubles. The celery is also free from damage caused by freezing, growth cracks, horizontal cracks, pithy branches, seedstems, suckers, wilting, blight, other\ndiseases, insects or mechanical or other means. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nStalk means an individual\nplant. (2)\n\nSimilar varietal\ncharacteristics means that the stalks in any package have the same general\nappearance and character of growth. (3)\n\nWell developed means that the branches\nare of good width and thickness in relation to the length of midribs and type\nof celery and that the heart branches are of reasonable number, length and\nstockiness. (4)\n\nWell formed means\nthat the branches are fairly straight and not more than slightly curved or\ntwisted. (5)\n\nClean means that the\nstalk is practically free from dirt or other foreign material. Stalks shall be\npermitted to have a small amount of dirt on the inside of the branches or in\nthe heart branches which cannot be removed by good commercial methods of\nwashing. (6)\n\nWell trimmed means\nthat not more than two relatively thin, short or spindly, or coarse and fibrous\nouter branches remain; that the main root has been cut off so as not to extend\nmore than 1 1/2 inches below the point of attachment of the lowest outer\nbranch; that secondary rootlets are not of such number or length as to\nmaterially affect the appearance of the stalk; and, that the appearance is not\nmaterially affected by the presence of discolored leaves or by excessive\nremoval of leaves or portions of leaves. (7)\n\nCompact means that the branches on the\nstalk are fairly closetogether throughout most of their length. (8)\n\nAverage midrib length means the average\nlength of all the branches in the outer whorl measured from the point of\nattachment at the base to the first node. (9)\n\nBranch means the leaf of a stalk and\nconsists of the edible stem-like portion and the tops or leaf blades. (10)\n\nLength of stalk means the distance from\nwhere the root is cut off to a point which represents the average length of the\nlongest branches. (11)\n\nDiameter\nmeans the greatest dimension of the stalk measured at a point two inches above\nthe point of attachment of the lowest outer branch to the base. (c) Size. The average midrib\nlength of the outer whorl of branches shall both be less than seven inches. Stalks shall be of such length as to extend from one side, end, or bottom of\nthe container to within one inch of the corresponding opposite side, end, or\ntop of the container. Such measurement shall not include the bulge, and shall\nbe measured in whole inches of even number as 12 inches, 14 inches, etc., in\naccordance with the facts. (d) Tolerances. In order to allow for variations incident to proper grading and\nhandling, the following tolerances shall be permitted: (1)\n\nFor defects. Ten percent, by count, in\nany lot for stalks which fail to meet the requirements of the grade, including\ntherein not more than 1/2 of this amount of five percent for stalks which are\nseriously including therein one percent for soft rot. (2)\n\nFor off-length stalks. Five percent by\ncount, in any lot for stalks which fail to meet the minimum length required or\nspecified. (3)\n\nFor off-length\nmidribs. Five percent by count, in any lot for stalks which fail to meet the\nrequirements as to average midrib length. (e) Application of tolerances. The contents\nof individual packages in the lot, based on sample inspection, are subject to\nthe following limitations: provided, that the averages for the entire lot are\nwithin the tolerances specified: (1)\n\nFor\npackages which contain 20 specimens or more and a tolerance of 10 percent or\nmore is provided, individual packages in any lot may contain not more than one\nand one-half times the tolerance specified. For packages which contain 20 or\nmore specimens and a tolerance of less than 10 percent is provided, individual\npackages in any lot may contain not more than double the tolerance specified\nexcept that at least one defective and one off-size specimen may be permitted\nin any package. (2)\n\nFor packages\nwhich contain less than 20 specimens, individual packages in any lot may\ncontain not more than double the tolerance specified, except that at least one\ndefective and one off-size specimen may be permitted in any package; provided\nthat for packages which contain six specimens or less, individual packages in\nany lot are not restricted as to the percentage of defects; and provided\nfurther, that not more than one specimen which is affected by decay or\notherwise seriously damaged and one off-size specimen may be permitted in any\npackage. (f) Count. The\nnumber of stalks of celery in the container may be specified by numerical count\nor in terms of dozens or half dozens. (g) Defects. (1)\n\nGrowth cracks mean more than one branch\nis affected by growth cracks which are over 1/2 inch in length or when more\nthan four branches have growth cracks. (2)\n\nHorizontal cracks mean more than two\nbranches have horizontal cracks which are over one-half inch in length, or when\nmore than four branches have horizontal cracks. (3)\n\nPithy branches mean more than two are\npithy in that portion of the midrib between a point one inch above the point of\nattachment to the base and the first node, or between a point one inch below\nthe first node and the point of attachment to the base, or when pith occurs at\nboth ends of the midrib and more than a total of one inch is\naffected. (4)\n\nSeedstems mean the\nlength of seedstem exceeds 1 1/2 times the diameter or six inches in\nlength. (5)\n\nBrown stem, cracked\nstem and crater blotch means materially affecting more than one branch or when\naggregate area exceeds one-half of a square inch on the branches. (6)\n\nDiscoloration means each of more than one\nbranch or 1/4 of the branches of the stalk, whichever is less, has more than\nthree distinct hairlike lines more than two inches long occurring on the outer\nside of the branch or an aggregate area of more than 1/4 by 3/4 inch of blotch\nor solid type discoloration occurring on the inner side. (7)\n\nInsects mean worms are present or when\ninsect injury occurs on heart branches, or when insect injury affects midrib\nportion of more than one branch, or when injury on other portions slightly\naffects the appearance of the stalk. (8)\n\nMechanical injury means the root has been\ncut off too closely leaving the branches without support; when more than one\nbranch is materially scuffed or bruised; when the branches have been broken\nabove the first node to an extent which materially affects the appearance; or\nwhen more than one branch is broken below the first node except that all\nbranches may be cut below the first node provided the stalk is of the length\nspecified. (h) Packing. Celery must be packed in new wirebound crates or new waxed cartons or any other\nnew standard containers subject to the approval of the Department of\n\nAgriculture and Markets. Container approval shall be based upon the ability of\nthe container to maintain the quality standards and integrity of the\nproduct. (i) Markings. Celery\npackaged and offered for sale under the Seal of Quality shall have affixed the\nofficial seal designation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
