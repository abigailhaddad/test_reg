(b) Foundations shall rest on natural solid bearing if a satisfactory bearing is\navailable at reasonable depths. Proper soil-bearing values shall be established\nin accordance with recognized standards. If solid bearing is not encountered at\npractical depths, the structure shall be supported on driven piles or drilled\npiers designed to support the intended load without detrimental settlement, except that one-story buildings may rest on a fill designed by a soils\nengineer. When engineered fill is used, site preparation and placement of fill\nshall be done under the direct full-time supervision of the soils engineer. The\nsoils engineer shall issue a final report on the compacted fill operation and\ncertification of compliance with the job specifications. All footings shall\nextend to a depth not less than one foot below the estimated maximum frost\nline. (c) Construction standards\nfor nursing home facilities shall comply with the following: (1)\n\nOne-story buildings shall be of type I, or type II (222) or (111) construction; buildings with two or more stories\nshall be of type I construction.

(e) Building insulation\nmaterials, unless sealed on all sides and edges, shall have a flame spread\nrating of 25 or less and a smoke developed rating of 150 or less when tested in\naccordance with NFPA 255, Standard Method of Test of Surface Burning\n\nCharacteristics of Building Materials, 2000 edition. Further details concerning\nthe material referenced herein are contained in section\n711.2\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (f) An emergency radio\ncommunication system shall be provided in each facility. This system shall be\nself-sufficient in times of emergency and capable of operation without reliance\non the building service or emergency electric power supply. It shall also be\nlinked with the available community or State emergency communication network, including connections with police and fire department or system. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
