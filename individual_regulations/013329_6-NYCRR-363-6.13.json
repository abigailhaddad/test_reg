  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.13 - Filter layer criteria\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a filter\nlayer is included, it must be designed to prevent the migration of fine soil\nparticles into a coarser grained material, and to allow water or gases to\nfreely enter a drainage structure (e.g., pipe or drainage blanket) without\nclogging. (b) Materials required. (1)\n\nGraded cohesionless soil filters. Granular soil material used as a filter must have no more than five percent by\nweight passing the No. 200 sieve and no soil particles larger than three inches\nin any dimension. (2)\n\nGeosynthetic\nfilters. Geosynthetic filter material must demonstrate adequate permeability, soil particle retention, resistance to clogging, and chemical and physical\nresistance to adjacent materials so that it is not adversely affected by waste\nplacement, overlying material or leachate generated at the landfill. Geosynthetic filter openings must be sized in accordance with the following\ncriteria: (i) Permeability criteria: k\nf\n> 10k\ns\nwhere: k\nf\nis the geosynthetic filter\npermeability; and\nk\ns\nis the overlying soil\npermeability\n(ii)\n\nRetention\ncriteria: O\n95\nof the geosynthetic filter <\n3d\n85, where: O\n95\nis the apparent opening size\nof the geosynthetic filter at which 95% of the soil particles will be retained; and\nd\n85\nis the soil particle size at\nwhich 85% of the particles are finer. (3)\n\nClogging potential of soil or\ngeosynthetic filter system must be assessed using a long-term permeameter test\nmethod or other methods acceptable to the department. (c) Construction requirements. (1)\n\nGeosynthetic filters must not be damaged\nduring installation and must be installed in a manner that does not reduce\ntheir ability to function as designed. (2)\n\nAll rolls of geosynthetic filters\nreceived and stored at the landfill must be stored enclosed in protective\nwrapping, such as the original, unopened packaging or an opaque tarpaulin, to\nensure protection from direct sunlight, ultraviolet radiation, temperatures in\nexcess of 160° F and below 32° F, mud, debris and other deleterious\nmaterials, and any other environmental condition that may damage the physical\nproperty values of the material. The storage location must be stable, dry, and\nwell-drained. The surface on which the material is stored must be free of sharp\nobjects. Rolls of geosynthetic filter materials must not be stored in stacks\nmore than three tiers high. Extended outdoor storage of rolls must not exceed\nmanufacturer's recommendations or nine months, whichever is less. For storage\nperiods longer than manufacturer's recommendations or nine months, rolls must\nbe stored off the ground under an additional cover or tarpaulin beyond the\nmanufacturer's wrapping or placed in an enclosed structure. (d) Certification requirements. For\ngeosynthetic filters, the project engineer must assess the polymer type and\ndensity, ultraviolet stability, mechanical properties, weight, tensile\nstrength, permittivity, apparent opening size, and puncture strength. The\nproject engineer must certify that post-construction care procedures were\nimplemented to protect the soil or geosynthetic filter from the intrusion of\nfines related to water-borne and wind-borne sediments.
