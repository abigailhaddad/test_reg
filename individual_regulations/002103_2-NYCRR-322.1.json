  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 2 § 322.1 - Background\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions\nof sections\n90\nand\n390\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw permit a retiring member to select an optional settlement of his retirement\nallowance. Such an option selection is to be filed with the Comptroller any\ntime before the first payment of a benefit becomes normally due, except that in\nthe case of retirement on account of disability, such an election may be made\nwithin 30 days after mailing by the Comptroller of notification of approval of\nretirement on account of disability. To assist retiring members in the\nselection of an option, the Retirement System prepares an estimate of benefits\nwhich will be available to the applicant. The estimate sets forth the\ninformation which is necessary and pertinent for the member to select the\nretirement settlement most suited for him and his beneficiary. (b) In the event a retired member dies within\n30 days after the effective date of his retirement, and before his optional\nelection becomes effective, sections\n60\nand\n360\nof the Retirement and Social Security\n\nLaw, among other things, provide that his designated beneficiary shall be\nentitled to the ordinary death benefit. However, should a retired member die\nmore than 30 days after the effective date of retirement, and without having\nselected an option, sections 90 (bb [2]) and 390 (bb [2]) mandate that he be\ndeemed to have been retired under option one-half, which provides only for the\nreturn of the member's accumulated contributions, if any. In this latter case, no benefit will be paid to the beneficiary of a noncontributory member, since\nhe will have had no accumulated contributions to his credit. Based upon the\nauthority set forth in sections 90 (bb [1]) and 390 (bb [1]), this Part is\npromulgated to ensure that the provisions of sections 90 (bb [2]) and 390 (bb\n[2]) will not become applicable in the case of a pensioner who dies within 60\ndays following the effective date of retirement without making an effective\nelection of an option, and: (1)\nwho had not\nbeen furnished with a retirement estimate within one year prior to the date of\nretirement; or\n(2)\nwho was\nfurnished with a retirement estimate less than 14 days prior to the date of\ndeath. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 2\n§\n322.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
