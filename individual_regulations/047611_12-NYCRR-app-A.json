Part 440)\nNOTIFICATION CONCERNING PAYMENT FOR MEDICATION\nDear [Name]\n[Carrier or self-insured employer] has filed papers with the\nworkers' compensation board contesting your claim for workers' compensation\nbenefits. Under state law, an insurance company is not required to reimburse a\nworker for medications while it is contesting the claim, and we have chosen not\nto do so. However, the Worker's Compensation Board requires that we\nnotify you of the following. While we are contesting the claim, the following\nrules apply: [*] You may obtain your medications from any pharmacy. You are\nnot required to use a pharmacy designated by [carrier or self-insured\nemployer]. [*] If you prevail on your claim, [carrier or self-insured\nemployer] must reimburse you or the pharmacy directly (if it extends you\ncredit). The specific amount of the reimbursement may differ from the amount\nyou paid, and is set by the Workers' Compensation Board based on the kind of\nmedication you purchase. If you have any questions about this, please contact\nthe Board at 1-877-632- 4996. [*] If you do not prevail on your claim, [carrier or\nself-insured employer] is not required to reimburse you or the pharmacy. If you have any questions or problems, you may call us at [toll\nfree number], or find further information at [website].
