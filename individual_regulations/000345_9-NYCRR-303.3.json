  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 303.3 - Location of aeds\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subject to the\nphased-in implementation of AEDs, each State agency shall endeavor to have\nsufficient AEDs available at each of its public buildings to ensure ready\naccess for use during emergencies. (1)\n\nEach\n\nState agency's phased-in implementation plan shall commence by prioritizing AED\nplacement in those public buildings that house the largest number of State\nemployees, other intended occupants or estimated regular visitors, or which the\n\nState agency reasonably deems to merit priority treatment due to the high risk\nnature of the population served or the activities conducted at the public\nbuilding. (2)\n\nWhen prioritizing AED\nplacement as described in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, those public\nbuildings where there is a greater level of physical activity or in which a\nhigher occupant density is likely shall be given priority for AED placement\nover public building(s) that have a lower level of physical activity or lower\nlikely levels of occupant density. (3)\n\nPublic buildings housing a staff, other\nintended occupants or regular visitors of 100 people or more shall be\nconsidered priority structures for the implementation of an AED\nprogram. (b) After a\n\nState agency has prioritized its public buildings for purposes of implementing\nan AED program, the agency shall determine the quantity and placement of AEDs. In implementing the physical placement of the AEDs, consideration shall be\ngiven to the size and physical layout of the public building, including but not\nlimited to the following factors: (1)\nplacement of AEDs in centralized locations based upon the response system an\nagency has established in its PAD plan, or mobile deployment of AEDs (e.g., placement of AEDs in emergency vehicles), such that a trained operator could\noptimally respond to the site of a cardiac event with an AED at or about an\nagency's public building(s) in a period of not more than three\nminutes; (2)\nlocations of stairways\nand elevators; (3)\nnumber of floors\nin the facility; (4)\nsecurity\nfeatures that limit access or restrict freedom of movement to certain areas of\na building; (5)\nconspicuous\nlocation for AED access and retrieval; and\n(6)\nprotection of the AED against accidental\nphysical damage, tampering or theft. (c) AEDs should not be located in locked\nrooms or where access is restricted, unless the AED is meant to be an\nadditional device or is secondary to the AEDs installed for regular daily\naccess. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where placement of an AED may be\nproblematic due to security or other safety considerations, or where the\ncombined logistics of building design, risk level and operator availability\nreasonably indicates a secure AED placement, the State agency may consider\nalternate installations that are as consistent as possible with these rules and\nregulations. (d) An agency shall\nconsider AED options for children in those State facilities that are regularly\nopen to the public, e.g., museums, convention centers, recreational/sport\nfacilities. Appropriate AED equipment options should be acquired and made\navailable for resuscitating children in accordance with AED manufacturer's\nrecommendations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n303.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
