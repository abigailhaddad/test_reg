  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 §§ 8188-4.8 - Continuing education requirement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each county director must comply with the\napplicable continuing education requirement set forth herein. (1)\n\nEffective October 1, 2011, a county\ndirector must successfully complete an average of 12 continuing education\ncredits every year. A continuing education year is defined as beginning on\n\nOctober 1st and ending on September 30th of the following year. Continuing\neducation credit means the number of contact hours awarded for attendance at\napproved courses, conferences, and seminars. Continuing education credits are\nawarded on an hour for hour basis in full hour amounts only. (i) If a county director successfully\ncompletes more than 12 continuing education credits in one continuing education\nyear, as many as 12 of the excess credits may be applied toward the requirement\nfor only the next continuing education year. Continuing education credit\nrequirements already satisfied for the 2010-2011 and 2011-2012 continuing\neducation years will remain satisfied. (ii)\n\nIf a county director has not satisfied\nthe required number of continuing education credits for the prior year, continuing education credits successfully completed in the current year will\nfirst be applied retroactively to satisfy the prior continuing education year\nrequirement. In no case shall credit be awarded retroactively to satisfy more\nthan one continuing education year. (2)\n\nThis requirement commences upon the\n\nOctober 1st next succeeding the date that the certification of the county\ndirector was issued. (b) Continuing education credit hours shall be awarded for courses, conferences and\nseminars which are primarily devoted to assessment administration or real\nproperty valuation. In addition, continuing education credit hours may be\nawarded to a county director who is a qualified instructor and who conducts a\ncourse for which continuing education credit hours may be awarded. One and\none-half times the continuing education credits for the course shall be awarded\nfor instructing. Continuing education credits shall not be awarded for\nrepeating instruction of a course within a three-year period. In the case of\n\nBoard of Assessment review training, four continuing education credit hours per\nyear may be awarded. (c) Continuing\neducation credits for the attainment of professional designations set forth in\nRPTL section 318(3)(b) shall be awarded on an hour for hour basis for\nqualifying examinations which are successfully completed. Demonstration\nappraisals accepted as a requirement for a professional designation shall be\nawarded 24 continuing education credits. (d) In the case of approved course\nexaminations successfully completed without attending classroom instruction, the continuing education credits awarded shall be the same as the credits that\nwould be awarded for course attendance with successful completion of the\nexamination. A director may only be granted continuing education credits once\nfor an approved course by successfully completing an examination without\nattending classroom instruction. (e) Retroactive continuing education credit\nfor courses taken one year prior to certification shall be allowed providing\nthe required information detailed in subdivision (b) of this section is\nsubmitted to ORPTS.
