  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 229.20 - Equipment and testing procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nWithin 30 days of the effective date hereof, each company\ndistributing natural gas shall advise this commission, by a letter signed by a\nresponsible official of the company, of the manner in which the specific\ngravity of said gas is determined at or before each respective source of the\ngas. Each company's statement shall include the locations where said\ndeterminations are made, the name of the transmission corporation or company\nmaking said determinations at each location, information indicating that the\nsamples tested in said determinations at each location are representative of\nthe gas distributed by the company, the types of specific gravity equipment\nused in said determinations at each location and a summary of the procedure\nemployed at each location for making said determinations and verifying their\naccuracy. (a) Determination for\nmetering purposes. (1)\n\nWhere a company\ndistributes natural gas that has had its specific gravity determined by the\nrelevant transmission corporation in a manner adequate for orifice and other\ntypes of velocity metering at a testing station fully complying with the\nprovisions of subdivision (b) of section\n229.50, and section\n229.51, with its total chemical\ncomposition unchanged from the location of specific gravity determination to\nthe location of consumption, specific gravity equipment need not be installed\nin its testing station testing said gas provided that said company is\nperiodically supplied with reports regarding the specific gravity of the gas. Said reports shall also include suitable identifying data such as the source of\neach gas sample tested, the date that it was taken, the date, method and\nlocation of test, etc. and sufficient information to demonstrate that each\nsample is representative of the gas delivered to the company, that its specific\ngravity has been determined in a manner adequate for orifice and other types of\nvelocity metering and that the equipment used to determine the specific gravity\nof the gas is periodically adjusted and calibrated in accordance with the\nprovisions of subdivision (a) of section\n229.21. (2)\n\nWhere a company distributes gas that has\nnot had its specific gravity determined in a manner adequate for orifice and\nother types of velocity metering at a testing station fully complying with the\nprovisions of subdivision (b) of section\n229.50, and section\n229.51\nor that does not have its\ntotal chemical composition unchanged from the location of specific gravity\ndetermination to the location of consumption, part of which is distributed to a\nconsumer with an orifice or other type of velocity meter, said company shall\n(i) provide each of its testing stations\ntesting said gas required herein by section\n229.50\n(a)-(d)\nof\nthis Part with a recording gravitometer fully complying and standardized, maintained, adjusted and calibrated in full compliance with the provisions\ntherefor of the relevant effective code of the American Society for Testing\n\nMaterials, the presently effective code being entitled \"Standard Methods of\n\nTest for Specific Gravity of Gaseous Fuels (D 1070-52)\" (the presently\neffective code hereinafter referred to as ASTM D 1070), and the recommendations\ntherefor of pages 76 through 95 of Miscellaneous Publication M 177 of the\n\nNational Bureau of Standards entitled \"Tests of Instruments for the\n\nDetermination, Indication, or Recording of the Specific Gravities of Gases\"\n(hereinafter referred to as NBS M 177) and\n(ii)\noperate said recording gravitometer\nlikewise in full compliance with said codes. (b) Automatic and manual determination. In\neach instance not described herein by subdivision (a), each company shall\n(1)\nprovide each of its testing stations\nrequired herein by section\n229.50\n(a)- (d)\nof\nthis Part with specific gravity equipment fully complying and standardized, maintained, adjusted and calibrated in full compliance with the relevant\nprovisions therefor of ASTM D 1070 and/or the relevant recommendations therefor\nof NBS M 177 and those of the manufacturer's instructions therefor that do not\nconflict with either ASTM D 1070 or NBS M 177 and\n(2)\noperate said specific gravity equipment\nlikewise in full compliance with said codes. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n229.20\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
