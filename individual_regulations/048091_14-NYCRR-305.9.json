Tit. 14 § 305.9 - Confidentiality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In all cases\nwhere preventive alcoholism counseling services are provided to children, extra\nprecautions shall be taken to protect confidentiality.

(b) If preventive counseling\nservices are provided to a child without parental consent, only the child's\nwritten consent is necessary to disclose information, and the written consent\nof the parent may not be sought. (c) If preventive counseling services are\nprovided to a child with parental consent, the written consent of both the\nchild and the parent must be acquired in order to disclose information. The\nchild's consent must be sought first, and, if the child refuses to consent, parental consent shall not be sought. (d) If HIV-related information is obtained\nduring the course of providing preventive counseling services, such information\nshall be maintained and released only pursuant to the Federal confidentiality\nregulations, when applicable, and Part 309 of this Title.
