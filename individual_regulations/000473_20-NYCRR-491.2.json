  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 491.2 - Who should apply for licenses and decals\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 521, 522, 526(d) and 528\n(a) (1)\n\nGenerally, an application for a fuel use tax license and decal(s) must be made\nby any carrier who operates or will be operating a qualified motor vehicle upon\nthe public highways of New York State, provided such qualified motor vehicle is\nnot exempt from the provisions of article 21-A of the Tax Law. Many qualified\nmotor vehicles that are subject to the provisions of article 21-A of such law\nare, for varying periods of time, leased to others, interchanged with qualified\nmotor vehicles belonging to others or, in some other manner, used or controlled\nby persons other than the owners. Under the Tax Law, the owner of a qualified\nmotor vehicle and any other person having a lawful use or control, or a right\nto the use or control of a qualified motor vehicle are each carriers, and are\njointly and severally liable for the fuel use tax. Moreover, every carrier must\napply to the department or the carrier's base jurisdiction for a fuel use tax\nlicense and decal(s) for each qualified motor vehicle operated or to be\noperated by the carrier on the public highways of New York State. (2)\n(i) Except as provided in paragraph (5) of this subdivision, to avoid the issuance\nof numerous licenses and decals for the same qualified motor vehicles, if a\nlessor engaged in the business of leasing or renting qualified motor vehicles\nwithout drivers for compensation to lessees has already secured an appropriate\nfuel use tax license and decal(s) for the qualified motor vehicle, any carrier\noperating such qualified motor vehicle under a lease or other agreement need\nnot obtain a license and decal(s). A carrier operating a qualified motor\nvehicle under a lease or other agreement covering a period of 30 days or more\nmay obtain a license and decal(s) for such qualified motor vehicle and be\ndeemed to be the licensee. However, if the lease or other agreement is for 29\ndays or less, the lessor will be the licensee, unless the lessee has a written\ncontract that provides that the lessee will report and pay the fuel use tax on\nthe qualified motor vehicle subject to such lease and the lessor has a copy of\nthe lessee's IFTA fuel tax license which is valid for the term of the lease. In\nsuch case, the lessee must obtain a license and decal(s) for such qualified\nmotor vehicle. (ii)\n\nWhere a carrier\nis using independent contractors under leases of 30 days or more, the lessor\nand lessee will be given the option of designating which party will obtain the\nappropriate license and decal(s) for such qualified motor vehicle and report\nand pay the fuel use tax. In the case of a carrier using independent\ncontractors under leases of 29 days or less, the lessor is responsible for\nreporting and paying the fuel use tax on the subject qualified motor vehicle\nand must obtain the appropriate license and decal(s). (3)\n(i) Where any carrier other than the owner of a qualified motor vehicle obtains a\nfuel use tax license and decal(s), such decal(s) will be valid only during the\nterm of the lease or other agreement, or any immediate renewal or extension\nthereof, that authorizes the use or control of such qualified motor vehicle\nunless such decal(s) otherwise expires or is suspended or revoked. However, the\nlicensee may retain such license until such license expires or is suspended or\nrevoked. (ii)\n\nSee section\n491.8\n(d) of this Part regarding surrender of licenses and destruction of decals in the\ncase of qualified motor vehicles operated by carriers other than the\nowners. (4)\n\nIn the event\nthat the owner of a qualified motor vehicle conveys the use or control of the\nqualified motor vehicle to another carrier and such carrier in turn conveys\nthat authority to a third party, the latter conveyance and any subsequent\nconveyances shall also be subject to the provisions of this\nsubdivision. (5)\n\nPursuant to the\njoint administration provisions of section 528(a) of article 21-A of the Tax\n\nLaw, where a carrier operating exclusively in New York State or a carrier\nengaged in interstate commerce not required to obtain an IFTA license, obtains\na New York State fuel use tax license in accordance with the provisions of\nsection\n491.3\n(c) of this Part (combined highway use tax permit/fuel use tax license), the\nhighway use tax licensing provisions with respect to leases (see section\n473.8\nof this\n\nTitle) shall be applicable to such carrier. (b) In general, a person is considered to be\noperating a qualified motor vehicle where such person actually drives the\nqualified motor vehicle or where an employer-employee relationship exists\nbetween such person and the driver of the qualified motor vehicle. Whether a\nperson is deemed to be operating a qualified motor vehicle and whether the\nextent of authority necessary to establish an employer-employee relationship is\npresent in any given case will depend upon the particular facts in such case. See section\n473.8\n(e) through\n(i) of this Title, for some tests used for\ndetermining whether an employer-employee relationship exists. (c) (1)\nA\ndealer or other person who lawfully operates a qualified motor vehicle under a\ndealer or transporter registration is deemed not to be a carrier with respect\nto such qualified motor vehicle for purposes of the fuel use tax if the\nqualified motor vehicle is operated without a load and operated for the\npurposes described in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this paragraph. Therefore, except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, such dealer or other\nperson need not apply for a fuel use tax license and decal(s) under such\ncircumstances. The fact that a device drawn by a qualified motor vehicle may be\noperated under a dealer/transporter registration is not relevant in determining\nif the qualified motor vehicle drawing such device is required to have a fuel\nuse tax license and decal(s). (i) Transporter\nplates may be used for the limited operation of qualified motor vehicles owned\nor controlled by a transporter for the following purposes: (a) weighing, testing, dismantling, transporting or delivering a qualified motor vehicle; (b) moving a qualified motor vehicle in\nconnection with making installations thereon or improvements thereto; (c) foreclosure or repossession of a\nqualified motor vehicle; or\n(d) demonstrating a qualified motor vehicle owned by a manufacturer. (ii)\n\nDealer plates may be used for\nall purposes for which transporter plates may be used and, in addition, dealer\nplates may be used for the operation of qualified motor vehicles owned or\ncontrolled by a dealer and held for sale or demonstration. (2)\nA person whose base jurisdiction is New\n\nYork State and who operates under transporter or dealer plates, as described in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, may be required to obtain an IFTA license\nand decals for purposes of reporting and paying the fuel use taxes imposed by\nother IFTA jurisdictions in which that person operates.
