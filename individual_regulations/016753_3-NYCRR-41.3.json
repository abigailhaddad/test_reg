Tit. 3 § 41.3 - Prohibited acts and practices\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following acts and practices are prohibited in the making\nof a high cost home loan. (a) No\nlending without counseling disclosure and list of counselors and consumer and\nhome ownership counseling notice. (1)\nA lender\nor mortgage broker must deliver, place in the mail, fax or electronically\ntransmit the following notice in at least 12-point type to the borrower at the\ntime of application: \"You should consider financial counseling prior to\nexecuting loan documents. The enclosed list of counselors is provided by the\n\nNew York State Banking Department.\" In the event that the lender or broker does\nnot know whether the borrower's application is a high cost home loan\napplication, such disclosure must be made as soon as the lender determines that\nit is a high cost home loan application. In the event of a telephone\napplication, the disclosures must be made immediately after receipt of the\napplication by telephone. Such disclosure shall be on a separate form. In order\nto utilize an electronic transmission, the lender or broker must first obtain\neither written or electronically transmitted permission from the borrower. A\nlist of approved counselors, available from the New York State Banking\n\nDepartment, shall be provided to the borrower by the lender or the mortgage\nbroker at the time that this disclosure is given. The lender or mortgage broker\nmay provide to the borrower the entire list of counselors or those portions of\nthe list which pertain to both the geographic area in which the borrower\nresides and any adjacent area or areas. (2)\n\nWithin three days after determining that\nthe loan is a high cost home loan, but no less than 10 days before closing, a\nlender or mortgage broker shall not make or arrange a high cost home loan\nunless either the lender or the mortgage broker has delivered to the borrower\nin writing, either placed in the mail, faxed or electronically transmitted, the\nfollowing notice in at least 12-point type: \"CONSUMER CAUTION AND HOME OWNERSHIP COUNSELING NOTICE\nIf you obtain this loan, which pursuant to New York State Law\nis a High-Cost Home Loan, the lender will have a mortgage on your home. You\ncould lose your home, and any money you have put into it, if you do not meet\nyour obligations under the loan. You should shop around and compare loan rates and fees. Mortgage loan rates and closing costs and fees vary based on many factors, including your particular credit and financial circumstances, your earnings\nhistory, the loan-to-value requested, and the type of property that will secure\nyour loan. The loan rate and fees could vary based on which lender or mortgage\nbroker you select. Higher rates and fees may be related to the individual\ncircumstances of a particular consumer's application. You should consider consulting a qualified independent credit\ncounselor or other experienced financial adviser regarding the rate, fees, and\nprovisions of this mortgage loan before you proceed. The enclosed list of\ncounselors is provided by the New York State Banking Department. You are not required to complete any loan agreement merely\nbecause you have received these disclosures or have signed a loan application. If you proceed with this mortgage loan, you should also remember that you may\nface serious financial risks if you use this loan to pay off credit card debts\nand other debts in connection with this transaction and then subsequently incur\nsignificant new credit card charges or other debts. If you continue to\naccumulate debt after this loan is closed and then experience financial\ndifficulties, you could lose your home and any equity you have in it if you do\nnot meet your mortgage loan obligations. Property taxes and homeowner's insurance are your\nresponsibility. Not all lenders provide escrow services for these payments. You\nshould ask your lender about these services. Your payments on existing debts contribute to your credit\nratings. You should not accept any advice to ignore your regular payments to\nyour existing creditors. Accordingly, it is important that you make regular\npayments to your existing creditors.\"\nIf the notice required by this paragraph is given to the\nborrower separately from counseling notice required by paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision, then the list of counselors so enclosed in the counseling notice\ndisclosure shall be enclosed also with this disclosure notice. Such disclosure\nshall be on a separate form. In order to utilize an electronic transmission, the lender or broker must first obtain either written or electronically\ntransmitted permission from the borrower. (b) No lending without due regard to\nrepayment ability. A lender or mortgage broker may not make or arrange a high\ncost home loan unless the lender reasonably believes at the time the loan is\nconsummated that the borrower or the borrowers (when considered collectively in\nthe case of multiple borrowers) will be able to make the scheduled payments to\nrepay the obligation based upon a consideration of their current and expected\nincome, current obligations, employment status, and other financial resources\n(other than the borrower's equity in the dwelling which secures repayment of\nthe loan) as verified by detailed documentation of all sources of income and\ncorroborated by independent verification. A lender shall benefit from a\nrebuttable presumption that a borrower is able to make the scheduled payments\nto repay the obligation, if, at the time the high cost home loan is\nconsummated, or at the time of the first rate adjustment in the case of a lower\nintroductory interest rate, the borrower's scheduled monthly payments do not\nexceed 50 percent of the borrower's monthly gross income as verified by the\ncredit application, the borrower's financial statement, a credit report, financial information provided to the lender by or on behalf of the borrower, or any other reasonable means, and the lender, in making such high cost home\nloan, follows the residual income guidelines pursuant to\nsection\n36.4337(e)\nof title 38 of the Code of\n\nFederal Regulations and U.S. Veterans' Administration VA Form\n26-6393. VA Form 26-6393 may be viewed at the New York City office of the New\n\nYork State Banking Department located at the address stated in Supervisory\n\nPolicy G1 of this Title or by internet access at\nhttp://www.vba.va.gov/pubs/homeloanforms.htm.

A borrower's repayment ability shall be\npresumed \"corroborated by independent verification\" for purposes of this Part\nand section\n6-l\n(2)(k)\nof the Banking Law if the borrower's\nincome, employment status, obligations, and other financial resources are\nverified by documents prepared by persons or entities having no direct\nrelationship with the lender or mortgage broker or a relationship with the\nborrower, other than an employment, debtor-obligor, or fiduciary relationship, or by governmental documents, such as an income tax return. For purposes of\ndetermining monthly income, only the income of the borrower(s) shall be\nconsidered. (c) Financing of points\nand fees. In making a high cost home loan, a lender may not require a borrower\nto directly or indirectly finance any portion of the points and/or fees, in an\namount that exceeds three percent of the principal amount of a closed end high\ncost home loan, or of the maximum line of credit amount for open end high cost\nhome loans, for loans other than refinancings. For refinancings, a lender may\nnot finance such points or fees in an amount that exceeds three percent of the\nadditional proceeds received by the borrower in connection with the\nrefinancing. In making a high cost home loan, a lender may not finance\nvoluntary credit, disability, unemployment and/or life insurance as part of the\nprincipal amount of the loan, whether interest is charged or not. In making a\nhigh cost home loan, a lender may not directly or indirectly finance any\nprepayment fees or penalties payable by the borrower in a refinancing\ntransaction if the lender or an affiliate of the lender is the originator of\nthe loan being refinanced. For purposes of this subdivision, additional\nproceeds for a closed end loan is the amount over and above the current\nprincipal balance of the existing home loan. For an open end loan, additional\nproceeds is the amount by which the line of credit on the new loan exceeds\ncurrent principal balance of the existing home loan. (d) Refinancing and modification of existing\nhigh cost home loan. (1)\n(i) A lender shall not charge a borrower\npoints and fees in connection with a high cost home loan if the proceeds of the\nhigh cost home loan are used to refinance an existing high cost home loan held\nby the lender or an affiliate of the lender. (ii)\n\nIn all other instances, a lender may not\ncharge a borrower points and fees in connection with a high cost home loan if\nthe proceeds of the high cost home loan are used to refinance an existing high\ncost home loan and the last financing was within two years of the current\nrefinancing. This provision shall not prohibit a lender from charging points\nand fees in connection with any additional proceeds received by the borrower in\nconnection with the refinancing, provided that the points and fees charged on\nthe additional sum must reflect the lender's typical point and fee structure\nfor high cost refinance loans. For purposes of this subdivision, additional\nproceeds for a closed end loan is the amount over and above the current\nprincipal balance of the existing high cost home loan. For an open end loan, additional proceeds is the amount by which the line of credit on the new loan\nexceeds current principal balance of the existing high cost home\nloan. (2)\nA lender may\nnot charge a borrower any fees to modify, renew, extend, or amend a high cost\nhome loan or defer any payment due under a high cost home loan if, after the\nmodification, renewal, extension or amendment, the loan is still a high cost\nloan or, if no longer a high cost home loan, the annual percentage rate has not\nbeen decreased by at least two percentage points. For purposes of this\nparagraph, fees do not include interest that is otherwise payable and\nconsistent with the provisions of the loan documents. This provision shall not\nprohibit a lender from charging points and fees in connection with any\nadditional proceeds received by the borrower in connection with the\nmodification, renewal, extension or amendment (over and above the current\nprincipal balance of the existing high cost home loan) provided that the points\nand fees charged on the additional sum must reflect the lender's typical point\nand fee structure for high cost home loans. This provision shall not apply if\nthe existing high cost home loan is in default or is 60 or more days delinquent\nand the modification, renewal, extension, amendment or deferral is part of a\nwork-out process. (e) Restrictions on home improvement contracts. A lender may not pay a contractor\nunder a home-improvement contract from the proceeds of a high cost home loan\nother than by an instrument payable to the borrower or jointly to the borrower\nand the contractor or, at the election of the borrower, through a third-party\nescrow agent in accordance with terms established in a written agreement signed\nby the borrower, the lender, and the contractor prior to the disbursement of\nfunds to the contractor. (f) No\nrefinancing of special mortgages. No lender making a high cost home loan may\nrefinance an existing mortgage loan that is a special mortgage originated, subsidized or guaranteed by or through a state, tribal or local government, or\nnonprofit organization, which either bears a below-market interest rate at the\ntime of origination, or has nonstandard payment terms beneficial to the\nborrower, such as payments that vary with income, are limited to a percentage\nof income, or where no payments are required under specified conditions, and\nwhere, as a result of the refinancing, the borrower will lose one or more of\nthe benefits of the special mortgage, unless the lender is provided prior to\nloan closing documentation by a U.S. Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment certified housing counselor or the lender who originally made the\nspecial mortgage that a borrower has received home loan counseling in which the\nadvantages and disadvantages of the refinancing has been received.
