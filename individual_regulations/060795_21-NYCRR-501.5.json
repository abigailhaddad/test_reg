  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 501.5 - Requests for public access to records\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any written request for records covered\nby this Part shall be deemed to be a request for records pursuant to the\n\nFreedom of Information Law, whether or not the Freedom of Information Law is\nmentioned in the request. An oral request for records will not be considered a\nrequest for records pursuant to the Freedom of Information Law. Responses to\noral requests for records shall be made as promptly as resources and time\nrestraints permit. (b) The authority\nshall respond to a written request which reasonably describes the records\nsought within five business days of receipt of the request. If the authority\nfails so to do, the request may be construed as denied and may be\nappealed. (c) The response set forth\nin subdivision (b) of this section shall offer or deny access, in whole or in\npart, to the records sought, or shall acknowledge receipt of the written\nrequest and set forth the approximate date upon which the request will be\ngranted or denied. The response may set forth a request on the part of the\nauthority to confer with the requester to review the request to determine which\nrecords will satisfy the objectives and needs of the requester; provided, however, that the failure on the part of the requester to confer with the\nauthority or the failure of the authority to produce records described in the\nwritten request for records shall not preclude an appeal by the requester based\nupon a denial of access. (d) If\naccess to records is neither granted nor denied within five business days\nfollowing the receipt of a request, the authority shall acknowledge the receipt\nof the request in writing and include a written statement of the approximate\ndate when such request will be granted or denied, in which case, if access to\nrecords is neither granted or denied within 10 business after the time set\nforth in such statement, the request may be considered as denied. The authority\nmay extend the time for providing access to records beyond five business days\nof the receipt of a request when it is necessary to: (1)\nsearch for and collect the requested\nrecords from facilities or other establishments that are separate from the\nauthority; (2)\nsearch for, collect\nand appropriately examine a voluminous amount of records which are demanded in\na single request; or\n(3)\nconsult, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another person having\na substantial interest in the determination of the request, or among two or\nmore components of the authority having substantial subject matter interest\ntherein. (e) The time\nlimitations on response to requests for records shall begin to run as of the\ntime a request for records is received by the records access officer and a\ndate-stamp notation placed directly on the request. (f) A request for access to records must\nreasonably describe the records requested. Where possible, specific information\nregarding dates, title, file designations, and other information which may help\nidentify the records, should be supplied by the requester. Where the\ninformation supplied by the requester is not sufficient to permit\nidentification and location of the records by authority personnel without an\nunreasonable amount of effort, the requester will be contacted and asked to\nsupply the necessary information. Every reasonable effort shall be made by\nauthority personnel to assist in the identification and location of requested\nrecords. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
