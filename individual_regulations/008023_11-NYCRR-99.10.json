(iii)\n\nIn using the 2012 IAR Table, the mortality rate for a person age x in year (2012 + n) is calculated as follows: q\n2012+n\n= q\n2012\n(1 - G2)\nn. (iv)\n\nThe resulting q\n2012+n\nshall be rounded to three decimal places per 1,000 (\ne.g., 0.741 deaths per 1,000) in accordance with the formula in subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, starting at the 2012 period table rate. For example: For a male, age 30, q\n2012\n= 0.741, q\n2013\n= 0.741 * (1 - 0.010)\n1\n= 0.73359, which is rounded to 0.734, and q\n2014\n= 0.741 * (1 - 0.010)\n2\n= 0.7262541, which is rounded to 0.726. (v) Rounding shall be performed only at the end of the calculation, not at intermediate steps. For example, a method leading to incorrect rounding would be to calculate q\n2014\nas q\n2013\n* (1 - 0.010), or 0.734 * 0.99 = 0.727. The already-rounded q\n2013\nmay not be used to calculate q\n2014. (4)\n\nThe 1983 GAM.
