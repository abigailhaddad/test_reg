To ensure good medical outcomes, a mechanical\nrestraint may be used to limit mobility or temporarily immobilize a patient in\nrelation to a medical, post-surgical, or dental procedure. (2)\n\nRestraint or seclusion for any purpose\nshall never be utilized as punishment, for the convenience of staff, to\nsubstitute for inadequate staffing, or as a substitute for treatment\nprograms. (3)\n\nIn choosing the form\nof intervention for any purpose, staff shall utilize the least restrictive type\nwhich is appropriate and effective under the circumstances.

(ii)\n\nUtilization of seclusion or restraint to manage violent or self-destructive\nbehavior shall not be based solely on a patient's seclusion or restraint\nhistory or on a history of dangerous behavior. (iii)\n\nMechanical restraint. The only\npermissible forms of mechanical restraint shall be those devices which have\nbeen authorized by the commissioner. (2)\n\nSimultaneous use.
