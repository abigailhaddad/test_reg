  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1646-6.3 - Procedure during initial operating period\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Initial operating period income. During\nthe initial operating period, only income derived from the operation of the\nproject proper shall be deposited into the administration fund. Such income\nshall include dwelling and non-dwelling rentals, revenue from other charges\nmade to tenants, such as for sales and services, fines and penalties, commissions and profits from telephone pay-stations, washing machine\nconcessions, vending-machines, etc. Revenue derived from other sources, such as\ninterest on development fund investments, forfeited deposits on plans and\nspecifications, etc., shall continue to be deposited into the development fund\nand credited to the development cost accounts provided. (b) Initial operating period expenses. Expenses chargeable to the initial operating period shall include only the\nactual expenses, applicable to the period, of operating the project proper, such as salaries of the project manager and staff, janitorial and maintenance\nsalaries, project office expenses, operating services, and utilities. Tenant\nselection costs, interest on indebtedness, insurance on newly constructed\nbuildings, and taxes shall not be included, nor shall any provision be made for\namortization of a bond issue, if any, for accrual of subsidies, or for any\nreserves. Expenses falling within the direct costs (1410) group of development\ncost accounts shall not be charged to initial operating period expense unless\nit is clearly established that such expenses would not have been incurred if\nthe project proper were not being operated. All expenses chargeable to the\ninitial operating period shall be paid out of the administration\nfund. (c) Vacancy losses. No\nvacancy loss shall be recorded prior to the last day of the month during which\n95 per cent of the dwelling units of the project proper become available for\noccupancy or the date of substantial completion as determined by the\ncommissioner, whichever is earlier. However, for purposes of control over the\ncharging of rents to tenants, it is recommended that a memorandum record of\nvacancy losses be maintained in the rent roll and vacancy loss control book, as\ndescribed in section\n1642-4.7. (d) Transfers from development fund. (1)\n\nIf there are not sufficient funds\navailable in the administration fund at any particular time during the initial\noperating period for payment of such operating expenses as are required to be\npaid therefrom, there may be transferred, in even amounts, from the development\nfund to the administration fund sufficient funds to cover such\nrequirements. (2)\n\nIn transferring\nthe above mentioned funds, a development fund accounts payable voucher shall be\nprepared, as follows: Debit: 1680D Interfund Clearance-Development\n$XXX\nCredit: 1111 Development Fund $XXX\n(3)\n\nThe deposit of funds in the\nadministration fund is recorded in the cash receipts register, as follows: Debit: 1112 Administration Fund $XXX\nCredit: 1680A Interfund Clearance-Administration\n$XXX\n(e) Reporting. (1)\n\nWhere requested by the\ndivision, the local agency shall include with each quarterly financial report\n(see §\n1646-7.2\n) filed subsequent to the\nbeginning of the initial operating period, an itemized statement of initial\noperating period, on form DH-621, Income and Expense--Budget Control Statement. Form DH- 621 is a printed form supplied by the division and is shown as Exhibit\n27 of Appendix S-11. For use in reporting the results of operation during the\ninitial operating period, the phrase \"Initial Operating Period\" shall be added\nto the heading of form DH-621, and the budget columns of the form shall be\ndisregarded. Column 3, cumulative figures--actual, shall reflect the results of\noperation from the first day of the initial operating period to the closing\ndate of the current quarter or the date of substantial completion, whichever is\nearlier. The net income or deficit shown on the last line of form DH-621 shall\nagree with and support the amounts entered for account 1470.3 on form DH-213, Development Cost--Budget Control Statement, submitted simultaneously\ntherewith. (2)\n\nThe transfer from\nthe development fund and the net receipts (other than transfers) or\ndisbursements of the administration fund during the initial operating period\nwill appear as reconciling items in schedule A and B, respectively, of form\nDH-213 until the final amount of the net income or deficit for the initial\noperating period has been determined and the final transfer of funds, reflecting such determination has been made.
