  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.105 - Executive order no. 105: establishing the governor's task force on work and family\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe interdependence of work and family has taken on new\ndimensions as more women work outside the home and the proportion of parents in\nthe State's labor force rises. \"Average family\" no longer means husband, wife\nand two children, with the husband as sole wage earner and the wife at home\ncaring for the children. These trends are expected to continue into the next\ncentury. Working families are the cornerstone of our growing\neconomy. Our goal in New York State is to create an environment that\nsuccessfully attracts and retains productive and dedicated employees, and that\nsupports employees in their efforts to care for their families, thereby\nstrengthening families while making businesses more competitive. The changing family, especially the rise of single-parent\nfamilies and dual-income families, has altered the relationship between work\nand family. In light of the new links between work and family, support for\nworking families represents an investment not only in our families, but in our\nbusinesses as well. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I.

The members shall also\ninclude such representatives of public and private sector employers and\nemployees, including representatives of the small business sector, as the\n\nGovernor shall choose to appoint, who shall serve at the pleasure of the\n\nGovernor.
