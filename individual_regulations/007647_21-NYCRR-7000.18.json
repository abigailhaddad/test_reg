  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 7000.18 - Denial of grants and contracts\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The board of trustees shall have the\npower to determine that an applicant for funding is not qualified to receive\nfunding or is not the most meritorious of competing applicants, to deny or\nreduce future funding, or to terminate existing funding. (b) In reaching a decision, the board of\ntrustees shall take into consideration the amount of funds available for\ndistribution, the continuity, competence and cost-effectiveness of the services\nprovided, the provider's compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant\nand the requirements of these regulations, the standing of the recipient in the\nclient community being served, the viability of an alternate provider of\nservices and the disruption of services caused by a change in the identity of\nthe provider. If a decision is made to terminate or deny refunding of a grant, the board of trustees may authorize temporary funding if necessary to enable a\ngrant recipient to close or transfer current matters in a manner consistent\nwith its professional responsibilities to its current clients. Where the board\nof trustees has funded an applicant for general operating support on a\nrecurring basis, a decision to terminate funding or deny refunding will\nnormally only be based on: (1)\na substantial\nfailure to comply with the terms and conditions of the grant or the\nrequirements and restrictions of these regulations; (2)\na substantial failure to use the grant to\nprovide economical and effective legal assistance as measured by generally\naccepted professional standards and the provisions of these regulations; or\n(3)\na lack of sufficient funds\navailable for distribution pursuant to these regulations. (c) The provisions of subdivision (b) of this\nsection shall not apply to any grant awards which the board of trustees\ndesignates, at the time such award is made, as one time in\nnature. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n7000.18\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
