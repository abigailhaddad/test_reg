  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5329.14 - Parlay card wagers\n\nState Regulations\n\nThis section applies to parlay card wagers and not parlay\nwagers. (a) Requirements for\nparlay card wagers. Each operator that offers parlay card wagers shall\ndisclose fully, accurately and unambiguously on all parlay card wagering\nforms: (1)\nthe amounts to be paid to\nwinners, the method by which such amounts are to be determined and aggregate\npayout amount; (2)\nthe minimum and\nmaximum betting limits, if any; (3)\nthe effect of ties or draws in sports events; (4)\nthe effect of a sports event not being\nplayed on the date specified and of other occurrences that will cause\nselections to be invalid; (5)\nthe\nprocedure for claiming winnings, including, without limitation, the\ndocumentation a patron must present to claim winnings; (6)\nthe requirement that a parlay card wager\nmust consist of at least three selections that have not become invalid under\napplicable house rules or the wager will be void and will be\nrefunded; (7)\nthe rights, if any, reserved by the operator, including, without limitation, the right to eliminate\nany selection prior to the acceptance of a wager, or to withhold payouts of\nspecified amounts until the outcome of each proposition offered by the parlay\ncard has been determined; (8)\nthe\nrequirement that the point spreads, if any, printed on the parlay card wagering\nform when the wager is accepted will be used to determine the outcomes of the\nwagers; and\n(9)\nthat the operator's\nhouse rules apply to parlay cards unless otherwise stated on the parlay card\nwagering form. (b) Payout. (1)\n\nAn operator may\nlimit, with commission approval, the aggregate amount to be paid to winners on\na parlay card. Any such aggregate limit shall not be less than an amount\ndisclosed on the parlay card (the aggregate limit). (2)\n\nWhen an operator knows or reasonably\nshould know that actual payouts on a parlay card will be limited by an\naggregate limit, the operator shall cease accepting wagers on such parlay card\nand making payouts on such parlay card. (3)\n\nWhen an operator ceases accepting wagers\nand making payouts on a parlay card pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, if the parlay card, patron receipts and related documentation are\ndistinguishable from the parlay card, receipts and documentation as to which\nthe operator has ceased accepting wagers, then the operator may accept wagers\non only those sports events listed on the parlay card whose outcomes have not\nbeen determined, in which case such parlay card shall be considered a different\nparlay card for purposes of this subdivision. (4)\n\nAfter the outcome of the final sports\nevent offered on a parlay card has been determined, the operator shall\ndetermine the total amount of all winning wagers on such parlay card from all\npatrons. If such total amount exceeds the aggregate limit, the operator, unless\nparagraph (5) of this subdivision applies, may pay each winning wager, instead\nof the amount that would have been due in the absence of such aggregate limit, an amount equal to the amount of such winning wager multiplied by such\naggregate limit and divided by the total amount of all winning wagers\n(including payouts made prior to the suspension of payouts) that would\notherwise have been made without regard to such aggregate limit. (5)\n\nNotwithstanding the aggregate limit, if\nan operator pays a winner of a parlay card wager more than 10 percent of the\naggregate limit before the outcome of every proposition offered by such parlay\ncard has been determined, such operator shall pay every winner of a wager on\nsuch parlay card the proper payout amount stated on such parlay card in full\nand without regard to any aggregate limit. (6)\n\nIn specific cases, the commission, only\nin writing, may waive the requirements of this subdivision or impose\nrequirements more restrictive than the requirements of this\nsubdivision.
