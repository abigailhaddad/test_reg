  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 863.3 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words, or phrases hereinafter\nmentioned shall be construed as follows: (a) Item no. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters index number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identity specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Lower Hudson watershed in 1936 and has been closely followed in connection\nwith the identification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of\nthe stream numbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams\noriginally shown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the\ntime of its 1936 survey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few streams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the\nnewer maps are designated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Lower Hudson River drainage basin may be\nillustrated as follows: Water index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from The Battery, New York City. H-204\n\nStockport Creek\n\nThe 204th tributary entering the Hudson River in\n\nNew York State numbering upstream from The Battery. H-204-2\n\nKinderhook Creek\n\nThe 2nd tributary entering Stockport Creek\nnumbering upstream from the mouth. H-204-2-36\n\nBlack River\n\nThe 36th tributary entering Kinderhook Creek\nnumbering upstream from the mouth. H-204-2-36-4\n\nTrib. of Black River\n\nThe 4th tributary entering Black River numbered\nupstream from the mouth. H-204-2-36-4-P 81\n\nSpring Lake\n\nThe 81st pond, lake or reservoir encountered in the\nbiological survey area of the Lower Hudson River watershed, and specifically\nlocated in the drainage basin of the Black River. (c) The abbreviations trib., tribs., subtrib. and subtribs indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and\nsubtributaries, respectively, shall mean any stream, lake, pond or other body\nof surface water which fiows into any other stream, lake, or pond or other body\nof surface water. Where no tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include only the stream, lake, pond or\nother body of surface water referenced by such waters index number; where\ntributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after the waters index number, the\nspecifically designated waters shall include the stream, lake, pond or other\nbody of surface water referenced by such waters index number and all\ntributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on the reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of sections of waters to which a particular assignment\nof a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also include any useful\ninformation pertinent to the classification and standards. (f) Map Ref. No. as\nappearing in table I shall mean map reference number and indicates one or more\nof the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in part, on\nwhich the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are shown. The\nfollowing maps were produced from original maps. The U.S. Geological Survey\nmaps may be procured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological\n\nSurvey. The N.Y.S.D.O.T. maps may be procured through the Map Information Unit, New York State Department of Transportation. Map Ref.
