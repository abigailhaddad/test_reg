  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 242-10.5 - CO[2] emissions offset project standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Avoided methane emissions from\nagricultural manure management operations'. To qualify for the award of\nCO\n2\noffset allowances under this Subpart, offset\nprojects that capture and destroy methane from animal manure and organic food\nwaste using anaerobic digesters shall meet the requirements of this subdivision\nand all applicable requirements of this Subpart. (1)\n'Eligibility'. (i) Eligible offset projects shall consist of\nthe destruction of that portion of methane generated by an anaerobic digester\nthat would have been generated in the absence of the offset project through the\nuncontrolled anaerobic storage of manure or organic food waste. (ii)\n\nEligible offset projects shall employ\nonly manure-based anaerobic digester systems using livestock manure as the\nmajority of digester feedstock, defined as more than 50 percent of the mass\ninput into the digester on an annual basis. Organic food waste used by an\nanaerobic digester shall only be that which would have been stored in anaerobic\nconditions in the absence of the offset project. (iii)\n\nThe provisions of paragraphs\n242-10.3(c)(2) and (3) of this Subpart shall not apply to agricultural manure\nmanagement offset projects provided either of the following requirements are\nmet. (a) The offset project is located in a\nstate that has a market penetration rate for anaerobic digester projects of\nfive percent or less. The market penetration determination shall utilize the\nmost recent market data available at the time of submission of the consistency\napplication pursuant to section\n242-10.4\nof this Subpart and shall\nbe determined as follows: MP (%) = MG\nAD\n/ MG\nSTATE\nwhere: MG\nAD\n= Average annual manure\ngeneration for the number of dairy cows and swine serving all anaerobic\ndigester projects in the applicable state at the time of submission of a\nconsistency application pursuant to section\n242-10.4\nof this Subpart. MG\nSTATE\n= average annual manure\nproduction of all dairy cows and swine in the state at the time of submission\nof a consistency application pursuant to section\n242-10.4\nof this Subpart. (b) The offset project is located\nat a farm with 4,000 or less head of dairy cows, or a farm with equivalent\nanimal units, assuming an average live weight for dairy cows (lbs/cow) of 1,400\nlbs., or, if the project is a regional-type digester, total annual manure input\nto the digester is designed to be less than the average annual manure produced\nby a farm with 4,000 or less head of dairy cows, or a farm with equivalent\nanimal units, assuming an average live weight for dairy cows (lbs/cow) of 1,400\nlbs. (2)\n'Offset project description'.

(3)\n'Emissions baseline\ndetermination'. The emissions baseline shall represent the potential emissions\nof the CH\n4\nthat would have been produced in a baseline\nscenario under uncontrolled anaerobic storage conditions and released directly\nto the atmosphere in the absence of the offset project. (i) Baseline CH\n4\nemissions shall be calculated as follows: E = (Vm x M)/2000 x GWP\nwhere: E = Potential CO\n2\ne emissions due\nto calculated CH\n4\nproduction under site-specific\nanaerobic storage and weather conditions (tons); Vm = Volume of CH\n4\nproduced each\nmonth from decomposition of volatile solids in a baseline uncontrolled\nanaerobic storage scenario under site-specific storage and weather conditions\nfor the facility at which the manure or organic food waste is generated\n(ft\n3\n)\nM = Mass of CH\n4\nper cubic foot\n(0.04246 lb/ft³ default value at one atmosphere and 20°C)\nGWP = Global warming potential of\nCH\n4\n(28)\n(ii)\n\nThe estimated amount of volatile solids\ndecomposed each month under the uncontrolled anaerobic storage baseline\nscenario (kg) shall be calculated as follows: VSdeg = VSavail x f where: VS = volatile solids as determined from the equation: VS\n= M\nm\nx TS\n%\nx\nVS\n%\nwhere: M\nm\n= mass of manure or organic\nfood waste produced per month (kg)\nTS\n%\n= concentration (percent) of\ntotal solids in manure or organic food waste as determined through EPA 160.3\ntesting method (U.S.EPA Method Number 160.3, Methods for the Chemical Analysis\nof Water and Wastes (MCAWW) (EPA/600/4-79/020)) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title)\nVS\n%\n= concentration (percent) of\nvolatile solids in total solids as determined through EPA 160.4 testing method\n(U.S.EPA Method Number 160.4, Methods for the Chemical Analysis of Water and\n\nWastes (MCAWW) (EPA/600/4-79/020)) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title)\nVS\navail\n= volatile solids\navailable for decomposition in manure or organic food waste storage each month\nas determined from the equation: VS\navail\n= VSp + 1/2\nVS\nin\n- VS\nout\nwhere: VS\np\n= volatile solids present in\nmanure or organic food waste storage at beginning of month (left over from\nprevious month) (kg)\nVSin = volatile solids added to manure or organic food\nwaste storage during the course of the month (kg). The factor of 1/2 is\nmultiplied by this number to represent the average mass of volatile solids\navailable for decomposition for the entire duration of the month. VS\nout\n= volatile solids removed\nfrom the manure or organic food waste storage for land application or export\n(assumed value based on standard farm practice)(kg)\nf = van't Hoff-Arrhenius factor for the specific month as\ndetermined using the equation below. Using a base temperature of 30° C, the\nequation is as follows: f = exp{/}\nwhere: f = conversion efficiency of VS to\nCH\n4\nper month\nE = activation energy constant (15,175 cal/mol)\nT\n2\n= average monthly ambient\ntemperature for facility where manure or organic food waste is generated\n(converted from ° Celsius to ° Kelvin) as determined from\nthe nearest National Weather Service certified weather station (if reported\ntemperature ° C > 5° C; if reported temperature °C < 5° C, then F =\n0.104)\nT\n1\n= 303.16 (30° C converted to\n°K)\nGC = ideal gas constant (1.987 cal/K mol)\n(iii)\n\nThe volume of\nCH\n4\nproduced (ft\n3\n) from\ndecomposition of volatile solids shall be calculated as follows: Vm = (VS x B\no\n) x 35.3147\nwhere: V\nm\n= volume of\nCH\n4\n(ft\n3\n)\nVS = volatile solids decomposed (kg)\nB\no\n= manure or organic food waste\ntype-specific maximum methane generation constant\n(m\n3\nCH\n4\n/kg VS decomposed). For dairy cow manure, B\no\n= 0.24\nm\n3\nCH\n4\n/kg VS decomposed. The\nmethane generation constant for other types of manure shall be those cited at\nU.S. EPA, Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks: 1990-2017, Annex 3, Table A-179 (U.S. EPA, April 11, 2019) (see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title), unless the\nproject sponsor proposes an alternate methane generation constant and that\nalternate is approved by the Department. If the project sponsor proposes to use\na methane generation constant other than the ones found in the above-cited\nreference, the project sponsor must provide justification and documentation to\nthe department. (4)\n'Calculating emissions reductions'. Emissions reductions shall be calculated as follows: ER\nt\n=E\nb\n-E\np\nwhere: ER\nt\n= CO\n2\ne\nemissions reductions due to project activities (tons); E = Potential Coe emissions due to calculated CH\nproduction under site-specific anaerobic storage and weather conditions\n(tons); E = COe emissions due to project activities additional to\nbaseline (tons), including, but not limited to, manure transportation, flaring, venting, and effluent management. storage and weather conditions (tons); Emissions reductions may not exceed the potential\nemissions of the anaerobic digester, as represented by the annual volume of\nCH\n4\nproduced by the anaerobic digester, as monitored\npursuant to paragraph (5) of this subdivision. CO\n2\nemissions due to transportation of manure and organic food waste from the site\nwhere the manure and organic food waste was generated to the anaerobic digester\nshall be subtracted from the emissions reduction calculated pursuant to\nsubparagraphs (3)(i) through (iii) of this subdivision. Transport\nCO\n2\nemissions shall be determined through one of the\nfollowing methods. (i) Documentation of\ntransport fuel use for all shipments of manure and organic food waste from\noff-site to the anaerobic digester during each reporting year and a log of\ntransport miles for each shipment. Off-site is defined as a location that is\nnot contiguous with the property where the anaerobic digester is located. CO\n2\nemissions shall be determined through the\napplication of an emissions factor for the fuel type used. If this option is\nchosen, the following emissions factors shall be applied as appropriate. (a) Diesel fuel: 22.912 lbs. CO\n2\n/gallon. (b) Gasoline: 19.878 lbs. CO\n2\n/gallon. (c) Other fuel: submitted emissions factor\napproved by the department. (ii)\n\nDocumentation of total tons of manure\nand organic food waste transported from off-site for input into the anaerobic\ndigester during each reporting year, as monitored pursuant to subparagraph\n(5)(i) of this subdivision, and a log of transport miles and fuel type used for\neach shipment. CO\n2\nemissions shall be determined through\nthe application of a ton-mile transport emission factor for the fuel type used. If this option is chosen, the following emissions factors shall be applied as\nappropriate for each ton of manure delivered, and multiplied by the number of\nmiles transported. (a) Diesel fuel: 0.131\nlbs. CO\n2\nper ton-mile. (b) Gasoline: 0.133 lbs. CO\n2\nper ton-mile. (c) Other fuel: submitted emissions factor\napproved by the department. (5)\n'Monitoring and verification\nrequirements'. Offset projects shall employ a system that provides metering of\nbiogas volumetric flow rate and determination of CH\n4\nconcentration. Annual monitoring and verification reports shall include monthly\nbiogas volumetric flow rate and CH\n4\nconcentration\ndetermination. Monitoring and verification shall also meet the following\nrequirements. (i) If the offset project is a\nregional-type digester, manure and organic food waste from each distinct source\nsupplying to the anaerobic digester shall be sampled monthly to determine the\namount of volatile solids present. Any emissions reduction will be calculated\naccording to mass of manure and organic food waste (kg) being digested and\npercentage of volatile solids present before digestion, consistent with the\nrequirements at paragraph (3) of this subdivision and subparagraph (iii) of\nthis paragraph, and apportioned accordingly among sources. The project sponsor\nshall provide supporting material and receipts tracking the monthly receipt of\nmanure and organic food waste (kg) used to supply the anaerobic digester from\neach supplier. (ii)\n\nIf the offset\nproject includes the digestion of organic food waste eligible pursuant to\nsubparagraph (1)(ii) of this subdivision, organic food waste shall be sampled\nmonthly to determine the amount of volatile solids present before digestion, consistent with the requirements at paragraph (3) of this subdivision and\nsubparagraph (iii) of this paragraph, and apportioned accordingly. (iii)\n\nThe project sponsor shall submit a\nmonitoring and verification plan as part of the consistency application that\nincludes a quality assurance and quality control program associated with\nequipment used to determine biogas volumetric flow rate and\nCH\n4\ncomposition. The monitoring and verification plan\nshall be specified in accordance with the applicable monitoring requirements\nlisted in Table 3 below. The monitoring and verification plan shall also\ninclude provisions for ensuring that measuring and monitoring equipment is\nmaintained, operated, and calibrated based on manufacturer's recommendations, as well as provisions for the retention of maintenance records for audit\npurposes. The monitoring and verification plan shall be certified by an\nindependent verifier accredited pursuant to section\n242-10.6\nof this Subpart.
