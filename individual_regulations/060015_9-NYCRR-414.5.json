  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 414.5 - Commercial moving expenses\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn eligible person occupying a business, farm operation\nor a nonprofit organization will be reimbursed for actual, reasonable and\nnecessary moving expenses, actual, reasonable and necessary expenses in\nsearching for a replacement site and actual direct losses of tangible personal\nproperty in moving or discontinuing the operation or activity. (a) The eligible person shall notify the\ndepartment eight weeks prior to the starting date of the move of his definite\nintentions regarding the manner and method of moving. At the option of the\ndepartment, personnel of the department may conduct an inventory of personal\nproperty and merchandise to be moved, including a description of each phase of\nthe work to be performed and an explanation of any unusual or peculiar\ncircumstances that will be pertinent to arriving at a comprehensive cost of\nmoving figure. The address of the appropriated property, address the eligible\nperson is moving to and the approximate distance between is to be included\ntherein. This inventory is to be signed by the eligible person and is to be\nsupplied to all estimators and bidders for each phase of the work and they are\nto base their estimates and bids on removal of the items listed therein. The\noccupant may, at his own expense, obtain competitive bids on the costs of\nmoving and may submit a competitive self-move bid on all or a portion of the\nremoval. (b) Actual costs must be\ndocumented upon receipted, detailed bills from recognized movers, skilled\ncraftsmen and are not to exceed the total of the lowest acceptable bids or\nestimates obtained on each phase of the move. (c) Estimates and bids on each phase of the\nmove shall be obtained by the department from generally recognized, qualified\nmovers and skilled craftsmen. Upon receipt and review of all estimates and\nbids, the department will determine the lowest acceptable bid. This bid will be\nsent to the eligible person advising him to commence moving and setting forth\nthe limits of reimbusement and the time and manner in which payment will be\nmade. After the removal has been accomplished, actual costs must be documented\nby detailed, receipted bills from recognized movers, skilled craftsmen and are\nnot to exceed the approved amount based on a total of the lowest acceptable\nbids or estimates obtained on each phase of the move. All bids from movers and\ncraftsmen must be submitted in accordance with section\n414.6\nof this Part. (d) In the case of a\nself move, the owner of a relocated business may be paid an amount to be\nnegotiated between the State and the business not to exceed the lower of two\nfirm bids or estimates obtained by the State from qualified moving\nfirms. (e) When personal property\nwhich is used in connection with the business to be moved is of low value and\nhigh bulk and the estimated cost of moving would be disproportionate in\nrelation to the value, the State may negotiate with the owner for an amount not\nto exceed the difference between the cost of replacement of comparable item(s)\non the market and the amount which would probably have been received for the\nitem(s) on liquidation. (f) All\nbooks and records kept by eligible persons shall be subject to review and audit\nby a State representative during reasonable business hours. (g) Payment of moving expenses is based upon\nthe pre-approval of estimates and bids submitted to the department before\ncommencing the move. If, due to extraordinary circumstances, a move is\ncompleted without submitting necessary bids, the commission may, upon receipt\nof sufficient written justification for failure to submit estimates, pay\nreasonable and necessary actual expenses upon verification and support for the\nexpenses incurred.
