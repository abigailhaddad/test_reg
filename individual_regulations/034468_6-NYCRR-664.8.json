Tit. 6 § 664.8 - Jurisdictional Determination Procedure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person may submit to the department a\nrequest for a parcel jurisdictional determination as to whether a given parcel\nof land includes freshwater wetlands or regulated adjacent areas subject to\n\nState regulation. (b) Any landowner\nwho has been issued a positive parcel jurisdictional determination may request\nthat the department undertake to delineate the boundary of any freshwater\nwetland identified by the department on the subject parcel or may submit a\nwetland delineation for verification by the department. (c) Any landowner who has been issued a\npositive parcel jurisdictional determination may submit an application to the\ndepartment requesting a project jurisdictional determination, provided that the\nlandowner has submitted site-specific development plans and a wetland\ndelineation completed or verified by the department. Such an application shall\nbe deemed complete upon notice to the landowner that the application includes\nsite-specific plans with enough detail to identify the full extent of the\nproject in relation to jurisdictional wetlands and adjacent areas. (d) A request for a parcel jurisdictional\ndetermination, a wetland delineation, verification of a wetland delineation, or\na project jurisdictional determination must be made in writing and submitted to\nthe department consistent with instructions available on the department's\nwebsite. (e) The department shall\nprovide a definite answer in writing within 90 days of the receipt of such\nrequest as to the jurisdictional status of a parcel, and if requested, a\nproject jurisdictional determination. Provided however, that if weather or\nground conditions prevent the department from making a project jurisdictional\ndetermination within 90 days, it may extend such period until a determination\ncan be made. (f) If the department\nfails to provide a definite answer in writing, or notification of an extension\nwithin 90 days of the receipt of a parcel jurisdictional determination, or a\nproject jurisdictional determination, the requestor shall make notice of that\nfailure by means of certified mail, return receipts requested, addressed to the\n\nDirector of the Division of Fish and Wildlife, New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation, Division of Fish and Wildlife, 625 Broadway, Albany, NY 12233-1750.

(g) If the department\nfails to provide a definite answer within 10 business days of the receipt of\nsuch notice, freshwater wetland jurisdiction for the subject parcel shall be\ndeemed waived. Such waiver shall serve as a complete defense to the enforcement\nof the Act for a period of five years from the date of the waiver. (h) A positive parcel jurisdictional\ndetermination shall describe the reasons for the determination, including the\npresence of Wetlands of Unusual Importance, wetlands which are greater than\n12.4 (or 7.4 after December 31,2027) acres, wetland adjacent areas, and all\napplicable wetland classifications.
