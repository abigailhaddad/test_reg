Tit. 10 § 100.4 - Village of Altamont\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.]\nThe rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made, and enacted in accordance with the provisions of section 70, 71, 72 and 73 of chapter 45 of the Consolidated Laws (Public Health Law) as heretofore set forth shall apply to the mountain stream and to all watercourses entering or ultimately discharging into said stream above the intake at the impounding reservoir, said stream being a source of water supply of the village of Altamont. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to the impounding and distributing reservoirs on the stream used as a source of water supply by the village and to any additional reservoirs which may be constructed on said stream or any of its tributaries. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and filter basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel or permeable pipe or conduit of every kind, the waters of which, when running whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into the water supply of the said village of Altamont. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain with its nearest point within 75 feet of any reservoir or watercourse of the water supply of the village of Altamont. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed, maintained or allowed to remain with its nearest point within 150 feet of any reservoir or watercourse of the water supply of the village of Altamont. (3)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle or place used for the temporary storage of human excreta which is constructed, located, maintained or allowed to remain between the limiting distances of 75 feet and 150 feet as provided by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subdivision from which privy or other receptacle the excreta are not at once removed by pump or other satisfactory means through watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, as hereinafter provided, shall be arranged in such manner that all such excreta shall be received temporarily in suitable vessels or receptacles which shall at all times be maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and which will permit of convenient removal to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth. (4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid temporary receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and deodorized as often as may be found necessary to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundations or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Department of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid temporary receptacles permitted under paragraph (3) of this subdivision shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or by thoroughly digging it into the soil in such place and manner as to effectually prevent their being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at distances not less than 300 feet, horizontal measurement, from the high-water mark of any reservoir or not less than 200 feet from the edge, margin or precipitous bank of any watercourse of said water supply. (6)\n\nWhenever, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height of flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, it is considered by the State Commissioner of Health that excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or waste from any dump may be washed over the surface or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
