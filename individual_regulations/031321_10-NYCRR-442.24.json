  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 442.24 - Direct assignment of costs\n\nState Regulations\n[ 1610 ]\n(a) The direct assigning of costs is the\nprocess of identifying and assigning costs directly to the functional cost\ncenter generating those costs. Only those costs which meet the definitions and\nguidelines established within this section\n444.7\nof this Article will be\ndirectly assigned. (b) Buildings and fixtures\n[ 1611 ] The cost of all depreciation or rent/lease of\nbuildings and fixtures is to be charged to the Depreciation and Amortization\n\nCost Center (account 8810) and to the Leases and Rental Cost Center (account\n8815), respectively, and not reported as a direct expense of specific cost\ncenters. (c) Salary-\nand payroll-related employee benefits. [ 1612 ]\n(1)\n\nThe salaries and wages cost must be assigned directly to the functional cost\ncenter to which the employee is assigned (see Natural Classification Accounts, section\n444.23\n(b) of this\n\nArticle). For example, for reporting purposes the salary cost of direct nursing\nservices, including float nurses, must be directly assigned to the patient care\ncost centers receiving the service. This assignment may be based on each\nemployee's actual nursing services, hours performed within each patient care\ncost center multiplied by that employee's hourly salary rate while performing\nthe direct nursing service, or based on an analysis of salary and wage expense\nincluding time and cost studies. (2)\n\nPayroll-related employee benefits must be\nreported in the cost center where the applicable employee's compensation is\nreported. This assignment can be performed on an actual basis or upon the\nfollowing basis: (i) FICA - actual expense by\ncost center; (ii)\npension and\nretirement and health insurance (non-union) - gross salaries of participating\nindividuals by cost center; (iii)\nunion health and welfare - gross salaries of participating union members by\ncost center; (iv)\nall other\npayroll-related benefits - gross salaries by cost center. (3)\n\nNon-payroll-related employee benefits are\nto be reported in account 8830 (Employee Benefits-Non-Payroll-Related). (d) Medical\nsupplies and durable medical equipment. [ 1613 ]\n(1)\n\nThe invoice/inventory cost of all medical and surgical supplies for which a\nseparate charge is made, except home program dialysis supplies, must be\nreported as a cost of the Medical Supplies-Sold cost center (account 7110). The\nrelated revenue must be reflected in the Medical Supplies-Sold revenue center\n(account 4110). Home program dialysis supplies must be reported as a cost of\nthe appropriate home program dialysis center. (2)\n\nMedical and surgical supplies and\nmaterials issued by Central Services and Supplies for which a separate charge\nis not made must be reported at invoice/inventory cost as a cost of the cost\ncenter using the supplies and materials. (3)\n\nEffective for cost reporting periods\nbeginning January 1, 1982, the invoice/inventory cost of all durable medical\nequipment sold must be reported as a cost of the Durable Medical Equipment-Sold\ncost center (account 7130). The related revenue must be reported in the Durable\n\nMedical Equipment-Sold revenue center (account 4130). (4)\n\nEffective for cost reporting periods\nbeginning January 1, 1982, the depreciation expense associated with durable\nmedical equipment leased or rented must be reported in the Durable Medical\n\nEquipment-Leased/Rented cost center (account 7140). The related revenue must be\nreported in the Durable Medical Equipment-Leased/Rented revenue center (account\n4140). (5)\n\nThe overhead associated\nwith the issuance of medical supplies and durable medical equipment must be\nreported in the Central Services and Supplies cost center (account 8460). The\ncost of reusable patient chargeable supplies must remain in the Central\n\nServices and Supplies cost center. (e) Drugs. [ 1614 ] Pharmaceutical supplies and materials\nincluding IV solutions, admixtures, blood derivatives, etc.) issued by the\n\nPharmacy cost center for which a separate Pharmacy charge is made must be\nreported for as a cost of the Drugs Sold cost center (account 7150). The\nrelated revenue must be reflected in the Drugs Sold revenue center (account\n4150). Pharmaceutical supplies and materials including IV\nsolutions, admixtures, blood derivatives, etc.) issued by the Pharmacy for\nwhich a separate charge is not made must be reported at invoice/inventory cost\nas a cost of the cost center using the supplies and materials. The overhead associated with the issuing of\npharmaceutical supplies and materials (including IV solutions, admixtures, blood derivatives, etc.) must be reported in the Pharmacy cost center (account\n8470). The cost of reusable patient chargeable items must remain in the\n\nPharmacy cost center. (f) Data processing. [ 1615 ]\n(1)\n\nAll the direct costs incurred in operating an electronic data processing\ncenter, in purchasing data processing services, and/or in obtaining such\nservices from related organizations, must be reported in the using cost\ncenters. Direct cost which cannot be directly identified with specific\nfunctional cost centers must be assigned to the functional cost centers using\nsuch services based on each hospital's own determination of a fair and\nequitable assignment or allocation concept which gives appropriate recognition\nto the types of data processing costs incurred in their data processing center, under contract, and/or from related organizations. (2)\n\nEffective for cost reporting periods\ncommencing January 1, 1981 or thereafter, this cost assignment or allocation\nconcept must be agreed to by the medical fiscal intermediary prior to the end\nof the reporting period. Once a basis has been approved, it will remain in\neffect until the provider initiates a subsequent request to change\nit. (3)\n\nNo prior approval is\nrequired for cost reporting periods ending December 31, 1980 or before. (g) Central\npatient transportation. [ 1616 ]\n(1)\n\nBecause patient transportation costs are relatively minor in most hospitals, direct assignment of this expense is not required. Such expense may be reported\nwhere incurred. However, since no patient transportation cost center is\nprovided, those hospitals which maintain a central patient transportation\ndepartment must report such expenses in the appropriate ancillary services cost\ncenters. Patient visits or some other valid basis may be used for reclassifying\nsuch expenses. (2)\n\nThe expenses\nincurred in transporting patients to the Daily Hospital Services areas at the\ntime of admission are to be assigned to the Inpatient Admitting cost center\n(account 8524). The expenses incurred in transporting patients who have been\ndischarged are to be assigned to the Daily Hospital Services functional cost\ncenter from which the patient was discharged. Notes\nN.Y.
