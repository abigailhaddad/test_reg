(9)\n\nWhen the basis for a transfer no longer\nexists, and the resident is deemed appropriate for placement in the facility, the operator shall readmit him, even if involuntary termination proceedings\nhave begun. (10)\n\nTransfer of a\nresident without notice of termination shall not be deemed a termination of the\nadmission agreement. Such removal shall not relieve the operator from the\nrequirement of proceeding, subsequent to the removal of the resident, to\nterminate the admission agreement. (11)\n\nWhen the operator proceeds to terminate\nthe admission agreement of a resident transferred without notice of\ntermination, he shall insure that the written notice shall be hand-delivered to\nthe resident at the location to which he has been removed.

(15)\n(i) If\nfailure to make timely payment resulted from an interruption in the receipt by\nthe resident of any public benefits to which he is entitled, no admission\nagreement may be involuntarily terminated unless the operator, during the\n30-day notice period, assists the resident in obtaining such benefits, or any\nother available supplemental public benefits. (ii)\n\nDocumented failure of the resident to\ncooperate with such efforts by the operator shall be considered evidence of\nassistance. (16)\n\nIf the\nresident indicates to the operator, within 30 days of receipt of notice, that\nhe objects to the termination of the agreement, or if at the end of 30 days the\nresident remains in the facility, the operator shall institute a special\nproceeding pursuant to section\n461-h\nof\nthe Social Services Law prior to termination and discharge. (17)\n\nWhile legal action is in progress, the\noperator shall not: (i) seek to amend the\nadmission agreement in effect as of the date of the notice of\ntermination; (ii)\nfail to provide\nany of the care and services required by department regulations and the\nadmission agreement; or\n(iii)\nengage in any action to intimidate or harass the resident. (18)\n\nBoth the resident and the operator are\nfree to seek any other judicial relief to which they may be entitled. (19)\n\nThe operator shall assist any resident, proposed to be transferred or discharged pursuant to this subdivision, to the\nextent necessary to assure, whenever practicable, the resident's placement in\ncare settings which are adequate, appropriate and consistent with his\nwishes.
