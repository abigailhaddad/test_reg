  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 76.14 - High cost areas\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Banking Department recognizes that the demographics and\nhousing characteristics of an area may be such that the gap between housing\ncosts and area median income greatly restricts the affordability of\nowner-occupied housing for low-and moderate-income persons residing in such an\narea. At the same time, there may exist a shortage of credit which endangers\nthe preservation, stabilization or improvement of middle-income geographies or\nlimits access to credit for middle- income persons residing in such an area. Where, based on relevant, current and verifiable data (including but not\nlimited to the most recent census data pertaining to such area) these\nconditions are found to exist, the department may, in its assessment of the\ninstitution's performance, be flexible in its consideration of a banking\ninstitution's activities pertaining to owner-occupied housing in middle-income\ngeographies or for middle-income individuals residing in such an area. Consideration of such activities shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, consideration of activities in low-or moderate-income geographies and\nactivities which serve low- or moderate- income individuals. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n76.14\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
