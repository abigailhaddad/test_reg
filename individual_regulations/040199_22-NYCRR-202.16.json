(4)\n\nUnless the court\nexcuses their presence, the parties personally must be present in court at the\ntime of the compliance conference. If the parties are present in court, the\njudge personally shall address them at some time during the conference. Where\nboth parties are represented by counsel, counsel shall consult with each other\nprior to the compliance conference in a good faith effort to resolve any\noutstanding issues. Notwithstanding NYCRR § 202. 11, no prior consultation\nis required where either or both of the parties is self-represented. Counsel\nshall, prior to or at the compliance conference, submit to the court a writing\nwith respect to any resolutions reached, which the court shall \"so order\" if\napproved and in proper form. (5)\n\nIn\naccordance with Section\n202.20\n-c(f), absent good cause, a\nparty may not use at trial or otherwise any document which was not produced in\nresponse to a request for such document or category of document, which request\nwas not objected to, or, if objected to, such objection was overruled by the\ncourt, provided, however, the court may exercise its discretion to impose such\nother, further, or additional penalty for non-disclosure as may be authorized\nby law and which may be more appropriate in a matrimonial action than\npreclusion or where there is a continuing obligation to update (e.g., updated\ntax returns, W-2 statements, etc.). (6)\n\nThe Court shall alert the parties to the\nrequirements of 22 NYCRR §\n202.20\n-c regarding requests for\ndocuments; §\n202.20\n-e regarding adherence to\ndiscovery schedule, and §\n202.20\n-f regarding discovery\ndisputes, and shall address the issues of potential for default, preclusion, denial of discovery, drawing inferences, or deeming issues to be true, as well\nas sanctions and/or counsel fees in the event default or preclusion or such\nother remedies are not appropriate in a matrimonial action.

Failure to file with the court a report in\nconformance with these requirements may, in the court's discretion, preclude\nthe use of the expert. Except for good cause shown, the reports exchanged\nbetween the parties shall be the only reports admissible at trial. Late\nretention of experts and consequent late submission of reports shall be\npermitted only upon a showing of good cause as authorized by CPLR\n3101(d)(1)(i). In the discretion of the court, written reports may be used to\nsubstitute for direct testimony at the trial, but the reports shall be\nsubmitted by the expert under oath, and the expert shall be present and\navailable for cross- examination. In the discretion of the court, in a proper\ncase, parties may be bound by the expert's report in their direct\ncase. (3)\n\nPursuant to NYCRR §\n202.26, in cases in which both\nparties are represented by counsel and each party has called, or intends to\ncall, an expert witness on issues of finances (e.g., equitable distribution, maintenance, child support), the court may direct that, prior to, or during\ntrial, counsel consult in good faith to identify those aspects of their\nrespective experts' testimony that are not in dispute. The court may further\ndirect that any agreements reached in this regard shall be reduced to a written\nstipulation. Such consultation shall not be required where one or both parties\nis self-represented or where the expert testimony relates to matters of child\ncustody or parental access, domestic violence, domestic abuse, or child neglect\nor abuse. (4)\n\nThe provisions of\nsection\n202.20\n-a regarding privilege logs\nshall not apply to matrimonial actions and proceedings unless the court orders\notherwise.

Counsel shall separately identify for the\ncourt only a list of the witnesses who may be called solely for rebuttal or\nwith regard to credibility. The court may permit for good cause shown and in\nthe absence of substantial prejudice, a party to call a witness to testify who\nwas not identified on the witness list submitted by that party. The estimates\nof the length of testimony and the order of witnesses provided by counsel are\nadvisory only and the court may permit witnesses to be called in a different\norder and may permit further testimony from a witness notwithstanding that the\ntime estimate for such witness has been exceeded. (h) Statement of Proposed Disposition. (1)\n\nEach party shall exchange a statement\nsetting forth the following: (i) the assets\nclaimed to be marital property; (ii)\nthe assets claimed to be separate\nproperty; (iii)\nan allocation of\ndebts or liabilities to specific marital or separate assets, where\nappropriate; (iv)\nthe amount\nrequested for maintenance, indicating and elaborating upon the statutory\nfactors forming the basis for the maintenance request; (v) the proposal for equitable distribution, where appropriate, indicating and elaborating upon the statutory factors\nforming the basis for the proposed distribution; (vi)\nthe proposal for a distributive award, if requested, including a showing of the need for a distributive\naward; (vii)\nthe proposed plan for\nchild support, indicating and elaborating upon the statutory factors upon which\nthe proposal is based; and\n(viii)\nthe proposed plan for custody and visitation of any children involved in the\nproceeding, setting forth the reasons therefor. (2)\nA copy of any written agreement entered\ninto by the parties relating to financial arrangements or custody or visitation\nshall be annexed to the statement referred to in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision. (3)\n\nThe statement\nreferred to in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, with proof of service upon\nthe other party, shall, with the note of issue, be filed with the court. The\nother party, if he or she has not already done so, shall file with the court a\nstatement complying with paragraph (1) of this subdivision within 20 days of\nsuch service.

(2)\n\nNo motion shall be heard unless the\nmoving papers include a statement of net worth in the official form prescribed\nby subdivision (b) of this section. (3)\n\nNo motion for counsel fees and expenses\nshall be heard unless the moving papers also include the affidavit of the\nmovant's attorney stating the moneys, if any, received on account of such\nattorney's fee from the movant or any other person on behalf of the movant, the\nhourly amount charged by the attorney, the amounts paid, or to be paid, to\ncounsel and any experts, and any additional costs, disbursements or expenses, and the moneys such attorney has been promised by, or the agreement made with, the movant or other persons on behalf of the movant, concerning or in payment\nof the fee. Fees and expenses of experts shall include appraisal, accounting, actuarial, investigative and other fees and expenses (including costs for\nprocessing of NYSCEF documents because of the inability of a self-represented\nparty that desires to e-file to have computer access or afford internet\naccessibility) to enable a spouse to carry on or defend a matrimonial action or\nproceeding in the Supreme Court.

(6)\n\nThe notice of motion submitted with any\nmotion for or related to interim maintenance or child support shall contain a\nnotation indicating the nature of the motion. Any such motion shall be\ndetermined within 30 days after the motion is submitted for decision. (7)\n\nUpon any application for an award of\ncounsel fees or fees and expenses of experts made prior to the conclusion of\nthe trial of the action, the court shall set forth in specific detail, in\nwriting or on the record, the factors it considered and the reasons for its\ndecision. (l) Hearings\nor trials pertaining to temporary or permanent custody or visitation shall\nproceed from day to day conclusion. With respect to other issues before the\ncourt, to the extent feasible, trial should proceed from day to day to\nconclusion. (m) The court may, for\ngood cause, relieve the parties and counsel from the requirements of 22 NYCRR\n§\n202.34\nregarding pre-marking of\nexhibits and 22 NYCRR §\n202.20\n-h. regarding pre-trial\nmemoranda and Exhibit Books.

Where an objection to a portion of a direct testimony affidavit is\nsustained, the court may direct that such portion be stricken. The submission\nof direct testimony in affidavit form shall not affect any right to conduct\ncross examination or re-direct examination of the witness. Notwithstanding the\nforegoing, in an action for custody, visitation, contempt, order of protection\nor exclusive occupancy, however, except as provided in NYCRR §\n202.18, a party or a party's own\nwitness may not testify on direct examination by affidavit.
