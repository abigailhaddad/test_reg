  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 217-5.6 - Test equipment specifications and test procedures\n\nState Regulations\n\nAll test equipment and procedures shall, at minimum, comply with SAE J1667 test procedures unless otherwise noted herein. (a) A smokemeter used to measure smoke\nopacity in the exhaust emissions of a HDDV pursuant to this Subpart shall: (1)\nbe a manufacturer's model certified by\nNYSDEC as having satisfactorily demonstrated an acceptable ability to comply\nwith the recommended test standard contained in SAE J1667; (2)\nat a minimum, have the ability to\nmeasure, where appropriate, and print the following: (i) the smoke opacity value for each snap\nidle test in sequence; (ii)\nthe\nfinal test result, in percent opacity; (iii)\nthe engine oil temperature; (iv)\nthe engine RPM at high idle for each\nsnap; (v) the inspection date, time\nand location; (vi)\nthe name and\ncertification number of the certified inspector; (vii)\nthe exhaust pipe diameter or engine\nhorsepower; (viii)\nthe applicable\nsmoke opacity standard; (ix)\npass\nor fail of test results compared to applicable smoke opacity\nstandard; (x) license plate number\nand state of issuance; (xi)\nthe\nvehicle identification number (VIN); and\n(xii)\nthe engine model year. (3)\n\nThe smokemeter shall be\ncapable of: (i) retaining data pertaining to\nthe previous 40 tests; and\n(ii)\nmultiple printouts of parameters specified in paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision. (b) The testing procedures for the snap\nacceleration smoke opacity test, required in accordance to this subdivision, shall be performed on applicable HDDVs as follows: (1)\n\nWhere applicable, determine the engine\nhorsepower from the engine identification plate or engine serial number. Refer\nto Table 2 of this Subpart and input the nominal stack size into the\nsmokemeter. If the engine identification plate is missing, inaccessible or\nillegible, measure the outside diameter of the exhaust pipe extending from the\nexhaust manifold with a precision caliper or equivalent gauge, rounding to the\nnearest inch. (2)\n\nDuring an annual\nemissions inspection, performed at an ODEIS: (i) determine RPM in accordance with\nprocedures established by the CVIS, affix the RPM sensor to the engine of the\nvehicle according to the instructions of the smokemeter manufacturer; (ii)\ndetermine oil temperature in accordance\nwith procedures established by the CVIS or DEC certified opacity smokemeter; or\ninsert the engine oil temperature sensor into the oil dipstick tube and into\nthe crankcase oil according to the instructions of the smokemeter manufacturer; and\n(iii)\nconnect the engine RPM\nand oil temperature sensors to the smokemeter according to the instructions of\nthe smokemeter manufacturer. (3)\n\nAffix the smokemeter in accordance with\nprocedures established by the CVIS; or according to the instructions of the\nmanufacturer to the end of the exhaust pipe of the vehicle. For full-flow\nsmokemeters, ensure that the final two feet and the exit of exhaust pipe is\nstraight, with an internal diameter not to exceed five inches. Appropriate\nexhaust pipe adapters shall be used as necessary to comply with these\nspecifications. Do not use full-flow smokemeters on vehicles with underbody\nexhaust pipes which direct the exhaust flow to the ground unless the exhaust\ngases are redirected away from the ground by the appropriate exhaust pipe\nadaptor mentioned above. (4)\n\nEnsure\nthat the vehicle is restrained to prevent the vehicle from moving during the\ntest. (5)\n\nThe diesel emission\ninspection (smoke opacity) may not proceed until the smokemeter is warmed up\nand calibrated according to the CVIS or in accordance with the instructions of\nthe manufacturer. Initiate the test sequence on the smokemeter. (6)\n\nThe CVIS or DEC certified smokemeter\nshall determine the appropriate smoke opacity pass/fail standards set forth in\neither Table 1 or 2 of the Subpart. Prior to the CVIS requirement, the\ncertified inspector shall s elect the appropriate smoke opacity pass/fail\nstandards, set forth at Table 1 or 2 of this Subpart, based upon the engine\nmodel year. If using a full-flow smokemeter, the certified inspector may be\nrequested to enter engine horsepower and stack diameter as measured from the\nvehicle exhaust stack. (7)\n\nIf using\na smokemeter without horsepower input, the certified inspector will select the\nappropriate stack size from Table 3 of this Subpart, based upon the engine\nhorsepower of the vehicle. (8)\n\nWith\neach prompt from the CVIS or NYSDEC certified smokemeter to accelerate engine, ensure the accelerator pedal is rapidly depressed to the floor and held there\nuntil prompted by the CVIS or smokemeter to release the pedal. For those\nvehicles with electronic engine controls, engine diagnostic equipment should be\nused to allow acceleration to governed speed. (9)\n\nRepeat procedures described in paragraph\n(8) of this subdivision at least four more times. This shall include, at a\nminimum, two preliminary snap accelerations to remove loose soot from the\nexhaust system for a stabilized reading, and a minimum of three snap\naccelerations for the official test, the average of which shall constitute the\nfinal test result. (10)\n\nThe CVIS or\nthe NYSDEC certified smokemeter shall make the pass/fail determination which\nshall be based upon three valid smoke opacity test results averaged\narithmetically and compared to the pass/fail standards appropriate for the\nengine model year. (11)\n\nWhen\napplicable, i ssue a printout including the items listed in paragraph (a)(2) of\nthis section. Table 3\n\nEngine Horsepower Rating vs. Nominal Stack Size\n\nManufacturer's rated\nhorsepower\n\nNominal stack size in\ninches\n\nLess than 101\n2\n101-200\n3\n201-300\n4\n301 and over\n5\n(c) a smokemeter used to measure smoke\nopacity in the exhaust emissions of a HDDV during a roadside emissions or\nNYSDOT bus inspection does not need to include the following: (1)\nan engine oil temperature sensor; and\n(2)\nan engine RPM\nsensor.
