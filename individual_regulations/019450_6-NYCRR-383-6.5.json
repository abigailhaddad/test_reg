(1)\n\nAlternate trust. The permittee\nmay obtain alternate coverage required by this Subpart through the use of an\nalternate trust that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and section\n383-6.12\n(a) of\nthis Subpart. The executed alternate agreement must be submitted to the\ntrustee(s) of the trust(s) established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart for which\nthe alternate trust is providing alternate coverage. (i) The permittee must submit an executed\nalternate trust agreement to the trustee of the trust for which the alternate\ntrust is providing alternate coverage and an originally signed duplicate to the\ndepartment. If the alternate trust is used as part of the financial assurance\nplan in effect before the operation period, the alternate trust must be in\neffect at least 60 days prior to initial receipt of waste at the land disposal\nfacility. (ii)\nA trust used as an\nalternate financial method or instrument must be funded, at the time the\nalternate trust agreement is executed, for the full amount of the difference\nbetween: (a) the amount determined pursuant\nto sections 383-6.6 through\n383-6.8\nand sections 383-6.9 and\n383-6.10\nof this Subpart, and the\namount held in the trusts established pursuant to section\n383-6.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart; or\n(b) the amount held in\nsuch trusts established pursuant to section\n383-6.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart and the amount provided by such alternate financial assurance methods\nor instruments established pursuant to subdivision (m) of this\nsection. (iii)\n\nThe\nalternate trust must be funded by a single lump-sum payment by the permittee\ninto the alternate trust at the time the alternate trust agreement becomes\neffective. (iv)\n\nThe alternate trust\nagreement must be identical to the wording required by section\n383-6.12\n(a) of\nthis Subpart and must be accompanied by a formal acknowledgment. (v) The permittee must appoint the trustee to\nsupervise and manage the alternate trust. The appointment of the initial, and\nany subsequent, trustee is subject to the prior written approval of the\ndepartment. The trustee(s) of the alternate trust(s) must be an entity that has\nthe authority to act as a trustee and whose trust operations are regulated by a\n\nFederal or State agency. The trustee's duties are limited to the duties set\nforth in the trust instrument required pursuant to section\n383-6.12\n(a) of\nthis Subpart. (vi)\n\nFollowing a\ndetermination by the department that funds are required for purposes for which\nthe alternate trust guarantees funds, the trustee(s) of the alternate trust(s)\nmust provide such funds to the trustee(s) of the trust(s) established pursuant\nto section\n383-6.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart, as directed by the department. (vii)\n\nIf expenditures are made from the\nalternate trust, the trustee of each such trust must: (a) calculate the revised value of the\nalternate trust; (b) send written\nnotification of the revised amount to the permittee, the department, and the\ntrustee(s) of the trust(s), established pursuant to section\n383-6.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart, for which the alternate trust provides alternate financial assurance; and\n(c) send such notification\nwithin 30 days of the time such funds are paid. (viii)\n\nThe permittee may terminate the\nalternate trust provided the department has given its prior written consent\nbased on receipt of documents from the permittee of alternate financial\nassurance as required by subdivision (k) of this section. After the department\ncertifies in writing that the financial assurance for which the alternate trust\nwas created is no longer necessary, the trustee(s) of the alternate trust must\ntransfer any funds remaining in the trust to the permittee. (2)\n\nSurety bond. A permittee may\nobtain alternate coverage required by this Subpart through the use of\nperformance surety bonds or payment surety bonds. A performance surety bond may\nbe used only to provide alternate coverage for implementation of the closure\nplan, post-closure plan, and institutional control plan. A payment surety bond\nmay be used to provide alternate coverage for implementation of the closure\nplan, post-closure plan, and institutional control plan, and/or coverage\nrequired by sections 383-6.9 and\n383-6.10\nof this Subpart for\nremediation of failures and third party compensation. (i) A surety bond must conform to the\nrequirements of this paragraph and section\n383-6.12\n(b) or (c)\nof this Subpart. The permittee must submit the surety bond to the trustee(s) of\nthe trust(s) for which the surety bond is providing alternate coverage and an\noriginally signed duplicate to the department. If the surety bond is used as\npart of the financial assurance plan in effect before the operation period, the\nsurety bond must be in effect at least 60 days prior to the initial receipt of\nwaste by the land disposal facility. The surety company issuing the surety bond\nmust, at a minimum, be among those listed as acceptable sureties on Federal\nsurety bonds in Circular 570 of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the surety bond must be\nidentical to the wording specified by section\n383-6.12\n(b) or (c)\nof this Subpart. (iii)\n\nThe payment\nsurety bond must guarantee that if the permittee fails to fulfill any of the\nobligations, established pursuant to this Subpart, for which the payment bond\nguarantees funds, then the surety must provide funds, up to the amount of the\npenal sum of the bond, to the trustee(s) of the trust(s) established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department. (iv)\n\nThe performance surety bond must guarantee that the surety will: (a) perform the activities specified by the\nclosure plan, post-closure plan, and/or institutional control plan if the\npermittee fails to perform the activities specified by the closure plan, the\npost-closure plan, or the institutional control plan; or\n(b) make payments to the trustee(s) of the\ntrust(s) established by section 383- 6.4 of this Subpart, as directed by the\ndepartment in writing, up to an amount equal to the penal sum of the\nperformance surety bond. Following a determination by the department that the\npermittee has not implemented the closure plan, post-closure plan, or\ninstitutional control plan, the surety must undertake the required performance, or provide funds to the trustee of the closure, post-closure and institutional\ntrust, as directed by the department, to pay for the necessary performance, up\nto the amount of the penal sum of the performance surety bond. (v) The penal sum of the surety\nbond, when combined with funds in the trust(s) established pursuant to section\n383-6.4\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart for which the surety bond is providing alternate coverage and any other\nfinancial assurance method or instrument which guarantees funds to such trust, must be at least equal to the amount required pursuant to section\n383-6.4\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. (vi)\n\nUnder the terms of\nthe surety bond, the surety may cancel the surety bond by sending notice of\ncancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the permittee, the\ndepartment, and the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the surety is\nproviding alternate coverage not less than 90 days prior to the renewal date\nfor the surety bond. (a) The surety must not\ncancel the surety bond unless the permittee has: (1)\nobtained alternate financial assurance\nmethods or instruments; (2)\nreceived approval from the department for such financial assurance methods or\ninstruments in accordance with subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section; and\n(3)\nmet the above requirements\nof subclauses (1) and (2) of this clause no later than 30 days after the\npermittee received notice of cancellation. (b) If the permittee fails to obtain an\nalternate financial assurance method or instrument acceptable to the department\nin accordance with subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section, then the surety\nmust provide funds, up to the amount of the penal sum of the bond, to the\ntrustee(s) of the trust(s) established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department. (vii)\n\nThe permittee may cancel the surety\nbond if the department has given prior written consent based on receipt of\ndocumentation from the permittee of an alternate financial assurance method or\ninstrument as required by subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section. (3)\n\nLetter of credit. A permittee\nmay obtain alternate coverage required by this Subpart through the use of an\nirrevocable standby letter of credit that conforms to the requirements of this\nparagraph and section\n383-6.12\n(d) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The permittee must submit\nthe letter of credit to the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the letter of\ncredit is providing alternate coverage and an originally signed duplicate to\nthe department. If the letter of credit is used as part of the financial\nassurance plan in effect before the operation period, the letter of credit must\nbe in effect at least 60 days prior to the initial receipt of waste by the land\ndisposal facility. The institution issuing the letter of credit must be an\nentity that has the authority to issue letters of credit and whose letter of\ncredit operations are regulated and examined by a Federal or State\nagency. (ii)\n\nThe wording of the\nletter of credit must be identical to the wording required by section\n383-6.12\n(f) of\nthis Subpart. (iii)\n\nThe firm\nissuing the letter of credit must hold a rating in one of the three highest\nrating grades (i.e., within the A range) as determined by a nationally\nrecognized independent rating agency (e.g., Moody's, Standard and\n\nPoor's). (iv)\n\nThe letter of credit\nmust be accompanied by a letter from the permittee which: (a) identifies the letter of credit by\nnumber, issuing institution, and date; and\n(b) states the name and address of the land\ndisposal facility, and the amount of funds assured by the letter of\ncredit. (v) The letter\nof credit must be irrevocable and issued for a period of at least one year. The\nletter of credit must provide that the expiration date will be automatically\nextended for a period of at least one year unless the issuing institution\ndecides not to extend the expiration date and sends notice of that decision by\ncertified mail, return receipt requested: (a) to the permittee, the department, and the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which\nthe letter of credit is providing alternate coverage; and\n(b) within at least 90 days before the\ncurrent expiration date. Under the terms of the letter of credit, the 90 days\nwill begin on the date when the permittee, the department, and the trustee(s)\nof the trust(s) for which the letter of credit is providing alternate coverage\nhave received the notice, as evidenced by the return receipts. (vi)\n\nThe permittee must establish\nalternate financial assurance methods or instruments as required by\nsubdivisions (j) and (k) of this section and obtain written approval of such\nalternate financial assurance instruments from the department within 60 days\nafter receipt of a notice from the issuing institution of a decision not to\nextend the expiration date of the letter of credit. (vii)\n\nIf the permittee does not obtain\nalternate financial methods or instruments within such 60-day period, the\nissuing institution must provide funds, up to the aggregate amount of the\nletter of credit, to the trustee(s) of the trusts established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department. The department may delay this required transfer of\nfunds if the issuing institution grants in writing an extension of the term of\nthe letter of credit. During the last 30 days of any such extension, the\ndepartment may draw on the letter of credit if the permittee has failed to\nestablish alternate financial assurance methods or instruments as required by\nsubdivisions (j) and (k) of this section and has failed to obtain written\napproval of such alternate financial assurance methods or instruments from the\ndepartment. (viii)\n\nFollowing a\ndetermination by the department that funds are required for purposes of which\nthe letter of credit guarantees funds, the issuing institution must provide\nsuch funds, up to the aggregate amount of the letter of credit, to the\ntrustee(s) of the trust(s) established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department. (ix)\n\nThe department must direct the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the letter\nof credit is providing alternate financial assurance to return the letter of\ncredit to the issuing institution for termination when a permittee substitutes\nalternate financial methods or instruments as required by subdivisions (j) and\n(k) of this section. (4)\n\nLiability insurance. A permittee may obtain alternate coverage required by this\n\nSubpart for remediation of failures or personal injury and property damage to\nthird parties caused by the operation of the land disposal facility through the\nuse of liability insurance that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph\nand section\n383-6.12\n(e) of\nthis Subpart. The permittee must submit such insurance policy and certificate\nof insurance to the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the insurance policy\nis providing alternate coverage and an originally signed duplicate of each to\nthe department. The permittee may use liability insurance only for coverage of\nremediation of failures and for personal injury and property damage to third\nparties caused by the operation of the land disposal facility. (i) A permittee must submit the certificate\nof insurance required by subdivision\n383-6.12\n(e) of\nthis Subpart and a copy of the liability insurance policy to the trustee(s) of\nthe trust(s) for which the liability insurance is providing alternate coverage\nand an originally signed duplicate to the department. If the liability\ninsurance is used as part of the financial assurance plan in effect before the\noperation period, the liability insurance policy must be in effect at least 60\ndays prior to the initial receipt of waste by the land disposal facility. At a\nminimum, the insurer must be authorized by the Superintendent of the New York\n\nState Insurance Department to conduct the business of insurance, or eligible to\nprovide insurance as an excess or surplus lines insurer in New York\n\nState. (ii)\n\nThe insurance policy\nmust be issued for a limit of liability at least equal to the coverage amount\nrequired by sections 383-6.9 and\n383-6.10\nof this Subpart, except as\nprovided in subdivision (n) of this section. (iii)\n\nThe liability insurance policy must\nguarantee that funds will be available immediately upon determination that a\nvalid claim has been presented to provide payments up to an amount equal to the\nlimits of liability. (iv)\n\nThe\npermittee must maintain the policy in full force and effect until the\ndepartment consents to termination of the policy by the permittee. The\npermittee must pay all premiums when due and perform all other actions\nnecessary to maintain the insurance policy in full force and effect. Failure to\npay the premium, without substitution of alternate financial methods or\ninstruments, constitutes a violation of these regulations. Such violation shall\nbe deemed to begin upon receipt by the department of notice of future\ncancellation, termination, or failure to renew due to nonpayment of the\npremium, rather than upon the expiration date of the insurance\npolicy. (v) The liability policy\nmust provide that the insurer may not cancel, terminate, or fail to renew the\npolicy except for the permittee's failure to pay the premium. The automatic\nrenewal of the policy must, at a minimum, provide the insured with the option\nof renewal at the limits of liability of the expiring policy. If the permittee\nfails to pay the premium, the insurer may elect to cancel, terminate, or fail\nto renew the policy by sending notice by certified mail, return receipt\nrequested, to the permittee, the department, and the trustee(s) of the trust(s)\nfor which the insurance policy is providing alternate financial assurance. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew may not occur during the 120\ndays beginning with the date of receipt of the notice by the permittee, the\ndepartment, and the trustee(s), of the trust(s) for which the insurance policy\nis providing alternate financial assurance, as evidenced by the return\nreceipts. Cancellation, termination, or failure to renew must not occur and the\npolicy must remain in full force and effect in the event that on or before the\nexpiration date of the insurance policy: (a) the department determines that the land disposal facility has been abandoned; or\n(b) the permit issued by the\ndepartment is terminated or revoked or a permit renewal is denied; or\n(c) closure is ordered by the department, any\nother agency with regulatory jurisdiction over the land disposal facility, or a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction; (d) the premium due is paid; or\n(e) the permittee is named as a debtor in a\nvoluntary or involuntary bankruptcy proceeding. (vi)\n\nThe permittee must obtain written\napproval from the department to terminate the insurance policy when the\npermittee substitutes an alternate financial assurance method or instrument as\nrequired by subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section. (5)\n\nGuarantee. The permittee may obtain\nalternate coverage required by this Subpart through the use of a written\nguarantee that conforms to the requirements of this paragraph and section\n383-6.12\n(f) of\nthis Subpart. (i) The permittee must submit\nsuch guarantee to the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the guarantee is\nproviding alternate assurance and an originally signed duplicate to the\ndepartment. If the guarantee is used as part of the financial assurance plan in\neffect before the operation period, the guarantee must be in effect at least 60\ndays prior to initial receipt of waste at the land disposal facility. (ii)\n\nThe guarantor may be a corporate or\nother legal or financial affiliate of the permittee. (iii)\nA guarantor must provide proof that it\nis capable of providing the financial assurances being guaranteed on behalf of\nthe permittee by submitting documentation to the department containing\ninformation sufficient to allow the department to evaluate the suitability of\nthe guarantee as an alternate financial assurance method or instrument. The\ninformation must include, but is not limited to: (a) name, address, partnerships (and\nproportion of ownership) and state of incorporation of the firm seeking to\nprovide the guarantee, the form of its business organization, and the\nguarantor's business relationship to the facility owner or operator (such as\n\"subsidiary\", \"affiliate\", etc.); (b) copy of the applicant's articles of\nincorporation and bylaws or other similar documents, if the applicant is not an\nindividual (e.g.,corporation); (c) past experience as a guarantor, including whether the guarantor has ever\nqualified as a guarantor in any state, whether such authority has ever been\nrevoked, whether the guarantor has ever defaulted on any previous guarantees, and whether an application to act as a guarantor has ever been\ndenied; (d) copies of any\nguarantees provided to the proposed guarantor by any parent or holding\ncompanies of the proposed guarantor regarding the project; (e) details concerning the guarantor's past\nand present insurance coverage; (f) rationale for the applicant to act as guarantor, including but not limited to\ncost savings; (g) balance sheets, income and profit and loss statements of the guarantor prepared by an\nindependent certified public accountant; (h) information concerning reserves, guarantees, or other support for the guarantee; (i) information concerning legal\nauthorization or power to provide a guarantee; (j) copies of the last three years of any\nrating of the applicant's firm by a bond rating service (e.g., Moody's or\n\nStandard and Poor's); (k) description of any litigation involving the guarantor that may have a negative\neconomic impact on its operations; (l) information concerning authorization by\nstockholders, directors, or other firm owners of power to provide the\nguarantee; and\n(m) any other\ninformation required by the department at the time of application. (iv)\n\nThe guarantee must be\nidentical to the wording required by section 383- 6.12(d) of this Subpart. The\nterms of the guarantee must provide that: (a) if the permittee fails to implement the closure plan, the post-closure plan, or\nthe institutional control plan, in accordance with the directions of the\ndepartment whenever required to do so, the guarantor must provide funds, up to\nthe full amount of the guarantee, to the trustee(s) of the trusts established\nby section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department; and/or\n(b) if the permittee fails to remediate\nfailures or to compensate third parties for judgments, releases, or settlements\nfor personal injury or for property damage caused by the operation of the land\ndisposal facility to which the guarantee applies, the guarantor must provide\nfunds, up to the full amount of the guarantee, to the trustee(s) of the\ntrust(s) established by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department; (c) under the terms of the guarantee, the guarantor may cancel the guarantee by\nsending notice of cancellation by certified mail, return receipt requested to\nthe permittee, the department, and the trustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the\nguarantee is providing alternate financial assurance. Cancellation must not\noccur, however, during the 90 days beginning on the date of receipt of the\nnotice of cancellation by the permittee, the department, and the trustee(s) of\nthe trust(s) for which the guarantee is providing alternate financial\nassurance; and\n(d) the guarantor\nmust provide up to the full amount of the guarantee: (1)\nalternate financial assurance\ninstrument(s) in the name of the permittee; or\n(2)\nfunds to the trustee(s) of the trust(s)\nestablished by section\n383-6.4\nof this Subpart, as\ndirected by the department in the event that: (i) the permittee fails to provide alternate\nfinancial assurance methods or instruments as required by subdivisions (j) and\n(k) of this section; (ii)\nobtain\nthe written approval of such alternate financial assurance methods or\ninstruments from the department; and\n(iii)\nobtain such approval within 60 days\nafter receipt of a notice of cancellation by the permittee, the department, and\ntrustee(s) of the trust(s) for which the guarantee is providing alternate\nfinancial assurance. (v) The department may require the guarantor\nto submit reports of its financial condition at any time. If the department\nfinds, on the basis of such reports or other information, that the guarantor no\nlonger is capable of providing the financial assurance guaranteed, the\npermittee must, within 30 days after notification by the department of such a\nfinding, provide alternate financial assurance method(s) or instrument(s) as\nrequired by subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section, and obtain written\napproval of such alternate financial method(s) or instrument(s) from the\ndepartment. (vi)\n\nThe department may\ndetermine that the guarantor fails to meet the requirements of this section on\nthe basis of qualifications in an opinion expressed in a report of an\nindependent certified public accountant on examination of the guarantor's\nfinancial statements. An adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion will be\ncause for such a determination. The department may evaluate other\nqualifications on an individual basis. (vii)\n\nThe permittee may cancel the guarantee\nif the department has given prior written consent based on receipt of\ndocumentation from the permittee of an alternate financial method or instrument\nas required by subdivisions (j) and (k) of this section. (n) Use of multiple alternate\nfinancial instruments.
