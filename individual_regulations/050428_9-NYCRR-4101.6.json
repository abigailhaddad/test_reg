(b) A statutorily\ndesignated harness track may elect upon 30 days' written notice to the\ncommission (and a copy to the Tax Commission) to withhold, in addition to any\nother amounts required by this section, one percent of the total deposits in\npools resulting from regular and multiple bets; provided, however, that any\nharness track (or, in the case of Buffalo Raceway, the county agricultural\nsociety that is deemed to be a harness track for purposes of this section)\nwithholding pursuant to this subdivision shall use such one percent exclusively\nfor capital improvements, as defined in subdivision (a) of this section, subject to the following provisions: (1)\n\nAll\namounts withheld by a track on and after such 30-day written notice to the\ncommission, as well as all monies paid over to the track by off-track betting\ncorporations from additional withholding mandated upon such corporations\npursuant to such law (section 527[5-a]), shall be deposited in a segregated\ninterest-bearing account designated \"Retention for Capital Construction\"\naccount. A track may withdraw monies from such account for the purposes of\ninvestment in segregated certificates of deposit or government securities, provided that the entire proceeds of such investments, including interest or\ndividends therefrom, are redeposited in such account within two years of such\nwithdrawal.

(4)\n\nNo monies may be withdrawn from such\naccount except for investments permitted pursuant to subdivision (c) of this\nsection or in payment for capital improvements for which a permit has been\nissued by the commission. (5)\n\nWithin 30 days of the end of the calendar year, such track shall submit a\nreport to the commission, showing the balance of the account at the beginning\nof the year, the total added and the total withdrawn during the year, and the\nbalance at the end of the year listing each bank account and investment.
