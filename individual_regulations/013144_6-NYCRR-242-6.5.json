  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 242-6.5 - Compliance\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Allowances\navailable for compliance deduction'. CO\n2\nallowances that\nmeet the following criteria are available to be deducted in order for a\nCO\n2\nbudget source to comply with the\nCO\n2\nrequirements of subdivision\n242-1.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart for a control period or an interim control period. (1)\n\nThe CO\n2\nallowances, other than CO\n2\noffset allowances, are of\nallocation years that fall within a prior control period, the same control\nperiod or the same interim control period for which the allowances will be\ndeducted. (2)\n\nThe\nCO\n2\nallowances are held in the\nCO\n2\nbudget source's compliance account as of the\nCO\n2\nallowance transfer deadline for that control period\nor interim control period or are transferred into the compliance account by a\nCO\n2\nallowance transfer correctly submitted for\nrecordation under section\n242-7.1\nof this Part by the\nCO\n2\nallowance transfer deadline for that control period\nor interim control period. (3)\n\nFor\nCO\n2\noffset allowances, the number of\nCO\n2\noffset allowances that are available to be deducted\nin order for a CO\n2\nbudget source to comply with the\nCO\n2\nrequirements under subdivision\n242-1.5\n(c) of this\n\nPart for a control period or an interim control period may not exceed 3.3\npercent of the CO\n2\nbudget source's\nCO\n2\nemissions for that control period, or of 0.50 times\nthe CO\n2\nbudget source's CO\n2\nemissions for an interim control period, as determined in accordance with this\n\nSubpart and Subpart 242-8 of this Part. (4)\n\nThe CO\n2\nallowances\nare not necessary for deductions for excess emissions for a prior control\nperiod under subdivision (d) of this section. (b) 'Deductions for compliance'. Following\nthe recordation, in accordance with section\n242-7.2\nof this Part, of\nCO\n2\nallowance transfers submitted for recordation in the\nCO\n2\nbudget source's compliance account by the\nCO\n2\nallowance transfer deadline for a control period or\ninterim control period, the department or its agent will deduct\nCO\n2\nallowances available under subdivision (a) of this\nsection to cover the source's CO\n2\nemissions (as\ndetermined in accordance with Subpart 242-8 of this Part) for the control\nperiod or interim control period, as follows: (1)\nuntil the amount of\nCO\n2\nallowances deducted equals the number of tons of\ntotal CO\n2\nemissions less the CO\n2\nallowances deducted to meet the requirements of paragraph 242-1.5(c)(2) of this\n\nPart with respect to the previous two interim control periods, or 0.50 times\nthe number of tons of total CO\n2\nemissions for an interim\ncontrol period, less any CO\n2\nemissions attributable to\nthe burning of eligible biomass, determined in accordance with Subpart 242-8 of\nthis Part from all CO\n2\nbudget units at the\nCO\n2\nbudget source for the control period or interim\ncontrol period; or\n(2)\nif there are\ninsufficient CO\n2\nallowances to complete the deductions\nin paragraph (1) of this subdivision, until no more CO\n2\nallowances available under subdivision (a) of this section remain in the\ncompliance account. (c) 'Identification of available CO\n2\nallowances by serial\nnumber; default compliance deductions'. (1)\n\nThe CO\n2\nauthorized account representative for a source's\ncompliance account may request that specific CO\n2\nallowances, identified by serial number, in the compliance account be deducted\nfor emissions or excess emissions for a control period or interim control\nperiod in accordance with subdivision (b) or (d) of this section. Such\nidentification shall be made in the compliance certification report submitted\nin accordance with section\n242-4.1\nof this Part. (2)\n\nThe department or its agent will deduct\nCO\n2\nallowances for a control period or interim control\nperiod from the CO\n2\nbudget source's compliance account, in the absence of an identification or in the case of a partial identification\nof available CO\n2\nallowances by serial number under\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, in the following order: (i) First, subject to the relevant compliance\ndeduction limitations under paragraphs (a)(3) and (d)(1) of this section, CO\n2\noffset allowances. CO\n2\noffset\nallowances shall be deducted in chronological order ('i.e.', CO\n2\noffset allowances from earlier allocation years\nshall be deducted before CO\n2\noffset allowances from\nlater allocation years). In the event that some, but not all\nCO\n2\noffset allowances from a particular allocation year\nare to be deducted, CO\n2\nallowances shall be deducted by\nserial number, with lower serial numbered allowances deducted before higher\nserial numbered allowances. (ii)\n\nSecond, any CO\n2\nallowances, other than\nCO\n2\noffset allowances, which are available for deduction\nunder subdivision (a) of this section. CO\n2\nallowances\nshall be deducted in chronological order ('i.e.', CO\n2\nallowances from earlier allocation years shall be deducted before\nCO\n2\nallowances from later allocation years). In the\nevent that some, but not all CO\n2\nallowances from a\nparticular allocation year are to be deducted, CO\n2\nallowances shall be deducted by serial number, with lower serial numbered\nallowances deducted before higher serial numbered allowances. (d) 'Deductions for\nexcess emissions'. (1)\n\nAfter making the\ndeductions for compliance under subdivision (b) of this section, the department\nor its agent will deduct from the CO\n2\nbudget source's\ncompliance account a number of CO\n2\nallowances, equal to\nthree times the number of the source's excess emissions. In the event that a\nsource has insufficient CO\n2\nallowances to cover three\ntimes the number of the source's excess emissions, the source shall be required\nto immediately transfer sufficient allowances into its compliance account. No\nCO\n2\noffset allowances may be deducted to account for the\nsource's excess emissions. (2)\n\nAny\nCO\n2\nallowance deduction required under paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision shall not affect the liability of the owners and operators of\nthe CO\n2\nbudget source or the CO\n2\nunits at the source for any fine, penalty, or assessment, or their obligation\nto comply with any other remedy, for the same violation, as ordered under\napplicable State law. The following guidelines will be followed in assessing\nfines, penalties or other obligations. (i) For purposes of determining the number of days of violation, if a\nCO\n2\nbudget source has excess emissions for a control\nperiod, each day in the control period constitutes a day in violation unless\nthe owners and operators of the unit demonstrate that a lesser number of days\nshould be considered. (ii)\n\nEach ton\nof excess emissions is a separate violation. (iii)\n\nFor the purposes of determining the\nnumber of days of violation, if a CO\n2\nbudget source has\nexcess interim emissions for an interim control period, each day in the interim\ncontrol period constitutes a day in violation unless the owners and operators\nof the unit demonstrate that a lesser number of days should be\nconsidered. (iv)\n\nEach ton of excess\ninterim emissions is a separate violation. (3)\n\nThe propriety of the department's\ndetermination that a CO\n2\nbudget source had excess\nemissions and the concomitant deduction of CO\n2\nallowances from that CO\n2\nbudget source's account may be\nlater challenged in the context of the initial administrative enforcement, or\nany civil or criminal judicial action arising from or encompassing that excess\nemissions violation. The commencement or pendency of any administrative\nenforcement, or civil or criminal judicial action arising from or encompassing\nthat excess emissions violation will not act to prevent the department or its\nagent from initially deducting the CO\n2\nallowances\nresulting from the department's original determination that the relevant\nCO\n2\nbudget source has had excess emissions. Should the\ndepartment's determination of the existence or extent of the\nCO\n2\nbudget source's excess emissions be revised either\nby a settlement or final conclusion of any administrative or judicial action, the department will act as follows. (i) In any\ninstance where the department's determination of the extent of excess emissions\nwas too low, the department will take further action under paragraphs (1) and\n(2) of this subdivision to address the expanded violation. (ii)\n\nIn any instance where the department's\ndetermination of the extent of excess emissions was too high, the department\nwill distribute to the relevant CO\n2\nbudget source a\nnumber of CO\n2\nallowances equaling the number of\nCO\n2\nallowances deducted which are attributable to the\ndifference between the original and final quantity of excess emissions. Should\nsuch CO\n2\nbudget source's compliance account no longer\nexist, the CO\n2\nallowances will be provided to a general\naccount selected by the owner or operator of the CO\n2\nbudget source from which they were originally deducted. (e) The department or its agent\nwill record in the appropriate compliance account all deductions from such an\naccount pursuant to Subdivisions (b) and (d) of this section. (f) 'Action by the department on\nsubmissions'. (1)\n\nThe department may review\nand conduct independent audits concerning any submission under the\nCO\n2\n\nBudget Trading Program and make appropriate\nadjustments of the information in the submissions. (2)\n\nThe department may deduct\nCO\n2\nallowances from or transfer\nCO\n2\nallowances to a source's compliance account based on\ninformation in the submissions, as adjusted under paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision.
