Tit. 9 § 4080.4 - Registration and de-registration\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo horse shall be considered as a New York-bred\nthoroughbred unless such horse is so registered by the fund. Should the fund be\nsatisfied that grounds exist to cancel or void a registration it may so\ndetermine and order any monies of the fund due any person as a result of such\nquestionable registration held, and if paid, to be returned to the fund for\nproper disposition. In addition, pending such determination, the fund shall be\nempowered to order retention of such monies as may be payable as a result of\nany questionable registration, for proper disposition, upon its final\ndetermination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n4080.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
