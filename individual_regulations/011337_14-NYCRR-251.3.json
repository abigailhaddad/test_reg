(1)\nA permanent employee, or an employee holding a position by permanent or temporary appointment who\nrequests leave because of pregnancy or childbirth, may, in the discretion of\nthe department, be granted a leave of absence, without pay, for a period not\nexceeding two years. Such leave may be extended beyond two years, for periods\naggregating not in excess of an additional two years, only with the approval of\nthe Civil Service Commission. In an exceptional case, a further extension may\nbe permitted by the commission for good cause shown and where the interests of\nthe government would be served. For the purposes of this section, time spent in\nactive service in the military forces of the United States or of the State of\n\nNew York shall not be considered in computing the period of leave.

(b) Successive leaves of absence. Where a leave of absence without pay has been granted for a period which\naggregates two years, or more if extended pursuant to subdivision (a) of this\nsection, a further leave of absence without pay shall not be granted unless the\nemployee returns to his/her position and serves continuously therein for six\nmonths immediately preceding the subsequent leave of absence.
