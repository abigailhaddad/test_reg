  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 5.4 - Requests for documents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) After a\nproceeding is commenced and until any cut-off point that the presiding officer\nmay set, any party may serve a written request for documents (including\nwritings, drawings, and electronically stored information) on any other party. The request shall describe the documents sought with reasonable particularity, though the description may be by clearly defined category rather than by item. A copy of every request shall be served on each party, and on the presiding\nofficer, if he or she so requests. (b) Except as provided below, a party to whom\na request for a document is addressed shall furnish a copy of the document to\nthe requesting party within 10 days of service of the request. A copy of each\ndocument shall be provided to any presiding officer or party who so requests. Electronic service of a copy of the document satisfies this\nobligation. (c) If the party from\nwhich a document is sought cannot provide a copy within 10 days, it shall, within the 10 days, so inform the requesting party and state when the copy will\nbe forthcoming. Any ensuing dispute over timing of the response shall be\nsubmitted to the presiding officer for resolution. (d) Any objection to a document request shall\nbe made in writing and served on all parties and the presiding officer within\n10 days of service of the request. The document need not be supplied while the\nobjection remains pending. If the presiding officer overrules the objection, the document shall be supplied within five days following the issuance of the\nruling or within 10 days following service of the request, whichever is\nlater. (e) If a requested document\nis voluminous, the responding party may permit the requesting party to examine\nthe document at the responding party's office and then supply a copy of only so\nmuch of the document as the requesting party finds it needs. The times, locations, and conditions for such examination shall be reasonable, and the\npresiding officer shall ensure that responding parties do not use this option\nto impose unfair burdens on requesting parties or otherwise hinder\ndiscovery. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n5.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
