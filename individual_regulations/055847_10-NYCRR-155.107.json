  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 155.107 - New york inter-urban water company\n\nState Regulations\n(a) [Application.] The rules and regulations hereinafter given, duly made and enacted in accordance with the provisions of sections 70, 71 and 72 of the Public Health Law heretofore set forth shall apply to that portion of the drainage area of Mamaroneck Creek which forms or is tributary to the source of water supply of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company of Westchester County, N. Y. They shall also apply to the reservoirs and to the coagulation basins of the said company. (b) [Definitions.]\n(1)\n\nThe term reservoir wherever used in this section is intended to mean and refer to any reservoir or coagulation basins of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company. (2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and include every spring, pond (other than the artificial reservoirs and coagulations basins), stream, ditch, gutter or other channel or permeable pipe or conduit of every kind, the water of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flows or may flow into the water supply of the said New York Inter-Urban Water Company. (3)\n\nWherever a linear distance of a structure or object from a reservoir or from a watercourse is mentioned in this section, it is intended to mean the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to any reservoir or watercourse. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed or maintained with its nearest point within 50 feet of any reservoir or watercourse of the water supply of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company, except the properly constructed and operated sewage treatment plant as hereinafter set forth in subdivision (e), provided, however, that the property on which the privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle intended for the deposit of human excreta is built or to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance above named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (2)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle, used or intended for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta and built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision cannot be obtained within the limits of such property, shall be placed as far as possible from the reservoir or watercourse and shall be especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight vessels or receptacles are provided, they shall be placed in watertight concrete or masonry receptacles and shall be located as far as practicable from the reservoir or watercourse. All receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed only with the approval of and under the supervision of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company and so located that the tops of such receptacles shall be above the highest known water level of Mamaroneck Creek or tributaries. (3)\n\nWhenever a privy, privy vault, pit or other receptacle of any kind used for either the temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta is especially constructed and made watertight and located nearer the reservoir or watercourse than the distances named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, such receptacle shall be emptied at regular intervals and disinfected as often as may be necessary to maintain it in a proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow and in the case of a property occupied by the owner during the summer only, the said receptacle shall be emptied at least once every fall at the end of the summer season, disinfected with lime and left empty during the winter. The work of emptying and disinfecting these receptacles shall be done under the supervision of or in accordance with the directions of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company and in such a manner as to effectually prevent any pollution of the public water supply of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company and in a manner provided hereinafter in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed or maintained with its nearest point within 150 point of any reservoir or watercourse of the water supply of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company. (5)\n\nEvery privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or other receptacle or place, used for the temporary storage of human excreta, which is constructed, located or maintained within the aforesaid 150 feet, horizontal measurement, of the water line of any reservoir or the edge, margin or precipitous bank of any watercourse of the water supply of the New York Inter-Urban Water Company, from which privy or other receptacle the excreta are not at once removed automatically by means of suitable watertight pipes or conduits to some proper place of ultimate disposal, shall be arranged in such manner that all such excreta shall be received temporarily in suitable vessels or receptacles which shall at all times be maintained in an absolutely watertight condition and which will permit of convenient removal to some place of ultimate disposal as hereinafter set forth in paragraphs (6) and (7) of this subdivision. (6)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacles referred to in paragraph (5) of this subdivision shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleaned and deodorized as often as may be found necessary, in order to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundations or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (7)\n\nUnless otherwise specially ordered or permitted by the State Department of Health, the excreta collected in any aforesaid receptacles shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or by thoroughly digging it into the soil in such place and manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at distances not less than 300 feet, horizontal measurement, from the high-water mark of any reservoir or not less than 200 feet from the edge, margin or precipitous bank of any watercourse of the New York Inter-Urban water supply. (8)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, the excremental matter from any privy or any aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal or the garbage or wastes from any dump may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface or through the soil into any reservoir or watercourse in an imperfectly purified condition, then the said privy or receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal or the said garbage or waste dump shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
