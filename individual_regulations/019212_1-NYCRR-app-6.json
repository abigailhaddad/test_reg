Methods of Sanitization\nCHEMICAL\nCertain chemical compounds are effective for the sanitization\nof utensils, containers, and equipment. The bactericidal activity of such\ncompounds is influenced by temperature, hydrogen-ion concentration (pH), and, in some instances, by interfering substances in the water in which they are\nused. The activity of chemical sanitizers may also be adversely\naffected by ingredients in washing compounds and organic matter carried over\nfrom the wash solution. Consequently, a rinse between washing and bactericidal\ntreatment is important in maintaining the strength of solutions. Similarly, deposits of milk solids on utensil surfaces interfere with bactericidal\nactivity, and chemical sanitizers cannot be relied upon unless the surfaces to\nbe treated are clean. Temperature, pH and exposure time also influence the corrosive\naction of the chemical bactericides and sanitizers on materials used for\nproduct-contact surfaces of equipment, containers, utensils, and pipelines. Minimum treatment consistent with sanitizing requirements will aid in\npreserving the sanitary finish of surfaces. Hypochlorites.--Either calcium or sodium hypochlorite (stock\npowder or solution) is a satisfactory chemical sanitizer. An exposure period of at least 1 minute to at least 50 ppm\navailable chlorine should be maintained when the temperature is at least 75° F\n(24° C). Under these conditions, an exposure of 1 minute is considered adequate\nfor all hypochlorites, including the slower, more alkaline compounds. Lower\nsolution temperatures result in slower action; for each 18° F (10° C) drop in\ntemperature, approximately double the exposure time is needed to achieve\nequivalent bactericidal action with the same strength of solution. It is also\npossible to compensate for lower temperatures by increasing the concentration\nof the bactericide. Hypochlorite bactericides cannot be relied upon in the presence\nof large amounts of milk or other organic matter. A sharp decline in the\navailable chlorine content of a sanitizer following circulation through\nprocessing equipment is usually regarded as evidence of inadequate cleaning and\nshould be promptly investigated. When a spray is used in lieu of circulation or\nimmersion, the above specified concentrations of available chlorine should be\ndoubled. Organic Chlorine Compounds.--The bactericidal action of\nchloramine T, the chlorinated hydantoins, the chlorinated isocyanurates and\nother organic forms of chlorine are significantly affected by pH.A\nNote.--Trichloromelamine, an organic chlorine, may not be used\nto sanitize product containers and equipment. For example, with chloramine T solutions, the maximum pH which\ncan be tolerated and still provide satisfactory results at 200 ppm available\nchlorine is 7.2; at 100 ppm concentration it is 6.8; and at the 50 ppm level, 6.4. Thus, satisfactory results with formulations of the chemical based on the\nabove equivalent germicidal activities cannot be expected with products which\nionize in solutions to give pH values higher than 6.4. The practical value of\nchloramine T is limited to situations where long exposure periods are\npracticable, or where a low pH can be provided. Chlorinated hydantoin formulations giving solutions of pH 7.0\nand below should be satisfactory. Satisfactory results in chlorinated isocyanuric acid solutions\nof pH values up to 9.5 can be expected. The marked differences found in bactericidal activity of\norganic chlorine compounds over the pH range illustrate the necessity of\nestablishing the conditions of use, including concentration, from experimental\ndata. Quaternary Ammonium Compounds.--Continued field use has\nestablished that certain quaternary ammonium compounds are effective\nbactericides for the treatment of utensils, containers, and equipment. The\nbactericidal effectiveness of specific quaternary ammonium compounds varies and\nis influenced by the chemical nature and concentration of active agent, temperature, pH, exposure time, and by interfering substances present in\nnatural waters. It has been established that the interference of natural waters\nis due principally to bicarbonates, sulphates, and chlorides of calcium and\nmagnesium. B Ferrous bicarbonate may also interfere to a lesser degree but its\ninterference is minimized when the iron is oxidized. Any treatment which tends\nto precipitate, remove or inactivate calcium or magnesium reduces this\ninterference as do increased pH and temperature. Products containing n-alkyl (C\n8\n-C\n1\n8\ndimethyl benzyl ammonium\nchlorides, n-alkyl (C14-C18) dimethyl benzyl ammonium chlorides, alkyl dimethyl\ndichlorobenzyl ammonium chlorides and n-alkyl (C\n1\n2\n-C\n1\n8\n)\ndimethyl ethylbenzyl ammonium chlorides are effective in waters ranging from\n550 to 1,100 ppm hardness without added sequestering agents. Other quaternary\nproducts such as diisobutyl phenoxy ethoxy ethyl dimethyl benzyl ammonium\nchloride and methyl dodecyl benzyl trimethyl ammonium chloride-methyl dodecyl\nxylene bis (trimethyl ammonium chloride) require compounding with sufficient\nsodium tripolyphosphate to raise their hard water ceiling levels to a minimum\nof 500 ppm hardness at use concentrations. By proper formulation, however, levels up to 1,200 ppm are possible. The above products have been found to be\nbactericidally effective when used: 1. At concentrations of 200 ppm or more; 2. At pH levels of 5.0 or higher; 3. At temperatures of 75° F (24° C) or higher; and\n4. For a 30-second exposure period. The above-named compounds without sequestering agents are also\neffective within certain limits of water hardness under the conditions of use\nenumerated above however, the level of hardness at which bactericidal activity\nis reduced below that necessary for effective treatment, varies among the four\nnamed compounds and may be influenced by other ingredients in a proprietary\nformulation. Accordingly, the limiting hardness should be established for the\nuse of each quaternary ammonium product. Unless stated on the label,c the\nregulatory agency should request such information from the manufacturer. Bacteriological data should be used to establish the usefulness\nof the above named quaternary ammonium compounds and sequestering agents and\nany others: 1. At temperatures less than 75° F (24° C); or\n2. At a pH below 6.0; or\n3. When combined with a compatible sequestering agent in waters\nabove 500 ppm of hardness; or\n4. Without, or with less than, the specified amount of\nsequestering agent. Suggested methods and criteria are given in a following\nsubsection on Other Chemical Sanitizers. Iodine Compounds.--Another type of halogen sanitizer that has\nbeen found effective consists of a combination of iodine with certain nonionic\nsubstances. Although iodine is only slightly soluble in water and is volatile; in combination with nonionic wetting agents as an iodophor, it is readily\nsoluble in water and is less volatile. When diluted for use, iodophors have a\nlow pH which enhances their germicidal qualities. Increasing the temperatures\nof a sanitizing solution containing iodophors also increases its effectiveness, but above 120° F (49° C) iodine volatilizes, resulting in a decrease in\nsolution strength. In solution, iodophors are yellow or amber in color and the\nintensity is proportional to the concentration of iodine. Concentrations of\n12.5 ppm when used as a bactericide only and 25 ppm when used as a\ndetergent-sanitizer have been found effective. The concentration of iodine can\nbe determined by titration with sodium thiosulfate, and color tests for field\nuse are available. Since the bactericidal properties of different proprietary\nformulations may vary because of differences in ingredients and pH, their\neffectiveness may be evaluated by the use of a bacteriological test procedure\nsuch as that proposed by Weber and Black D or the Chambers modification\nthereofE. Detergent-Sanitizers. --Bactericides are sometimes combined\nwith detergents in proprietary formulations for the cleaning and bactericidal\ntreatment of containers, utensils, and equipment in a single operation. Such\nuse has been reported to be effective under certain conditions for the cleaning\nand bactericidal treatment of dairy farm equipment, milk tank trucks, and\nsimilar equipment. The limitations of detergent-sanitizer combinations should be\nunderstood if they are to be used effectively. Certain sanitizers and\ndetergents cannot be combined in solution without impairment of bactericidal\nproperties, cleaning properties, or both. In addition, the activity of a\ndetergent-sanitizer is likely to be reduced more rapidly by the presence of\nmilk solids and other organic matter in a combined operation than when\nbactericidal treatment is a separate process which follows cleaning. These factors tend to point up the fact that the usefulness of\na detergent- sanitizer for the combined cleaning and sanitizing treatment of\nproduct-contact surfaces is dependent on both the composition of the product\nand its intended use. \"Single-step\" operations are actually considered most\ndependable when the amount of detergent-sanitizer can be carefully proportioned\nto the exact needs of the equipment involved, assuring effective cleaning and\nsanitizing, while minimizing the chance of residual chemical deposits on the\nequipment treated. Further, and of equal importance to the above, is the need for\nthe protection between treatment and use of all product-contact surfaces so\nsanitized. The application of untreated rinse water; the handling of equipment, as in the assembly of milking machines on farms or piping systems in milk\nplants; and the exposure of treated surfaces to airborne contamination through\nextended storage periods all tend to downgrade the values suggested for\ndetergent-sanitizers. These precautions are suggested where detergent-sanitizers are\nused: 1. Equipment to be treated should be thoroughly\nprerinsed. 2. Solutions should be prepared and used according to\nmanufacturer's directions. 3. Treated equipment which is exposed to any of the hazards of\ncontamination described above should be resanitized prior to use. Other Chemical Sanitizers. --Bactericides other than those\ndescribed in the previous sections are also available which are suitable for\nuse on milk equipment. Compounds containing bromine and iodine have been found\nto be effective for bactericidal treatment. In addition, other types of\nchemical agents are being compounded into proprietary formulations for the\nbactericidal treatment of milk equipment; however, their bactericidal\neffectiveness varies with specific formulations. Such compounds should be safe, and the recommended conditions of usage should provide bactericidal treatment\nat least equal to that given by 50 ppm of chlorine as hypochlorite at pH 10.0, at a temperature of 75° F (24° C), and with an exposure period of 1\nminute.F\nSanitizing solutions should be prepared at a concentration such\nas to provide bactericidal effectiveness (for circulation and immersion\napplications) equivalent to that of hypochlorite solutions at a concentration\nof 50 ppm of available chlorine. The bactericidal efficiency of chemical compounds may be\nevaluated without direct comparison to chlorine. Suitable data may be obtained\nby use of a bacteriological test procedure such as that proposed by Weber and\n\nBlackD, or the Chambers modification thereof E. These tests provide better\ncomparative data at an endpoint somewhat less than total kill of the test\ncultures. Therefore, the test time is less than 1-minute exposure period\nprescribed in Section 7 of this Ordinance. Bactericides which, in recommended\nconcentration, produce a 99.999-percent kill of 75-125 million E. coli ATTC\n11229 and of 75- 125 million M. pyogenes var. aureus ATCC 6538, within 30, seconds at 70°-75° F (22°-24° C), should be considered satisfactory. Swab tests\nof treated equipment do not furnish sufficient data for this purpose. Valid\ndata can be obtained only when stock cultures and suspensions of the test\norganisms are prepared in a manner that uniformly maintains their normal level\nof resistance to germicidal action. Periodic checks to determine the\nconsistency of test results, using a well known chemical such as phenol, are\nhelpful in this regard. The importance of adhering strictly to the composition\nof mediums and manner of transplanting cultures specified in the test\nprocedures cannot be overemphasized. II. Sanitization of Assembled Equipment\nSTEAM\nWhen steam is used, each group of assembled piping shall be\ntreated separately by inserting the steam hose into the inlet and maintaining\nsteam flow from the outlet for at least 5 minutes after the temperature of the\ndrainage at the outlet has reached 200° F (94° C). (The period of exposure\nrequired here is longer than that required for individual cans, etc., because\nof the heat lost through the large surface exposed to the air.) Covers must be\nin place during treatment. HOT WATER\nHot water may be used by pumping it through the inlet if the\ntemperature at outlet end of the assembly is maintained to at least 170° F (77°\nC) for at least 5 minutes. CHEMICALS\nWhen chlorine or another chemical solution is used, the\nsolution appearing at the outlet end shall show in excess of the minimum\nrequired strength. The chemical solution shall be pumped through the entire\nequipment for at least 1 minute. Unions and other connectors should be slightly\nloosened to permit treatment of gaskets and threads, except on lines\ncleaned-in-place. Surfaces which are not reached by the chemical solution shall\nbe treated with steam as previously described, spray application of chemical\nsolution or by other acceptable means. Header ends and connecting piping of\ncabinet coolers should not be overlooked, since condensation from them may\nenter the collecting trough. Chemical sanitizing solutions should be prepared\nfresh for each use. TREATMENT OF EQUIPMENT\nThe treatment of milk cans, coolers, packaging machines, other\nequipment, and all parts thereof, requires special consideration. Large\nequipment may be treated by thorough swabbing with a bactericidal solution of\nadequate strength, allowing the solution film to remain at least one\nminute. III. Sanitizer Strength and Water Hardness Tests\nTESTS FOR CHLORINE CONCENTRATION\nThree types of field tests are satisfactory for chlorine\nconcentration determinations: Starch-Iodide Method (iodometric).--This test makes use of the\nfact that chlorine displaces iodine from potassium iodide in an acid solution\n(low pH). See general discussions in the latest edition of Standard Methods for\nthe Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public\n\nHealth Association. Iodine, plus starch, forms a blue color which is removed\n(decolorized) by the addition of standard sodium thiosulphate. The quantity of\nstandard sodium thiosulphate required to remove the starch-iodine color is a\nmeasure of the chlorine present. Field kits are available which give satisfactorily accurate\nreadings of available chlorine. In some of these kits, the starch and potassium\niodide are mixed in dry form for convenience of handling. Some use a liquid\nacid while others employ, for convenience, a crystalline one, such as sulphamic\nacid. The sodium thiosulphate is unstable unless a preservative is added. Some\ntest kits make use of a preserved standardized sodium thiosulphate so that one\ndrop of solution is equivalent to 10 ppm of available chlorine. Test kits\nshould be checked periodically against standardized chlorine solutions. Orthotolidine Colorimetric Comparison.--This test is based on\nthe fact that orthotolidine, which is colorless, forms an orange-brown colored\ncompound when added to chlorine. The depth of color is a measure of the amount\nof chlorine present. A concentration of 20 ppm of available chlorine causes a\nprecipitate. Consequently, solutions which are concentrated must be diluted, usually at least 1:10 with chlorine-free water. Specific directions and color\nstandards for comparison are included in test kits. Such test kits are\navailable commercially. Color develops more slowly with alkaline hypochlorites\nthan with the less alkaline compounds. Chloramines are considerably slower than\nalkaline hypochlorites in color formation, usually requiring at least 5\nminutes. Indicator Paper Test.--The indicator paper test is widely used\nin situations where a high degree of accuracy is not required. It is a\nconvenient, rapid, and generally a useful screening device. Ranges of chlorine\nconcentration are indicated by the color developed on the test paper (usually\nstarch-iodide impregnated) as it is immersed in the solution being\ntested. Indicator papers are subject to rather rapid deterioration, especially if they are stored in a damp or chemically adverse environment. Their accuracy also suffers when they are handled excessively, especially if\nthe operator's hands have been exposed to detergents, sanitizers, or other\nchemically active substances. TESTS FOR QUATERNARY AMMONIUM COMPOUNDS\nTest kits are available which give satisfactory accurate\nreadings within the range of recommended quaternary ammonium compound\nconcentrations. In some, the reagents are tableted for convenience of handling; others make use of test papers. Where the sanitizing solution is essentially\nclear and free from organic contamination, the above chemical test procedures\nwill measure the amount of bactericidally active quaternary ammonium compound\npresent during or after use. Where organic contamination is apparent, as\nevidenced by cloudiness in the sanitizing solution, the test sample should be\nheated to boiling for at least 5 minutes, and the supernatant liquid made up to\nvolume with water and then removed for testing by pipetting or decantation in\norder to differentiate between the total amount of quarternary ammonium\ncompound present and the amount bactericidally active G. If there is reason to\nverify the concentration of the stock quaternary ammonium compound solution\nfrom which the standardized solutions are made, a laboratory procedure such as\nthat of Furlong and Elliker may be used.H\nTESTS FOR WATER HARDNESS\nThe water to be used for preparing solutions should, if\npertinent, be within the range of hardness in which the proprietary formulation\nto be used is effective. Hardness may be determined by either the Hardness by\n\nCalculation Method or the Versenate Test (EDTA, titration method, ammonium\nbuffer procedure), as described in the latest edition of Standard Methods for\nthe Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public\n\nHealth Association. TESTS FOR HYDROGEN-ION CONCENTRATION\nHydrogen-ion concentration (pH) has a pronounced effect on the\nactivity of sanitizing solutions. Consequently, solutions must be maintained in\nthe pH range within which the bactericidal agent is effective. In most cases, the pH of the solution is dependent upon the buffering action of the compound\nused. The pH of bactericide solutions can best be determined electrometrically, using the glass electrode. However, for a field test, colorimetric methods are\nmore applicable. Two types of test kits for such determinations are available\ncommercially. Colorimetric readings should be made immediately, because of the\ntendency toward oxidation and decolorization of the indicator. Such indicators\nas bromthymol blue, cresol red, thymol blue, or others are satisfactory, depending upon the pH range desired. References\nA Ortenzio, L. F., and Stuart, L.
