Tit. 21 § 2188.7 - Procedures for Monitoring of Projects\n\nState Regulations\n(a) With respect to each project to which the\nagency has allocated or allowed LIHTC, the owner of the project shall be\nrequired to execute a regulatory agreement, which outlines the program\nrequirements. The regulatory agreement will be recorded as a restrictive\ncovenant binding all subsequent owners and managing agents of the\nproject. (b) LIHTC\nmonitoring office. All HFA administrative functions related to the\noperation of qualified Low-Income buildings shall be the responsibility of the\nmonitoring office who, unless otherwise designated by the commissioner/CEO, shall be HCR's Office of Housing Operations/Statewide Asset Management. The\nmonitoring office will be responsible for enforcing all regulatory agreements\nand reporting noncompliance to the IRS. All correspondence and/or legal notices\nshould be addressed to the attention of HCR's Office of Housing\n\nOperations/Statewide Asset Management. (c) Section 42(m)(1)(B)(iii) of the Code\nmandates that State housing credit agencies monitor all placed in service tax\ncredit developments for compliance with the provision of section 42. The Code\nalso mandates that the State housing credit agencies notify the Internal\n\nRevenue Service of any instance of noncompliance through the issuance of IRS\nform 8823. Although the agency is responsible for monitoring the owner's\ncompliance with the Code, it is expressly understood that this responsibility\ndoes not and will not make the agency liable in any manner whatsoever for any\nnoncompliance by the owner. (d) Monitoring fees: (1)\nA reasonable annual\nmonitoring fee will be charged by the agency and will vary depending on the\ntype and size of the project. (2)\n\nThe monitoring fee for any project financed by HFA shall be included in the\nagency's normal financing servicing fee for the applicable financing program as\nspecified in the appropriate financing documents. (3)\n\nIf HFA does not provide permanent\nfinancing to a project for which it allocates LIHTC, or if the permanent\nfinancing of a project is prepaid, or the agency otherwise is no longer\nentitled to a fee for servicing such financing, the agency shall charge a\nmonitoring fee based on the agency's estimate of the costs associated with\nmonitoring the project. The agency reserves the right to adjust monitoring fees\nbased on administrative or other cost increases to monitor overall\ncompliance. (e) Required\nstaff training: (1)\n\nThe agency mandates\napplicants to require management staff administering any project which may\nreceive an allocation of LIHTC to complete a certification program from an\nentity acceptable to the agency on Low-Income housing tax credit compliance\nbefore the project is placed in service. (2)\n\nAll project management plans must include\na requirement that appropriate staff administering any project containing\n\nLow-Income U nits shall receive training and certification at the commencement\nof employment and refresher training in LIHTC compliance as necessary, not less\nthan every five years. (f) Recordkeeping and record\nretention. (1)\n\nRecordkeeping. The\nregulatory agreement shall provide that the owner of the project is required to\nkeep records for each building with respect to which LIHTC has been allocated\nor allowed that show for each year in the compliance period (as defined in Code\nsection 42(i)(1)): (i) the total number of\nresidential rental units in each building (including the number of bedrooms and\nthe size in square feet of each residential rental unit); (ii)\nthe percentage of residential rental\nunits in each building that are Low-Income Units (as defined in Code section\n42(i)(3)); (iii)\nthe rent charged\non each residential rental unit in each building (including any utility\nallowances); (iv)\nthe Low-Income\n\nUnit vacancies in each building and information that shows when, and to whom, the next such available units were rented; (v) the annual income certification and\nrecertification of each tenant of a Low-Income Unit in the project if a waiver\nhas not been granted under subdivision (i) of this section; (vi)\ndocumentation to support the income\ncertification and recertification made by each tenant of a Low-Income U nit\n(for example, a copy of the tenant's Federal income tax return, form W-2, or\nverifications of income from third parties such as employers or State agencies\npaying unemployment compensation), in accordance with section l.42-5(b)(1)(vii)\nof the applicable IRS regulations; (vii)\nthe eligible basis (as defined in Code\nsection 42(d)) and the qualified basis (as defined in Code section 42(c)) of\neach building, at the end of the first year of the credit period (as defined in\n\nCode section 42(f)(1)), the placed in service date of each building, the\napplicable fraction chart for each building, list of services and amenities\noffered to all residential tenants with corresponding fee charges, if any, and\na copy of the IRS form 8609; (viii)\nthe character and use of the nonresidential portion of the building included in\nthe building's eligible basis; (ix)\nin a format acceptable to the agency, the data elements specified by the\nagency, that are necessary for the agency to meet its reporting requirements\nunder section 36, Collection of Information on Tenants in Tax Credit Projects, of title 1 of the United State Housing Act of 1937; and\n(x) fiscal documentation to include annual\nbudgets, certified financial audits and all financial records pertaining to the\nproject including all records related to the operation and maintenance of the\nproject. Such other information as the agency may reasonably request from time\nto time. (2)\n\nRecord\nretention. The regulatory agreement shall provide that the owner of the project\nshall retain the foregoing records for at least six years after the due date\n(including any extensions for any filings required to be made by the owner with\nthe Internal Revenue Service or its successor agency) for that year, except\nthat the records for the first year of the credit period shall be retained for\nat least six years after the due date (including any extensions for any filings\nrequired to be made by the owner with the Internal Revenue Service or its\nsuccessor agency) for the last year of the compliance period. (3)\n\nInspection record retention. The\nregulatory agreement shall provide that the owner of the project shall retain\nthe original local health, safety, or building code violation reports or\nnotices that were issued by the State or local government unit responsible for\nmaking local health, safety, or building code inspections for the agency's\ninspection under subdivision (j) of this section. Retention of the original\nviolation reports or notices is required until the later of when the agency\nreviews the violation reports or notices and completes its inspection under\nsubdivision (j) of this section or when the violation is corrected. (g) Certification, inspection and review. (1)\n\nCertification period. Annual certifications shall be submitted for all projects\nfor which final credit allocation has been issued and shall be submitted\nannually for the period during which the project is subject to regulation under\nthe Code. The owner of a Low- Income housing project shall certify annually\nunder the penalty of perjury that the project or building is in compliance with\nall applicable State and Federal laws, regulations, procedures, policies and\ncontractual obligations in a form approved by HFA. (2)\n\nThe project meets the requirements of\nwhichever minimum set-aside test was elected for the project and if applicable\nto the project, the 15-40 test under IRC section 42(g)(4) and IRC section\n142(d)(4)(B) for deep rent skewed projects. (3)\n\nThere was no change in the applicable\nfraction (as defined in IRC section 42 (c)(1)B)) of any building in the\nproject, or that there was a change, and a description of the change. (4)\n\nThe owner has received an annual income\ncertification from each tenant of a Low-Income Units and documentation to\nsupport that certification, or, in case of a tenant receiving section 8 housing\nassistance payments, a statement from a public housing authority described in\nparagraph (b)(1)(vii) of section 1.42-5 of the IRS regulations if a waiver has\nnot been granted pursuant to subdivision (i) of this section. (5)\n\nEach Low-Income Unit in the project is\nrent restricted within the meaning of IRC section 42(g)(2). (6)\n\nAll units in the project are and have\nbeen for use by the general public and used on a nontransient basis (except for\ntransitional housing for the homeless provided under Code section 42\n(i)(3)(B)(iii)). (7)\n\nEach building\nin the project is and has been suitable for occupancy, in compliance with all\napplicable local health, safety, and building codes and the State or local\ngovernment unit responsible for making local health, safety, or building code\ninspections did not issue a violation report for any building or Low-Income\n\nUnit in the project. If a violation report or notice was issued by the\ngovernmental unit, the owner must either attach a statement describing the\nnature of the violation(s) or a copy of each violation report to the Owner's\n\nCertification. The owner must also indicate whether the violation has been\ncorrected. (8)\n\nThere has been no\nchange in the eligible basis of any building in the project or, if there has\nbeen a change, the nature of the change. (9)\n\nAll tenant facilities included in the\neligible basis of any building in the project, such as swimming pools, other\nrecreational facilities, and parking areas, are provided on a comparable basis\nwithout charge to all tenants in the building. (10)\n\nIf and when a Low-Income Unit in the\nbuilding became vacant during the year, reasonable attempts were or are being\nmade to rent that unit or the next available unit of comparable or smaller size\nto a tenant having a qualifying income before any units in the building were or\nwill be rented to tenants not having a qualifying income; except, in the case\nof a deep rent skewed project, if and when a Low-Income Unit in the building\nbecame vacant during the year, reasonable attempts were or are being made to\nrent that unit or the next available Low-Income Unit in the building to a\ntenant having a qualifying income before any Low-Income Units in the building\nwere or will be rented to tenants not having a qualifying income. (11)\n\nIf the income of the tenant of a\n\nLow-Income Unit in the building increased above 140 percent of the applicable\nincome limitation elected pursuant to IRC section 42(g)(1), then, pursuant to\nIRC section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii), the next available unit of comparable or smaller\nsize in the building was or will be rented to a tenant having a qualifying\nincome; except that in the case of a deep rent skewed project, if the income of\na tenant of a Low-Income Unit increased above 170 percent of the income\nlimitation applicable to the project pursuant to the election made under IRC\nsection 42(g)(1), then the provisions of IRC section 42(g)(2)(D)(ii) with\nrespect to the occupation of any Low-Income Unit in the building by a new\nresident were or will be applied. (12)\n\nAn extended Low-Income housing\ncommitment as defined in IRC section 42(h)(6), was in effect (for buildings\nsubject to IRC section 7108(c)(1) of the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1989)\nwhich includes the requirement that the owner cannot refuse to lease a unit in\nthe project to an applicant because the applicant holds a voucher or\ncertificate of eligibility under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of\n1937. (13)\n\nThe project is in\ncompliance with the Code, including any treasury regulations, this QAP, all\nother applicable laws, rules and regulations and, if applicable, with the HFA\nregulatory agreement. (14)\n\nIf\napplicable, the owner received its credit allocation from the portion of the\n\nState Credit Ceiling set-aside for the project involving A qualified non profit\norganization under IRC section 42(h)(5) and its nonprofit entity materially\nparticipated in the operation of the development within the meaning of section\n469(h) of the Code. (15)\n\nThe owner\nhas not refused to lease a unit in the project to any holder of a voucher or\ncertificate of eligibility under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of\n1937 because of the status of the prospective tenant as such a\nholder. (16)\n\nThere has been no\nfinding of discrimination under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. 3601\n-\n3619, against the project. A\nfinding of discrimination includes an adverse final decision by the Secretary\nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), 24 CFR\n180.680, an adverse final decision by a\nsubstantially equivalent State or local fair housing agency, 42 U.S.C. 3616a(a)(1), or an adverse\njudgment from a federal court. (h) All owner's certifications shall be\nreviewed for compliance with the requirements of section 42 and retained by the\nagency for not less than three years from the end of the calendar year in which\nthe agency receives the certifications. (i) Waiver of annual tenant income\nrecertification requirement. Annual tenant income recertifications\nrequirements are waived for any project where all the tenants are income\nqualified for any year if during such year no residential unit in the project\nis occupied by a new resident whose income exceeds the applicable income limit. The agency reserves the right, at its discretion, to continue requiring annual\nincome recertifications, or to reinstate annual recertification requirements. After initial income certification has been completed for all LIHTC units, all\n100 percent LIHTC projects monitored pursuant to this QAP can implement annual\nrecertification waivers. However, all 100 percent LIHTC projects monitored\npursuant to this QAP must certify annually to each LIHTC household member's\nstudent status, execute a Violence Against Women's Act addendum to the lease\nagreement and certify annually to compliance with any and all agency and LIHTC\nprogrammatic requirements. (j) Inspection and review. The regulatory agreement shall provide\nthat the agency shall have the right to perform inspections and reviews\nnecessary and convenient for project monitoring, and the project owner and the\nemployees and agents thereof shall cooperate with the agency with respect to\nsuch inspections and reviews, and shall facilitate audits of the project during\nand through the end of the compliance period. Such audits may include physical\ninspection of any building in the project and any individual Low-Income Unit in\nany building in the project. The regulatory agreement shall further provide\nthat the project owner shall include provisions in the lease given to each\n\nLow-Income tenant requiring the tenant to permit inspection of the Low-Income\n\nUnit by the authorized representatives of the agency in compliance with the\nprovisions of the Code and this Plan. Such audits, site visits, and physical\ninspections shall be performed at least as often as required by the Code, and\nmay be as frequent as deemed necessary and appropriate by the agency in its\nsole discretion. The audits may also include review of the owner's records as\ndescribed in the recordkeeping section herein. (k) In addition to the inspections described\nabove, the regulatory agreement shall provide that HFA shall have the right to\nperform, upon reasonable notice, an on site inspection of any LIHTC project at\nleast through the end of the compliance period and, to the extent deemed\napplicable by the agency, the extended use period, in order to implement and/or\nenforce any provision of this QAP or the Code. (l) Notification of\nnoncompliance. (1)\n\nNotice to owner. The regulatory agreement shall provide that the agency shall notify the owner\npromptly in writing if the agency does not receive the certification described\nin subdivisions(f) and (g) of this section, or is not permitted to inspect the\ntenant income documentation, or discovers by inspection, review, or in any\nother manner, that the project is not in compliance with the provisions of\nsection 42. (2)\n\nCorrection period. The regulatory agreement shall provide that the owner of the project must\nsupply any missing certification required to be supplied to the agency, or\ncorrect any noncompliance with the requirements of section 42, within a period\n(the correction period) of no more than 90 days from the time of notice from\nthe agency to the owner as described in the preceding paragraph. The regulatory\nagreement shall further provide that the agency may extend the correction\nperiod for up to six months, but only if the agency determines that there is\ngood cause for granting the extension. (3)\n\nNotice to Internal Revenue Service. The\nregulatory agreement shall provide that the agency shall file IRS form 8823, \"Low-Income Housing Credit Agencies Report of Noncompliance and Building\n\nDisposition\", with the IRS no later than 45 days after the end of the\ncorrection period, whether or not the noncompliance or failure to certify is\ncorrected. The filing and contents of such form 8823 by the agency shall be\ngoverned by the applicable income tax regulations or other rules promulgated by\nthe IRS. The regulatory agreement shall provide that the agency shall retain\nrecords of any noncompliance or failure to certify reported on any form 8823\nfiled by the agency for a period of six years from the filing of said form\n8823. (m) Agency\nretention of records. HFA shall retain records of noncompliance or\nfailure to certify for six years beyond the agency's filing of the respective\nform 8823. In other cases HFA must retain the certifications and records\ndescribed in subdivisions (f) and (g) of this section for three years from the\nend of the calendar year the agency receives the certified records. (n) Compliance with the requirements of the\n\nCode is the sole responsibility of the owner of the building for which the\ncredit is allowable. HFA's obligation to monitor for compliance with the\nrequirements of the Code does not create liability for an owner's\nnoncompliance. (o) Delegation. To the extent permitted under applicable law, and\ndetermined by the Commissioner/CEO of the agency to be advisable, the agency\nmay delegate monitoring functions under this Plan to any other housing credit\nagency or any qualified agent selected by the agency.
