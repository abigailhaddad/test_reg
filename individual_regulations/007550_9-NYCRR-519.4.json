  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 519.4 - Punishment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Rules and\nlimitations. Whether to impose punishment and the nature of the\npunishment are solely the decisions of the imposing commander. However, commanders are encouraged to consult with their NCO's on the appropriate type, duration and limits of punishment to be imposed. Additionally, as NCO's are\noften in the best position to observe a member undergoing punishment and\nevaluate daily performance and attitude, their views on clemency should be\ngiven careful consideration. (1)\nTABLE 4-1 TYPES OF\nPUNISHMENT\nMAXIMUM PUNISHMENT FOR ENLISTED\nMEMBERS\nPUNISHMENT\nIMPOSED BY COMPANY GRADE\nOFFICERS\nIMPOSED BY FIELD GRADE\nOFFICERS\nAdmonition/Reprimand\n\nYes\n\nYes\n\nWithholding of privilege\n2 consecutive weeks\n2 consecutive weeks\n\nRestriction with or without suspension from duty\n2 consecutive weeks\n2 consecutive weeks\n\nExtra duties\n2 consecutive weeks not to exceed 2 hours p/day; holidays included\n2 consecutive weeks not to exceed 2 hours p/day; holidays included\n\nReduction (E2-E7)\nE-2 through E-4, one grade but see Chapter 6 (NGR\n600-200)\nE-5, E-6 and E-7, one grade but see Chapter 6 (NGR\n600-200)\n\nReduction (E8 and E9)\n\nNo, see section\n519.6\n(NGR 600-200)\n\nNo, see section\n519.6\n(NGR 600-200)\n\nFine\n$150.00\n$150.00\n(2)\nPUNISHMENT FOR COMMISSIONED AND\nWARRANT OFFICERS\nWithholding of privileges\n2 consecutive weeks\n2 consecutive weeks\n\nRestrictions with or without suspension from\nduty\n2 consecutive weeks\n2 consecutive weeks\n\nImposed by Governor, Commanding Officer or Force of\n\nOrganized Militia or General or Flag Ranking Command\n\nFine of $200.00\n(b) Types of punishment. See paragraph (a)(1) of this subdivision, table 4-1 for\nmaximum punishments. (1)\n\nAdmonition\nis a warning, reminder or reproof given by a\ncommander to an offender to deter repetition of the type of misconduct which\nresulted in the admonition and to advise him of the consequences that may flow\nfrom a recurrence of that misconduct. An admonition may be oral or written and\nmay be included in a reprimand. (2)\n\nReprimand\nis the act of formal censure by a commander which\nreproves or rebukes the offender for his misconduct. It may be oral or written. Reprimand or admonition may be given administratively as a nonpunitive measure\nto improve efficiency. For this purpose, the procedures contained in this\nregulation need not be followed. If, however, the commander elects to impose\neither a reprimand or an admonition as non-judicial punishment under Military\n\nLaw, section\n130.15, the punishment must be\nimposed in accordance with the procedures outlined in this Part. (3)\n\nWithholding of privileges shall only be\nexecuted while the offender is in a duty status. (4)\n\nRestriction to certain specified limits\nshall only be executed while the offender is in a duty status, with or without\nsuspension from performance of duty. (5)\n\nExtra duties: (i) shall only be executed while the offender\nis in a duty status; (ii)\nthe\nperformance of extra duties shall not exceed two hours per day, and may include\nholidays; (iii)\nextra duties may\ninclude performance of any military duty except duty which: (a) demeans the grade or position of the\noffender in type of duty or manner of performance; (b) constitutes punishment not sanctioned by\nthe customs of the military; (c) normally is intended as an honor; or\n(d) uses the offender as a personal\nservant. (iv)\n\nAn\ninactive duty period may be extended beyond the normal four-hour period to\naccommodate the performance of the extra duties (see ML\n130.15[a][2][c]). (6)\n\nConfinement is limited to those instances authorized in Military Law, section\n130.15\n(a)(2)(E), and shall only be executed while the offender is in a duty status. (7)\n\nThe punishments or withholding of\nprivileges, restrictions to certain specified limits, extra duties and\nconfinement shall be executed within 60 days after the punishment is\nimposed. (8)\n\nFine may apply to pay\nor allowances as stated in Military Law, section\n130.15, subdivisions (a)(1)(C), (a)(2)(F) and (f). (i) Fines will be\ncollected by the unit commander and deposited in the unit's state military fund\naccount. (ii)\n\nIn the case of AGR\npersonnel, fines will be collected by the commander and remitted to the unit\n\nState military fund or in the case of assignment to another unit to the\nassigned unit's State military fund, e.g., STARC. (9)\n\nReduction in\ngrade (herein meaning \"pay grade\"). (i) Only\nthe commander with the authority to promote to the grade from which demoted may\nreduce a member in grade with the exception as indicated in subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph. See paragraph (ii) of this subdivision for reduction of\noffenders in grades E-8 and E-9. (ii)\n\nAn offender may be reduced only one\ngrade in each non-judicial punishment action. (iii)\n\nReduction authority pertaining to AGR\npersonnel is not delegated and rests with this headquarters. Reduction actions\nwill be implemented by completing and forwarding a copy of DMNA form 1057 to\n\nHeadquarters, NYARNG, ATTN: MNSP-AGR. (10)\n\nReduction in grade (herein meaning \"pay\ngrade\"). (This paragraph and paragraph (9) of this subdivision do not apply to\ncommissioned officers and warrant officers see paragraph [c][2] of this\nsection.)\n(i) Promotional authority. The grade\nfrom which reduced must be within the promotion authority of the imposing\ncommander or of any officer subordinate to the imposing commander. For the\npurposes of this Part, the imposing commander, or any subordinate commander has\n\"promotion authority\", if he or she has the general authority to appoint to the\ngrade from which reduced or to any higher grade (AR 600-200). (ii)\n\nLateral appointment or reduction of NCO\nto Specialist and a Specialist to NCO. An NCO may not be laterally appointed to\na Specialist in the same pay grade under section\n130.15\nof the Military Law. However, the NCO may be reduced to a Specialist or NCO of a lower pay grade\nprovided the latter grade is authorized in the member's primary military\noccupational specialty (PMOS). A Specialist may not be laterally appointed to\nan NCO in the same pay grade but may be reduced to a Specialist or NCO of a\nlower pay grade provided the latter grade is authorized in the member's primary\nMOS. For example, a Sergeant may not be appointed to a Specialist 5 but may be\nreduced to a Specialist 4 or to Corporal. If reduction is included in the\npunishment, the imposing commander must determine whether the lower pay grade\nstatus of either Specialist or NCO is authorized in the member's primary MOS. The commander will indicate upon announcement of the reduction which status\nwithin the pay grade is intended; e.g., \"to be reduced to\n\nSpecialist 4\". (iii)\n\nDate of rank. When a person is reduced in grade as a result of an unsuspended reduction, his\nor her date of rank in the grade to which reduced is the date the punishment or\nreduction was imposed. If the reduction is suspended either on or after the\ntime the punishment was imposed, or if set aside or mitigated to forfeiture of\npay, the date of rank in the grade held before the punishment was imposed\nremains unchanged. If a suspension of the reduction is vacated the date or rank\nin the grade to which reduced as a result of the action is the date the\npunishment was originally imposed, regardless of the date the punishment was\nsuspended or vacated. (iv)\n\nEntitlement to pay. When a member is restored to a higher pay grade because of\nsuspension or when a reduction is mitigated to a fine, entitlement or pay at\nthe higher grade is effective on the date of suspension or mitigation. This is\ntrue even though an earlier date of rank is assigned. If, however, a reduction\nis set aside and all rights, privileges and property are restored, the member\nconcerned will be entitled to pay as though the reduction had never been\nimposed. (v) Void reduction. A\nreduction imposed as non-judicial punishment by an imposing commander not\nhaving authority to do so is void and must be set aside. However, there is one\nexception, which clearly evidences a commander's intent to impose at least as\nauthorized one grade reduction. This is a reduction to a lower specialist grade\nwhen reduction should have been to a lower NCO grade (or vice versa). In this\ncase, administrative action will be taken to place the offender in the proper\nrank for the MOS held in the reduced pay grade. (vi)\n\nRemoval form standing promotion list. (See AR 600-200.)\n(11)\n\nReduction in grade of offenders in grades E-8 and E-9: (i) Only a major commander, New York Army\n\nNational Guard, is authorized to impose a reduction, suspended or unsuspended, in a non-judicial punishment action where the offender is in the grade of E-8\nor E-9. Likewise, only a major commander, New York Army National Guard, is\nauthorized to vacate a suspended reduction of an offender in grade E-8 or\nE-9. (ii)\n\nAll procedures previously\ndescribed in this regulation apply to any action involving the reduction of an\noffender in grades E-8 or E-9 subject to the following: (a) Any non-judicial punishment imposed on an\noffender in grades E-8 or E-9, not involving reduction, shall be imposed at the\nunit level by the commander authorized to impose such non-judicial punishment\non offenders in grades E-8 or E-9. (b) If the commander authorized to\nnon-judicially punish (other than reduction) such offenders, \"intends to impose\nreduction\", paragraph 1 (the notification of offense) DMNA Form 1057 (Appendix\nL-2[A16]) shall state that the commander intends to recommend to the\n(appropriate major commander) the imposition of non-judicial punishment\". However, this notification of offense shall not include a recommendation of the\ntype of severity of punishment to be imposed. (c) After all requirements in this Part\npreliminary to the actual imposition of non-judicial punishment are met, the\ncommander who would have otherwise been authorized to impose the punishment\nshall by indorsement, forward the record to the 42nd Infantry Division, Headquarters Troop Command, Headquarters, 27th Brigade STARC (if the action is\nnot commenced by the Division Commander, Commander, Headquarters Troop Command)\nor Commander, 27th Brigade through the unit Judge Advocate (for preliminary\nlegal sufficiency review for determination of imposition of non-judicial\npunishment). (d) Where the major\ncommander is forwarded the record to initially determine whether or not to\nimpose non-judicial punishment, he takes the place of the commander at the unit\nlevel with all his authority for non-judicial punishment action\n(\ni.e., imposition of punishment, termination without\npunishment, or termination of action and processing by\ncourt-martial). (iii)\n\nIf\nthe major commander imposes a reduction (although he may impose any type of\nnon-judicial punishment he deems appropriate) only he, or his\nsuccessor-in-command may suspend, vacate a suspension, mitigate or remit or set\naside the reduction. (a) Whatever remedial\naction the major commander takes, once the appellate process is completed, the\nrecord shall be maintained at the unit level, and the appropriate major\ncommander shall be notified of any further misconduct committed by such\noffender in any suspension period. (b) Any vacation action shall be commenced by\nthe unit commander recommending vacation action to the major commander and by\nmailing or delivering the notification to the offender in accordance with this\nregulation. (iv)\nA STARC\nStaff Judge Advocate, New York Army National Guard, shall review the record for\nlegal sufficiency in all cases of reductions in grade of offenders in grades\nE-8 and E-9. All papers shall be forwarded to DMNA, ATTN: MNJA, 330 Old\n\nNiskayuna Road, Latham, NY 12110-2224. (c) Limitations and types of\npunishment. (1)\n\nIn addition to, or in\nlieu of an admonition or reprimand, only one of the authorized punishments in\n\nMilitary Law, section\n130.15\nmay be imposed for each\nnon-judicial punishment action. (2)\n\nThe punishments of confinement, extra duties, or reduction may not be imposed\nnon-judicially on officers or warrant officers. (3)\n\nPunishments imposed may not be so grossly\ndisproportionate to the offenses committed, so as to violate fundamental\nprinciples of fairness and justice. (d) Effective date and execution of\npunishment. (1)\n\nGeneral. The date of imposition of non-judicial punishment is the\ndate items 1-3, DMNA form 1057 (Appendix L-2[A16]), as appropriate, are signed\nby the imposing commander. This action will normally be accomplished on the day\npunishment is imposed. (2)\n\nUnsuspended punishments. Unsuspended punishments of reduction and forfeiture take\neffect on the date imposed. Other unsuspended punishments take effect on the\ndate they are imposed, unless the imposing commander prescribes otherwise. In\nthose cases where the execution of the punishment must legitimately be delayed\n(\ne.g., the member is hospitalized, authorized emergency\nleave) the execution of punishment should begin immediately thereafter. The\ndelay in execution of punishment should not exceed 30 days. Once the member has\nsubmitted an appeal, including all pertinent attachments, such appeal normally\nshould be decided within 30 calendar days, excluding the submission date. If\nthe appeal is not decided within this period, the performance of those\npunishments involving deprivation of liberty will be interrupted pending\ndecision on the appeal. (3)\n\nVacated, suspended reduction. Suspended reduction, later vacated is effective on the date\nvacation is directed. Any commanding officer of the person to be punished may\norder the punishment to be executed and in such a manner and under such\nsupervision as he or she may direct. (e) Announcement of punishment. (1)\n\nThe punishment may be announced at the\nnext unit formation after punishment is imposed; or, if appealed, after the\ndecision of the appeal. It also may be posted on the unit bulletin board. The\npurpose of announcing the results of punishment is to preclude perceptions of\nunfairness of punishment and to deter similar misconduct by other service\nmembers. An inconsistent or arbitrary policy regarding the announcement of\npunishment that might result in the appearance of vindictiveness or favoritism\nshould be avoided. In deciding whether to announce punishment of members in the\ngrade of E-5 or above, the following should be considered: (i) the nature of the offense; (ii)\nthe individual's military record and\nduty position; (iii)\nthe deterrent\neffect; (iv)\nthe impact on unit\nmorale; (v) the impact on any\nvictim; (vi)\nthe detrimental impact\non the mission or leadership effectiveness of the individual\nconcerned.
