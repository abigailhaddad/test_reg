  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.6 - Wastewater discharge permits\n\nState Regulations\n(a) B.P.D.E.S. permit. (1)\n\nNo industrial user shall discharge, or\ncause to be discharged, any industrial wastewaters directly or indirectly to\nsewerage facilities owned by the Buffalo Sewer Authority without first applying\nfor a B.P.D.E.S. permit for industrial wastewater discharge. After review and\nevaluation of the application, the B.S.A. may issue that person a B.P.D.E.S. permit or require him to enter into an industrial waste agreement with the\nauthority. As a condition for issuance of a permit, the B.S.A. may require that\nany user of the authority's facilities shall enter into a contractual agreement\nfor a period of one year with provisions for renewal of such agreements as may\nbe required by the general manager. At a minimum, all significant industrial\nusers shall be issued permits. (2)\n\nThe authority may deny or condition any new or increased discharge to its\nsystem or discharges which have changed with respect to their physical or\nchemical character if, in the opinion of the general manager, such discharge\nwould not be in compliance with applicable Federal or State or local\npretreatment standards and requirements or where such discharge would cause the\nauthority to violate its SPDES permit, inhibit or interfere with the operation\nand maintenance of the authority's collection and treatment facilities, or\nconcentrate in the sludge and interfere with its disposal by approved\nmethods. (3)\n\nIf the volume or\ncharacter of the waste to be treated is determined by the B.S.A. to be in\ncompliance with all pertinent Federal, State and local regulations and, not to\ncause overloading of the sewage collection, treatment, or disposal facilities\nof the B.S.A., then prior to approval, the general manager and the person\nmaking the discharge shall enter into an agreement which provides that the\ndischarger pay a sewer rent and/or industrial waste surcharge, as outlined in\nthe latest edition of the B.S.A. Schedule of Sewer Rents and Other Charges (see\n\nAppendix 52 of this Title). (4)\n\nIf\nthe volume or character of the waste to be treated by the B.S.A. requires that\nwastewater collection, treatment, or other disposal facilities of the authority\nbe improved, expanded, or enlarged in order to treat or convey the waste, then\nprior to approval, the B.S.A. and the person making the discharge shall enter\ninto an agreement which provides that the discharger pay in full all added\ncosts the authority may incur due to acceptance of the waste. (5)\nA B.P.D.E.S. permit may require\npretreatment of industrial wastewaters before discharge, restriction of peak\nflow discharges, discharge of certain wastewater only to specified sewers, relocation of points of discharge, prohibition of discharge of certain\nwastewater components, restriction of discharge to certain hours of the day, payment of additional charges to defray increased costs of the authority\ncreated by the wastewater discharges and such other conditions as may be\nrequired to effectuate the purpose of these regulations. (6)\n\nNo B.P.D.E.S. permit is transferable\nwithout the prior written consent of the general manager. (7)\n\nNo person shall discharge industrial\nwastewaters in excess of the quantity or quality limitations set by his\nB.P.D.E.S. permit. Any person desiring to discharge wastewaters or use\nfacilities which are not in conformance with his B.P.D.E.S. permit must apply\nto the general manager for an amended permit. Such amended permit shall be\ngranted provided that its terms shall comply with these regulations. (b) Existing industrial wastewater\ndischarges. (1)\n\nAll persons discharging\nindustrial wastewater directly or indirectly to the Buffalo Sewer Authority\nsewerage system prior to the effective date of these regulations and who have\nobtained prior approval for that industrial wastewater discharge are hereby\ngranted a temporary permit to continue that discharge. This temporary permit\nshall expire 180 days after the industrial discharger has been notified by the\ngeneral manager that a B.P.D.E.S. permit must be applied for. All B.P.D.E.S. permit applications must be submitted to the B.S.A. Industrial Waste\n\nAdministrator at least 90 days prior to expiration of the temporary\npermit. (2)\n\nWithin 14 days of\nreceipt of the application, the B.S.A. general manager will acknowledge receipt\nand will indicate the acceptability and completeness of information contained\nin the application. Within 90 days of receiving an acceptable application the\nindustrial waste administrator will issue a B.P.D.E.S. permit or will notify a\nnonsignificant industrial user applicant that a permit will not be required for\ndischarge. (c) Procedure\nfor obtaining a B.P.D.E.S. permit. Applicants for a B.P.D.E.S. permit shall\ncomplete a Buffalo Sewer Authority application form. Blank application forms\nmay be obtained at the following address: Buffalo Sewer Authority Treatment Plant c/o Industrial Waste\n\nSection\n\nFoot of West Ferry Street\n\nBuffalo, NY 14213\n\nAll completed applications shall also be submitted to the\nabove address. If, after review, the B.S.A. determines the applicant to be a\nsignificant industrial user a B.P.D.E.S. permit may be issued after a check for\nregulation compliance is complete. (d) B.P.D.E.S. permit conditions. The\nconditions of any permit issued by the B.S.A. to an industrial user will be\nsubject to the provisions and requirements of these regulations and all\napplicable Federal and State pretreatment standards and requirements. (e) B.P.D.E.S. permit duration. Permits\nissued by the authority shall be valid for a period of three years. Users shall\napply for permit renewal at a minimum of 180 days prior to their permit\nexpiration date. (f) Modification of\nB.P.D.E.S. permit restrictions. (1)\n\nAs E.P.A. adds or amends specific pretreatment and effluent guidelines, or as the Buffalo\n\nSewer Authority deems necessary, the restrictions or conditions of any\nB.P.D.E.S. permit may require the introduction of changes or amendment, as\ncircumstances dictate. When necessary the Buffalo Sewer Authority shall require\nan industrial user to develop a time schedule for the installation of\ntechnology to comply with all applicable Federal, State and local pretreatment\nstandards and requirements as set forth in section\n10075.8\n(c) of\nthis Part. (2)\n\nIn addition, a\nusers' permit may be changed or modified at any time as the limitations or\nrequirements as identified in section\n10075.7\nof this Part are modified\nor other just cause exists. The user shall be informed of any proposed changes\nin his permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change. Any\nchanges or new conditions in the permit shall include a reasonable time\nschedule for compliance. (3)\n\nIn the\nevent that an existing user, becomes subject to a newly promulgated national\ncategorical pretreatment standard, that user shall submit a report to the\nB.S.A. within 180 days of promulgation of any applicable Federal categorical\npretreatment standard, describing the nature and concentration of any and all\nsubstances contained in the existing discharge which are impacted by the\n\nFederal categorical standard. This report shall further specify whether the\nexisting discharge complies with the Federal categorical standard and, if not, shall provide a schedule for incorporation of additional pretreatment necessary\nto comply. (g) Truckers\ndischarge permit. (1)\n\nAll persons owning\nvacuum or cesspool pump trucks, or other transport trucks, and desiring to\ndischarge septic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents, or\nindustrial wastes to sewerage facilities of the authority, or to facilities\nthat discharge directly or indirectly to such sewerage facilities, shall first\nhave a valid sewer authority trucker's discharge permit. All applicants for a\ntrucker's discharge permit shall complete an application form; pay the\nappropriate permit fee as specified in the latest edition of the B.S.A. Schedule of Sewer Rents and Other Charges (see Appendix 52 of this Title); receive a copy of the B.S.A. regulations governing discharge to B.S.A. facilities of wastes from trucks and shall agree in writing, to abide by these\nregulations. (2)\n\nDischarge of\nseptic tank, seepage pit, interceptor or cesspool contents or industrial wastes\nshall be made by truckers holding a permit only at the locations specified by\nthe general manager for the specific waste. The B.S.A. shall require payment\nfor treatment and disposal costs of the waste, or may refuse permission to\ndischarge prohibited wastes. (3)\n\nThe trucker's discharge permit shall be valid for one year from date of\nissuance subject to receipt of the permit fee. (4)\n\nAny person violating the authority's\nrequirements for liquid waste discharges from trucks may have his permit\nrevoked by the general manager. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
