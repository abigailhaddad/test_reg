(iii)\n\nIf, after an\nalternate agent's authority commences, the party appointed as agent becomes\navailable, willing and competent to serve as agent: (a) the authority of an alternate agent\nceases and the authority of the agent commences; and\n(b) an attending physician is to record the\nchange in agent and the reasons therefor in the medical portion of a\nprincipal's clinical record. (iv)\n\nThe restrictions and limitations in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision also apply to an alternate health care agent. (6)\n\nRights and duties of\na health care agent. (i) Scope of authority. Subject to any express limitations in a health care proxy, an agent has the\nauthority to make any and all health care decisions on a principal's behalf\nthat the principal could make. Such authority is subject to the provisions of\nparagraph (18) of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nDecisionmaking standard. After\nconsultation with a licensed physician, registered nurse, licensed clinical\npsychologist and/or certified social worker, whomever the agent considers to be\nmost qualified to aid him or her in making an informed health care decision, an\nagent is to make health care decisions: (a) in\naccordance with a principal's wishes, including a principal's religious and\nmoral beliefs; or\n(b) if a\nprincipal's wishes are not reasonably known and cannot with reasonable\ndiligence be ascertained, in accordance with a principal's best interests, provided however; (c) if a\nprincipal's wishes regarding the administration of artificial nutrition and\nhydration are not reasonably known and cannot with reasonable diligence be\nascertained, an agent does not have the authority to make decisions regarding\nthese measures. (iii)\n\nRight to receive information. Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, an agent\nhas the right to receive medical information and medical and clinical records\nnecessary to make informed decisions regarding a principal's health care (see\nglossary). (iv)\n\nPriority over other\nsurrogates. Health care decisions by an agent on a principal's behalf pursuant\nto this Part have priority over decisions by any other party, including\ndecisions by a guardian or a surrogate pursuant to section\n633.18\nof this Part, Procedures\ngoverning do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, except as otherwise provided in a\nhealth care proxy or in paragraph (10) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nAgent's authority to make\ndecisions regarding nutrition and hydration. (i) If a principal's wishes regarding the\nadministration of artificial nutrition and hydration are not reasonably known\nand cannot with reasonable diligence be ascertained, an agent does not have the\nauthority to make decisions regarding these measures. (ii)\nA principal may include, within a health\ncare proxy, his or her wishes regarding the administration of nutrition and\nhydration in order to make his or her wishes clearly known. (8)\n\nAn agent's authority commences\nupon a determination, made pursuant to subparagraph (10)(i) or (ii) of this\nsubdivision, that a principal lacks capacity to make health care\ndecisions. (9)\n\nDetermination of\nlack of capacity of a principal to make a health care decision, thereby\ninvoking the authority of a health care agent to make health care decisions, pursuant to the authority set forth in a health care proxy. (i) A determination that a principal lacks\ncapacity to make health care decisions is to be made by an attending physician\nto a reasonable degree of medical certainty. A determination is to be made in\nwriting and is to contain such attending physician's opinion regarding the\ncause and nature of a principal's incapacity as well as its extent and probable\nduration. A determination is to be included in the medical portion of a\nprincipal's clinical record. For a decision to withdraw or withhold\nlife-sustaining treatment, an attending physician who makes a determination\nthat a principal lacks capacity to make health care decisions must consult with\nanother physician to confirm such determination. The results of such\nconsultation is also to be included within the medical portion of a principal's\nclinical record. (ii)\n\nIf an\nattending physician determines that a principal lacks capacity because of a\ndevelopmental disability, the attending physician who makes the determination\nmust be, or must consult with a professional who is: (a) a physician licensed in New York State\nwho is presently employed by a developmental center or DDSO and has been so\nemployed for at least one year; or\n(b) a clinical psychologist who is presently\nemployed by a developmental center or DDSO and has been so employed for at\nleast one year; or\n(c) a physician\nlicensed in New York State who has been employed for at least two years to\nrender professional care and service at a facility; or\n(d) a clinical psychologist licensed in New\n\nYork State who has been employed for at least two years to render professional\ncare and service at a facility; or\n(e) a physician licensed in New York State\nwho has had specialized training in developmental disabilities and has had at\nleast two years of experience treating persons with developmental disabilities; or\n(f) a clinical psychologist in\n\nNew York State who has had specialized training in developmental disabilities\nand has had at least two years of experience treating persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities; or\n(g) a physician licensed in New York State who has had at least three years of\nexperience treating persons with developmental disabilities; or\n(h) a clinical psychologist licensed in New\n\nYork State who has had at least three years of experience treating persons with\ndevelopmental disabilities. (iii)\nA record of any consultation for the\npurpose of confirming lack of capacity due to a developmental disability is to\nbe included in the medical portion of a principal's clinical record. (iv)\nA physician who has been appointed as a\nprincipal's agent cannot make the determination of a principal's capacity to\nmake health care decisions. (v) If\nrequested by an agent, an attending physician is to make a determination\nregarding a principal's capacity to make health care decisions for the purposes\nof this section. (vi)\n\nNotice of a\ndetermination that a principal lacks capacity to make health care decisions is\nto promptly be given: (a) to the principal, orally and in writing, where there is any indication of a principal's ability\nto comprehend such notice; (b) to\nthe principal's agent; (c) to the\nchief executive officer of the principal's residence, who shall ensure that\nappropriate staff at the facility are so advised; (d) to the conservator for, or committee or\nguardian of, the principal, if applicable. (vii)\nA determination made pursuant to this\nparagraph that a principal lacks capacity to make health care decisions is not\nto be construed as a finding that a person lacks capacity for any other\npurpose. (10)\n\nPriority\nof a principal's decision. (i) Notwithstanding\na determination pursuant to this section that a principal lacks capacity to\nmake health care decisions, where a principal objects to the determination of\nincapacity or to a health care decision made by an agent, a principal's\nobjection or decision is to prevail unless a principal is determined by a court\nof competent jurisdiction to lack capacity to make health care\ndecisions. (11)\n\nConfirmation of lack of capacity. (i) An\nattending physician is to confirm a principal's continued incapacity before\ncomplying with an agent's health care decisions, other than those decisions\nmade at or about the time of an initial determination made pursuant to\nsubparagraph (9)(i) or (ii) of this subdivision. Confirmation is to be stated\nin writing and is to be included in the medical portion of the principal's\nclinical record. (ii)\n\nThe notice\nrequirements set forth in subparagraph (9)(vi) of this subdivision do not apply\nto a confirmation required by this paragraph. (12)\n\nEffect of recovery of capacity. (i) In the event that an attending physician\ndetermines that a principal has regained capacity, the authority of an agent is\nto cease.

(iii)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, nothing in this section shall be construed to require a\nnon-State operated facility to honor an agent's health care decision if: (a) the facility would be permitted by law to\nrefuse to honor a decision if made by a principal; or, a decision is contrary\nto a formally adopted policy of the facility that is expressly based on\nreligious beliefs or sincerely held moral convictions central to the facility's\noperating principles; and\n(b) the\nfacility has informed a principal or a health care agent of such policy prior\nto or upon admission, if reasonably possible; and\n(c) the principal is transferred promptly to\nanother facility that is reasonably accessible under the circumstances and is\nwilling to honor an agent's decision. If an agent is unable or unwilling to\narrange such a transfer, a facility may intervene to facilitate such a\ntransfer. If such a transfer is not effected, a facility shall seek judicial\nrelief or honor an agent's decision. (iv)\n\nNotwithstanding subparagraph (ii) of\nthis paragraph, nothing in this section shall be construed to require any\nhealth care provider to honor an agent's health care decision if the decision\nis contrary to a health care provider's religious beliefs or sincerely held\nmoral convictions, provided that: (a) the\nhealth care provider would not have honored the decision for the same religious\nor moral reasons had the decision been made by the principal when competent; and\n(b) the health care provider\npromptly informs the health care agent and the principal's residential\nfacility, if applicable, of the refusal to honor the agent's decision.

(c) A health care proxy will also be revoked\nupon execution by a principal of a subsequent health care proxy. (d) The creation by a principal of written\nwishes or instructions about health care, or limitations upon an agent's\nauthority, does not revoke a health care proxy unless such wishes, instructions\nor limitations expressly provide otherwise.
