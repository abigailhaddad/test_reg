(2)\n\nThe standards\nin this Subpart apply to owners and operators of all facilities which treat, store or dispose of hazardous waste, except as specifically provided otherwise\nin this Part or Part 371 of this Title. (3)\n\nThe requirements of this Subpart apply to\na person disposing of hazardous waste by means of ocean disposal subject to a\npermit issued under the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act (see\nsection\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle), only to the extent they are required by the exemption granted to such a\nperson under section\n373-1.1\n(d) of this\n\nPart.

(However, some\nremediation waste management sites may be a part of a facility that is subject\nto a traditional RCRA permit because the facility is also treating, storing or\ndisposing of hazardous wastes that are not remediation wastes. In these cases, sections\n373-2.2, 373-2.3, 373-2.4 and\n373-2.6\n(l) of this\n\nSubpart do apply to the facility subject to the traditional RCRA permit.)\n\nInstead of the requirements of sections\n373-2.2, 373-2.3, and\n373-2.4\nof this Subpart, owners or\noperators of remediation waste management sites must: (i) obtain an EPA identification number by\napplying to the USEPA Region II administrator using EPA form 8700-12; (ii)\nobtain a detailed chemical and physical\nanalysis of a representative sample of the hazardous remediation wastes to be\nmanaged at the site. At a minimum, the analysis must contain all of the\ninformation which must be known to treat, store or dispose of the waste\naccording to this subpart and Part 376 of this Title, and must be kept accurate\nand up to date; (iii)\nprevent\npeople who are unaware of the danger from entering, and minimize the\npossibility for unauthorized people or livestock to enter onto the active\nportion of the remediation waste management site, unless the owner or operator\ncan demonstrate to the department that: (a) physical contact with the waste, structures, or equipment within the active\nportion of the remediation waste management site will not injure people or\nlivestock who may enter the active portion of the remediation waste management\nsite; and\n(b) disturbance of the\nwaste or equipment by people or livestock who enter onto the active portion of\nthe remediation waste management site, will not cause a violation of the\nrequirements of this Subpart; (iv)\ninspect the remediation waste management\nsite for malfunctions, deterioration, operator errors, and discharges that may\nbe causing, or may lead to, a release of hazardous waste constituents to the\nenvironment, or a threat to human health. The owner or operator must conduct\nthese inspections often enough to identify problems in time to correct them\nbefore they harm human health or the environment, and must remedy the problem\nbefore it leads to a human health or environmental hazard. Where a hazard is\niminent or has already occurred, the owner/operator must take remedial action\nimmediately; (v) provide personnel\nwith classroom or on-the-job training on how to perform their duties in a way\nthat ensures the remediation waste management site complies with the\nrequirements of this Part, and on how to respond effectively to\nemergencies; (vi)\ntake precautions\nto prevent accidental ignition or reaction of ignitable or reactive waste, and\nprevent threats to human health and the environment from ignitable, reactive\nand incompatible waste; (vii)\nfor\nremediation waste management sites subject to regulation under sections 373-2.9\nthrough\n373-2.15\nand\n373-2.24\nof this Subpart, the\nowner/operator must design, construct, operate, and maintain a unit within a\n100-year floodplain to prevent washout of any hazardous waste by a 100-year\nflood, unless the owner/operator can meet the demonstration of section\n373-2.2\n(j)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart; (viii)\nnot place any\nnon-containerized or bulk liquid hazardous waste in any salt dome formation, salt bed formation, underground mine or cave; (ix)\ndevelop and maintain a construction\nquality assurance program for all surface impoundments, waste piles and\nlandfill units that are required to comply with sections\n373-2.11\n(b)(3) and\n(4), 373-2.12\n(b)(3) and\n(4), and\n373-2.14\n(c)(3) and\n(4)\nof this Subpart at the remediation waste\nmanagement site, according to the requirements of section\n373-2.2\n(k) of this\n\nSubpart; (x) develop and maintain\nprocedures to prevent accidents and a contingency and emergency plan to control\naccidents that occur. These procedures must address proper design, construction, maintenance, and operation of remediation waste management units\nat the site. The goal of the plan must be to minimize the possibility of, and\nthe hazards from a fire, explosion, or any unplanned sudden or non-sudden\nrelease of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents to air, soil, or\nsurface water that could threaten human health or the environment. The plan\nmust explain specifically how to treat, store and dispose of the hazardous\nremediation waste in question, and must be implemented immediately whenever a\nfire, explosion, or release of hazardous waste or hazardous waste constituents\nwhich could threaten human health or the environment; (xi)\ndesignate at least one employee, either\non the facility premises or on call (that is, available to respond to an\nemergency by reaching the facility quickly), to coordinate all emergency\nresponse measures. This emergency coordinator must be thoroughly familiar with\nall aspect of the facility's contingency plan, all operations and activities at\nthe facility, the location and characteristics of waste handled, the location\nof all records within the facility, and the facility layout. In addition, this\nperson must have the authority to commit the resources needed to carry out the\ncontingency plan; (xii)\ndevelop, maintain and implement a plan to meet the requirements in subparagraphs (ii)\nthrough (vi) and (ix) through (x) of this paragraph; and\n(xiii)\nmaintain records documenting\ncompliance with subparagraphs (i) through (xii) of this\nparagraph. (b) Relationship to interim status standards. A facility owner or operator who has fully complied with\nthe requirements for interim status, as defined in section\n373-1.3\nof this Part, must comply\nwith the regulations specified in Subpart 373-3 of this Part, in lieu of the\nregulations in this Subpart, until final administrative disposition of the\npermit application is made, except as provided under section\n373-2.19\nof this\n\nSubpart. (c) Imminent\nhazard action. Notwithstanding any other provisions of these\nregulations, enforcement actions may be brought pursuant to section 71-0301 of\nthe ECL or section 7003 of RCRA (see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle).
