  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 5.7 - Restrictions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) If a person\napplying for an original driver's license cannot meet the minimum visual\nrequirements except with the aid of corrective lenses or telescopic lenses, a\nlicense with an appropriate restriction shall be issued. However, a person may\nqualify for only a class D or class DJ driver license if it is necessary for\nhim to utilize telescopic lenses to meet the minimum visual acuity standards, except that such class D or DJ driver license shall not be valid for the\noperation of class B or C limited use motorcycles. In addition, a class M or MJ\ndriver license will not be issued to a person who must utilize telescopic\nlenses to meet the minimum visual acuity standards. (b) Upon application for renewal, if a person\nrequired to submit to a vision reexamination holds a license which is not\nrestricted to operation with corrective lenses or telescopic lenses, and such\nperson cannot meet the minimum visual requirements except with the aid of\ncorrective lenses or telescopic lenses, a renewal license with an appropriate\nrestriction shall be issued. If at renewal, a person's visual acuity has\ndiminished to the extent that he must utilize telescopic lenses to meet the\nminimum visual acuity standards, he will be required to convert his New York\ndriver license to the class D or class DJ driver license classification, except\nsuch license will not be valid for the operation of class B or C limited use\nmotorcycles. (c) Upon application\nfor renewal, if a person required to submit to a vision reexamination holds a\nlicense which is restricted to operation with corrective lenses or telescopic\nlenses, and such person can meet the minimum visual requirements without the\nuse of such lenses, such person shall be entitled to file an application to\nhave that restriction removed from his renewal license. Such application shall\nnot require a fee. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n5.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
