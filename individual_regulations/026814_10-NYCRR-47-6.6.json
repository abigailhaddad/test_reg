A recipient is required to practice in an underserved area in the profession for which he/she received an award for a period of nine months for each annual award received for part-time study. However, in no case shall the total number of months of service be less than 18. If a recipient receives more than one award, the service obligations for such awards shall run consecutively.

A recipient must agree to the following practice requirements: (1)\nprovide primary care services in an underserved area; (2)\nwork in a practice site that accepts payment on behalf of beneficiaries of title XVIII of the Federal Social Security Act (Medicare) and individuals eligible for medical assistance pursuant to title 11 of article five of the Social Services Law; and\n(3)\nprovide 35 hours per week of direct patient care in the underserved area.
