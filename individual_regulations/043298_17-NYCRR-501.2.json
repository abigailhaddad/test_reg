Tit. 17 § 501.2 - Representation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In any proceeding, parties may present their own case either personally or\nthrough a representative, or through a representative who is an attorney duly\nlicensed to practice in the State of New York. For the purpose of this section, an officer of a corporation or member of a limited liability company that is a\nparty to a proceeding may represent that entity. (b) All representatives must file a written\nnotice of appearance. (c) All\nrepresentatives will be held to the same standard of conduct as are attorneys\nlicensed by the State of New York. Failure to comply with such standards may\nresult in the barring of a representative from further participation in the\nproceeding. Any non-attorney representative who, in the sole discretion of the\npresiding officer, is deemed to be engaged in the unlicensed practice of law in\n\nNew York State, shall be barred from participation in any administrative\nproceedings, and such non-attorney representative's unlicensed practice of law\nmay be referred to the appropriate authorities for potential enforcement\naction.
