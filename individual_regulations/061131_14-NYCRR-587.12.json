In order\nto assure that this referral process best meets the needs of the local mental\nhealth system, a partial hospitalization program shall develop admission\nreferral and linkage agreements with providers designated by the Office of\n\nMental Health in consultation with the appropriate local government unit.

(h) The provider of service of a partial\nhospitalization program shall develop a plan for assuring continuity of care\nwithin the mental health system and other service systems\n(\ne.g., social services, health care, local correctional\nsystems). Such plan shall be subject to approval by the Office of Mental\n\nHealth. (i) Admission to a partial\nhospitalization program shall occur within the first three visits.
