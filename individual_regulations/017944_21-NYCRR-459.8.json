  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 459.8 - Days and hours during which service may be discontinued\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Electric service may be discontinued on\n\nMonday through Thursday during the regular business hours of the utility. Service may not be discontinued on, or immediately preceding, a day in which\nthe office of the utility is not open for business or on a public holiday. The\nutility may refuse to resume electric service so long as any part of the amount\ndue remains unpaid, unless other mutually satisfactory arrangements are\nmade. (b) A utility may not\ndiscontinue service for nonpayment of service bills rendered or failure to post\na required deposit until it has taken reasonable steps to verify that payment\nwas not received or posted to the customer's account up to the day that\ndisconnection is to occur. Receipt of a subsequently dishonored negotiable\ninstrument in response to a notice of discontinuance of service shall not\nconstitute payment and no further notice need be issued prior to\ndiscontinuance. (c) Such\ndiscontinuance of electric service will not relieve customer of liability for\nany minimum charge during the time electric service is so\ndiscontinued. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n459.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
