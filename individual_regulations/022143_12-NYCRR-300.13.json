Such review is discretionary unless a board\nmember dissents from the ruling regarding a finding other than the issue of\nwhether to appoint an impartial medical specialist. Upon notice to the\nclaimant, his or her legal representative, if any, the employer or carrier or\nspecial fund, the full board may review any case on its own motion. (3)\n\nFiling\nmeans an\napplication has been received by the board at the designated point of receipt.

Treating medical\nproviders and independent medical examiners are not parties of interest and may\nnot make filings, oral arguments, or otherwise participate in the\nadministrative review process. Attorneys and licensed hearing representatives\nare not necessary parties of interest under this rule, except that an attorney\nor representative is a necessary party in an appeal that concerns the amount of\na fee payable to an attorney or representative or a penalty imposed against an\nattorney or licensed hearing representative. A claimant's attorney or licensed\nhearing representative, properly designated by the claimant as his or her\nrepresentative, shall receive a copy of any applications or rebuttals filed\nunder this section. (b) Requests for administrative review and requests for full board review filed\npursuant to Workers' Compensation Law section 23, and requests for\nreconsideration of a board panel decision pursuant to section\n300.14\nof this Part. (1)\n\nApplication format. Unless submitted by\nan unrepresented claimant, an application to the board for administrative\nreview of a decision by a Workers' Compensation Law judge shall be in the\nformat as prescribed by the chair. The application in the format prescribed by\nthe chair must be filled out completely by the appellant, except that the\nrequirement to utilize the application format shall not be imposed upon a\nclaimant who is unrepresented. (i) Unless\notherwise specified by the chair, the appellant may attach a legal brief of up\nto eight pages in length, in 12-point font, with one inch margins, on 8.5 inch\nby 11 paper. A brief longer than eight pages will not be considered, unless the\nappellant specifies, in writing, why the legal argument could not have been\nmade within eight pages. In no event shall a brief longer than 15 pages be\nconsidered. (ii)\n\nDocuments that are\npresent in the board's electronic case folder at the time the administrative\nreview is submitted shall not be, included with or attached to the application. The board may reject applications for review by an appellant, or an attorney or\nlicensed representative of the appellant, who attaches documents that are\nalready in the case folder at the time of the application. (iii)\n\nIf the appellant seeks to introduce\nadditional documentary evidence in the administrative appeal that was not\npresented before the Workers' Compensation Law judge, the appellant must submit\na sworn affidavit, setting forth the evidence, and explaining why it could not\nhave been presented before the Workers' Compensation Law judge. The board has\ndiscretion to accept or deny such newly filed evidence. Newly filed evidence\nsubmitted without the affidavit will not be considered by the board\npanel.

Service upon a party who is not adverse to the\ninterest of the appellant may not render the appeal defective as such party is\nnot a necessary party of interest. Failure to properly serve a necessary party\nshall be deemed defective service and the application may be rejected by the\nboard. (a) Proof of service in the format\nprescribed by the chair shall specify the papers served, the person who was\nserved, the date, and method of service including the actual address, email\naddress or fax number where service was transmitted.

When the appellant fails to supply proper proof\nof timely service upon a necessary party. (a) When a rebuttal is submitted, the necessary party shall raise the issue of\ndefective service in its rebuttal.
