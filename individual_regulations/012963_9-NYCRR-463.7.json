  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 463.7 - \"in lieu of\" moving expenses for business or farm occupants\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn lieu of actual, reasonable and necessary moving\nexpenses, searching fees and actual direct losses of tangible personal\nproperty, a business or farm operation is eligible for a payment equal to the\naverage annual net earnings of the displaced business or farm, except such\npayment shall not be less than $2,500 nor more than $10,000, providing the\nfollowing requirements are met: (a) Business. The owner of the business eligible for relocation expenses must\nsubmit a written application as prescribed by the commissioner with eligibility\nfor payment contingent upon the State's determination that the business: (1)\ncannot be relocated without a substantial\nloss of patronage, herein defined as the average dollar volume of business\ntransacted during the two taxable years immediately preceding the year in which\nthe business is relocated; (2)\nis\nnot part of a commercial enterprise having at least one other establishment\nwhich is not being acquired by the State or the United States and which is\nengaged in the same or similar business; and\n(3)\nthe business contributes materially to\nthe income of the displaced owner. (b) Farm. The owner of a displaced farm\noperation must submit a written application as prescribed by the commissioner\nwith eligibility for payment contingent upon the State's determination that: (1)\nthe farm operator has discontinued or\nrelocated his entire operation at the present location; and\n(2)\nin the case of a partial taking, the\nproperty remaining after the acquisition is no longer an economic unit as\ndetermined by the State in its appraisal process. (c) The office will calculate a payment in\nlieu of moving expenses equivalent to the average annual net earnings. The term\naverage annual net earnings means one half of any net earnings of the business\nor farm before Federal, State and local income taxes during the two taxable\nyears immediately preceding the taxable year in which the business or farm is\nrelocated. Such earnings shall include any compensation paid by the business or\nfarm to the owner and his immediate family during the base-year period. In the\ncase of a corporation, earnings shall include any compensation paid by the\ncorporation to the owner of a majority interest in the corporation. For\npurposes of determining majority ownership, stock held by a husband and his\nimmediate family shall be treated as one unit. (d) If the business or farm affected can show\nthat it was in business 12 consecutive months during the two taxable years\nprior to the taxable year in which it is required to relocate; had income\nduring such period and is otherwise eligible, the owner of a business is\neligible to receive the \"in lieu of\" payment. Where the business was in\noperation during the entire two preceding taxable years, the payment shall be\ncomputed by dividing the net earnings by the number of months the business was\noperated and multiplying by 12. A taxable year is defined as any 12-month\nperiod used by the business in filing income tax returns. (e) For the owner of a business or farm to be\nentitled to this payment, the business or farm must provide information to\nsupport the net earnings. State or Federal income tax returns for the years in\nquestion are acceptable as evidence of earnings. Any commonly accepted method\nof verifying earnings may be offered, provided it grants the State the right to\nreview the records and accounts of the business or farm. The eligible person\nwill be notified in writing by the office regarding his eligibility, and the\namount of the \"in lieu of\" payment, if any, will be set forth\ntherein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n463.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
