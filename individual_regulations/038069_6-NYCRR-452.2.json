  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 452.2 - Site characteristics: highway operations\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Measurement shall be made at a test site\nwhich is adjacent to, and includes a portion of, a traveled lane of a public\nhighway. A microphone target point shall be established on the centerline of\nthe traveled lane of the highway, and a microphone location point shall be\nestablished on the ground surface not less than 35 feet (10.7 m) nor more than\n83 feet (25.3 m) from the microphone target point and on a line that is\nperpendicular to the centerline of the traveled lane of the highway and that\npasses through the microphone target point. In the case of a standard test\nsite, the microphone location point is 50 feet (15.2 m) from the microphone\ntarget point. Within the test site is a triangular measurement area. A plan\nview diagram of a standard test site, having an open site within a 50-foot\n(15.2 m) radius of both the microphone target point and the microphone location\npoint, is shown in Figure 1, below. Measurements may be made at a test site\nhaving smaller or greater dimensions in accordance with the rules in Part 454\nof this Title. Image\n(b) The test site must be an open site, essentially free of large sound-reflecting objects. However, the following\nobjects may be within the test site, including the triangular measurement area: (1)\n\nSmall cylindrical objects such as fire\nhydrants or telephone or utility poles. (2)\n\nRural mailboxes. (3)\n\nTraffic railings of any type of\nconstruction except solid concrete barriers (see §\n450.2\n[s]\nof this\n\nTitle.)\n(4)\n\nOne or more curbs\nhaving a vertical height of one foot (0.3 m) or less. (c) The following objects may be within the\ntest site if they are outside of the triangular measurement area of the site: (1)\n\nAny vertical surface (such as billboard), regardless of size, having a lower edge more than 15 feet (4.6 m) higher than\nthe surface of the traveled lane of the highway. (2)\n\nAny uniformly smooth sloping surface\nslanting away from the highway (such as a rise in grade alongside the highway)\nwith a slope that is less than 45 degrees above the horizontal. (3)\n\nAny surface slanting away from the\nhighway that is 45 degrees or more and not more than 90 degrees above the\nhorizontal, if all points on the surface are more than 15 feet (4.6 m) above\nthe surface of the traveled lane of the highway. (d) The surface of the ground within the\nmeasurement area must be relatively flat (see section\n450.2\n[o]\n). The\nsite shall be a \"soft\" test site. However, if the site is determined to be\n\"hard\", the correction factor specified in section\n454.3\n(a) of this\n\nPart shall be applied to the measurement. (e) The traveled lane of the highway within\nthe test site must be dry, paved with relatively smooth concrete or asphalt, and substantially free of: (1)\n\nHoles or other\ndefects which would cause a motor vehicle to emit irregular tire, body or\nchassis impact noise; and\n(2)\n\nLoose\nmaterial, such as gravel or sand. (f) The traveled lane of the highway on which\nthe microphone target point is situated must not pass through a tunnel or\nunderpass located within 200 feet (61 m) of that point. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n452.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
