  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 363-6.3 - Groundwater separation\n\nState Regulations\n\nIn cases where the base of the constructed liner system\nis less than five feet above the seasonal high groundwater elevation, the\ndepartment will require additional groundwater suppression systems to ensure\nthat groundwater does not come in contact with the lowest portion of the\nlandfill liner. At sites where perched water is encountered, the department\nwill determine with respect to groundwater separation distances whether\nseparation distances will be measured from the perched zone or the non-perched\nwater table. The nature of the materials making up this separation, whether\nnatural or backfilled, is subject to department approval. This minimum five\nfeet separation requirement may be reduced or waived upon demonstration of\nselection of a suitable landfill site, as defined under section\n363-5.1\n(a) of this\n\nPart and, that the proposed activity will have no significant adverse impact on\nthe overall stability of the landfill, the environment, or natural resources\nand that the landfill's performance will be consistent with that which is\nexpected from the application of this Part. In these cases, the department will\nrequire additional groundwater suppression systems to ensure that the seasonal\nhigh groundwater table does not come in contact with the lowermost portion of\nthe landfill liner during construction, and until the hydrostatic pressures are\nequalized by weight of the liner system and/or waste.
