  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.24 - Pick-four pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A winning\npick-four wager requires selection of the first-place finisher in each of four\ndesignated, consecutive contests, unless otherwise provided in this section. The association or corporation must obtain written approval from the commission\nconcerning the scheduling of pick-four contests and the designation of the\nmethod used. Any changes to the approved pick-four format require prior\napproval from the commission. (b) The pick-four wager is not a parlay and has no connection or relation to the\nother betting pools for the respective races. The pick-four pool shall be held\nentirely separate from all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta or other wagering pool. (c) Resale of pick-four tickets from one\nindividual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection and may be\ndeemed illegal gambling. (d) Races\nin which pick-four pools shall be conducted shall be clearly designated in the\nprogram and racing cards issued by the association or corporation. (e) The design of the pick-four tickets shall\nbe clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (f) Scratched horses\nand nonstarters. Should a programmed starter be scratched or declared\na nonstarter in any pick-four race before the start of the first pick-four\nrace, any affected bettor may select another betting interest, if the wager can\nbe canceled and a replacement wager issued before the start of the first\npick-four race, or may obtain a cancellation of the wager prior to the start of\nthe first pick-four race. If neither option is exercised, then wagers upon such\nscratched or declared nonstarter shall be deemed wagers upon the designated\nhorse for such race. The\ndesignated horse\nmeans the betting\nentry or field upon which the most wagering money has been registered at the\ntrack in the win pool at the close of win-pool betting for such race. In the\nevent of a money tie, the tied betting entry or field with the lowest program\nnumber shall be designated. At any time after wagering begins on the pick-four\npool, should an entire betting entry or field be scratched or declared a\nnonstarter in any pick-four race, no further tickets selecting such betting\nentry or field shall be issued, and wagers upon such betting entry or field, for purposes of the pick-four pool, shall be deemed wagers upon the designated\nhorse. Wagers in the pick-four pool upon an entry or field of horses from which\na starter or starters may have been scratched will, in the case of such entry\nor field, be deemed wagers upon the horse or horses remaining in such entry or\nfield. In case no starter remains representing any betting entry or field, wagers upon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated\nhorse in the race affected by the scratch. Should the balance of a betting\nentry or field race as a non-betting starter for purposes of other pari-mutuel\npools, as provided in sections\n4009.20\nand\n4009.21\nof this Article, wagers\nupon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for\nsuch race. (g) Wagering tickets and winners. If neither subdivision (h) nor subdivision (i) of\nthis section applies, then the pick-four pool shall be apportioned in the\nfollowing order: (1)\n\nIf no pick-four\nticket is sold combining the winners of the four pick-four races, all pick-four\ntickets designating three winners shall be considered winning tickets and the\nnet pool distributed equally to holders of such tickets. (2)\n\nIf no pick-four ticket is sold combining\nthe winners of three such races, all pick-four tickets designating two winners\nshall be considered winning tickets and the net pool distributed equally to\nholders of such tickets. (3)\n\nIf no\npick-four ticket is sold combining the winners of two such races, all pick-four\ntickets designating one winner shall be considered winning tickets and the net\npool distributed equally to holders of such tickets. (4)\n\nIf no pick-four ticket is sold\ndesignating any winner to win in the designated pick-four races, the pick-four\nshall be declared off and the gross pool refunded. (h) Race cancellations. (1)\n\nIf one or two of the pick-four races are\ncancelled or declared no race or non-betting, then those who selected the\nwinners in the greatest number of other pick-four races shall share the net\npool. (2)\n\nIf more than two of the\npick-four races are cancelled or declared no race or non-betting, then the\nentire pool shall be cancelled and all pick-four wagers shall be\nrefunded. (3)\n\nIf any of the\ndesignated races of the pick-four sequence is cancelled or declared no race or\nnon-betting before the first pick-four race is made official, then the\npick-four pool shall be declared off and the gross pool refunded. (i) Surface\ntransfers. When the condition of a turf course warrants a change\nof racing surface to a non-turf course in any of the pick-four races, and such\nchange has not been known to the public before the close of wagering for the\npick-four pool, such changed race shall be deemed an all win race for pick-four\nwagering purposes. An\nall win race\nmeans the winning horse of\nthat race is assigned to each pick-four ticket holder as such ticket holder's\nselection for that race. If there is a surface transfer in one or more of the\npick-four races, then those who selected the winners in the greatest number of\nraces without a surface transfer shall share the net pool. If there are no\nwagers selecting the winner of at least one of the races without a surface\ntransfer, then the entire pool for such program shall be refunded. If any of\nthe designated races is cancelled or declared \"no race,\" then the pick-four\npool will be determined by the winners of the remaining race or\nraces. (j) Dead\nheats. In the event of a dead heat for win in a pick-four\nrace, all pick-four tickets designating any such horse to win shall be eligible\nfor participation in the remaining pick-four races, and the net pool shall be\nequally distributed to the winners, that is, the net pool will be divided by\nthe total amount represented by all winning tickets and the resulting price, per dollar, and after breakage, shall be the payoff price, which shall be\nuniform for any winning combination. (k)-(o)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(p) In the event of occurrences\nnot encompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution\nshall be formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel practice and in\naccordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this section; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made on the\nbasis of outstanding tickets, then the method of formulation announced by the\ntrack, and the basis upon which payments have been made shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (q) Posting of winning\ncombinations. Every pick-four wagering combination entitled to a\npayoff shall be posted publicly by the track operator together with the payoff\nprice. (r) Non-transferability. Pick-four tickets shall be nontransferable, and\nviolations of this subdivision may lead to confiscation and cancellation of\nsuch tickets in addition to other disciplinary action. (s)-(w)\n[\nReserved\n]\n(x) Copies of this section shall\nbe made available free of charge by the track to the public in the public\nbetting area of the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
