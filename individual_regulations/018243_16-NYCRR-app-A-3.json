Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app A-3\n\nState Regulations\n(cf. §\n11.5\n[a]\n)\nA Model Letter and Form for Documentation of Inability to Pay\n\nUtility Bills\n\nWe have received an initial certificate of medical emergency, under which we must continue to provide you with utility service for 30 days, starting ________ and continuing until the beginning of business on\n________. At the expiration of that period, we can, under the provisions\nof law (sec. 32[3][a], Public Service Law) and Public Service Commission's\nregulations (16 NYCRR\n11.5\n[a]), terminate your utility service UNLESS the\nmedical condition persists AND you do not have enough ready cash or income to\nmeet your past due and current utility bills and still meet your other\nnecessary expenses such as food, housing and medical treatment. We enclose a form that you can use to provide the information\nwe need to make a determination, as required by law, whether you are unable to\npay past due and current bills. We will continue to provide you with utility\nservice while we consider the information you provide. If we determine that you have NOT demonstrated that you are\nunable to pay past due and current bills, we will notify you in writing and\ninform you how you can seek review of our determination by the Public Service\n\nCommission. If we determine that you have NOT shown that you have a\nfinancial hardship, we will offer you a deferred payment agreement, so that you\ncan pay past due bills and installments while you meet all current bills. And\nif you DO show a financial hardship, we will try to work out an arrangement so\nthat you will not accumulate substantial past due bills. If you have any questions, you can call (local utility\noffice/customer representative) at xxx-xxxx. If you are not satisfied with our\nresponse, you also can call the Public Service Commission during regular\nbusiness hours at xxx-xxxx, or, in an emergency, you can call the Public\n\nService Commission until 7:30 p.m., Monday through Friday at\n1-800-342-3355.
