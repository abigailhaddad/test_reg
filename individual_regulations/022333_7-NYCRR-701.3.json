  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 701.3 - General policies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Inmate's responsibility. An inmate is encouraged to resolve his/her complaints\nthrough the guidance and counseling unit, the program area directly affected, or other existing channels (informal or formal) prior to submitting a\ngrievance. Although a facility may not impose preconditions for submission of a\ngrievance, the failure of an inmate to attempt to resolve a problem on his/her\nown may result in the dismissal and closing of a grievance at an IGRC\nhearing. (b) Grievances must be\npersonal. An inmate must be personally affected by the policy or issue he/she\nis grieving, or must show that he/she will be personally affected by that\npolicy or issue unless some relief is granted or changes made. All grievances\nmust be filed in an individual capacity. (c) Visitor complaints. Visitor complaints\nshall be processed via the office of diversity management in accordance with\nthe departmental procedure on discriminatory treatment complaints of\nvisitors. (d) Class actions not\naccepted. Individuals personally affected by a matter which affects a class of\ninmates may only file a grievance on their own behalf. Grievances which are\nraised in terms of class actions should be referred to the inmate liaison\ncommittee. (e) Non-grievable\nissues. (1)\n\nAn individual decision or\ndisposition of any current or subsequent program or procedure having a written\nappeal mechanism which extends review to outside the facility shall be\nconsidered non-grievable. (2)\n\nAn\nindividual decision or disposition of the temporary release committee, time\nallowance committee, family reunion program or media review committee is not\ngrievable. Likewise, an individual decision or disposition resulting from a\ndisciplinary proceeding, inmate property claim (of any amount), central\nmonitoring case review or records review (freedom of information request, expunction) is not grievable. In addition, an individual decision or\ndisposition of the commissioner, or his designees, on a foreign national\nprisoner application for international transfer is not grievable. (3)\n\nThe policies, rules, and procedures of\nany program or procedure, including those above, are grievable. Note: If an inmate is unsure whether an issue is grievable, he/she should file a grievance and the question will be decided through the\ngrievance process in accordance with section\n701.5\nof this\n\nPart. (f) Outside agencies excluded. Any policy, regulation or rule of an outside agency\n(e.g., the division of parole, immigration and customs enforcement, the office\nof mental health, etc.) or action taken by an entity not under the supervision\nof the commissioner is not within the jurisdiction of the IGP. (g) Reasonable accommodations. The IGP\nsupervisor will ensure that disabled inmates are provided the necessary\nassistance to facilitate their access to and use of the IGP. Reasonable\naccommodations shall include, but not be limited to, meetings with inmates at\naccessible sites and the provision of qualified sign language interpreters for\ndeaf and hard-of-hearing inmates who use sign language to communicate. Copies\nof all grievance decisions concerning reasonable accommodations for disabled\ninmates shall be sent to the ADA coordinator in central office. (h) Translators. Translators will be used to\nfacilitate access to the IGP for those inmates who do not speak\n\nEnglish. (i) Sexual Abuse and\n\nSexual Harassment Complaints. The Department has zero tolerance for sexual\nabuse and sexual harassment. Consistent with this policy and the Prison Rape\n\nElimination Act (PREA) Standards (28 C.F.R. §\n115.52(a)\n), an inmate is\nnot required to file a grievance concerning an alleged incident of sexual abuse\nor sexual harassment to satisfy the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA)\nexhaustion requirement (42 U.S.C. §\n1997e(a)\n)  before bringing a\nlawsuit regarding an allegation of sexual abuse as long as the matter was\nreported as set forth below. For purposes of the Prison Rape Elimination Act\n(PREA) Standards (28 C.F.R. §\n115.52\n)  and the exhaustion requirement, any\nallegation concerning an incident of sexual abuse or sexual harassment (See, Departmental Directives #4027A Sexual Abuse Prevention & Intervention\n\nInmate-on-Inmate and #4028A Sexual Abuse Prevention & Intervention Staff-o\nn-Inmate) shall be deemed exhausted if official documentation confirms that: (1)\nan inmate who alleges being the victim of\nsexual abuse or sexual harassment reported the incident to facility staff; in\nwriting to Central Office Staff; to any outside agency that the Department has\nidentified as having agreed to receive and immediately forward inmate report s\nof sexual abuse and sexual harassment to agency officials under the PRE A\nStandards (28 C.F.R. §\n115.51(b)\n); or to the\n\nDepartment's Office of the Inspector General; or\n(2)\na third party reported that an inmate is\nthe victim of sexual abuse and the alleged victim confirmed the allegation upon\ninvestigation. A sexual abuse or sexual harassment complaint may be\nsubmitted at any time, however, a timely complaint is essential to providing\nservices and proper investigation. Acceptance of a late complaint does not\nwaive the applicable statute of limitations with respect to any related\nlawsuit. Any inmate grievance filed regarding a complaint of sexual\nabuse or sexual harassment shall immediately be reported by the IGP Supervisor\nto the Watch Commander for further handling in accordance with Departmental\npolicies. The complaint shall be deemed exhausted upon filing for PLRA\npurposes. If the grievance does not set forth any additional matters that\nrequire a response, the grievance shall be closed. Notes\nN.Y.
