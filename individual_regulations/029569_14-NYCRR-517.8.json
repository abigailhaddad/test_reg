  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 517.8 - Emergency accommodation of patients\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The commissioner may authorize the\ndirector of a hospital (referred to in this section as the \"evacuating\nhospital\") to arrange with one or more directors of OMH hospitals, designated\nby the commissioner or a designee thereof, for the immediate emergency\naccommodation of patients, upon a determination that: (1)\novercrowding presently exists at the\nevacuating hospital because of a scarcity of space; or\n(2)\nan unforeseen occurrence or act has\ncreated a hazard which immediately renders a significant portion of one or more\nbuildings of the evacuating hospital unfit for its normal use and will result\nin overcrowding of remaining space. (b) Emergency accommodation shall be provided\nto all patients in need of such accommodation, regardless of their admission\nstatus. (c) When a patient is\nprovided with emergency accommodation pursuant to this section, the evacuating\nhospital shall give notice in accordance with section\n517.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (d) Upon alleviation of the\ncondition which caused emergency accommodation of a patient, such patient shall\nbe offered the opportunity to return to the evacuating hospital. Any patient\nwho elects to remain at the hospital which provided emergency accommodation may\nbe permitted to do so if such hospital agrees to formal admission of the\npatient and if, based on the criteria established in section\n517.4\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Part, the patient's best interests would be better served by admission to\nsuch hospital than by return to the evacuating hospital. In such case, the\ndirectors of the evacuating hospital and of the hospital which provided\nemergency accommodation shall cooperate in effecting the patient's formal\nadmission to the latter hospital. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 14\n§\n517.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
