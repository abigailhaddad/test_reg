  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 262.225 - Alcohol tests required\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach operator shall conduct the following types of\nalcohol tests for the presence of alcohol: (a) Post-accident. (1)\n\nAs soon as practicable following an\naccident, each operator shall test each surviving covered employee for alcohol\nif that employee' s performance of a covered function either contributed to the\naccident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the\naccident. The decision not to administer a test under this section shall be\nbased on the operator's determination, using the best available information at\nthe time of the determination, that the covered employee's performance could\nnot have contributed to the accident. (i) If a\ntest required by this section is not administered within two hours following\nthe accident, the operator shall prepare and maintain on file a record stating\nthe reasons the test was not promptly administered. If a test required by this\nsubdivision is not administered within eight hours following the accident the\noperator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in\nthe record the reasons for not administering the test. (ii)\n[Reserved]\n(3)\nA covered employee who is subject to\npost-accident testing who fails to remain readily available for such testing, including notifying the operator or operator representative of his/her location\nif he/she leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to such test, may be deemed by the operator to have refused to submit to testing. Nothing in\nthis section shall be construed to require the delay of necessary medical\nattention for injured people following an accident or to prohibit a covered\nemployee from leaving the scene of an accident for the period necessary to\nobtain assistance in responding to the accident or to obtain necessary\nemergency medical care. (b) Reasonable suspicion testing. (1)\n\nEach operator shall require a covered\nemployee to submit to an alcohol test when the operator has reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nThe operator's\ndetermination that reasonable suspicion exists to require the covered employee\nto undergo an alcohol test shall be based on specific, contemporaneous, articulable observations concerning the appearance, behavior, speech, or body\nodors of the employee. The required observations shall be made by a supervisor\nwho is trained in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse. The supervisor who\nmakes the determination that reasonable suspicion exists shall not conduct the\nbreath alcohol test on that employee. (3)\n\nAlcohol testing is authorized by this\nsection only if the observations required by paragraph (2) of this subdivision\nare made during, just preceding, or just after the period of the work day that\nthe employee is required to be in compliance with this Part. A covered employee\nmay be directed by the operator to undergo reasonable suspicion testing for\nalcohol only while the employee is performing covered functions; just before\nthe employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the employee has\nceased performing covered functions. (4)\n(i) If a\ntest required by this section is not administered within two hours following\nthe determination under paragraph (2) of this subdivision, the operator shall\nprepare and maintain on file a record stating the reasons the test was not\npromptly administered. If a test required by this section is not administered\nwithin eight hours following the determination under paragraph (2) of this\nsubdivision, the operator shall cease attempts to administer an alcohol test\nand shall state in the record the reasons for not administering the test. Records shall be submitted to RSPA upon request of the administrator. (ii)\n[Reserved]\n(iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the absence of a\nreasonable suspicion alcohol test under this section an operator shall not\npermit a covered employee to report for duty or remain on duty requiring the\nperformance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of\nor impaired by alcohol, as shown by the behavioral, speech or performance\nindicators of alcohol misuse, nor shall an operator permit the covered employee\nto perform or continue to perform covered functions, until: (a) an alcohol test is administered and the\nemployee's alcohol concentration measures less than 0.02; or\n(b) the start of the employees next regularly\nscheduled duty period, but not less than eight hours following the\ndetermination under paragraph (2) of this subdivision that there is reasonable\nsuspicion to believe that the employee has violated the prohibitions in this\n\nPart. (iv)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, no operator shall take any\naction under this Part against a covered employee based solely on the\nemployee's behavior and appearance in the absence of an alcohol test. This does\nnot prohibit an operator with the authority independent of this Part from\ntaking any action otherwise consistent with law. (c) Return-to-duty testing. Each\noperator shall ensure that before a covered employee returns to duty requiring\nthe performance of a covered function after engaging in conduct prohibited by\nsections 262.215 through\n262.223\nof this Part, the employee\nshall undergo a return-to-duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol\nconcentration of less than 0.02. (d) Follow-up testing. (1)\n\nFollowing a determination under section\n262.243\n(b) of\nthis Part that a covered employee is in need of assistance in resolving\nproblems associated with alcohol misuse, each operator shall ensure that the\nemployee is subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol testing as directed by a\nsubstance abuse professional in accordance with the provisions of section\n262.243\n(c)(2)(ii)\nof this Part. (2)\n\nFollow-up testing\nshall be conducted when the covered employee is performing covered functions; just before the employee is to perform covered functions; or just after the\nemployee has ceased performing such functions. (e) Retesting of covered employees with an\nalcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04. Each operator\nshall retest a covered employee to ensure compliance with the provisions of\nsection\n262.237\nof this Part, if an\noperator chooses to permit the employee to perform a covered function within\neight hours following the administration of an alcohol test indicating an\nalcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04.
