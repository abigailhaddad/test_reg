Tit. 10, app 75-B § 75-B.2 - Activated carbon treatment systems\n\nState Regulations\n\nThese systems consist of filtration equipment which use\nactivated carbon to remove organic chemicals from individual water supplies. They also may be used to improve the aestetic quality of drinking water. These\nsystems are normally installed between the water source and the first point of\nuse in the water distribution system. (a) When an activated carbon filter unit is\ninstalled to treat an individual water supply containing organic chemicals, it\nmust meet all of the following conditions: (1)\n\nThe units are installed in-line and serve\nthe whole household. Faucet or undersink units shall not be used for the\nremoval of organic chemicals. (2)\n\nThe treatment unit must be capable of processing water at a flow rate of at\nleast five gallons per minute (gpm). Flow rates may be reduced if additional\npressurized storage is provided after the treatment unit to insure the system\nwill provide at least five gpm of treated water to the household continuously\nfor a minimum of 20 minutes. (3)\n\nThe maximum application rate shall be 10 gpm per square foot of activated\ncarbon surface area. Flow rates shall be controlled by a flow limiting\ndevice. (4)\n\nThe minimum empty bed\ncontact time shall be three minutes. This should be accomplished with at least\ntwo filter units of equal size placed in series. (5)\n\nOnly virgin carbon shall be used. The\ncylinder should be recharged at a point outside the residence and the spent\nactivated carbon properly disposed of by the vendor. (6)\n\nDisinfection must be provided after the\nactivated carbon unit. The preferred method of disenfection is an ultraviolet\nunit with a minimum rating of five gpm. The unit shall have a fail-safe device\nthat detects the intensity of the ultraviolet light and automatically shuts\ndown the system when the intensity decreases to below the minimum effective\nlevel specified for the unit. A manual or automatic wipe must be provided. An\nalternate method of disinfection would be sodium hypochlorite. If sodium\nhypochlorite is used, contact time adequate to eliminate, pathological\norganisms must be provided after the point of injection and prior to\nconsumption. The local health unit having jurisdiction may allow the use of\nactivated carbon units without disinfection upon the adoption of a formal\nprocedure for the approval of treatment systems installations, and notification\nto homeowners of the need for disinfection. (7)\n\nTreatment units capable of backwashing\nshall only use treated water for that purpose. Backwashing should be at a\nminimum flow rate of 10 gpm for at least two minutes. The backwashing must be\naccomplished in a manner that does not create a cross-connection. The\nwastewater shall not be discharged to the ground surface but may be discharged\nto a septic system. (8)\n\nAll\ncomponents of treatment units must safely withstand the highest water pressure\nin the system. (9)\n\nThe following\nmust be provided: (i) A flow meter to record\ntotal flow. (ii)\n\nSampling taps for\nraw, partially treated and treated water. (iii)\nadequate valving to isolate the various\ncomponents, and for backwashing of filters. (iv)\n\nOnly nontoxic materials and\ncoatings. (v) Ease of access to all\ncomponents. (vi)\n\nPrefiltration\nwhere appropriate to remove turbidity and bacteria. (vii)\n\nPressure gauges before and after the\nactivated carbon unit. (b) Other than whole-house units. Because\norganic chemicals can be inhaled and absorbed through the skin during baths and\nshowers, the following types of point-of-use activated carbon units are not\nsuitable for use where the water contains organics: (1)\n\nPour-through units - a stand-alone\ndevice, not attached to the water supply system, and normally manually\noperated. (2)\n\nFaucet-mount units -\na unit mounted directly at the outlet of an individual tap or faucet. (3)\n\nIn-line, one-tap units - a unit mounted\nin a supply line that serves only one tap or faucet. (4)\n\nLine-bypass units - an in-line unit that\nserves a separate tap or faucet intended for drinking water use only. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
