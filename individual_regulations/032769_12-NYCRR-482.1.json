  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 482.1 - Statement of intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The intent of section\n599\nof the Labor Law\nis to return the unemployed worker to the labor market with the necessary\nskills required to provide the claimant with the opportunity to secure\nemployment of a substantially equal or higher skill level than the claimant's\npast employment. Subject to the availability of funds, additional unemployment\ninsurance benefits provided by section\n599\nof the Labor Law\nshall be paid to a claimant who is in regular attendance at an approved career\nand related training program and who has exhausted regular unemployment\ninsurance benefits and, if in effect, any other extended benefits, and provided\nthat entitlement to a new benefit claim cannot be established. (b) In order to avoid the dissipation of\nlimited training funds, the Commissioner of Labor is exercising discretion not\nto pay additional unemployment benefits based on protracted waiting periods of\nmore than six weeks before the claimant enters training. Accordingly, no more\nthan 12 weeks of additional unemployment insurance benefits will be paid based\non the effective days of regular benefits remaining between the time a claimant\nis accepted in or demonstrates application for approved training and the date\nthe claimant begins such training. (c) Approval to receive additional benefits\nwhile attending approved career and related training is subject to the\navailability of funds. The Commissioner of Labor has established uniform\nprocedures for denying additional benefits to individuals when sufficient funds\nare not available, and for payment of additional benefits prospectively in the\nevent additional funds become available at a later time.
