  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 146-1.4 - Overtime hourly rates\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn employer shall pay an employee for overtime at a wage\nrate of 11/2 times the employee's regular rate for hours worked in excess of 40\nhours in one workweek. When an employer is taking a credit toward the basic\nminimum hourly rate pursuant to section\n146-1.3\nof this Subpart, the\novertime rate shall be the employee's regular rate of pay before subtracting\nany tip credit, multiplied by 11/2, minus the tip credit. It is a violation of\nthe overtime requirement for an employer to subtract the tip credit first and\nthen multiply the reduced rate by one and one half. Example 1: Non-tipped employee (when the basic minimum hourly rate is less than or equal\nto $10.00). Example 2: Tipped employee (when the basic minimum\nwage was $5.00, and the maximum tip credit was $2.25, for food service\nworkers). An employee regularly paid $10 per hour\nwho works 50 hours in a workweek: Regular rate: $10.00 per hour\n\nOvertime rate: $10.00 x 1.5 = $15.00 per hour\n\nWage for 40 hours: $10.00 x 40 = $400.00\n\nWage for 10 hours: $15.00 x 10 = $150.00\n\nTotal $550.00\nA food service worker regularly paid\n$7.25 per hour minus a tip credit of $2.25 per hour, for a wage rate of $5 per\nhour, who works 50 hours in a workweek: Regular rate: $7.25 per hour\n\nOvertime rate: $7.25 x 1.5 = $10.875 per hour\n\nWage rate for 40 hours: $7.25 - $2.25 = $5.00 per hour\n\nWage rate for 10 hours: $10.875 - $2.25 = $8.625 per hour\n\nWages for the workweek: $5.00 x 40 hours = $200.00\n$8.625 x 10 hours = $86.25\n\nTotal $286.25\n\nAlternative calculation: Wages for the work week: $7.25 x 40 hours = $290.00\n$10.875 x 10 hours = $108.75\n\nSubtotal $398.75\n\nMinus tip credit\n$2.25 x 50 hours = - 112.50\n\nTotal $286.25\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
