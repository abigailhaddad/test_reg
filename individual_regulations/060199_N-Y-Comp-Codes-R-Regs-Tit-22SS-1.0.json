  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22§ 1.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe purpose of these standards and policies\nis to assign and regulate administrative authority in a complex, multi-tiered\ncourt system. The Constitution now vests in a Chief Administrator of the\n\nCourts, on behalf of the Chief Judge, responsibility for supervising the\nadministration and operation of our courts. Heretofore this has been the\nconstitutional responsibility of the Appellate Divisions of the Supreme Court\nand the Administrative Board of the Judicial Conference. These standards and\npolicies reflect the judgment of the Chief Judge and of the Court of Appeals\nthat sound management of our court system requires that the Appellate\n\nDivisions, through their presiding justices, have a significant consultative\nrole in management decisions which affect the trial courts in each of the\ndiverse areas of our State. This participation of the Appellate Divisions in\ncourt administration is consistent with our judicial tradition and is important\nto the intelligent and effective exercise of the Chief Administrator's\nconstitutional functions and responsibilities. Paramount, however, is the constitutional\nmandate for a unified administration of the courts, within the framework of\nwhich the consultative role of the Appellate Divisions may appropriately\nfunction. The Chief Administrator should also consult with the trial judges, the bar, and the public, either directly or through deputies, local\nadministrative judges, and advisory committees. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22§\n1.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
