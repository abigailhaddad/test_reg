  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 9003.29 - Unlawful Distribution of Products and Materials\n\nState Regulations\n\nNo person shall engage in the non-commercial distribution of\nproducts and/or material (other than printed or similarly expressive material)\nwithout a permit issued by ParksCorp or BPCA. A permit shall be issued only\nupon ParksCorp's or BPCA's determination that said distribution will be\nconducted in a manner consistent with the public's use and enjoyment of the\npark or park facility in question. In making this determination, ParksCorp or\nBPCA will consider the nature of the product or material; whether the product\nor material is compatible with customary park uses; whether the product or\nmaterial is intended to be used in the park or park facility; the age of the\ntargeted audience for the product or material; and whether the area in the park\nor park facility where the distribution will take place is appropriate for such\ndistribution, considering, e.g., its proximity to areas designed for children, quiet zones or other areas designed for activities not compatible with such\ndistribution. In connection with the foregoing, ParksCorp may consult with\nparental or other groups that are involved with the park or park facility where\na permit for distribution is requested. ParksCorp or BPCA may also impose\nconditions upon the distribution of products and materials consistent with the\nconcerns reflected by the factors listed above. Products and/or materials may\nbe distributed only upon an indication of interest by the recipient, and only\nfrom a fixed location specified in the permit. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n9003.29\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register July 8, 2015/Volume XXXVII, Issue 27, eff. 7/8/2015\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
