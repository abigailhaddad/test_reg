  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 505.16 - Submission of local programs\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Local governments may regulate erosion\nhazard areas within their jurisdictions by adopting a local program that has\nbeen certified by the commissioner as meeting the minimum standards of section\n505.17\nof this Part. Pursuant to\nsection 34-0105 of the act, cities, towns (outside the area of any incorporated\nvillage) and villages have the first opportunity to adopt a local program after\nthe coastal erosion hazard area maps for their jurisdiction have been filed\nwith their city, town or village clerk. If a city, town (outside the area of\nany incorporated village), or village does not submit a local program to the\ncommissioner for certification, or the commissioner does not certify a local\nprogram within the time limits specified in section 34-0105(1) or (3) of the\nact, the county containing such city, town or village may submit a local\nprogram to the commissioner. If a county's local program is certified by the\ncommissioner as meeting the minimum standards of section\n505.17\nof this Part within the time\nlimits specified in section 34-0106(1) or (3) of the act, such county has the\nresponsibility and authority to regulate erosion hazard areas within all\ncities, towns (outside the area of any incorporated village) and villages\nwithin the county which have failed to submit a local program or have failed to\nget certification of a proposed local program within the time limits of section\n34-0105(1) and (3) of the act. Sections 34-0105 and 34-0106 of the act\nestablish the procedural steps local governments must follow in assuming local\njurisdiction over erosion hazard areas. (b) Submission of a local program to the\ncommissioner for certification must be on a form provided by the department and\nmust include: (1)\na certified copy of the\nerosion management local law or ordinance and all other local laws, ordinances, zoning regulations, subdivision and site plan approval regulations, or any\nother applications of police power that are elements of the local\nprogram; (2)\na map or other\nidentification of the erosion hazard area subject to regulation; (3)\nidentification of the person(s) who will\nadminister the program and their address, telephone number, current title, educational background, relevant work experience, location of employment, and\ntheir relationship to the local government (e.g., paid or volunteer, full-time\nor part-time, permanent or temporary); (4)\ndescription of the local government's\nadministrative capacity to administer its local program including a\nstep-by-step discussion of how a local permit application will be processed. Such discussion must describe, in chronological order, what individual or\noffice receives a local permit application and what individual or office\nmaintains records after the activity for which the permit is issued is\ncompleted, and each step between. The function of each step should be\ndescribed; (5)\nan identification of\nwhat person or office will have the responsibility for enforcement; and\n(6)\na resolution that the local\ngovernment will enforce the purposes and policies of the act and the minimum\nstandards of section\n505.17\nof this Part; that it will\nconduct compliance inspections to assure that the terms and conditions of local\npermits are adhered to; that it will investigate all reports of violations; that it will prosecute violations of its local program and terms and conditions\nof local permits; and that the local program was subject to public notice and\nreview as required by the local government. (c) When a local government submits a local\nprogram to the commissioner for certification, and such local program was\nimplemented prior to the filing of the applicable coastal erosion hazard area\nmaps, such submission need only include the information required by paragraphs\n(b)(1) and (2) of this section. If the commissioner determines that the local\nprogram needs substantial revision to meet the minimum standards of section\n505.17\nof this Part, subsequent\nsubmissions must meet all informational requirements of subdivision (b) of this\nsection. (d) An application for\ncertification of a local program is not complete until all information\nnecessary for its proper evaluation is received. (e) The commissioner must either certify or\ndisapprove the proposed local program within 30 working days of receipt of a\ncomplete application. If the commissioner disapproves a local program, he will\nnotify the local government in writing of the reasons for disapproval and the\nmodification that is necessary for certification. The commissioner will issue\nfindings as part of his decision to either certify or disapprove a proposed\nlocal program. (f) In an instance\nwhere the commissioner disapproves a proposed local program he may, at his\ndiscretion, extend the initial six-month period local governments have to adopt\na local program. Such extension will be a reasonable time period to make the\nmodification that is necessary for approval but may not exceed six months. During such extended time period a local government may adopt and resubmit a\nnew or modified local program to the commissioner for approval. In resubmitting\na modified local program, a local government need only resubmit information\nthat is additional to, or changed from, the initial submission. Such\nresubmission of a new or modified local program is subject to the same\ninformational requirements as specified in this section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
