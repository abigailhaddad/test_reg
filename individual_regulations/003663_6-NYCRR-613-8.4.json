(i) A\nlocal government tank system owner or operator may satisfy the requirements of\nsection 8.3 of this Subpart by establishing a dedicated fund account that meets\nthe requirements of this section. Except as specified in clause\n(\nb\n) of this subparagraph, a dedicated fund may not be\ncommingled with other funds or otherwise used in normal operations. A dedicated\nfund will be considered eligible if it meets one of the following requirements: (a) the fund is dedicated by state\nconstitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or\norder to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties\nfor bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising\nfrom the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks and is funded for the\nfull amount of coverage required under section 8.3 of this Subpart, or funded\nfor part of the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other\nmechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage; or\n(b) the fund is dedicated by state\nconstitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance, or\norder as a contingency fund for general emergencies, including taking\ncorrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property\ndamage caused by accidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum\nunderground storage tanks, and is funded for five times the full amount of\ncoverage required under section 8.3 of this Subpart, or funded for part of the\nrequired amount of coverage and used in combination with other mechanism(s)\nthat provide the remaining coverage (if the fund is funded for less than five\ntimes the amount of coverage required under section 8.3 of this Subpart, the\namount of financial responsibility demonstrated by the fund may not exceed\none-fifth the amount in the fund); or\n(c) the fund is dedicated by state\nconstitutional provision, or local government statute, charter, ordinance or\norder to pay for taking corrective action and for compensating third parties\nfor bodily injury and property damage caused by accidental releases arising\nfrom the operation of petroleum underground storage tanks, and the local\ngovernment tank system owner or operator has either available bonding authority\nin accordance with subclause (\n1\n), or a letter signed by the\nappropriate state attorney general in accordance with subclause\n(\n2\n). (1)\n\nAvailable bonding\nauthority is approved through voter referendum (if such approval is necessary\nprior to the issuance of bonds) for an amount equal to the difference between\nthe required amount of coverage and the amount held in the dedicated fund. This\nbonding authority must be available for taking corrective action and for\ncompensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by\naccidental releases arising from the operation of petroleum underground storage\ntanks. (2)\nA letter signed by the\nappropriate state attorney general states that the use of the bonding authority\nwill not increase the local government's debt beyond the legal debt ceilings\nestablished by the relevant state laws. The letter must also state that prior\nvoter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding authority. (3)\nA payment is made to the fund once every\nyear for seven years until the fund is fully-funded. This seven-year period is\nhereafter referred to as the \"pay-in-period.\" The amount of each payment must\nbe determined by this formula: (TF - CF) / Y\nwhere TF is the total required financial assurance for\nthe tank system owner or operator, CF is the current amount in the fund, and Y\nis the number of years remaining in the pay-in-period. (ii)\n\nTo demonstrate\nthat it meets the requirements of the local government fund, the chief\nfinancial officer of the local government tank system owner or operator and/or\nguarantor must sign a letter worded exactly as follows, except that the\ninstructions in brackets must be replaced with the relevant information and the\nbrackets deleted: Letter from Chief Financial\n\nOfficer\nI am the chief financial officer of [insert: name\nand address of local government tank system owner or operator, or guarantor]. This letter is in support of the use of the local government fund mechanism to\ndemonstrate financial responsibility for [insert: \"taking\ncorrective\naction\" and/or \"compensating third parties for\nbodily injury and property damage\"] caused by [insert: \"sudden accidental\nreleases\" or \"non-sudden accidental releases\" or \"accidental releases\"] in the\namount of at least [insert: dollar amount] per occurrence and [insert: dollar\namount] annual aggregate arising from operating (an) underground storage\ntank(s). Underground storage tanks at the following\nfacilities are assured by this local government fund mechanism: [List for each\nfacility: The name and address of the facility where tanks are assured by the\nlocal government fund]. [Insert: \"The local government fund is funded for\nthe full amount of coverage required under 6 NYCRR\n613-8.3, or funded for part\nof the required amount of coverage and used in combination with other\nmechanism(s) that provide the remaining coverage.\" or \"The local government\nfund is funded for five times the full amount of coverage required under 6\nNYCRR\n613-8.3, or funded for part of the required amount of coverage and used\nin combination with other mechanisms(s) that provide the remaining coverage,\"\nor \"A payment is made to the fund once every year for seven years until the\nfund is fully-funded and [name of local government tank system owner or\noperator] has available bonding authority, approved through voter referendum, of an amount equal to the difference between the required amount of coverage\nand the amount held in the dedicated fund\" or \"A payment is made to the fund\nonce every year for seven years until the fund is fully-funded and I have\nattached a letter signed by the State Attorney General stating that (1) the use\nof the bonding authority will not increase the local government's debt beyond\nthe legal debt ceilings established by the relevant state laws and (2) that\nprior voter approval is not necessary before use of the bonding\nauthority\"]. The details of the local government fund are as\nfollows: Amount in Fund (market value of fund at close of\nlast fiscal year): [If fund balance is incrementally funded as\nspecified in 6 NYCRR\n613-8.4\n(d)(11)(i)(c), insert: Amount added to fund in the most recently\ncompleted fiscal year: Number of years remaining in the\npay-in-period:]\nA copy of the state constitutional provision, or\nlocal government statute, charter, ordinance or order dedicating the fund is\nattached. I hereby certify that the wording of this letter\nis identical to the wording specified in 6 NYCRR\n613-8.4\n(d)(11)(i)(b) as such\nregulations were constituted on the date shown immediately\nbelow.

(ii)\n\nTermination of insurance or risk retention coverage, except for nonpayment or\nmisrepresentation by the insured, or state-funded assurance may not occur until\n60 days after the date on which the tank system owner or operator receives the\nnotice of termination, as evidenced by the return receipt. Termination for\nnon-payment of premium or misrepresentation by the insured may not occur until\na minimum of ten days after the date on which the tank system owner or operator\nreceives the notice of termination, as evidenced by the return\nreceipt. (2)\n\nIf a\nprovider of financial responsibility cancels or fails to renew for reasons\nother than incapacity of the provider as specified in subdivision 8.7(c) of\nthis Subpart, the tank system owner or operator must obtain alternate coverage\nas specified in this section within 60 days after receipt of the notice of\ntermination. If the tank system owner or operator fails to obtain alternate\ncoverage within 60 days after receipt of the notice of termination, the tank\nsystem owner or operator must notify the Commissioner of the Department of such\nfailure and submit: (i) the name and address\nof the provider of financial assurance; (ii)\nthe effective date of termination; and\n(iii)\nthe evidence of the\nfinancial assistance mechanism subject to the termination maintained in\naccordance with 8.6(b).
