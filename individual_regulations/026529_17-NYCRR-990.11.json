  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 990.11 - Investigation of accidents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Procedures. Public transportation system and public transportation service\naccident investigations are conducted by the Safety Board in order to determine\nthe facts, conditions, and circumstances relating to each accident, the\nprobable cause thereof, and to ascertain measures which will best prevent\nsimilar accidents in the future. The investigations, carried out in accordance\nwith procedures developed by the Safety Board, include field investigation, report preparation, and where ordered, a public hearing. The staff of the\n\nSafety Board are authorized to enter upon any property where a public\ntransportation accident has occurred, where wreckage from any such accident is\nlocated or where a vehicle involved in any such accident is located, and do all\nthings necessary for a proper accident investigation, including but not limited\nto interviewing of witnesses and others, examination and/or testing of any\nvehicle train or facility or any part or appurtenance thereof, which vehicle, train, facility or part or appurtenance thereof shall immediately be made\navailable for inspection and shall be preserved by the public transportation\nsystem and/or public transportation service, to the maximum extent feasible, for the purpose of an accident investigation, which accident investigation\nshall be commenced and completed with reasonable promptness. The Safety Board\nmay order a vehicle or any part or appurtenance thereof impounded for a period\nwhich shall not exceed two business days from the time of notification so that\na proper investigation including testing may be conducted. The Safety Board\nstaff may inspect all records, files, papers, processes, controls, equipment\nand facilities of a public transportation system and/or public transportation\nservice and other relevant factors in connection with the investigation of any\naccident involving such system or service. (b) Cooperation. Each public transportation\nsystem or service by its officers, directors, owners, members and employees, shall fully cooperate with the Safety Board in the investigation of public\ntransportation accidents. Such cooperation shall include, but shall not be\nlimited to, making the public transportation system's or service's employees\navailable for the purpose of interviews and providing investigators with all\ninformation requested, including the names of witnesses and all details of the\naccident. The failure to cooperate with the investigation as stated herein\nshall be deemed a violation of these rules and regulations and may be treated\nas grounds for the withholding of statewide mass transportation operating\nassistance.
