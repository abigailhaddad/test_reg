  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 154.3 - Change of resident status during year-general rules for filing New York State fiduciary returns for trust\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 654(g)\n(a) If the status of a trust changes during\nits taxable year from resident to nonresident, or from nonresident to resident\n(see subdivision [b] of this section), the fiduciary of such trust must file\none New York State fiduciary return as a resident trust for the portion of the\nyear during which the trust is a resident trust, and one New York State\nfiduciary return as a nonresident trust for the portion of the year during\nwhich the trust is a nonresident trust. Furthermore, in determining the New\n\nYork taxable income, the New York personal service taxable income and the New\n\nYork State minimum taxable income of such trust for the respective periods of\nresidence and nonresidence, the provisions of sections\n154.5\nthrough 154.14 of this Part must be taken into account (if applicable), except\nto the extent that the provisions of such sections may be inconsistent with the\nprovisions of section\n618\nor section\n638\nof the Tax Law. (b) (1)\n\nFor\npurposes of this section, a change of residence of a revocable\ninter\nvivos\ntrust or portion thereof will be deemed to have occurred if: (i) a revocable\ninter vivos\ntrust (consisting of property of a person or persons whose property constitutes\nsuch trust or portion thereof) becomes irrevocable; and\n(ii)\nprior to the time such trust becomes\nirrevocable, the domicile of the person or persons whose property constitutes\nthe trust or portion thereof is different from the domicile of such person or\npersons at the time the property was transferred to the trust. (2)\n\nThe date on which the change\nof residence will be deemed to have occurred is the date on which the revocable\ninter vivos\ntrust becomes irrevocable\ninter\nvivos, provided that all the conditions prescribed in paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision have been satisfied. (3)\n\nIf the property of more than one grantor\nconstitutes the trust and only one of the grantors satisfies the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the respective portions of the property\ntransferred to the trust by each such grantor must be treated as if separate\ntrusts had been created by each such grantor. Accordingly, the portion of the\ntrust which changed its resident status during the taxable year would be\nrequired to file one New York State fiduciary return as a resident trust for\nits period of New York State residence and another New York State fiduciary\nreturn as a nonresident trust for its period of nonresidence. However, the\nportion of the trust which did not change its resident status must file a New\n\nYork State fiduciary return for the entire taxable year as either a resident\ntrust or a nonresident trust, as the case may be. (4)\nA trust which is created as an\nirrevocable trust or as a testamentary trust may not change its resident\nstatus. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
