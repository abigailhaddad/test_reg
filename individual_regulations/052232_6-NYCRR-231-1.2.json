  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-1.2 - Applicability\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The provisions\nof this Subpart are applicable to all air contamination source projects which\nmeet the following conditions: (1)\nthe\ncomplete application for a permit to construct the air contamination source\nproject is submitted after August 9, 1984 and is determined complete by the\ndepartment in accordance with Part 621 of this Title before November 15, 1992; (2)\nthe facility at which the\nair contamination source project is proposed is located in an area designated\nas a nonattainment area when the application for the project is determined\ncomplete for the same air contaminant that the proposed air contamination\nsource project would emit (for ozone nonattainment areas, this applies to\nprojects that emit volatile organic compounds); and\n(3)\nthe annual actual emissions from the air\ncontamination source project proposed at an existing major facility exceed the\nde minimis emission limits shown in section\n231-1.9\nof this Subpart; or\n(4)\nthe facility at which the\nair contamination source project is proposed is not a major facility, but the\nannual actual emissions from the proposed air contamination source project\nequal or exceed 100 tons per year of either particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, or volatile organic compounds. (b) The provisions of this Subpart\nare applicable to all air contamination source projects with annual actual\nemissions exceeding the de minimis emission limit for lead shown in section\n231-1.9\nof this Subpart, proposed\nat major lead facilities if the complete application for a permit to construct\nthe air contamination source project is submitted after August 9, 1984 and the\nmajor lead facility is located in an area designated as nonattainment with\nambient air quality standards for lead. (c) Emission reductions at the same facility\nas the proposed air contamination source project may be considered to calculate\nthe net increase in emissions which must exceed the de minimis emission limit\nfor the project to be subject to this Subpart. Determination of the net\nemissions increase is subject to the following: (1)\n\nTo be considered, emission reductions\nmust be of the same contaminant(s) to be emitted by the proposed air\ncontamination source project. (2)\n\nTo be considered, emission reductions must have occurred within five years\nprior to the date of submittal of a complete application for a permit to\nconstruct the air contamination source project. (3)\n\nAn emission reduction which is considered\nin a net emission increase determination cannot be used again either to negate\nsubsequent emission increases or as an emission offset, and must not have been\nused for demonstrating attainment with ambient air quality standards or\nreasonable further progress in a federally approved implementation\nplan. (4)\n\nAn emission reduction\nmust have approximately the same qualitative significance for public health and\nwelfare as that attributed to the air contaminant whose emissions are\nincreased. (5)\n\nOnly potential\nemission increases and actual emission decreases are to be included in a net\nemissions increase determination. (6)\n\nThe net emissions increase calculated by\nconsidering actual emission reductions as well as proposed increases must also\ninclude past increases, as of five years prior to the date of submittal of a\ncomplete application for a permit to construct the air contamination source\nproject, which did not exceed the de minimis emission limits when they were\nproposed. (7)\n\nAny emission\nreductions used in a net emissions increase determination will be described in\nthe conditions of approval on the permit to construct. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-1.2\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
