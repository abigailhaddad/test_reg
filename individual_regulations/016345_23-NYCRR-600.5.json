  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 23 § 600.5 - General formatting requirements and contents\n\nState Regulations\n\nDisclosures provided in accordance with the CFDL shall comply\nwith the requirements of this section. (a) At the top of the disclosure, centered on\nthe page or other display medium, the provider shall print \"OFFER SUMMARY\" in\nbold font, followed by a one-to-five-word description of the type of product\noffered (e.g. \"Merchant Cash Advance\"), which may include the financer's\nbranding terminology. (b) For any\ndisclosure required to comply with Section\n600.18\n(a) of this\n\nPart, at the bottom of the disclosure, below any other information required by\nthe CFDL, the provider shall print the following statement: \"Applicable law\nrequires this information to be provided to you to help you make an informed\ndecision. By signing below, you are confirming that you received this\ninformation.\" Below the statement, the provider shall include a space for the\nrecipient to sign the form labeled \"Recipient Signature\" and a space for the\nrecipient to write the date of the recipient's signature, labeled \"Date.\" In\nthe case of electronically transmitted disclosures, such statement may be\nplaced below the attachment or link to the disclosures and shall direct the\nrecipient to the space for signature. A recipient may sign the disclosure with\na physical signature or a digital signature. A digital signature may be affixed\nby the recipient by any means that is compliant with the New York Electronic\n\nSignatures and Records Act, State Technology Law sections 103-109 (\"ESRA\"), including an \"Accept\" button or checking a digital box acknowledging agreement, provided the financer provides to the recipient the date stamp and receipt\nrequired by sub-section\n600.5\n(j) herein. For any disclosure not required to comply with Section\n600.18\n(a) of this\n\nPart, at the bottom of the disclosure, below any other information required by\nthis Part, the provider shall print the following statement: \"Applicable law\nrequires this information to be provided to you to help you make an informed\ndecision.\"\n(c) If the term or\nestimated term of a transaction is: (1)\none\nyear or less, the term or estimated term shall be disclosed in days, starting\nwith the day after the transaction is consummated and including the day of the\nfinal payment; or\n(2)\ngreater than\none year, the term or estimated term shall be disclosed in units of years and\nmonths, with any remaining days expressed as a portion of a month to the\nnearest two decimal points. (d) The annual percentage rate shall be\nexpressed to the nearest two decimal points. For example: \"10.45%.\"\n(e) The disclosures shall be presented to the\nrecipient as a separate document from any other contract, agreement, or other\ndisclosure document provided to the recipient, but may be mailed or transmitted\nin a package that contains other documents. In the case of electronically\ntransmitted disclosures, a \"separate document\" may appear in the same\nattachment or link, but shall be separated by page breaks from other\ndocuments. (f) Fonts. (1)\n\nThe provider may present the required\ndisclosure in fonts and colors that are clear, complete, conspicuous, easy to\ncompare with other disclosures, and consistent with the requirements of this\n\nPart. (2)\nA provider shall use\nfonts for the disclosures substantially similar in size to: (i) Times New Roman 12-point to 14-point\nfont, for information appearing in the first and second columns where those\ncolumns are not combined with other columns; (ii)\n\nTimes New Roman 10-point to 12-point\nfont, for information appearing in the third column, information appearing in\ncells where the second and third columns are combined, and information\nappearing in cells where the first, second, and third columns are combined; and\n(iii)\n\nTimes New Roman 16-point\nfont for the content required by subdivision (a) of this section. (3)\n\nNotwithstanding subdivision\n(g)(2) of this section, a provider may use a font substantially similar in size\nto Times New Roman 16-point font for \"OFFER SUMMARY FOR\" and content appearing\nin the first and second columns of the disclosure where those columns are not\ncombined with other columns. (4)\nA\nprovider may deviate from the font requirements described in paragraphs (2) and\n(3) of subdivision (g) of this section if the provider makes a good faith\ndetermination that deviating from the standards is necessary (i) to comply with\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §\n12101\net\nseq. ), or (ii) for clarity based upon the medium (e.g. mobile device)\nin which the disclosure will be presented. (g) A provider shall ensure that the width of\nthe columns in the required disclosure is such that the disclosure does not\nunnecessarily extend onto multiple pages. A provider that formats the columns\nin the required disclosure such that the ratio between the first, second and\nthird columns is 3:3:7 complies with the requirements of this\nsection. (h) Where a provider is\nrequired or permitted to provide a short explanation under this section, the\nprovider shall provide an explanation of not more than 60 words. (i) Each of the cells in the required\ndisclosures shall be outlined. (j) If disclosures are provided to a recipient electronically, then to comply with\n\nSection\n600.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart the provider shall include a method for the recipient to submit an\nelectronic signature that complies with ERSA, receive an automatic date stamp\nupon submission of such signature, and obtain a copy of the signed disclosure\nin a format that the recipient may save indefinitely for future reference. A\nformat that the recipient may save indefinitely includes hard copy disclosures, and electronic documents containing the required disclosures that the customer\ncan save indefinitely for future reference. (k) Except with respect to sales-based\nfinancing, if a provider must make estimates or assumptions to provide any\ndisclosure required by this section, then the provider shall: (1)\nbase those estimates or assumptions on\nthe best information reasonably available to the provider at the time of the\ndisclosure; (2)\nstate clearly that\nany disclosure based upon an estimate or assumption is an \"estimate\" by adding\nthe word \"estimate\" to the descriptive language of any required disclosure\nunder this section; and\n(3)\nstate\nclearly any assumptions or estimates used as the basis for the disclosure in\nany explanation or description associated with the disclosure (even if such\nstatement of assumptions or estimates requires the addition of an additional\nrow in the applicable table prescribed by this Part). (l) When making the disclosures required by\nthis section, for transactions where the applicable interest rate adjusts over\ntime and the interest rate applicable for the entire term of the transaction\ncannot be calculated in advance, the provider shall assume that the applicable\ninterest rate is the initial interest rate for any period of time when the\ninterest rate cannot be calculated in advance. (m) Numerical values, including but not\nlimited to percentages, dates, and dollar amounts, shall be expressed\nnumerically, (e.g., 23), and not alphabetically, (e.g., twenty-three). (n) If a provider\nissues a disclosure where the amount financed includes funds used to pay down\nor pay off other amounts owed by the recipient that may change over time, and\nthe amount due in connection with those amounts owed changes prior to\nconsummation of the agreement between the financer and the recipient, the\nprovider need not provide a new disclosure to the recipient solely because the\namount due in connection with those amounts owed has changed. (o) A provider may disregard the effects of\nthe following in making calculations and disclosures: (1)\nthat payments must be collected in whole\ncents; (2)\nthat dates of scheduled\npayments and advances may be changed because the scheduled date is not a\nbusiness day; (3)\nthat months have\ndifferent numbers of days; and\n(4)\nthe occurrence of leap years. (p) Notwithstanding subdivision (o)(1) of\nthis section, any dollar amount disclosed to a recipient shall not be disclosed\nusing fractions of a cent (e.g. \"$4.025\" or \"$4.02 and 1/2 cents.\")\n\nNotes\nN.Y.
