Tit. 9 §§ 1725-5.3 - Applicant files\n\nState Regulations\n\nApplicant files, whether active or inactive, should be\nmaintained as close as possible to the tenant files. The active files will\nconsist of those applications determined to be eligible or still being\ninvestigated and should be maintained in chronological order with earliest date\non top. Active files should be reviewed periodically to determine which\napplications should be shifted to the inactive files.
