  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 218-5.3 - Compliance testing and inspection-new vehicle selection, evaluation, and compliance action\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The department\nmay, with respect to any new vehicle engine family, test group or subgroup\nbeing sold, offered for sale, or manufactured for sale in New York, require a\nvehicle manufacturer to make available for compliance testing and/or inspection\na reasonable number of vehicles, and may direct that the vehicles be delivered\nto a specific location. Vehicles must be selected at random from sources\nspecified by the department, which insofar as practical must exclude: (1)\nvehicles manufactured pursuant to a\nspecific requirement of an ultimate purchaser; and\n(2)\nvehicles, the selection of which, if not\nexcluded, would result in an unreasonable disruption of the manufacturer's\ndistribution system. A subgroup may be selected for compliance testing only if\nthe department has reason to believe that the emissions characteristics of that\nsubgroup are substantially in excess of the emissions of the engine family as a\nwhole. (b) Selection and\ntesting of vehicles and the evaluation of data must be made in accordance with\nthe California Code of Regulations, title 13, section\n2101\n(see Table 1, section\n200.9\nof this\n\nTitle). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n218-5.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
