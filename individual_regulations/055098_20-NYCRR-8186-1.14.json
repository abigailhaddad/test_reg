Tit. 20 §§ 8186-1.14 - Valuation procedures, generally\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each market value base survey conducted\npursuant to this Part requires the appraisal of individual parcels of real\nproperty located in assessing units that have not completed timely\nreassessments that can be used to measure municipal full value. The procedures\nused in ascertaining the values of these parcels are set forth by ORPTS prior\nto the use of that market value survey in the establishment of tentative State\nequalization rates. (b) The\nvaluation of sample parcels for base surveys is performed as follows: (1)\n\nFor each parcel in the residential, farm, and vacant land categories: (i) cost approach\nestimates for improvements; (ii)\na\nmarket approach estimate obtained from use of statistical models and adjusted\ncomparable sales, in compliance with recognized appraisal standards; and\n(iii)\nwith respect to large\ncommercial farm operations, the income approach, when suitable data are\navailable and the entire farm operation is to be appraised. (2)\n\nFor each parcel in the\ncommercial category: (i) cost approach\nestimates for improvements, if data available; (ii)\na market approach estimate obtained from\nper-unit multipliers based on sales of similar properties, if data available; and\n(iii)\nan income approach\nestimate when suitable data are available. (3)\n\nFor each parcel in the industrial and\nutility categories: (i) for general purpose\nproperties, where information is available, cost, market and income approach\nestimates; and\n(ii)\nfor special\npurpose or single purpose properties, estimates of value from the cost\napproach. (4)\n\nFor each\nparcel, initial valuation reports for use in review and determination of\nappraised value. (5)\nA procedure\nfor review and determination of estimated values or refinement of estimated\nvalues of residential, farm, vacant and commercial parcels, which shall\ninclude: (i) an onsite inspection of each\nparcel when possible, except where not required by virtue of the type or class\nof property (such as vacant land) or the method of valuation employed (such as\nincome capitalization); (ii)\nenumeration of all major inventory items and correction of any data items found\nto be in error; (iii)\nreview of\ncomparable sales used to estimate an initial value for parcels in the\nresidential, farm and vacant land categories and the addition of sales which\nare more comparable and deletion of those which are less comparable; and\n(iv)\nreview of cost, market and\nincome approach estimates of initial values for parcels in the commercial\ncategory. (6)\n\nParcels of\nforest property shall be appraised in a market value survey by adding a\nstumpage value for the parcel to the value of the parcel without regard to\nstanding timber (bare land value).
