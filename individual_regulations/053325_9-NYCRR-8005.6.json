  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 8005.6 - Scheduling of the Preliminary Revocation Hearing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\npreliminary revocation hearing shall be scheduled to take place according to\nthe rules provided in this section, and other sections of this Part and Part\n8004 of this Title as may be relevant to reasonably ensure substantial\ncompliance with the Executive Law. Generally: (1)\n\nWhere the case may be designated as a\ntechnical violation case in which no reincarceration is possible: (i) If the releasee appears as directed in\nresponse to a notice of violation, the preliminary hearing is to be scheduled\nto occur within 10 days of issuance of the notice. (ii)\n\nIf the releasee does not appear as\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of section\n8004.6\nof this Title, no\npreliminary hearing is to be held as the violations shall be deemed\nsustained. (2)\n\nWhere the\ncase may be designated as a technical violation case in which reincarceration\nis possible: (i) If the releasee appears as\ndirected in response to a notice of violation, the preliminary hearing is to be\nscheduled to occur within 10 days of issuance of the notice. (ii)\n\nIf the releasee does not appear as\ndescribed in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of section\n8004.7\nof this Title and a parole\nwarrant was issued, then upon completion of a recognizance hearing and an order\nfrom the court therefrom: (a) If the releasee\nwas ordered released by the court, the preliminary hearing is to be scheduled\nto occur within 10 days of the issuance of such order, or\n(b) If the releasee was ordered by the court\nto be detained pending completion of their revocation case, the preliminary\nhearing is to be scheduled to occur within 5 days of the issuance of such\norder. (iii)\n\nNothing\nwithin this paragraph shall be construed as prohibiting the conduct of a\npreliminary hearing in absentia. (3)\n\nWhere the case may be designated as a\nnon-technical violation case: (i) If the\n\nDepartment proceeded by notice of violation and there is no parole warrant, the\nprovisions of paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall apply. (ii)\n\nIf a parole warrant was issued and\nexecuted, then upon completion of a recognizance hearing and an order from the\ncourt therefrom, (a) If the releasee was\nordered released by the court, the preliminary hearing is to be scheduled to\noccur within 10 days of the issuance of such order, or\n(b) If the releasee was ordered by the court\nto be detained pending completion of their revocation case, the preliminary\nhearing is to be scheduled to occur within 5 days of the issuance of such\norder. (4)\n\nShould release on recognizance be ordered pursuant to the Executive Law but a\ncourt thereafter again consider the releasee's detention prior to the\npreliminary hearing taking place, the preliminary hearing may be scheduled or\nrescheduled to occur within 5 days of the court's conclusion upon such new\nconsideration if the releasee is ordered detained, or within 10 days of the\ncourt's conclusion if the releasee is again ordered released. Nothing within\nthis subdivision shall be interpreted to require a rescheduling of the\npreliminary hearing, or to require the scheduling of a new preliminary hearing\nwhere a preliminary hearing had commenced or been completed. (5)\n\nThe scheduling or conduct of a\npreliminary hearing for a releasee who has absconded from supervision and\nremains in such status or who is otherwise not within the convenience and\npractical control of the Department is not required during such\nperiod. (6)\n\nIssuance of the notice\nof violation within the meaning of this subdivision occurs when the releasee\nhas been served with such notice and: (i) has\nappeared as directed in response to a notice of violation; or\n(ii)\nhas appeared in response to a notice of\nviolation within no later than forty-eight hours of the directed time, but\notherwise as directed. Issuance of the notice of violation may, however, be\ndeemed by the Department or Board to have occurred prior to the date and time\nfor which the releasee had been directed to appear in response to the notice of\nviolation, in the event the preliminary hearing has been scheduled to occur\nupon such date. (b) Location of the hearing. (1)\n\nFor any case in which no parole warrant\nhas been issued or in which the releasee was ordered released on recognizance\npursuant to the Executive Law, the preliminary hearing shall be scheduled and\nheld in a courthouse, in cooperation with the chief administrator of the courts\nand the chief administrator's designees, provided, however, that if such a\ncourthouse is not reasonably available for such hearing, the Department may\ndesignate a suitable office or other similar facility that is not a\ncorrectional facility, detention center or local correctional facility for such\nhearing. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the preliminary hearing may, in the\n\nDepartment's discretion and as appropriate, be scheduled and held in a\nresidential treatment facility, or a nursing, medical or mental health\nfacility, as the case may be, where it is reasonably likely that the releasee\nwill remain in custody or residence therein irrespective of the issuance of a\nparole warrant or the decision on recognizance pursuant to the Executive Law. Subsequent changes in a releasee's custodial or residential status shall permit\nthe Department reasonable extension of time for scheduling or rescheduling at\nanother appropriate location. (c) The right to a preliminary hearing may be\nwaived. The waiver of a preliminary hearing may be made either in writing on\nforms provided, or orally on the record at any appearance in response to a\nnotice of violation, the recognizance hearing or the preliminary\nhearing. (d) An adjournment may be\ngranted at the preliminary hearing for the releasee to obtain counsel or for\ngood cause shown. An attorney who represents the releasee may only obtain an\nadjournment for good cause prior to the scheduled date of a preliminary hearing\nby contacting the hearing coordinator. (e) There shall be good cause to extend the\ntime in which the preliminary hearing is scheduled to occur where reasonably\nnecessary to allow for its conduct at the appropriate location and\nfacility.
