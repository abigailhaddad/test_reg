The ALJ has discretion to determine and\nadjust the order of events and presentation of evidence, and to establish\nprocedures to promote the conduct of a fair and efficient hearing. In general, the order of events at a hearing shall be as follows: (1)\n\nFormal opening.

The ALJ shall call\nthe name of each person who has been granted status as a party. (3)\n\nOpening statements. Prior to the\ncommencement of the adjudicatory sessions, each party may, at its option, offer\na brief opening statement of position on the application. (4)\n\nAdmission of evidence. The applicant\nshall present its direct case first and shall start by identifying all\ndocuments which constitute the application, any supplements to the application, and all supporting documents which are relevant to the issues to be\nadjudicated. A panel of witnesses may be used for presenting testimony or for\ncross-examination at the ALJ's discretion. Cross-examination shall be conducted\nby parties in a sequence to be established by the ALJ, which normally will be\nthe sequence in which the parties will present their direct cases. The evidence\nshall be confined to that which is relevant to issues identified in the ALJ's\nwritten issues determination. (5)\n\nClose of record. Closing statements of position will be dealt with in the same\nmanner as opening statements. At the concluding session of the hearing, the ALJ\nshall determine whether to allow the submission of written post-hearing briefs.

(6)\n\nWhere the ALJ permits the filing of\nbriefs, the ALJ shall also determine page limits for said briefs and whether\nreplies will be permitted and the schedule for filing. Simultaneous filing\nshall normally be required. A party shall give specific reference to the\nportions of the record, whether transcript or otherwise, relied upon in support\nof the respective statements of fact made throughout the brief. Briefs shall be\nconsidered only as argument and shall not refer to or contain any evidentiary\nmaterial outside of the administrative record. (b) The ALJ. (1)\n\nIn proceedings pursuant to this Part, the\nALJ has power to: (i) Rule upon all motions\nand requests, including those that decide the ultimate merits of the\ncase; (ii)\n\nSet the time and place\nof the hearing, recesses and adjournments; (iii)\n\nAdminister oaths and\naffirmations; (iv)\n\nIssue subpoenas\nupon request of a party not represented by counsel admitted to practice in New\n\nYork State.

(2)\n\nImpartiality of the ALJ and motions for recusal. (i) The ALJ shall conduct the proceeding in a\nfair and impartial manner. (ii)\n\nAn\nALJ shall not be assigned to any proceeding in which the ALJ has a personal\ninterest. (iii)\n\nAny party may file\nwith the ALJ a motion in conformance with section 1100-8.5(c) of this Part, together with supporting affidavits, requesting that the ALJ be recused on the\nbasis of personal bias or other good cause.

All\npersons appearing before the ALJ shall conform to the standards of conduct\nrequired of attorneys appearing before the courts of the State of New York. Any\nperson signing any papers submitted in or entering an appearance in any\nproceeding shall be considered to have agreed to conform to those standards. A\nfailure to conform to those standards shall be grounds for exclusion from that\nand any later proceeding. Nothing in this paragraph authorizes a non-lawyer to\nengage in the practice of law.

The\nparties shall file one original and three copies of any papers filed pursuant\nto this paragraph. (2)\n\nDuring the course of the proceeding, in conformance with section 1100-8.5(e) of\nthis Part, the following rulings may be appealed to the Executive Director on\nan expedited basis: (i) Any ruling in which\nthe ALJ has denied a motion for recusal; and\n(ii)\n\nAny other ruling of the ALJ that does\nnot finally resolve all issues in the proceeding, by seeking permission to file\nan expedited appeal upon a demonstration that the failure to decide such an\nappeal would be unduly prejudicial to one of the parties or would result in\nsignificant inefficiency in the hearing process. In all such cases, the\n\nExecutive Director's determination to entertain the appeal on an expedited\nbasis is discretionary. (3)\nA motion for permission to file an\nexpedited appeal shall demonstrate that the ruling in question falls within the\ncriteria set forth in subparagraph (2)(ii) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe Executive Director may review any\nruling of the ALJ on an expedited basis upon the Executive Director's\ndetermination or upon a determination by the ALJ that the ruling should be\nappealed. (5)\n\nWhenever the\n\nExecutive Director grants permission to file an expedited appeal, the parties\nshall be notified. The appellant shall be provided the opportunity to file a\nbrief on appeal and the other parties shall be provided with the opportunity to\nfile a response to the appeal. (6)\n\nFailure to file an expedited appeal or the denial of permission to file an\nexpedited appeal shall not preclude an appeal from the ruling to the Executive\n\nDirector after the hearing. (7)\n\nThe\nhearing shall not be adjourned while an appeal or motion for permission to\nappeal is pending except by permission of the ALJ or the Executive\n\nDirector. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
