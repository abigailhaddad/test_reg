  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.26 - Pick-six pools\n\nState Regulations\n(a) A\nwinning pick-six wager requires selection of the first-place finisher in each\nof six designated, consecutive contests, unless otherwise provided in this\nsection. The association or corporation must obtain written approval from the\ncommission concerning the scheduling of pick-six contests, the designation of\nthe method used and the amount of any cap to be set on the carryover. Any\nchanges to the approved pick-six format require prior approval from the\ncommission. (b) The pick-six wager\nis not a parlay and has no connection or relation to the other betting pools\nfor the respective races. The pick-six pool shall be held entirely separate\nfrom all other pools and is no part of a daily double, exacta, quinella, trifecta, superfecta or other wagering pool. (c) Resale of pick-six tickets from one\nindividual to another is prohibited, shall be grounds for ejection, and may be\ndeemed illegal gambling. (d) Races\nin which pick-six pools shall be conducted shall be clearly designated in the\nprogram and racing cards issued by the association or corporation. (e) The design of the pick-six tickets shall\nbe clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (f) Scratched\nhorses and nonstarters. Should a programmed starter be scratched or\ndeclared a nonstarter in any pick-six race before the start of the first\npick-six race, affected bettors may select another betting interest, if a wager\ncan be canceled and a replacement wager issued before the start of the first\npick-six race, or may obtain a cancellation of the wager issued before the\nstart of the first race of the pick-six sequence. If neither option is\nexercised, then wagers upon such scratched or declared nonstarter shall be\ndeemed wagers upon the designated horse for such race. The\ndesignated\nhorse\nmeans the betting entry or field upon which the most wagering\nmoney has been registered at the track in the win pool at the close of win-pool\nbetting for such race. (In the event of a money tie, the tied betting entry or\nfield with the lowest program number shall be designated.) At any time after\nwagering begins on the pick-six pool, should an entire betting entry or field\nbe scratched or declared a nonstarter in any pick-six race, no further tickets\nselecting such betting entry or field shall be issued, and wagers upon such\nbetting entry or field, for purposes of the pick-six pool, shall be deemed\nwagers upon the designated horse. Wagers in the pick-six pool upon an entry or\nfield of horses from which a starter or starters may have been scratched will, in the case of such entry or field, be deemed wagers upon the horse or horses\nremaining in such entry or field, except at tracks with totalisator capability\nto record wagers selecting a coupled entry (or field) and wagers selecting any\nindividual constituent horses therein (merging such wagers for odds display and\npayoff purposes), in which case, the wagers upon scratched constituent horses\nwill be deemed wagers upon the designated horse in such race. In case no\nstarter remains representing any betting entry or field, wagers upon such entry\nor field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse in the race affected\nby the scratch. Should the balance of a betting entry or field race as a\nnonbetting starter for purposes of other pari-mutuel pools, as provided in\nsections\n4009.20\nand\n4009.21\nof this Article, wagers\nupon such entry or field shall be deemed wagers upon the designated horse for\nsuch race. (g) Wagering\n\nTickets and Winners. If neither subdivision (h) nor subdivision (i) of\nthis section applies: (1)\n\nThe pick-six pool\nshall be apportioned as follows: 75 percent of the resulting pick-six net pool\nfor the day shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of wagers\nselecting the winners of all six designated races in the pool, or to the\nholders of the wagers selecting the winners of the designated races with no\nmore than three all-win races, and no other races are cancelled in the pick-six\nsequence or races, and 25 percent of such net pool shall be distributed to the\nholders of the wagers selecting the most winners. (2)\n\nShould there be no wager selecting\nwinners of all six designated races, or to the holders of wagers selecting the\nwinners of the designated races with no more than three \"all win\" events, then\n25 percent of the net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of\nwagers selecting the winners of the most pick-six races, and the 75 percent of\nthe net pool reserved for holders of wagers selecting six winners, or to the\nholders of wagers selecting the winners of the designated races with no more\nthan three all-win races, then 25 percent of the net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of wagers selecting the winners of the most\npick-six races, and the 75 percent of the net pool reserved for holders of\nwagers selecting six winners, or to the holders of wagers selecting the winners\nof the designated races with no more than three all win races shall be carried\nover and added to and distributed with the 75-percent net pool share of the\nnext pick-six pool in which a wager correctly selects the winners of all six\ndesignated pick-six races, or five winners and no more than one all-win race. 75-percent-net-pool share and any carry-overs distributable when a wager\ncorrectly selects winners of all six designated races, or five winners and no\nmore than one all-win race of a pick-six pool, there shall be distributed by\nthe track operator from its own funds, upon such occurrence, any amounts it has\nadvertised that it will add to the total distribution, or any amounts necessary\nto yield an advertised guaranteed total distribution. (h) Race cancellations. Except for pick-six pools in which an intermediate or final distribution is to\nbe made, should one or more pick-six races be cancelled or declared no race or\nnon-betting, no carry-overs from prior pick-six pools, advertised guaranteed\namounts nor advertised added amounts will be distributed to winners in such\nday's pick-six pool; and\n(1)\nif more than\nthree such races are contested, 75 percent of that program's net pool shall be\ndistributed, less breaks, to holders of wagers upon the winners of all the\ncontested pick-six races and 25 percent of such program's net pool shall be\ndistributed to the holders of wagers selecting the next most winners; should no\nwager select the winners of all the contested pick-six races, 25 percent of the\nnet pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of wagers selecting\nthe most winners of the contested pick-six races and 75 percent of such\nprogram's net pool shall be carried over as elsewhere provided in this\nsection; (2)\nif three or fewer such\nraces are contested, then the entire pool for such program shall be refunded; and\n(3)\nif any of the designated\nraces are canceled or declared no race or non-betting before the first pick-six\nrace is made official, then the pick-six pool shall be declared off and the\ngross pool refunded. (i) Surface transfers. When the condition of a turf course\nwarrants a change of racing surface to a non-turf course in any of the pick-six\nraces, and such change has not been known to the public before the close of\nwagering for the pick-six pool, then such changed race shall be deemed an all\nwin race for pick-six wagering purposes. An\nall win race\nmeans\nthe winning horse of that race is assigned to each pick-six bettor as such\nbettor's selection for that race. Except for pick-six pools in which an\nintermediate or final distribution is to be made, a pick-six sequence with\nsurface transfer(s) shall be handled as follows: (1)\n\nIf there is one surface transfer race in\nthe pick-six sequence of designated races combined with the winners of the five\nother designated races, 75 percent of such program's net pool, less breaks, and\nany carryovers, advertised guaranteed amounts or advertised added amounts, shall be distributed to the holders of such wagers, and 25 percent of such\nprogram's net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of wagers\nselecting the next most winners; should no wager include the winners of all\nfive non-surface transfer races in the pick-six sequence, 25 percent of such\nnet pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the holders of wagers selecting\nthe most winners of the non-surface transfer races in the pick-six sequence, and 75 percent of such program's net pool shall be carried over as elsewhere\nprovided in this section for subsequent distribution. (2)\n\nIf there are two or three surface\ntransfer races in the pick-six sequence, no carryovers from prior pick-six\npools, advertised guaranteed amount or advertised added amounts will be\ndistributed to winners in such day's pick-six pool, and 75 percent of such\nprogram's net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to holders of wagers\nselecting the winners of all non-surface transfer races in the pick-six\nsequence, and 25 percent of such program's net pool shall be distributed, less\nbreaks, to holders of wagers selecting the next most winners; should no wager\ninclude the winners of all the non-surface-transfer races in the pick-six\nsequence, 25 percent of such net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to the\nholders of wagers selecting the most winners of the non-surface-transfer races\nin the pick-six sequence, and 75 percent of such program's net pool shall be\ncarried over as elsewhere provided in this section for subsequent\ndistribution. (3)\n\nIf there are more\nthan three surface transfer races in the pick-six sequence, no carry-overs from\nprior pick-six pools, advertised guaranteed amounts or advertised added amounts\nwill be distributed to winners in such day's pick-six pool, and 25-percent of\nthat program's net pool shall be distributed, less breaks, to holders of wagers\nselecting the winners of the most non-surface-transfer races in the pick-six\nsequence, and 75 percent of such program's net pool shall be carried over as\nelsewhere provided in this section for subsequent distribution. (4)\n\nIf there are one or more surface transfer\nraces in the pick-six sequence, and there are no wagers selecting the winner(s)\nof at least one of the non-surface transfer races, the entire pool for such\nprogram shall be refunded; in the event there is a final distribution or\nintermediate distribution scheduled, and no further programs are conducted at\nthe meeting, the commission shall require that a pick-six pool be conducted on\nthe first program of the next race meeting conducted at such track by such\ntrack operator to provide for final distribution for such prior meeting. The\ncommission may also order a final distribution for an earlier time in the\ncommission's discretion. (j) Dead heats. Each horse\nin a dead heat for win shall be considered the winner, and no allocations among\nwagers shall be made as a result thereof, unlike the practice in a pari-mutuel\nwin pool. The payoff price per dollar shall be the same for each class of\nwinning wager. (k) Carryovers. Carryovers from prior pick-six pools, advertised\nguaranteed amounts or advertised added amounts will be distributed to winners\nin such day's pick-six pools, provided that there is no more than one all win\nrace and no other races are cancelled in the pick-six sequence. (l) Intermediate\ndistributions. Prior to the last two weeks of a race meeting at a\ntrack, a date and program approved by the commission may be announced by the\ntrack operator at which (provided no one thereafter correctly selects the\nwinners of all six designated races, or five winners and no more than one\nall-win race of a pick-six pool through such program) accumulated carryovers in\nan amount announced by the track operator will be added to the 25 percent of\nthe net pool distributable to wagers selecting the winners of the most races of\nthe pick-six pool conducted on such program if no one correctly selects all six\nwinners, or five winners and no more than one all-win. The balance of\nundistributed carry-overs above such announced amount, plus any carry-over from\nsuch program, shall in turn carry over for distribution with subsequent\npick-six pools conducted by such track operator at such track. An intermediate\ndistribution may also be directed at any time, upon three days' notice by the\ncommission, of such portion or all of the accumulated carry-over money as may\nbe directed by the commission. (m) Final distribution. The track shall select, with the approval\nof the commission, a date and program during the final week of the annual\nassigned racing dates of the track operator, and also during the year during\nthe final week of a meeting at a track after which such track operator will\noperate at another track, when there shall be a final distribution of all\naccumulated carry-overs together with 75 percent of the net pool of the\npick-six pool conducted during such program to the holders of wagers selecting\nthe winners of the most pick-six races contested during such program, and 25\npercent of such net pool shall be distributed to the holders of the remaining\nwagers selecting the next most winners, except that, if only one, two or three\nsuch races are conducted, then all accumulated carry-overs and the entire net\npool shall be distributed to the holders of wagers selecting the most winners\nof such races. Thereafter, no pick-six pools will be conducted during such\nweek. In the event that all pick-six races on the program designated for final\ndistribution are cancelled, or the pick-six pool is refunded, and no further\nprograms are conducted at the meeting, the commission shall require that a\npick-six pool be conducted on the first program of the next race meeting\nconducted at such track by such track operator to provide for final\ndistribution for such prior meeting. The commission may also order a final\ndistribution for an earlier time in the commission's discretion. (n) The association or corporation may\nsuspend previously approved pick-six wagering with the prior approval of the\ncommission. Any carryover shall be held until the-suspended pick-six wagering\nis reinstated. An association or corporation may request approval of a pick-six\nwager or separate wagering pool for specific performances. (o) Reserved. (p) In the event of occurrences not\nencompassed within the explicit provisions of this section, distribution shall\nbe formulated on the basis of established pari-mutuel practice and in\naccordance with the distribution philosophy set forth in this section; provided, nevertheless, that if full distribution of the pool is made on the\nbasis of outstanding tickets, then the method of formulation announced by the\ntrack and the basis upon which payments have been made shall be deemed\nconclusively correct and not subject to review. (q) Posting of winning\ncombinations. Every pick-six wagering combination entitled to a payoff\nshall be posted publicly by the track operator together with the payoff\nprice. (r) Non-transferability. Pick-six tickets shall be\nnontransferable, and violations of this subdivision may lead to confiscation\nand cancellation of such tickets in addition to other disciplinary\naction. (s) Betting\ninformation. A racing association may display publicly information in\nregard to combinations wagered upon, amounts wagered on such combinations, numbers of tickets sold or number of tickets still capable of winning a\npick-six pool. The operation of the totalisator equipment and reports generated\nthereby shall be subject to the strict supervision of the commission. (t) No reduction in guaranteed\ndistributions. Advertised added monies or minimum distributions shall\nnot apply to intermediate or final distributions, unless a wager correctly\nselects winners of all six designated races, or five winners and no more than\none all-win of the pick-six pool. A guaranteed minimum distribution or\nguaranteed added money amount, once advertised, may not be reduced and shall\ncontinue to be guaranteed by the track operator for every pick-six pool for the\nbalance of the meeting. (u) Interfacing of off-track wagers. Interfacing of off-track\nwagers shall be accomplished according to procedures approved by the\ncommission. In the event there is a failure to interface all such wagers with\non-track wagers in accordance with such procedures, the procedure for\ndistribution of the pool and computation of payoff prices shall be approved by\nthe commission. (v) Trust\nfunds. Carry-over monies shall be held in a separate account in trust\nby track operators for the benefit of participants in pick-six pools until\ndistributed. (w) Seed money\nor insurance allocation. Except where the established takeout is\nhigher than the prevailing takeout established for non-carryover days, a\npercentage designated by the track operator and approved by the commission, not\nexceeding two percent of the total daily pick-six pool wagering, shall be held\napart by the track operator from the takeout of each pick-six pool to reimburse\nsuch track operator for the cost of any insurance it may secure to guarantee\nminimum distributions to winners of such pools, or to reimburse a track\noperator for funds such track operator expends for added money or guaranteed\nminimum distributions to winners of such pools. Any accumulation of such\nallocations not necessary to reimburse a track for expenditures actually\nincurred for such purposes shall be added to the amounts distributable in the\npool designated for final distribution for the meeting. (x) Copies of this section shall be made\navailable free of charge by the track to the public in the public betting area\nof the track. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
