Tit. 9 § 4032.4 - Extension of weight allowance\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe commission may extend the weight allowance of an\napprentice jockey when, in the discretion of the commission an apprentice\njockey is unable to continue riding due to: (a) physical disablement or\nillness; (b) military\nservice; (c) attendance in an\ninstitution of secondary or higher education; (d) restriction on racing; or\n(e) other valid reasons. In order to qualify for an extension, an apprentice\njockey shall have been rendered unable to ride for a period of not less than\nseven consecutive days during the period in which the apprentice was entitled\nto an apprentice weight allowance. Under exceptional circumstances, total days\nlost collectively will be given consideration. The commission currently\nlicensing the apprentice jockey shall have the authority to grant an extension\nto an eligible applicant, but only after the apprentice has produced\ndocumentation verifying time lost as defined by this regulation. An apprentice\nmay petition one of the jurisdictions in which he or she is licensed and riding\nfor an extension of the time for claiming apprentice weight allowances, and the\napprentice shall be bound by the decision of the jurisdiction so\npetitioned.
