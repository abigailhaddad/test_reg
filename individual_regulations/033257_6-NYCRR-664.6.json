Tit. 6\n§\n664.6\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register December 31, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 53, eff. 1/1/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. This section describes characteristics and their associated benefits used in classifying\nwetlands\nin section\n664.5\nof this Part. (a) Cover types. The different\nwetland\ncover types described in this subdivision provide\nwetland\nbenefits to varying degrees. In order for a\nwetland\nto be considered to be of a given cover type and classified accordingly, that cover type should constitute at least 50 percent of the area of the\nwetland. However, if no single cover type constitutes 50 percent or more of the\nwetland\narea, this aspect of the\nwetland\n's\nclassification\nshall be determined by adding up the areas of all the separate cover types in each class and then assigning the\nwetland\nto the class that represents the largest proportion of the\nwetland\n's area. As listed in section\n664.5\nof this Part, the only class II cover type is emergent marsh in which purple loosestrife and/or reed (phragmites) constitutes less than two thirds of the cover type; class III cover types are emergent marsh in which purple loosestrife and/or reed (phragmites) constitutes two thirds or more of the cover type, deciduous swamp, shrub swamp, floating and/or submergent vegetation, and\nwetland\nopen water; and class IV cover types are wet meadow and coniferous swamp. The evaluations of cover types in this subdivision are distinct from the evaluations of structural groups provided in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. (1)\n\nWet meadow. This consists of such plants as sedges, rushes, coarse grasses, and sometimes cattails. The soil is usually saturated with water for a significant part of the growing season. Vegetation tends to grow in clumps or tussocks. Cattails, if present, tend to grow between the clumps. In agricultural areas, wet meadow is usually a cleared but uncultivated parcel; often it is pastured. If the land is pastured, the clumps are more pronounced due to trampling by livestock. Wet meadow may occur within or at the edges of a hayfield and may be mowed, depending upon the degree of wetness. Old beaver meadows and floodplains may contain wet meadow vegetation. Standing water is often present during wet periods. Wet meadow, when associated with other\nwetland\ncover types, is valuable for wildlife, especially for nesting\nwetland\nbirds. When associated with certain other\nwetland\ncover types or with open water, wet meadow may be valuable for fish spawning. When not associated with other\nwetland\ncover types, however, wet meadow is likely to be of relatively low value. (2)\n\nEmergent marsh. This consists of such plants as cattails, purple loosestrife, swamp loosestrife, arrowheads, reeds, bur reeds, pickerelweed, wild rice, water plantain, bulrushes and arrow arum. These are herbaceous plants encroaching on water areas and flooded with standing water much of the year. Emergent marsh is generally the most valuable individual cover type. The emergent vegetation itself provides nesting habitat, food and cover. Frequently, emergent vegetation produces the largest\nannual\nincrease in natural organic materials of any cover type, providing nonpolluting nutrients to food chains. An emergent marsh is usually different in physical structure from surrounding areas and therefore provides habitat diversity. An exception to the high value assigned to emergent marsh may occur where purple loosestrife or reed (phragmites) is dominant, in that it constitutes two thirds or more of the cover type. In this case, a\nwetland\nshall be a class III\nwetland. (3)\n\nDeciduous swamp. This consists of live deciduous trees over 4.5 meters (approximately 15 feet) in height. If not totally flooded, the terrain is hummocky. The trees include, but are not limited to, American elm, red maple, silver maple, red ash, black ash, swamp white oak, and willows. Deciduous swamps will generally be flooded or saturated during the spring and early summer but are likely to appear dry toward the end of summer and in the fall. Deciduous swamp is relatively valuable because it is frequently used by nesting waterfowl and is also heavily used by songbirds and other wildlife. (4)\n\nConiferous swamp. This consists of live coniferous trees over 4.5 meters (approximately 15 feet) in height. Some of the coniferous trees most commonly found in\nwetlands\nare black spruce, white cedar, red spruce, balsam fir and American larch. Flooded conifers usually grow in hummocky terrain. The trees tend to grow out of the drier hummocks with pockets of water forming between the hummocks. The value of coniferous swamp for wildlife is considered to be relatively low, although coniferous swamp can provide important winter cover for deer and habitat for varying hare. (5)\n\nShrub swamp. This cover type is found in a variety of areas including floodplains; frost pockets; edges of ponds, lakes and bogs; and in association with hillside seeps. Woody vegetation is classified as shrub swamp if it is 4.5 meters (approximately 15 feet) or less in height. Species include: alders, willows, leather-leaf, bog rosemary, sweet gale, buttonbush, highbush cranberry, and red osier dogwood. Also, sphagnum moss in bog mats usually occurs in association with shrub species. The value of shrub swamp for fish and wildlife is variable, but shrub swamp can provide some of the values of emergent marsh or deciduous swamp: it is likely to have a structure different from surrounding areas and may supply significant nesting and other wildlife uses. (6)\n\nFloating and submergent vegetation. Floating\nwetland\nvegetation may be free-floating, such as duckweed and watermeal, or rooted with floating leaves, such as water lily, water shield and spatterdock. Submergent plants, such as pondweeds, naiads, coontail, water milfoil, wild celery, muskgrass, stonewort, water smartweed, and bladderworts, normally grow beneath the surface of the water. These cover types can be important food sources for waterfowl and frequently are valuable areas for fish spawning and nurseries. (7)\n\nWetland\nopen water, including open water with dead trees and open water that occasionally exposes unvegetated mud flats. Unvegetated open water is part of a\nwetland\nas a\nwetland\ncover type if it is substantially enclosed by\nwetland\nvegetation and is no larger than 2.5 hectares (approximately 6.2 acres). If the body of open water that is substantially enclosed by\nwetland\nvegetation is larger than 2.5 hectares (approximately 6.2 acres), then only that portion of the open water that is within 50 meters (approximately 165 feet) of the\nwetland\nvegetation is considered to constitute a\nwetland\ncover type and to be part of a\nwetland. When in close conjunction with\nwetland\nvegetation, open water can be of considerable value as fish and wildlife habitat. (b) Ecological associations. A variety of significant ecological associations may occur in\nwetlands. Wetlands\nhaving an association of substantially different kinds of physical or vegetative structures have special ecological value, especially for wildlife and fish. Association with particular non-\nwetland\nfeatures may be important in defining\nwetland\nbenefits. In addition, the visual diversity provided serves a valuable aesthetic function. The nature and significance of these associations are set forth in this subdivision. (1)\n\nTwo or more structural groups. Three groups of\nwetland\nvegetative structures can be identified. In order to be significant enough to be considered a factor in classifying a\nwetland\naccording to this class II characteristic, each structural group must constitute at least a particular minimum percentage of the area of the\nwetland. (i) The herbaceous structural group consists of the cover types made up of herbaceous vegetation which emerges above the surface of the water or soil. These emergent marsh and/or wet meadow cover types must constitute at least 25 percent of the area of the\nwetland. (ii)\n\nThe woody structural group consists of cover types of generally woody vegetation. These deciduous swamp, coniferous swamp, and/or shrub swamp cover types must constitute at least 25 percent of the area of the\nwetland. (iii)\n\nThe water structural group consists of cover types in which the surface of the water is apparent. These submergent and floating vegetation and/or\nwetland\nopen water cover types, including open water with dead trees and open water that occasionally exposes unvegetated mud flats, must constitute at least 15 percent of the area of the\nwetland. For example, a\nwetland\nwhich is 80 percent shrub swamp (woody structural group) and 20 percent submergent and floating vegetation (water structural group) has this class II characteristic. A\nwetland\nwhich is 45 percent deciduous swamp (woody structural group), 35 percent coniferous swamp (also woody structural group), and 20 percent wet meadow (herbaceous structural group) does not have this class II characteristic because, although the woody structural group constitutes well over its minimum 25 percent of the\nwetland, the herbaceous structural group constitutes less than its minimum 25 percent of the\nwetland. The physical structure of each of these three groups is substantially different from the structure of each of the other two. The presence of this characteristic increases the value of a\nwetland\nas fish and wildlife habitat because each of the different groups can support species not found in the others, thus increasing the variety of species on the\nwetland\nas a whole. In addition, those species which need two different structural groups to meet all of their requirements can only exist when both groups are present. The presence of different groups together also provides visual variety, thus enhancing aesthetic benefits. (2)\n\nClassic kettlehole bog. Classic kettlehole bogs are\nwetlands\nwhich are at least 75 meters (approximately 246 feet) in diameter within a closed drainage basin, having a minimal or no surface inlet or outlet. These bogs have complete or virtually complete concentric zones of differing vegetative cover types. The innermost zone of the bog is open water that is of pH 5.00 or lower and is typically anoxyous and dark brown. Surrounding this is a floating mat of sphagnum mosses, liverwort, and shrubby heath plants; this mat is surrounded in turn by coniferous swamp above deep deposits primarily of partly decayed sphagnum mosses. Wetlands\nof this type are very rare, as are many of the life forms within them, and therefore they contribute to the ecological, geological and aesthetic diversity of the\n\nState. This in turn provides educational and scientific research benefits. (3)\n\nWetlands\ncontiguous to tidal\nwetlands. These are\nfreshwater wetlands\nwhich abut the landward boundary of tidal\nwetlands\nshown on the tidal\nwetlands\ninventory maps promulgated pursuant to section\n25-0201\nof the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law. Freshwater wetlands\ncontiguous to tidal\nwetlands\ncan provide unusual fish and wildlife habitat benefits. The perpetuation of\nfreshwater wetlands\nassociated with tidal\nwetlands\nis likely to be essential to the protection of the tidal\nwetlands. These\nfreshwater wetlands\ncan purify water flowing into tidal\nwetlands\nand also can\nact\nwith tidal\nwetlands\nto protect adjacent property against storm tides. (4)\n\nAssociated with permanent open water outside the\nwetland. A\nwetland\nmay include open water, as described in subdivision\n664.6\n(a)(7). However, to be considered under this characteristic, a\nwetland\nmust be associated with permanent open water which exists outside of the\nwetland. This association must be one of close proximity, with water flow between the\nwetland\nand the open water at some time during the year. The\nwetland\nmust be contiguous to the open water or, if it is separated, the separation must be only a narrow strip of land, such as a barrier beach or a railroad bed. Wetlands\nassociated with open water have many special values. Some wildlife and fish usually found in open water must spend part of their life cycle in\nwetlands\nfor reproduction, food and cover. The\nwetlands\nare also vital in providing natural nutrients to open water ecosystems. They may cleanse water entering the open water body and thus protect the quality of the open water. The associated open water often provides recreational and educational opportunities dependent upon these\nwetland\nfunctions. (5)\n\nAdjacent or contiguous to streams classified C(t) or higher under article 15 of the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law. Wetlands\nmay be critical to protecting the quality of these streams. They may remove sediment and other pollutants, stabilize water flow, and help to maintain water temperatures required by desirable fish species. (6)\n\nIsland present within\nwetland. Islands provide nesting habitat and refuge for wildlife. They provide visual variety and interest and can be the focus of recreational and educational activities. (c) Special features. Wetlands\nmay contain particularly critical or fragile resources that require special protection. They may also contain other special features which enhance their benefits. Since some of these features are described in relation to major regions of the\n\nState, a definition of those major regions is provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision. (1)\n\nThe major regions of the\n\nState\nare shown on the\nmap\nin Appendix 8-D. More detailed delineations of the major regions shown on that\nmap\nare available in the regional offices of the\ndepartment. Where a\nwetland\nis near a major region border, the\nwetland\n's region shall be considered to extend into the adjacent region(s) to a distance of 15 kilometers (approximately 9 miles) from the\nwetland. However, this\nmodification\nof regional borders does not apply to the borders of the metropolitan region. The major regions are: (i) Coastal plain (Long Island, outside of the New York portion of the New York-Northeastern New Jersey urbanized area, as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census--see also paragraph [e][1] of this section); (ii)\n\nMetropolitan (the New York portion of the New York - Northeastern New Jersey urbanized area); (iii)\n\nHudson-Mohawk (in the Hudson Valley, north of the metropolitan region, from the eastern border of the\n\nState\nto the Appalachian highlands; in the Mohawk Valley, from the Appalachian highlands to the Adirondacks);. (iv)\n\nLake plain (a narrow strip bordering Lake Erie; south of Lake Ontario to the Appalachian highlands; east of Lake Ontario to the Adirondacks; north of the Adirondacks to the St. Lawrence River or to the Canadian border; a narrow strip bordering Lake Champlain); (v) Adirondack (within the Adirondack forest park and bordered by the lake plain and Hudson Mohawk regions); (vi)\n\nAppalachian highland (from the Pennsylvania and New Jersey borders to the lake plain and the Hudson-Mohawk valleys). (2)\n\nWetlands\ncontaining resident animal habitat. This means habitat of year-round resident animal species, or habitat of migratory species during their breeding or wintering periods. (3)\n\nWetlands\ncontaining traditional migration habitat of an animal species. This is a habitat used by a species in moving from breeding to wintering habitat in the late summer and fall, and from wintering to breeding habitat in the late winter and spring. Such use must be on a recurring basis so that there are grounds to believe that it will continue annually. This characteristic does not apply to the occasional occurrence of a stray or wandering individual animal during the migration period. (4)\n\nEndangered or threatened species. This is a species or subspecies (or botanical \"variety\", where \"variety\" is used as the equivalent of the zoological \"subspecies\") of plant or animal (vertebrate or invertebrate) which, for the purposes of this Part, shall be considered to be of statewide significance because it has been identified as endangered or threatened by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or in\nregulations, such as Part 182\nof this Title, promulgated by the\ndepartment\npursuant to section\n11-0535\nof the\n\nEnvironmental Conservation Law, in the case of animals, or in additions to this Part after public\nhearing, in the case of plants. (5)\n\nVulnerable species. This is a species or subspecies (or botanical \"variety\", where \"variety\" is used as the equivalent of the zoological \"subspecies\") of plant or animal (vertebrate or invertebrate): (i) for which extirpation from the\n\nState\nor a major region of the\n\nState\nis likely, but the species as a whole is not in jeopardy; (ii)\nthat is in such small numbers throughout the\n\nState\nor a major region of the\n\nState\nthat it could be extirpated if recent trends degrading or diminishing its habitat continue; or\n(iii)\nwhose range is restricted in the\n\nState\nor a major region of the\n\nState\nand it or its habitat has a low tolerance for disturbance. Vulnerable species shall be identified by the\ndepartment\nin additions to this Part after public\nhearing. (6)\n\nWetlands\nhaving animal species in unusual abundance or diversity (statewide or regional). Certain\nwetlands\nare unusual ecosystems because they are sites of large heronries or other colonial nesting; are regularly and intensively used by raptors, waterfowl or other migrating birds; are in major deer winter concentration areas; support valuable and intensive fish spawning; are extremely productive in breeding ducks, geese, shore birds, wading birds, and/or furbearers; or otherwise contain an unusually high abundance or diversity of wildlife or fish. In order to be considered under this characteristic, the abundance and/or diversity must be actual, not merely potential or predicted; with the expectation, based on the\ndepartment\n's knowledge of existing conditions and fish and wildlife behavior, that the abundance and/or diversity is not merely a one-year or transitory phenomenon. However, this characteristic does not apply to domestic or invertebrate species or to disease-bearing or other noxious species such as the Norway rat. (7)\n\nWetlands\nhaving animal species in unusual abundance or diversity (county). The same values described under paragraph (6) of this subdivision apply here, except that they are lower because the basis for assessing abundance or diversity is countywide rather than regional or statewide. (8)\n\nWetlands\nhaving demonstrable archaeological or paleontological signifi-cance as\nwetlands. Some existing\nwetlands\nwere important sites of native American activities such as food-gathering, or supported concentrations of life forms now long extinct, and the natural conditions in\nwetlands\nenabled the\nevidence\nof these functions to be preserved. Such areas now are valuable resources for education and scientific research examining the importance of\nwetlands\nto human and animal life over time. Damage to such\nwetlands\ncould significantly diminish those resources. (9)\n\nWetlands\nhaving geological significance. Some\nwetlands\nare associated with unusual geological features which are excellent representations of their type. Examples of such features might be lakeshore barrier beaches, sand dunes, eskers, or pine barrens. Where\nwetlands\ncontain, are part of, owe their existence to, or are ecologically associated with, such a feature, they comprise integral parts of unusual ecological communities. Damage to such\nwetlands\nmay therefore result in the loss of unusual species of fish, wildlife or vegetation and is likely to significantly diminish the\n\nState\n's or a major region's ecological, educational or aesthetic resources or diminish the variety of the\n\nState\n's or a major region's landforms. (10)\n\nWetlands\nhaving a total alkalinity of at least 50 parts per million. A relatively high total alkalinity has value for wildlife and fish for at least two reasons. It is a measure of the capacity of\nwetlands\nto avoid acidic conditions and as such deters the accumulation of substances harmful to the growth of vegetation that provides good wildlife habitat. Total alkalinity is also a general indication of the natural fertility of the substrate underlying the\nwetland. Generally, a more naturally fertile substrate will support better habitat. (11)\n\nWetlands\nadjacent to fertile upland. This characteristic is identified by soil tests or by soils maps. Upland soils in the immediate vicinity of a\nwetland\nare an indication of the fertility of the\nwetland\nsubstrate. In general, those soils described by the United States Soil Conservation Service as \"high base soils\" (pH 5.6 or higher) will be considered fertile for the purposes of this Part. The value of fertile soils is similar to the values described in paragraph (10) of this subdivision: generally, a more naturally fertile substrate will support better habitat for fish and wildlife. (d) Hydrological and\npollution\ncontrol features. Some\nwetlands\nprovide significant hydrological and\npollution\ncontrol benefits. The major features of\nwetlands\nproviding those benefits are set forth in this subdivision. (1)\n\nWetlands\nmay provide a drainage basin with a natural stormwater retention\nfacility. This flood\nstorage\nfunction may slow the downstream movement of the flood crest and lower its peak elevation. The flood control benefits of a\nwetland\ngenerally increase with its size relative to the size of the drainage area tributary to the flood-endangered locale. The loss of a significant area of\nwetland\nwithin a drainage basin may therefore aggravate flooding, erosion, and sedimentation in the immediate downstream area. (2)\n\nThe protection of\nwetlands\nadjacent or contiguous to reservoirs or to other bodies of water used primarily for public water supply may be essential to preserving that supply. Disturbance or loss of these\nwetlands\ncan lower water quality and cause health problems to the water users. (3)\n\nSome\nwetlands\nthat are part of a surface water system with permanent open water receive pollutants. By slowing runoff, adding water to the pollutants, and spreading water shallowly over a large area, these\nwetlands\nmay remove sediment, oxidize or precipitate pollutants, and dilute\nwastewater, thus cleansing water in the surface water system. In some cases, such\nwetlands\nprovide tertiary\ntreatment\nin relation to sewage\ndisposal\nsystems. However, these beneficial characteristics are considered for\nclassification\nonly if the\npollution\nis generally of a kind amenable to assimilation or amelioration by\nwetlands. (4)\n\nSome\nwetlands\nare underlain by deposits of pervious earth materials which serve to hydraulically connect them to aquifer systems so that some of the water from such\nwetlands\npercolates into the aquifers and recharges them. For infiltration of water from a\nwetland\nto be of an amount significant enough to provide a ground-water supply source, and therefore to be either a class I or II characteristic, the pervious earth materials underlying the\nwetland\nmust be more than three meters (approximately 10 feet) thick. Some of the more important aquifers in the\n\nState\nhave already been identified by various agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey, the\n\nDepartment\nof Environmental Conservation, the\n\nState\n\nDepartment\nof Health and various county and regional\nplanning\nagencies. Preservation of groundwater recharge areas is critical to the protection of the aquifers and the water supply. Recharge to groundwater systems generally takes place during times of the year when little foliage (which discharges water via transpiration) is present. At these times, as well as other times, wetlands\ncan recharge aquifers if the soils at their bottoms are so pervious as to allow infiltration. For example. although the soil types underlying\nwetlands\nare usually peat, muck, marl or clay, none of which is very pervious, wetland\noverflow lands in floodplains may be underlain by sandy or gravelly alluvial soils. These\nwetlands, even if not very large, can serve to restore significant amounts of water to aquifers, thereby allowing wells to continue yielding water. (e) Distribution and\nlocation. The distribution and\nlocation\nof\nwetlands\nare important considerations in determining the benefits of particular\nwetlands\nas open space and for recreational, aesthetic and educational purposes. Nothing in this Part or in the\nact, however, requires a landowner to open land to public access for such purposes. (1)\n\nWithin urbanized areas. \"Urbanized areas\" are defined by the United States Bureau of the Census, and consist of a central city, or cities, and surrounding suburban areas. According to that definition, the central city must have a population of 50,000 or more, and surrounding closely settled areas are included if these are: (i) incorporated places of 2,500 inhabitants or more; (ii)\nincorporated places with fewer than 2,500 persons, provided that each has a closely settled area of 100 housing units or more; (iii)\nsmall land parcels normally less than one square mile in area having a population density of 1,000 inhabitants or more per square mile; or\n(iv)\nother similar small areas in unincorporated territory with lower population density when these areas serve to complete urban-suburban community boundaries. For the purposes of this Part, the urbanized areas of the\n\nState\nare listed by the United States Bureau of the Census as follows: New York -Northeastern New Jersey (the New York\n\nState\nportion), Buffalo, Albany-Schenectady-Troy, Binghamton, Rochester, Syracuse, and Utica-Rome. In addition, incorporated cities not covered by the United States Bureau of the Census definition are included for the purposes of this Part, but only the city proper and not surrounding areas. These are: Amsterdam, Auburn, Batavia, Beacon, Canandaigua, Corning, Cortland, Dunkirk, Elmira, Fulton, Geneva, Glens Falls, Gloversville, Hornell, Hudson, Ithaca, Jamestown, Johnstown, Kingston, Little Falls, Lockport, Mechanicville, Middletown, Newburgh, Norwich, Ogdensburg, Olean, Oneida, Oneonta, Oswego, Plattsburgh, Port Jervis, Poughkeepsie, Salamanca, Saratoga Springs and Watertown. Because of their rarity, their distinctiveness from urban surroundings, and their proximity to large numbers of people, wetlands\nin urbanized areas can provide unusually important natural, recreational, educational, scientific, open space and aesthetic benefits. (2)\n\nVisible from an interstate highway, a parkway, a designated scenic highway or a passenger railroad, and serves a valuable aesthetic or open space function. The following criteria will be considered in determining the applicability of this characteristic: the visibility of the\nwetland\nor of the wildlife on the\nwetland, the size of the\nwetland, and the topography and the variety of vegetative types in and surrounding the\nwetland. As a guideline, the\nwetland\nshould be within one-half kilometer (approximately one-third mile) from the transportation corridor, although the criteria may justify a reduction or increase in this distance. For many people who commute on high use transportation corridors, the open space, visual variety, and wildlife-viewing opportunities provided by\nwetlands\nare aesthetically important benefits. (3)\n\nOne of the three largest\nwetlands\nwithin a city, town, or New York City borough; one of the three largest\nwetlands\nof the same cover type within a town; in a town in which\nwetland\nacreage is less than one percent of the total acreage. The rarer\nwetlands\nare, and the rarer any one cover type is in a locality, the more valuable are the recreational and educational opportunities and open space and aesthetic benefits provided by the\nwetlands\nor cover types which remain. In addition, the retention of a base of\nwetlands\nand\nwetland\ncover types in a locality can help to perpetuate fish and wildlife diversity in that locality. The size of a\nwetland\ncan also be significant because many species have substantial threshold space requirements and are unable to make use of smaller areas. In addition, disturbance of\nwetland\nwildlife by activities outside the\nwetland\nor\nadjacent area\ncan be buffered to some degree in larger\nwetlands. (4)\n\nWithin a publicly owned recreation area. These\nwetlands\nprovide many recreational and educational opportunities. (5)\n\nOn publicly owned land that is open to the public. Many of the recreational, educational, scientific, aesthetic and open space benefits of\nwetlands\ncited in section 24-0105 of the\nact\nwill usually be most fully realized on publicly owned lands. Such lands may have greater public use than private lands. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§\n664.6",
