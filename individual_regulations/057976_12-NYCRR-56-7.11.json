  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 56-7.11 - Regulated abatement work area enclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Critical barriers. Critical barriers\nshall be constructed to seal off all openings and penetrations to the regulated\nabatement work area including, but not limited to, operable windows and\nskylights, doorways and corridors (which shall not be used for passage), ducts, grills, diffusers, HVAC system seams, and any other penetrations to surfaces\nwithin the regulated abatement work area. Critical barriers shall be\nconstructed using two independent layers of at least six mil fire-retardant\nplastic sheeting with each layer sealed separately with duct tape. Caulk and\nfire-retardant expandable foam may be used to seal small openings or\npenetrations. Doorways and corridors, which shall not be used for passage\nduring the asbestos project, shall also be sealed. (b) Isolation barriers. Temporary hardwall\nbarriers to complete the containment enclosure and establish the asbestos\nproject regulated abatement work area shall be constructed using the following\nframing, sheathing, sealing and plasticizing criteria: (1)\n\nFraming. Isolation barrier partitions\nshall be constructed of wood or metal framing in all openings larger than 32\nsquare feet, except that where any one dimension is one foot or less, framing\nis not required. Existing walls or framing may be used to support isolation\nbarrier partition framing and sheathing. (2)\n\nSheathing. A plywood or oriented strand\nboard (OSB) sheathing material of at least 3/8-inch thickness shall be fastened\nto the regulated abatement work area side of the barrier partition. (3)\n\nSealing of isolation barriers. The edges\nof the isolation barrier partition shall be sealed at the floor, ceiling, walls\nand fixtures using caulk, fire-retardant expandable foam or duct tape to form\nan airtight seal. The seams of the partition sheathing shall also be sealed\nairtight using these techniques. (4)\n\nPlasticizing isolation barriers. The\nregulated abatement work area side of the isolation barrier partition shall be\ncovered with two layers of, at a minimum, six mil fire-retardant plastic\nsheeting with staggered joints and sealed airtight. (c) Removal of mounted objects. After\ncritical barriers and isolation barriers are in place, mounted objects shall be\nremoved and HEPA-vacuumed or wet wiped or both. Localized HEPA-filtered vacuum\nequipment shall be used during mounted object removal to reduce potential\nasbestos dispersal. (d) Elevator\nshutdown or isolation. Elevators running through the regulated abatement work\narea shall be shut down except as noted in this subdivision: (1)\n\nIsolation detail. In projects where the\nelevator cannot be shut down, the hoistway door frames shall be enclosed with\nnominal 2\" x 4\" framing, 16 inch on center, covered with 3/8-inch thickness\nplywood or OSB sheathing, and caulked or duct taped airtight at all seams. The\nenclosures shall be covered with two seamless layers of at least six mil\nplastic sheeting duct taped and sealed airtight. A final larger layer of at\nleast six mil plastic sheeting shall be duct taped and sealed airtight, but\nwith slack, forming a larger perimeter diaphragm to sense air movement caused\nby elevator operation. (2)\n\nElevator\nshaft ports. Elevator shaft ports for pressure equalization when within the\nregulated abatement work area, shall be vented to the outside or non-work areas\nusing oversized solid-walled ducts or chambers constructed with 3/8-inch\nthickness plywood or OSB sheathing over nominal 2\" x 4\" framing, 16 inch on\ncenter. The joints shall be caulked and the ducts or chambers shall be sealed\nwith two layers of at least six mil fire-retardant plastic sheeting and duct\ntape. The first layer of plastic sheeting shall be attached to the ducts or\nchambers using spray adhesive. This system shall be subjected to and pass a\nnegative pressure test daily. (e) Floor, wall and ceiling plasticizing and\nsealing. All floor, wall and ceiling surfaces, except where abatement of ACM, PACM or asbestos material shall be performed on those specific surfaces, shall\nbe covered with two layers of, at a minimum, six mil fire-retardant plastic\nsheeting. The floor shall be plasticized first, and its plastic sheeting shall\nextend up the walls a distance of at least 12 inches on all sides. The walls\nshall then be plasticized by applying plastic sheeting from the ceiling to the\nfloor, overlapping the floor sheeting by at least 12 inches. Next, the ceiling\nshall be plasticized overlapping the walls by at least 12 inches, to form a\nsecure airtight seam. This process shall be repeated for the second layer of\nplastic sheeting for the floor, walls and ceiling. All seams within a layer\nshall be separated by a distance of at least six feet and sealed airtight with\nduct tape. All seams between layers shall be staggered at least two\nfeet. (f) Barrier/pIasticizing\nexemptions. (1)\n\nNegative pressure tent\nregulated abatement work area enclosure. An alternate isolation method may be\nused where preparation of the entire room/space is either unfeasible or not\nnecessary to adequately access all impacted ACM, PACM or asbestos material. (i) Where allowed. Negative pressure tent\nenclosures are allowed to be utilized for gross abatement of any quantity\ninterior and exterior non-friable ACM or asbestos material, glovebag abatement\nof any quantity friable TSI, or gross abatement of minor and small quantities\nof friable ACM, PACM or asbestos material. For tent enclosures with gross\nabatement of friable materials, attached (contiguous) decontamination system\nenclosures shall be constructed, maintained and utilized as per this Part. Minor size tent enclosure work areas shall at a minimum have decontamination\nareas installed and utilized, as per the requirements of section\n56-11.3\nof this Part. (a) Multiple minor size regulated abatement\nwork areas. If the small or large asbestos project consists of multiple\nnegative pressure tent regulated abatement work area enclosures with minor\nquantities of ACM to be abated within each tent enclosure, these tent\nenclosures shall be constructed as per this subpart, including attached airlock\nif remote decontamination systems are allowed and utilized for the asbestos\nproject. (ii)\n\nTent\nconstruction. (a) Tents with greater than 20\nsquare feet of floor space, that are scheduled for gross removal of friable\nACM, PACM, or asbestos material, shall be constructed of two layers of six mil\nfire-retardant plastic sheeting and shall include walls, ceiling and a floor\n(except for portions of walls, floors and ceilings that are the removal\nsurface) with double-folded seams. Seams shall be duct taped airtight and then\nduct taped flush with the adjacent tent wall. (b) Tents with no gross removal of friable\nACM, PACM or asbestos material, shall be constructed of one layer six mil\nfire-retardant plastic sheeting and shall include walls, ceiling and a floor\n(except for portions of walls, floors and ceilings that are the removal\nsurface) with double-folded seams. Seams shall be duct taped airtight and then\nduct taped flush with the adjacent tent wall. (c) Tents or tent-like structures or\nenclosures shall be adequately supported and reinforced to withstand local\nenvironmental conditions and the negative pressures developed within\nthem. (d) Airlock. An airlock shall\nbe constructed as per section\n56-7.5\n(b)(11)\nof\nthis Subpart, at the entrance to each tent that utilizes remote decontamination\nsystem facilities. Each tent and airlock shall be cordoned off 25 feet from it\nperimeter, or the interior space/ room where the tent and airlock is located\nshall be secured from non-certified personnel or public access, and signage\nshall be installed as per section\n56-7.4\n(c) of this\n\nSubpart. (iii)\n\nNegative\nair. Manometers consistent with the requirements of section 56- 7.8(a)(4) of\nthis Subpart, are required for negative pressure tent enclosure regulated\nabatement work areas with OSHA Class I abatement. Negative air shall be\nmaintained at four air changes per hour for non-friable and glovebag abatement\ntent enclosure work areas. Eight air changes shall be maintained for friable\ngross removal tent enclosure work areas. If a HEPA-filtered vacuum is used for\na minor size abatement tent enclosure work area to maintain the required air\nchanges, after final cleaning is completed 20 minutes shall elapse, then\nventilation may be stopped, clearance air samples collected if required, and\nthe tent sealed until results are read. If air sample results are unacceptable, ventilation shall be reestablished, the area recleaned and new samples\ntaken. (2)\n\nFire-retardant spray plastic. Fire-retardant spray plastic may be used in lieu\nof two layers of six mil plastic sheeting as required by subdivision (e) of\nthis section, under the following conditions: (i) Critical barriers are installed per\nsubdivision (a) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe fire-retardant spray plastic is\nused, applied, maintained and removed in accordance with the manufacturer's\ndetailed procedures by persons who have been trained by the manufacturer or\nothers authorized to perform such training. Proof of appropriate training shall\nbe located at the work site and shall be produced upon verbal request of the\ncommissioner or his or her duly authorized representative. (iii)\n\nApplication shall be made to result in\na dry thickness of not less than six mils. (3)\n\nSpecial projects. See Subpart 56-11 of\nthis Part regarding work area preparation requirements for special projects. These projects include exterior non-friable ACM roofing, siding, caulking, glazing compound, transite, tars, sealers, coatings, and other NOB ACM\nabatement, abandoned intact pipe/duct/conduit wrap and cut abatement, flooring\nand mastic abatement, pre-demolition abatement, demolition with asbestos in\nplace, in-plant operations abatement, emergency project abatement and minor\nsize project abatement. (4)\n\nRemoval\nof ceilings and components. Suspended ceiling and components that exist below\nfriable ACM or PACM material, and that are not themselves ACM or PACM, shall\nremain in place until the remainder of the regulated abatement work area has\nbeen plasticized, negative air established, and personal and waste\ndecontamination enclosures have been constructed. The ceiling tiles and\ncomponents shall then be removed and disposed of as asbestos waste or\ndecontaminated if possible. This type of removal must be done prior to\ncommencement of Phase II B abatement, but after the remaining regulated\nabatement work area preparation has been completed. Critical barriers shall be\ninstalled above the suspended ceiling as per subdivision (a) of this section, prior to the commencement of Phase II B abatement. (5)\n\nExits. Emergency and fire exits from the\nregulated abatement work area shall be maintained or alternate exits shall be\nestablished and appropriately signed according to all applicable codes. Temporary hardwall barriers are not required at emergency and fire exit\nlocations. (g) Toilet\nfacilities. Adequate toilet facilities shall be readily accessible to the\npersonal decontamination enclosure. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
