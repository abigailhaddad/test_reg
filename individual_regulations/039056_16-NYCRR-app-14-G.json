Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 14-G\nState Regulations\nEXAMPLES ILLUSTRATING THE REINFORCEMENT OF WELDED\nBRANCH CONNECTIONS\nExample 1\n\nAn 8 inch outlet is welded into a 24 inch header. The header\nmaterial is API 5LX 46 with 5/16 inch wall. The outlet is API 5L Grade B\n(Seamless) Sched. 40 with 0.322 inch wall. The working pressure is 650 PSI. The\n\nClass Location is 1. The joint efficiency is 1.00. The temperature is 100°\nF. Design Factors F=0.60, E=1.00, T=1.00. For dimensions see Figure for Example\n1, Appendix 14-G. Header: Nominal wall thickness: t =(PD/2 SFET)(650 x 24/2 x 46000 x 0.60 x 1.00 x 1.00) = 0.283\ninch\n\nExcess thickness in header wall (H-t) =0.312 - 0.283 = 0.029\ninch\n\nOutlet: Nominal wall thickess: t\nb\n= ( 650 x 8.625/2 x 35000 x 0.60 x\n1.00 x 1.00) = 0.133 inch\n\nExcess thickness i outlet wall (B-t\nb\n)\n=0.322-0.133 = 0.189 inch\nd = diameter of opening = 8.625-(2 x 0.322) =7.981 inch\n\nReinforcement required. A\nR\n= d x t = 7.981 x 0.283 = 2.26\nsquare inch\n\nReinforcement provided: A\n1\n= (H-t)d = 0.029 x 7.981 = 0.23\nsquare inch\n\nEffective area in outlet: Height (L) 21/2 B + M (assume 1/4 inch pad) = 21/2 x 0.322 +\n0.25 = 1.05 inches or 21/2 H = 2.5 x 0.312 = 0.78 inch. Use 0.78 inch. A\n2\n= 2(B-t\nb\n)L =\n2 x 0.189 x 0.78 = 0.295 sq. in. This must be multiplied by 35000/46000\n\nEffective A\n2\n= 0.295 x (35000/46000) =\n0.22 sq. in. Required area A\n3\n= A\nR\n- A\n1\n- A\n2\n= 2.26 - 0.23 - 0.22 = 1.81 sq. in. Use reinf. pl. 1/4 inch thick (minimum practicable) x 15.5 inch\ndiameter. Area (15.50 - 8.62) x 0.25 = 1.72 sq. in. Fillet welds (assuming two 1/4 inch welds each side)\n0.25 x 0.25 x 0.50 x 2 x 2 = 0.12 sq. in. Total A\n3\nprovided 1.84 sq. in. Example 2\nA 16 inch outlet is welded into a 24 inch header. The header\nmaterial is API 5LX46 with 5/16 inch wall. The outlet is API 5L Grade B\n(Seamless) Sched. 20 with 0.312 wall. The working pressure is 650 PSI. The\n\nClass Location is 1. The reinforcement must be of the complete encirclement\ntype. The joint efficiency is 1.00. The temperature is 100° F. Design\n\nFactors F=0.60, E=1.00, T=1.00. For dimensions see Figure for Example 2 in\n\nAppendix 14-G.
