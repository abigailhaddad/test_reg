Tit. 14 § 687.5 - Suspension, revocation or limitation of an operating certificate\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\ncommissioner may revoke, suspend or limit an operating certificate or impose\npenalties upon a determination that the family care provider named on the\ncertificate has failed to comply with the terms of the operating certificate or\nwith the provisions of any applicable statute, rule or regulation. The family\ncare provider shall be given notice and an opportunity to be heard pursuant to\nsection\n16.17\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law and applicable regulations of the commissioner prior to\nany such determination. (b) A\ncertificate may be temporarily suspended or limited without a hearing for a\nperiod not in excess of 60 days upon written notice to the family care provider\nfollowing a finding by OPWDD that an individual's health or safety is in\nimminent danger or there exists any condition or practice or a continuing\npattern of conditions or practices which poses imminent danger to the health or\nsafety of any individual. Upon such finding and notice, the power of the\ncommissioner to temporarily suspend or limit an operating certificate shall\ninclude, but shall not be limited to: (1)\nprohibit or limit the placement of new individuals in the family care\nhome; (2)\nremove or cause to be\nremoved some or all of the individuals in the family care home; or\n(3)\nsuspend or limit or cause to be suspended\nor limited the payment of any governmental funds to the family care home, provided that such action shall not in any way jeopardize the health, safety\nand welfare of any individual residing in the family care home. (c) At any time subsequent to the\nsuspension or limitation of any operating certificate where said suspension or\nlimitation is the result of correctable physical plant or program deficiencies, the family care provider may request OPWDD to reinspect the family care home to\nredetermine whether a specific condition or practice continues to exist. (1)\n\nWithin 10 days of the receipt of such a\nrequest, OPWDD shall reinspect the family care home to redetermine whether a\nspecific condition or practice continues to exist. (2)\n\nIn the event that the previously found\ncondition or practice has been eliminated, the suspension or limitation shall\nbe withdrawn. (3)\n\nIf the condition\nor practice has not been eliminated, OPWDD shall not thereafter be required to\nreinspect the family care home during the emergency period of suspension or\nlimitation. (d) During\nthe 60-day suspension or limitation period provided for in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, the commissioner shall determine whether to reinstate or remove\nthe limitations on the provider's operating certificate, or to revoke, suspend\nor limit the operating certificate. Should the commissioner choose to revoke, suspend or limit the operating certificate, then the emergency suspension or\nlimitation provided for shall remain in effect pending the outcome of an\nadministrative hearing on the revocation, suspension or limitation. (e) The family care provider, within 10 days\nof the date when the emergency suspension or limitation pursuant to subdivision\n(b) of this section is first imposed or within 10 days of the date of receipt\nof notice from the commissioner to revoke or limit the provider's operating\ncertificate, may request an evidentiary hearing to contest the validity of the\nemergency suspension or limitation. Such an evidentiary hearing shall commence\nwithin 10 days of the family care provider's request and no request for an\nadjournment shall be granted without the concurrence of the family care\nprovider, the commissioner and the hearing officer. The evidentiary hearing\nshall be limited to those violations of Federal and State law and regulations\nthat gave rise initially to the emergency suspension or limitation. Should the\ncommissioner decide to revoke, suspend or limit the facility's operating\ncertificate, no administrative hearing on that action shall commence prior to\nthe conclusion of the evidentiary hearing, the rendering of the hearing\nofficer's report and the commissioner's final review and determination\nconcerning the emergency suspension or limitation. The commissioner shall issue\na ruling within 10 days after the receipt of the hearing officer's\nreport. (f) The commissioner may\nimpose a fine upon a finding that the holder of the certificate has failed to\ncomply with the terms of the operating certificate or with the provisions of\nany applicable statute, rule or regulation. The maximum amount of fine shall be\n$1,000 per day or $15,000 per violation. Such penalty may be recovered by an\naction brought by the commissioner in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such\npenalty may be released or compromised by the commissioner before the matter\nhas been referred to the Attorney General. Any such penalty may be released or\ncompromised, and any action commenced to recover the same may be settled or\ndiscontinued by the Attorney General with the consent of the\ncommissioner. (g) Any notice of\nsuspension, revocation, or limitation of an operating certificate, or notice of\nintent to take such action, must also be addressed and sent to the executive\ndirector of an agency sponsored family care program.
