  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 50.1 - Findings of fact\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe board finds that certain industries, trades, occupations and processes involving the use or presence of lasers involve\nelements of potential danger to the lives, health and safety of persons\nemployed therein. The board finds, therefore, that special regulations are\nnecessary for the protection of such persons in that lasers emit infrared, visible or ultraviolent coherent light which may have the property of producing\ndeleterious effects upon the human body and within the human eye and in that\nother hazards associated with lasers may be present. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n50.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
