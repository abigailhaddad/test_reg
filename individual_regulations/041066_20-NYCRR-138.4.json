  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 138.4 - Modifications relating to New York items not in distributable net income\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 638(a)(3)\n(a) General. In determining the New York taxable income of a nonresident estate or trust, there must be added or subtracted, as the case may be, the amount of any of the modifications described in paragraphs (1) through (11) of this subdivision to the extent they are attributable to income, gain, loss or deduction derived from or connected with New York State sources which are included in the Federal taxable income of the estate or trust and which are not included in distributable net income. (1)\n\nThe optional modifications for depreciation and research and development expenditures, pursuant to section\n112.7\nof this Title. (2)\n\nThe optional modification for waste treatment facility expenditures pursuant to section\n112.8\nof this Title. (3)\n\nThe modifications relating to mines, oil and gas wells and other natural deposits, pursuant to section\n112.9\nof this Title. (4)\n\nThe modification relating to net capital gains for the taxable year (to the extent allocable to principal) pursuant to section\n112.2\n(i) of this Title, if any. However, no modification is required to be made to the New York taxable income of a nonresident estate or trust pursuant to the provisions of such subdivision for that portion of any net gain as described in such subdivision which: (i) is derived from or connected with New York State sources; (ii)\nhas been paid or permanently set aside for New York charitable purposes by the estate or trust; and\n(iii)\nis allowable as a deduction for charitable purposes in accordance with the provisions of section\n642\nof the Internal Revenue Code. (5)\n\nThe portion of any gain from the sale or other disposition of property having a higher adjusted basis for New York State income tax purposes than for Federal income tax purposes, in accordance with the provisions of section\n112.3\n(d) of this Title. Example: A nonresident trust acquired a rented parcel of real property located in New York State in 1956. The basis of the property to the trust, as of the last day of the last taxable year for which article 16 of the Tax Law was effective, was $2,000 less for Federal income tax purposes than for New York State income tax purposes, as the trustee used accelerated depreciation on the Federal returns and straight-line depreciation on the New York State returns of the trust prior to 1960. The property was sold in 1985 at a profit of $10,000, which was considered a long-term capital gain for Federal income tax purposes. In accordance with the trust instrument, the trustee allocated all the gain to corpus. Consequently, although no portion of this gain was includible in the distributable net income of the trust, the $10,000 gain was properly included in the Federal taxable income of the trust. For New York State income tax purposes, the amount of the Federal gain is reduced by the modification for the higher New York State basis as prescribed by section\n112.3\n(d) of this Title. However, the modification for the portion of the Federal gain representing the difference between the Federal and New York State bases is limited to 40 percent, as the gain was considered a long-term capital gain for Federal income tax purposes. The modification, therefore, is $800 (40 percent of $2,000). (6)\n\nThe modification for the amount necessary to prevent the taxation, under article 22 of the Tax Law, of an annuity or other amount of income or gain which was previously taxable under article 16 of the Tax Law in accordance with the provisions of section\n112.3\n(e) of this Title. (7)\n\nThe modification for that portion of wages and salaries paid or incurred for the taxable year for which a deduction is not allowed in accordance with the provisions of section\n280C\nof the Internal Revenue Code pursuant to section\n112.3\n(o) of this Title. (8)\n\nThe modification described in section\n112.2\n(k) of this Title in the case of an estate or trust to which the assets of a qualified higher education fund are required to be distributed pursuant to section\n612 (k)(3)(A)(iii)\nof the Tax Law. (9)\n\nFor taxable years beginning in 1982, 1983 and 1984, the modifications described in subdivisions (p) and (q) of section\n112.2\nof this Title and those described in subdivisions (u) and (v) of section\n112.3\nof this Title relating to an election made pursuant to section\n168(f)(8)\nof the Internal Revenue Code as such section was in effect for safe harbor lease agreements entered into prior to January 1, 1984. (10)\n\nFor taxable years beginning in 1982, 1983 and 1984, the modifications described in: (i) section\n112.2\n(r) of this Title relating to the disallowance of the amount allowable as the accelerated cost recovery system deduction pursuant to section\n168\nof the Internal Revenue Code; and\n(ii)\nsection\n112.3\n(w) of this Title relating to the allowance of a depreciation deduction pursuant to section\n167\nof the Internal Revenue Code as such section would have applied to property placed in service on December 31, 1980. (11)\n\nThe modification described in section\n112.2\n(s) of this Title or the modification described in section\n112.3\n(x) of this Title relating to the disposition of recovery property for which accelerated cost recovery system deductions were not allowed (see section\n112.2\n[r]\nof this Title) and for which New York depreciation deductions were allowed (see section\n112.3\n[w]\nof this Title). (b) Exception. The New York taxable income of a nonresident estate or trust does not include that proportion of those modifications described in paragraphs (a)(1) through (11) of this section to the extent that such modifications relate to items of income, gain, loss or deduction attributable to New York State sources which, pursuant to the terms of the governing instrument, are paid or permanently set aside during the taxable year for a New York State charitable purpose (see section\n139.3\n(b) of this Article).
