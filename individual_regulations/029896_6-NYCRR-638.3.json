The time rate of heat flow through a unit area of homogeneous material in a direction perpendicular to isothermal planes, induced by a unit temperature gradient between the two surfaces. (ef)\n\nThermal zone. A building area that is either (a) unconditioned (\ne.g., a garage), or that is (b) conditioned and controlled by at least one controlling device, such as a thermostat. (eg)\n\nThrottling range. The number of degrees that a space temperature must change so that the heating (or cooling) system goes from full heating (or cooling) to no heating (or no cooling). (eh)\n\nTotal volatile organic compounds. The sum of volatile organic compounds that can be analyzed and measured by EPA Method TO-1, calibrated referenced to toluene. (ei)\n\nType 1 finishes. Materials and finishes which have the potential for short-term off-gassing, (a) because of the way they are manufactured or (b) because they contain solvents which evaporate during drying or curing. Type 1 finishes include: (1)\narchitectural coatings; (2)\nadhesives, caulks and sealants; (3)\nwood preservatives and finishes; (4)\ncontrol and/or expansion joint fillers; (5)\nall hard finishes requiring adhesive installation; (6)\ncomposite wood products, including millwork, wood paneling, doors or furniture made from particle board or medium density fiberboard containing urea formaldehyde resin; and\n(7)\nmaterials and finishes that can be categorized as both a type 1 finish and a type 2 finish. (ej)\n\nType 2 finishes. Materials that are woven, fibrous or porous in nature and finishes which tend to adsorb contaminants associated with type 1 finishes. They also collect dust and can retain moisture, promoting mold growth. Type 2 finishes include: (1)\ncarpet and carpet cushion; (2)\nfabric-covered partitions and acoustic wall panels; (3)\nfabric wall coverings; (4)\nacoustical ceiling tiles; and\n(5)\nupholstered furniture. (ek)\nU-factor. The heat flow rate per unit area under steady state conditions from the fluid on the warm side of a building component to the fluid on the cold side, per unit temperature difference between the two fluids. For most applications the fluid is air. (el)\nUL listing. Underwriters Laboratory (UL) certification that a manufacturer's product has been tested by UL to nationally recognized safety standards and found to be free from reasonably foreseeable risk of fire, electric shock and related hazards according to those standards. (em)\n\nUnit pavers. Units with regular shape used for outdoor paving systems. In these systems voids between the unit pavers allow water to drain. Unit paver materials include concrete, brick, stone, plastic (discrete units or grid). (en)\n\nVentilation zone. Subdivided area of the building served by one air handling unit. (eo)\n\nVolatile organic compound (VOC). (1)\nA chemical with sufficiently high vapor pressure to exist as a gas or vapor at ambient temperatures, i.e., with lower boiling point limit between 50 and 100 degrees Centigrade and an upper limit between 240 and 260 degrees Centigrade and formaldehyde; or\n(2)\nany organic compound that participates in atmospheric photochemical reactions. (ep)\n\nWaste management plan. Document outlining resource efficient measures used during construction to minimize waste generation, reuse and renovate existing structures, salvage existing materials and items for reuse or sale, reuse materials on-site, and recycle waste generated during the demolition and construction process. (eq)\n\nWastewater. Water that has been used at least once in a building. (er)\n\nWater cascading. Unidirectional use of untreated wastewater for a purpose with appropriately matched lower quality requirements. (es)\n\nWater recycling. Reuse of treated wastewater for purposes including the original use, involving repeated cycling of water through a system. Water recycling flow is not limited by input to the system, but it may be limited by increasing concentration of wastewater constituents that are not removed by treatment. (et)\n\nWater reuse. Unidirectional use of treated wastewater for another purpose, limited in quantity to the amount of water used for the original purpose. (eu)\n\nWhole building. An entire building, including the base building and all tenant spaces. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
