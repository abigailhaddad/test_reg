  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 7 § 1951.1 - General confinement facility screening procedure\n\nState Regulations\n\nThese procedures apply to inmates at maximum, medium and\nminimum correctional facilities, including shock incarceration facilities. In\norder for an inmate to participate in the CASAT program, the inmate must meet\nthe basic program requirements, and be eligible for presumptive work release\napproval contingent upon successful completion of Phase I of the CASAT program, or be approved for work release. (a) Identification of eligible inmates. Each month the senior correction counselor\nwill identify the pool of time eligible inmates, who have not previously been\nscreened for CASAT eligibility, and will insure that these inmates are screened\nfor CASAT by the appropriate counselor. When an inmate is disqualified from\nparticipation in shock incarceration, the senior counselor will immediately\ndetermine whether the inmate is time eligible for CASAT. If the inmate is time\neligible, he should be immediately screened for CASAT. (b) Initial screening. Correction counselors\nwill use form K-17, the CASAT Checklist, to screen for CASAT\neligibility. (c) Work release\napproval or presumptive work release approval. Prior to placement in a CASAT\nannex, an inmate must receive either work release approval or presumptive work\nrelease approval. (1)\n\nWith the exception of\nthe point score requirement, an inmate's temporary release screening for CASAT\nparticipation will be done in accordance with the provisions of Subchapter A of\nthis Chapter. (2)\n\nPoint scores will\nbe completed for all inmates being screened for CASAT. An inmate who does not\nmeet the point score requirement for work release approval shall be reviewed\nfor presumptive work release approval. (3)\n\nPoint scores are deemed to be waived for\npresumptive work release approval, based upon satisfactory completion of Phase\nI of the CASAT program. (4)\n\nAn\ninmate may only be deemed unsuitable for presumptive work release approval\nbased upon his: (i) crime of\ncommitment; (ii)\ncriminal\nhistory; (iii)\ncustodial\nadjustment; or\n(iv)\noutstanding\nwarrants/detainers. (5)\n\nThe temporary release chairperson will schedule the inmate for an appearance\nbefore the facility temporary release committee. The committee will determine\nif the inmate is suitable for work release, or is suitable for presumptive work\nrelease approval contingent upon successful completion of the CASAT Phase I\nprogram component. (d) Review by superintendent. The superintendent will assess each CASAT referral\nsent to him by the temporary release chairperson and approve or disapprove the\nrecommendation of the temporary release committee. Notes\nN.Y.
