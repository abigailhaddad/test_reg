Tit. 16 § 255.107 - Yield strength (s) for steel pipe\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For pipe that is manufactured in accordance with a specification listed in\nsection I of Appendix 14-B of this Title, the yield strength to be used in the\ndesign formula in section\n255.105\nof this Part is the SMYS\nstated in the listed specification, if that value is known. (b) For pipe that is manufactured in\naccordance with a specification not listed in section I of Appendix 14-B of\nthis Title and whose specification or tensile properties are unknown, the yield\nstrength to be used in the design formula in section\n255.105\nof this Part is one of the\nfollowing: (1)\nif the pipe is tensile tested\nin accordance with section II-D of Appendix 14-B to this Title, the lower of\neither 80 percent of the average yield strength determined by the tensile\ntests, or the lowest yield strength determined by the tensile tests; or\n(2)\nif the pipe is not tensile\ntested as provided in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, 24,000 psi (165\nMPa). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.107\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
