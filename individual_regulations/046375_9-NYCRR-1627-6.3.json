  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-6.3 - Termination by authority\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Grounds\nfor instituting summary proceedings. Following are grounds upon which summary\nproceedings should be instituted by the authority to recover possession: (1)\nnonpayment of rent; (2)\nwillful misrepresentation or concealment\nby tenant of any material fact which would affect eligibility for admission or\ncontinued occupancy or rent to be paid; (3)\nbreach of rules and regulations of\ntenancy; (4)\nnoncooperation; (5)\nchronic\ndelinquency in payment of rent; (6)\nnonverifiable income; (7)\nunder- or\nover-occupancy and refuses offer of transfer; (8)\nresidual single person occupant contrary\nto authority's policy on single person occupancy; (9)\nassignment or transfer of possession by\ntenant of record to other person or persons, without authority, permission or\nconsent, after tenant of record has moved from apartment; (10)\nnondesirability; and\n(11)\ncontingent liability arising from use of\napartment for illegal purposes. (b) Responsibilities of manager and counsel. (1)\n\nActions by the authority to recover\npossession will be processed by the authority's counsel based on information\nfurnished by the manager. The manager is responsible for the accuracy of that\ninformation and, where applicable, that all other reasonable efforts have been\nmade to correct the situation. (2)\n\nThe authority's counsel is responsible for insuring that necessary notices and\nother papers are properly and timely prepared and served. Preparation and\nservice of such papers, as directed by authority's counsel, should be\naccomplished by project personnel where practicable, especially in the case of\nnonpayment or other rent action. (3)\n\nActions for nonpayment of rents must\nfollow the schedule outlined in Subpart 1627-5, Rent Determination and\n\nCollection. The schedule of legal action, including three days' notice, should\nbe such as to have the case in court during the first month of delinquency. In\nholdover proceedings, i.e., actions other than for nonpayment of rent, necessary legal action should be scheduled as soon as possible after authority\nauthorization has been obtained. Where authorization to institute holdover\nproceedings is required, it is the responsibility of the manager to submit to\nthe authority, as promptly as possible, full information, including his efforts\nto resolve the matter by other means. If matter is urgent, authorization can be\nobtained by contracting authority chairman and members, with such authorization\nbeing officially ratified at authority's next meeting. (4)\n\nIt is essential that all statutory\nrequirements and procedures established by the authority are strictly followed\nin the case of termination proceedings so that action is not impaired. The\nauthority's counsel should insure that authority personnel concerned are aware\nof applicable statutory requirements. No payments of rent should be accepted\nonce proceedings have been instituted, unless such acceptance is approved by\nthe authority's counsel. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
