  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 43.6 - Operation of producers security fund\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Annually, and at such other times as he\ndeems appropriate, the commissioner shall determine the amount of money to be\naccumulated in the producers security fund sufficient to protect the interests\nof producers in accordance with section 258-b(4)(b) of the law. The\ncommissioner's determination shall be promptly announced to milk dealers\nparticipating in the producers security fund. (b) Each milk dealer who participates in the\nproducers security fund shall on or before the 25th day of each month make\npayment to the commissioner, at the rate per hundredweight announced for the\nfiscal year pursuant to section 258- b(3)(a) of the law or at such lesser rate\nas may be established pursuant to section 258-b(3)(b) of the law, on all milk\npurchased, received or handled from producers during the preceding month. Such\npayment shall be reduced by the amount of any credit the commissioner issues to\nthe milk dealer pursuant to subdivision (f) of this section applying to such\nmonthly payment and the balance payable shall be considered the dealer's net\nmonthly payment to the fund. The amount of a milk dealer's required net monthly\npayment to the producers security fund may be increased by one percent for each\nmonth or portion thereof that such payment is received after the due date. Notwithstanding the payment of late charges, the commissioner may take such\naction against the milk dealer for late payment as he deems appropriate\npursuant to the law. (c) The\nbalance in the producers security fund shall be determined monthly by the\ncommissioner, including any interest credited to the fund and allowing for\npayments from the fund for the expense of administration, withdrawals by milk\ndealers who terminate their participation therein, any credits issued or paid\nfrom the fund, claims paid from the fund not reimbursed by the defaulting milk\ndealer and any amounts the commissioner has reason to believe will be paid from\nthe fund as a result of pending claims. (d) An account shall be maintained by the\ncommissioner for each milk dealer who participates in the producers security\nfund, showing his initial and net monthly payments to the fund and any cash\ncredits or rebates received from the fund. (e) Each milk dealer's percentage (pro rata)\nshare of the balance in the producers security fund to be computed by the\ncommissioner at the close of each calendar quarter shall be his total net\npayments to date less any rebates or other cash credits he has received from\nthe fund divided by the total of such payments less rebates and cash credits of\nall dealers participating in the fund at the close of such calendar quarter; provided that: (1)\n\nAny milk dealer who has\ndefaulted in paying producers or a producer settlement or equalization fund for\nan order promulgated under section 258-m or 258-n of the law for which a claim\nor claims have been paid or there is reason to believe will be paid from the\nproducers security fund, and has not promptly reimbursed the fund in full for\nsuch claim or claims, shall have his percentage share of the balance in the\nfund reduced to the extent of all such claims. (2)\n\nAny milk dealer who fails to make payment\nto the producers security fund in accordance with subdivision (b) of this\nsection shall have his percentage share of the balance in the fund reduced to\nthe extent of such delinquent payments. (f) Whenever the balance in the producers\nsecurity fund at the close of a calendar quarter exceeds, by more than two\npercent, the amount the commissioner determines should be accumulated in the\nfund pursuant to subdivision (a) of this section, he shall compute a credit for\neach participating milk dealer by multiplying the dealer's percentage share, as\ncalculated pursuant to subdivision (e) of this section, times the amount by\nwhich the balance in the fund exceeds the amount the commissioner has\ndetermined should be so accumulated. Notice of any such credits shall be issued\nto each participating milk dealer for application to such dealer's monthly\npayments to the fund during the next calendar quarter. If a credit or credits\nissued to a milk dealer exceed the amount of his required payments to the fund\nduring such calendar quarter, such excess credits shall be paid by the\ncommissioner to the dealer at the close of the calendar quarter. (g) At least twice each year, the\ncommissioner shall report to participating milk dealers and producers on\nreceipts and disbursements from the producers security fund, the balance\ntherein and such other information about the fund as he deems of importance to\nsuch interested persons.
