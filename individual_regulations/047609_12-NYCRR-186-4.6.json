(b) Except as otherwise\nprovided in this section, the parent or guardian shall designate the\nresponsible person and may choose to serve as the responsible person for his or\nher own child under the age of 16. The parent or guardian may designate another\nadult at least 18 years of age, including another child performer's parent or\nguardian, to serve as the responsible person for the first parent's or\nguardian's child. (c) If a parent\nor guardian fails to designate a responsible person, or a child under 16 is\nwithout a responsible person on any day, the employer shall designate a\nresponsible person for that child. Such responsible person may be responsible\nfor more than one child. (d) Notwithstanding subdivisions (b) and (c) of this section, in live theater or\nother live performance, where it is physically impracticable for the employer\nto permit a responsible person designated by the parent or guardian to\naccompany a child under 16, the employer may either employ a responsible person\nfor the child or provide the responsible person designated by the parent or\nguardian with facilities to observe and hear the child through electronic or\nother appropriate means, or both. Where the employer elects to employ a\nresponsible person, the employer shall notify the parent or guardian in writing\nof the name of the responsible person, who may be responsible for more than one\nchild, and shall, at the employer's election, either: (1)\nobtain the written agreement of the\nparent or guardian, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed; or\n(2)\nprovide the parent or\nguardian with an opportunity to object to the responsible person and provide a\nmechanism to timely address any reasonable objections in the best interest of\nthe child. (e) The\nresponsible person shall not be assigned any duty by the employer that\ninterferes with the responsible person's duties to the child\nperformer(s). (f) Notwithstanding\nthe foregoing, when a group of children is employed under an employer\ncertificate of group eligibility, the employer or the entity providing the\ngroup of children must provide at least one responsible person for every 20\nchildren under the age of 16 or fraction thereof, to accompany the group\nthroughout the work day and to monitor the children's safety and well-being. Parents or other adults over 18 years of age may serve as responsible persons\nfor the group.
