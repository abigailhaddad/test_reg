  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 463.11 - Additions and retirements of steam plant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue\nrefinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of\nsteam plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of (1) retirement\nunits and (2) minor items of property. (b) Units of property (i.e., retirement\nunits, see section\n460.1\n[a][36]\nof\nthis Article). Each utility may adopt its own list of retirement units for the\npurpose of this instruction until such time as the commission shall prescribe a\nlist of units. Not later than six months after the effective date of this\nsystem of accounts, each utility shall file with the commission a list of the\nitems of property it proposes to account for as retirement units of property. Revisions of such list may be made at any time by appropriate filing thereof\nwith the commission. (1)\n\nWhen a retirement\nunit is added to steam plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the\nappropriate steam plant account, except that when retirement units are acquired\nin the acquisition of any steam plant constituting an operating system, they\nshall be accounted for as provided in steam plant instruction, section\n463.3\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWhen a retirement unit is retired from\nsteam plant, with or without replacement, the book cost thereof shall be\ncredited to the steam plant account in which it is included, determined in the\nmanner set forth in subdivision (d) of this section. The book cost of the\nretirement unit retired and credited to steam plant shall be charged to the\ndepreciation reserve provided for such property. (See also account 144, Retirement Work in Progress, and steam plant instruction, section\n463.12\nof this Part.)\n(c) Minor items of property. (1)\n\nWhen a minor item of property which does\nnot replace a similar item and which is a part of or associated with a\nretirement unit and will be accounted for and retired together with such unit, and which by itself or together with other similar items makes a substantial\naddition, is added to the plant, the cost thereof shall be added to the\nappropriate steam plant account; otherwise the cost of any minor item of\nproperty shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account. The amount\nadded to steam plant accounts for such minor items shall not, however, exceed\nthe additional cost computed at current prices that would have been incurred if\nthe minor items had been installed together with the retirement units to which\nthey are related. (2)\n\nWhen a minor\nitem of property is retired and not replaced, the book cost thereof shall be\ncredited to the steam plant account in which it is included; the depreciation\nreserve shall be charged with the book cost and cost of removal and credited\nwith the salvage. If, however, the book cost of a minor item retired and not\nreplaced, the original cost of which is less than $100, has been or will be\naccounted for by its inclusion in the retirement unit of which it is a part\nwhen such unit is retired, no separate credit to the property account is\nrequired when such minor item is retired. (3)\n\nWhen a minor item of property is replaced\nindependently of the retirement unit of which it is a part, the cost of\nreplacement shall be charged to the maintenance account appropriate for the\nitem, except that if the replacement effects a substantial betterment (the\nprimary aim of which is to make the property affected more useful, more\nefficient, or of greater capacity), the excess cost due to the betterment shall\nbe charged to the appropriate steam plant account. Such excess cost shall not\nexceed the additional cost computed at current prices that would have been\nincurred for such betterment if it had been installed together with the\nretirement unit to which it is related. (d) Determination of book cost. The book cost\nof steam plant retired shall be the amount at which such property is included\nin steam plant accounts 101 to 104 or 106, including all components of\nconstruction costs. The book cost shall be determined from the utility's\nrecords and if this can not be done, it shall be estimated. When it is\nimpracticable to determine the book cost of each item, due to the relatively\nlarge number or small cost thereof, the average book cost of the items, with\ndue allowance for any differences in size, character, and year of installation, shall be used as the book cost of the items retired. (e) Land retired. The book cost of land\nretired shall be credited to the appropriate land account. If the land is sold, the difference between the book cost and the sale price of the land (less\ncommissions and other expenses of making the sale) shall be credited or debited\nto the appropriate depreciation reserve. (f) Steam plant sold. When steam plant\nconstituting an operating unit or system is sold, conveyed or transferred to\nanother by sale, merger, consolidation or otherwise, the book cost of the\nproperty sold or transferred to another shall be credited to the appropriate\nsteam plant accounts, and amounts carried in account 105, Steam Plant\n\nAcquisition Adjustments, shall be credited thereto. The amounts (estimated if\nnot known) carried with respect thereto in the depreciation and amortization\nreserve accounts and in account 241, Customers' Advances for Construction, and\naccount 265, Contributions in Aid of Construction, shall be charged to such\nreserves and accounts. Unless otherwise ordered by the commission, the\ndifference, if any, between (1) the net amount of debits and credits and (2)\nthe consideration received for the property (less commissions and other\nexpenses of making the sale) shall be included in account 414, Miscellaneous\n\nDebits to Surplus, or account 401, Miscellaneous Credits to Surplus, as\nappropriate. (See account 106.3, Steam Plant Sold.)\n(g) The service value of steam plant retired\nshall be charged in its entirety to account 250, Reserve for Depreciation of\n\nSteam Plant. Any amounts which by approval of the commission are charged to\naccount 141, Extraordinary Property Losses, shall be credited to account 250, Reserve for Depreciation of Steam Plant. (h) The ledgers containing the primary steam\nplant accounts and subdivisions thereof shall be kept so as to show on their\nface (1) additions, (2) retirements, and (3) transfers and adjustments. Corrections of errors and adjustments to additions or retirements in the\ncurrent or preceding year shall be classified as additions or\nretirements. (i) The cost of paving\ndisturbed, including replacing pavement, pavement base and sidewalks, shall be\nincluded in the steam plant accounts only when incurred in connection with the\naddition of one or more retirement units of property; and the cost associated\nwith a particular retirement unit (see, however, subd. [d], supra) shall be\nretired when that retirement unit is retired, irrespective of whether the\npaving itself has a shorter or longer life. No addition (except charges to land\nfor public improvements) shall be made to any steam plant account for cost of\npaving installed in public streets which is not directly occasioned by the\ninstallation of property constituting one or more retirement units with which\nthe paving cost is associated as an element of cost. Amounts for such cost of\npavement which are included in any primary steam plant account or subdivision\nthereof shall be carried in a separate subdivision of the account so that the\nbalance therein may be determined at any time. (j) In the case of substantial items of\nequipment readily identifiable by serial number or other distinguishing mark, such as pumps, motors, meters, vehicles, furniture, etc., which are retired\nfrom plant and not sold or scrapped, statistical records shall be maintained to\nshow readily the year of original entry into utility service and the year when\npermanently retired and the salvage realized at permanent retirement. Such\nstatistical records shall be of such nature that the history of the property\nmay be recast to reflect the total life and final salvage of such items and to\neliminate the intermediate retirements and reuses, during the life of the\nproperty as well as after final retirement. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n463.11\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
