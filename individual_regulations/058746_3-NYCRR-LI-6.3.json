  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § LI 6.3 - Preemption of part of banking law, section 352(b) by the federal equal credit opportunity act\n\nState Regulations\n\nBanking Law, § 352[b]\n(a) Section\n352\n(b) of the Banking Law provides that a\nlicensed lender may not \"induce or permit any person, nor any husband and wife\njointly or severally, to become obligated, directly or contingently, or both, under more than one contract of loan at the same time, for the purpose or with\nthe result of obtaining a higher rate of interest than would otherwise be\npermitted by this section\". This prohibits a licensed lender from inducing or\npermitting husband and wife to enter into multiple loan agreements if the\npurpose or result is to obtain a rate of interest higher than would be\npermissible if only one loan agreement were made. Since the interest rates\nwhich licensed lenders may charge decline as the amount of the loan increases, a licensee would earn greater interest from multiple loans than from a single\nloan and might attempt to structure a singe loan as a multiple loan in the\nabsence of such a provision. (b) The Federal Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, which was\npromulgated pursuant thereto, expressly preempt \"any provision of State law\nwhich prohibits the separate extension of consumer credit\" to spouses if \"each\nspouse voluntarily applies for separate credit from the same creditor\". Thus, Regulation B preempts so much of section 352(b) as prohibits a licensee from\npermitting a husband and wife to enter into separate loan agreements with the\nsame licensee. By its terms, however, section 202.8(a) of Regulation B does not\napply to a situation in which a licensee induces a husband and wife to enter\ninto separate loan agreements. (c) The result of the interplay of the two provisions is that the language of\nsection 352(b) quoted above should be understood as follows: (1)\n\nNo licensee shall induce or permit any\nperson to become obligated, directly or contingently, or both, under more than\none contract of loan at the same time, for the purpose or with the result of\nobtaining a higher rate of interest than would otherwise be permitted by this\nsection. (2)\n\nNo licensee shall\ninduce any husband and wife jointly or severally to become obligated, directly\nor contingently, or both, under more than one contract of loan at the same\ntime, for the purpose or with the result of obtaining a higher rate of interest\nthan would otherwise be permitted by this section. (3)\n\nIf a husband or wife so requests, a\nlicensee must permit any husband and wife jointly or severally to become\nobligated, directly or contingently, or both, under more than one contract of\nloan at the same time, but the licensee may not obtain a higher rate of\ninterest on any loan than would otherwise be permitted if any loan or loans\nmade to both spouses jointly and any loan or loans made to one spouse\nindividually were considered a single loan; provided, however, that any loan or\nloans made to one spouse individually or jointly with a third party shall not\nbe considered in determining the rate of interest applicable to any loan or\nloans made to the other spouse individually or jointly with a third\nparty. (4)\n\nThe aggregate amount of\nloans outstanding by a licensee on which any person is obligated in any manner\nshall not exceed the amount authorized by section\n352\n(a) of the Banking Law.
