Tit. 16 § 197.36 - Unaudited items\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhen the amount of any item affecting these accounts can\nnot be accurately determined in time for inclusion in the accounts of the\nfiscal year in which the transaction occurs, the amount of the item shall be\nestimated and included in the proper accounts. When the item is audited the\nnecessary adjustments shall be made through the accounts in which the estimate\nwas recorded. If, during the interval between the date of inclusion of the item\nin the accounts and the date on which it is audited, a substantial difference\nfrom the initial estimate is determined, appropriate adjustments shall be made\nin the current accounts to cover such difference. The utility is not required\nto anticipate small items which would not appreciably affect these\naccounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n197.36\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
