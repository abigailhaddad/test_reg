NOW, THEREFORE, I, ANDREW M. CUOMO, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and\nlaws of the State of New York, do hereby order and direct as follows: 1. \"State Entities\" shall mean (i) all\nagencies and departments over which the Governor has executive authority and as\ndefined in subdivision 3, section\n2-a\nof the\n\nState Finance Law; and (ii) all public benefit corporations, public\nauthorities, boards, and commissions for which the Governor appoints the Chair, the Chief Executive, or at least 50% of the Board Members. 2. \"Contract\" shall mean any contract, lease, grant or equivalent legal instrument. 3. State Entities are directed to evaluate -\nutilizing the existing vendor responsibility determination process - whether\nbidders are responsible, based in pertinent part upon the following factors: (i) financial and organization capacity; (ii)\nlegal authority; (iii)\nintegrity; and\n(iv)\npast performance. Moreover, State\n\nEntities are required to determine whether a contractor, vendor, or grantee has\nfailed to comply with any statutory provisions relating to debarment. 4. If a State Entity discovers\ninformation that indicates a contractor, vendor, or grantee may not be\nresponsible, may no longer be responsible during the term of the contract, or\nbe subject to debarment for violation of a statutory provision or provisions, the State Entity is directed, as applicable, (i) to conduct an analysis, review, hearing, or investigation, which may include, but is not limited to, conducting a document review supplemented by interviews involving the\nquestioning of the contractor, vendor, or grantee and their representatives; and (ii) to make a determination following such review, hearing or\ninvestigation. 5. All State\n\nEntities are required to maintain information on contractors, vendors, or\ngrantees that have been deemed non-responsible or ineligible to bid on future\ncontracts or grants and are directed to submit a list of such contractors, vendors, or grantees to the Office of General Services (\"OGS\") for posting on\nthe OGS website within 5 days. This list should include the name of such\ncontractor, vendor, or grantee, the date, and the basis of the determination, and shall be provided in a manner to be determined by OGS. 6. OGS is directed to post a list of the\nnon-responsibility and debarment determinations on the OGS public website. Such\nnames of debarred contractors, vendors, or grantees shall remain posted on the\nOGS website for the period designated in the relevant statutory provision\nallowing for such debarment. In all other cases, determinations shall remain on\nthe list until OGS receives notice of a finding by a court of competent\njurisdiction that the non-responsibility or debarment determination was in\nerror or until such time as a waiver has been approved by the Counsel to the\n\nGovernor, in a manner to be determined by OGS. 7. All State Entities and their\nstate-approved directors must rely on the determination made by other State\n\nEntities in ascertaining the responsibility, ineligibility, or debarment of a\ncontractor, vendor, or grantee in current and future procurements. 8. Any commissioner, agency or department\nhead, or member of a board of directors of a State Entity who selects, absent\nan approved wavier, a contractor, vendor, or grantee, who has been deemed\nnon-responsible, debarred, or otherwise ineligible shall be breaching their\nduty as a public officer and/or fiduciary duty as a board member.
