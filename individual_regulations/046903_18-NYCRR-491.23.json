(1)\n\nThe office\nmay undertake an investigation of the affairs and management of any shelter for\nadults, small-capacity shelter, or shelters for adult families, or of any\nperson, corporation, society, association or organization that operates or\nholds itself out as being authorized to operate any such facility, or of the\nconduct of any officers or employers of any such facility. The office is\nempowered to issue compulsory process for the attendance of witnesses and the\nproduction of papers, to administer oaths and to examine persons under oath, and to exercise the same powers in respect to the conduct of such an\ninvestigation as belong to referees appointed by the Supreme Court. (2)\n\nIf it shall appear after such\ninvestigation that the residents of the facility are cruelly, negligently or\nimproperly treated, or that inadequate provision is made for their sustenance, clothing, care, supervision or other condition necessary for their comfort and\nwell-being, the office, may issue an order in the name of the people, and under\nthe official seal of the State, directing the appropriate officers or managers\nof such facility to modify such treatment or provide such other remedy as may\nbe specified therein. Before any such order is issued, it must be approved by a\n\nJustice of the Supreme Court, after such notice as he may prescribe and after\nan opportunity to be heard, and any person to whom such an order is directed\nwho shall intentionally fail or refuse to obey its terms shall be guilty of a\nmisdemeanor. (b) Enforcement. (1)\n\nEnforcement\nshall mean the action(s) undertaken or initiated\nby the office to help assure that shelters for adults, small-capacity shelters\nand shelters for adult families are established and operated in compliance with\nall applicable State and local laws or regulations, including the applicable\nprovisions of this Part, and in accordance with an operational plan approved by\nthe office. (2)\n\nEnforcement actions\nundertaken by the office may include, but are not limited to: (i) issuance of notice of intention to\ninitiate enforcement; (ii)\nconduct\nof hearings to determine if an operator has failed to comply with applicable\nlaw and regulation; (iii)\ndetermination, after hearing, that civil penalties should be imposed; (iv)\ndetermination, after hearing, to revoke, suspend or limit an operating certificate; (v) issuance of an order pursuant to Social\n\nServices Law section 460-d(2) requiring an operator to immediately remedy\nconditions dangerous to residents; (vi)\ntemporary suspension or limitation of an\noperating certificate upon finding that resident health and safety are in\nimminent danger; (vii)\nrequest to\nthe Attorney General to seek an injunction against an operator for violations\nor threatened violations of law or regulation; or\n(viii)\nrequest to the Attorney General to\ntake such action as is necessary to seek criminal prosecution, or to bring\nabout compliance with any outstanding hearing determination or order. (3)\n\nThe operating certificate of\nany shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or shelters for adult families\nmay be revoked, suspended or limited upon a determination by the office, after\na hearing in accordance with procedures set forth in Part 493 of this Title, that the operator has failed to comply with the operational plan approved by\nthe office or requirements of State or local laws or regulations applicable to\nthe operation of such facility. (4)\n\nThe operating certificate of any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or\nshelters for adult families may be temporarily suspended or limited without a\nhearing for a period not in excess of 60 days upon written notice to the\nfacility that the office has found that the public health, or an individual's\nhealth, safety or welfare is in imminent danger. If the office schedules an\nexpedited hearing to begin during the suspension period, in a proceeding to\nsuspend, revoke or limit the operating certificate, as set forth in section\n493.8\nof this Title, the temporary\nsuspension will remain in effect until the hearing decision is\nissued. (5)\n\nAny order or\ndetermination to limit an operating certificate shall specify the manner in\nwhich the operating certificate is to be limited. An operating certificate may\nbe found subject to one or more of the following limitations: (i) a limitation on the period of time for\nwhich such certificate remains effective, contingent on a determination that\nspecified violations have been corrected or specified conditions have been\nmet; (ii)\na limitation on the\nnumber of persons for which such facility is authorized to provide\ncare; (iii)\na prohibition against\nthe admission of new residents after a specified date; or\n(iv)\na limitation on the type(s) of service\nto be provided. (c) Violations or threatened violations of\nlaw or State regulations at any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or\nshelters for adult families may be enjoined by the Supreme Court. The Attorney\n\nGeneral may seek such an injunction, in the name of the people, upon the\nrequest of the office. Service in such an action shall state the nature of the\nviolation and shall be accomplished in the manner prescribed by the Civil\n\nPractice Law and Rules; provided, however, that an\nex parte\ntemporary restraining order may be issued, notwithstanding the Civil Practice\n\nLaw and Rules, if the court finds, on motion and affidavit, that such violation\nmay reasonably be expected to result in imminent danger to the public health or\nto the health, safety or welfare of any individual in a facility subject to the\noffice's inspection and supervision. The court, after a hearing, may issue a\npreliminary injunction or a permanent injunction enjoining a facility from\nadmitting new residents, or directing the office and such facility to arrange\nfor the transfer of residents to other facilities, or any other injunctive\nrelief the court may deem necessary. (d) Whenever the office has knowledge, acquired by announced or unannounced inspections, audits, or other methods, or\nhas been advised by any State or local entity authorized to conduct inspections\nor audits, that there exists a violation of law, regulation, or code with\nrespect to any shelter for adults, small-capacity shelter, or shelter for adult\nfamilies in which there are conditions that are dangerous, hazardous, imminently detrimental to life or health, or otherwise render the building not\nfit for human habitation, the office may take immediate emergency measures, including, but not limited to, one or more of the following: (1)\nissuing an order directing the facility\nto take immediate measures to rectify any deficiencies, violations, or\nconditions, requiring additional security, or directing the transfer of the\nfacility's residents to other temporary emergency housing; or\n(2)\ntemporarily suspending the facility's\noperating certificate or directing closure of the facility, subject to the\nnotice and expedited hearing process set forth in section\n493.8\nof this Title. (e) If the office, after\ninvestigation, finds that any person, agency or facility subject to this\nregulation is causing, engaging in or maintaining a condition or activity which\nconstitutes a danger to the physical or mental health of the residents of a\nfacility subject to the inspection and supervision of the office, and that it, therefore, appears to be prejudicial to the interests of such residents to\ndelay action for 30 days until an opportunity for a hearing can be provided in\naccordance with the provisions of this section, the office shall order the\nperson, agency or facility, by written notice setting forth the basis for such\nfinding, to discontinue such dangerous condition or activity or take certain\naction immediately or within a specified period of less than 30 days. The\noffice shall, within 30 days of issuance of the order, provide the person, agency or facility an opportunity to be heard and to present any proof that\nsuch condition or activity does not constitute a danger to the health of such\nresidents.
