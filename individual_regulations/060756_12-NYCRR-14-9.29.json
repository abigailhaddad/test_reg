  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 §§ 14-9.29 - Blowoff pipe and fittings\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nOn all boilers, except electric steam\nboilers having a normal water content not exceeding 100 gallons, and those used\nfor traction and/or portable purposes, when the allowable working pressure\nexceeds 100 psi, each bottom blowoff pipe shall have two slow-opening valves, or one quick-opening valve or cock at the boiler nozzle followed by a\nslow-opening valve. All valves shall comply with section\n14-9.28\n(b)(4) and\n(5)\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nBy \"slow-opening valve\" is meant one\nwhich requires at least five 360- degree turns of the operating mechanism to\nchange from full-closed to full-opening, and vice versa. (3)\n\nOn a boiler having multiple blowoff\npipes, a single master valve may be placed on the common blowoff pipe from the\nboiler, in which case only one valve on each individual blowoff is required. In\nthis case either the master valve or the individual valve or cocks must be of\nthe slow-opening type. (4)\n\nTwo\nindependent slow-opening valves, or a slow opening valve and a quick-opening\nvalve, or a cock may be combined in one body provided the combined fitting is\nthe equivalent of two independent slow-opening valves, or a slow-opening valve\nand a quick-opening valve or a cock so that the failure of one to operate could\nnot affect the operation of the other. (5)\n\nAll water walls and water screens which\ndo not drain back into the boiler and all integral economizers shall be\nequipped with drain or blowoff valves conforming with the requirements of\nsubdivisions (a) and (b) of this section and also of sections\n14-9.27\n(b) and\n14-9.28\n(a) of\nthis Subpart. (b) (1)\n\nThe bottom blowoff pipes of every\ntraction and/or portable boiler shall have at least one slow- or quick-opening\nblowoff valve or cock conforming to the requirements of ASME. (2)\n\nOnly one blowoff valve, which shall be of\na slow-opening type, is required on forced circulation and electric steam\nboilers having a normal water content not exceeding 100 gallons. (c) A bottom blowoff pipe when\nexposed to direct furnace heat shall be protected by firebrick, or other\nheat-resisting material, so arranged that the pipe may be inspected. (d) An opening in the boiler setting for a\nblowoff pipe shall be arranged to provide free expansion and\ncontraction. (e) Blowoff pipes\nshall be located so as to prevent scalding. (f) Bottom blowoff valves shall be tested\ndaily when the boiler is in operation. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§§\n14-9.29\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
