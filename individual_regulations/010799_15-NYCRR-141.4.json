  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 141.4 - Eligibility to deliver an adm course\n\nState Regulations\n(a) An accident prevention course may be\ndelivered by a sponsoring agency using an alternate delivery method that does\nnot require students to be present in a classroom. The commissioner may approve\nsuch method if it can be determined that the sponsor is capable of delivering\nthe course via an alternate method that includes testing and security measures\nthat are at least as secure as those present in the classroom course, as\nestablished in Part 138 of this Title. (b) General criteria. The department shall\nreview each application to assess the methodology, the sponsor's mastery of the\nADM, its internal controls and its overall ability to successfully deliver the\ncourse in a manner consistent with consumer service and the aims of the motor\nvehicle accident prevention course. Approval of one sponsor's ADM does not\nconstitute approval of the same delivery method by a different\nsponsor. (c) Applicants may apply\nimmediately upon the date this Part takes effect. No course will be approved\nuntil the completed application is received, reviewed by the department and a\ndetermination to approve it has been made. (d) An ADM course applicant must be an active\nsponsoring agency that had a classroom course approved by the commissioner\npursuant to article 12-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and Part 138 of this\n\nTitle prior to April 16, 2005. The commissioner may, in his or her discretion, approve ADM course applications that have received classroom course approval\nafter such date and such applications must meet the criteria set forth in\nsubdivision (g) of this section. (e) The commissioner may, in his or her\ndiscretion, require that sponsoring agencies continue to deliver their DMV\napproved classroom course throughout the duration of their approval to conduct\nan ADM course. (f) The department\nreserves the right to deny participation in the ADM pilot if adverse material\nis uncovered during the application review process which indicates that the\nsponsor is not of the high moral and financial character required to operate an\nADM course. (g) ADM course\napplicants that did not have a classroom course approved by the commissioner\nprior to April 16, 2005, must present proof satisfactory to the commissioner\nthat they purchased the ongoing concern and the approved course curricula of an\nexisting sponsoring agency or ADM sponsoring agency that remains in good\nstanding, or alternatively meet the following requirements: (1)\n\nThe course must be approved as a\nclassroom course pursuant to article 12-B of the Vehicle and Traffic Law and\nsuch course must have been in existence for a minimum of one year, with at\nleast 20 classes conducted, prior to applying for ADM course\napproval. (2)\n\nThe course may not be\ndelivered via the internet based course, but rather, must propose the use of\nother technologies or delivery methods approved by the commissioner. (3)\n\nOne or more identity and participation\nvalidation methods must be used by the course provider and be approved by the\ncommissioner. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
