(b) An analysis of\nalternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control\ntechniques which demonstrates that benefits of the proposed new or modified\nfacility significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a\nresult of its location, construction, or modification within New York\n\nState.

Upon issuance of the permit for the proposed\nnew or modified facility, the NYS ERC Registry will be amended to reflect that\nthe ERCs are committed as emission offsets to the proposed new or modified\nfacility; and\n(3)\nan air quality\nimpact evaluation in accordance with the provisions of section 231-5. 5(d) o f\nthis Subpart, Subpart 231-12 of this Part, and department approved modeling\nprocedures.
