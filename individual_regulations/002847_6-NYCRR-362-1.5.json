  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 362-1.5 - Design and operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\nA facility required to obtain a permit under this Subpart\nmust, in addition to the requirements identified in section\n360.19\nof this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the\nfollowing: (a) Combustors that treat\nmunicipal solid waste must include power generation equipment, such as steam\nturbines, or other energy recovery equipment which must be installed and must\nbe operated while the facility is in operation, except during routine\nmaintenance and unexpected downtime events. (b) Waste receipt and storage. (1)\n\nThe facility must only receive and treat\nwaste in accordance with the facility's approved waste control plan submitted\nin accordance with section\n360.16\n(c)(4)(i)\nof\nthis Title. The metal that is extracted subsequent to combustion is not\nconsidered to be a part of the facility's approved design capacity. (2)\nA minimum of one random inspection of a\nwaste delivery vehicle per operating day for unauthorized waste must be\nperformed. A daily log of these inspections must be maintained. (3)\n\nAll waste delivered to the facility must\nbe processed and contained within a completely enclosed structure. All waste\nstored must be contained within a completely enclosed structure or building\nthat provides a minimum of three days storage capacity. In no case can the\nwaste stored at the facility exceed the capacity of the waste storage bunker or\nthe department-approved storage area of the tipping floor. (4)\n\nExternal storage of putrescible waste is\nprohibited. Nonputrescible recyclables or oversized, bulky, or excluded waste\ncan be temporarily stored outside the facility in covered containers for a\nperiod not to exceed 10 calendar days. (5)\n\nExcept for facilities that process only\nnonputrescible waste, the waste storage area and tipping area must maintain a\nnegative air pressure, compared to atmospheric conditions, when the facility is\nin operation. (6)\n\nAll rejected, oversized, bulky, excluded, untreatable, or bypass waste that is not recyclable\nmust be disposed of at an authorized facility. (7)\n\nRadioactive waste detection procedures\nand requirements. A facility that accepts wastes other than source-separated\nrecyclables must meet the following requirements: (i) A fixed radiation detection unit must be\ninstalled and operated at a location appropriate for the monitoring of all\nincoming waste. (ii)\n\nThe\nconcentration of radium-226 in any waste treated at the facility cannot exceed\n25 pCi/g however waste which triggers the radiation detector can be accepted\nand evaluated according to the facility's waste control plan in order to\ndetermine whether or not the waste may be accepted at the facility. (iii)\n\nThe investigation alarm setpoint of the\nradiation detector must be set at least two times, but no greater than five\ntimes, site background radiation levels. (iv)\n\nBackground radiation readings at the\nfacility must be measured and recorded at least daily. (v) Field checks of the radiation detector\nutilizing a known radiation source must be performed and recorded at least\nweekly. (vi)\n\nThe radiation detector\nmust be calibrated at least annually or more often as recommended by the\nmanufacturer, and documentation describing the calibration must be maintained\nat the facility. (vii)\n\nEach\ninstance in which the radiation detector is triggered by a waste load must be\ndocumented and reported to the department within 24 hours. Recorded information\nmust include the date the waste was received, transporter name, origin of the\nwaste, truck number or other identifying marking, detector reading, disposition\nof the waste, and date of disposition. (8)\n\nSource-separated recyclables, source-separated household hazardous waste, source-separated electronic wastes, source-separated rechargeable batteries, source-separated mercury-containing\nproducts, and other source-separated items that are subject to legislatively\nenacted product stewardship programs in New York State must not be accepted for\ntreatment, except at facilities that are approved by the department to accept\nonly source-separated recyclables as feedstocks. Facilities must not accept\nsource-separated recyclables as feedstock unless, at the time of permitting, that feedstock has no recycling market as determined by the department. Viability of recycling markets will be evaluated at the time of each permit\nrenewal. (9)\n\nRegulated medical\nwaste or source-separated pharmaceutical waste can only be accepted if it is: (i) handled separately from other waste when\nreceived; (ii)\nunloaded directly\ninto the waste receiving pit; (iii)\nmanaged in a manner that ensures controlled substances are placed directly into\nthe combustor and not placed in the waste receiving pit with other\nwaste; (iv)\nhandled in a manner\nthat ensures the integrity of the containers until combustion; (v) combusted within a 24 hour-period; and\n(vi)\nidentified in the\nfacility's waste control plan. (c) Residue sampling and\nanalysis. (1)\n\nThe owner or operator of\nthe facility must separately test individual residue streams unless the residue\nstreams are combined for disposal. (2)\n\nToxicity characteristic testing\nrequirements. (i) Residue must be tested for\ntoxicity characteristic using the toxic characteristic leaching procedure found\nin\nEPA Method 1311 of Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods, as incorporated by reference in section\n360.3\nof this Title. Testing must\nbe performed by a laboratory that has an Environmental Laboratory Approval\n\nProgram (ELAP) certification from the New York State Department of Health. All\nresidue analyses used to comply with the requirements of this Subpart must be\ndone in accordance with \"EPA Method 1311 of Test Methods for Evaluating Solid\n\nWaste, Physical/Chemical Methods\" and must be performed without site specific\nchanges to these procedures. The details of the sample collection and\nanalytical parameters must be described in a site-specific sampling and\nanalysis plan as described in section\n362-1.4\n(c)(4)\nof\nthis Subpart. (ii)\n\nTesting must\nbegin within one month following the commencement of operation and must be\nconducted biannually. Tests must be conducted at least four, but no more than\neight, months apart.
