An applicant must live\nwithin the geographic area served by the local department in which they file an\napplication for food stamps. An otherwise eligible household cannot be required\nto reside in a permanent dwelling or have a fixed mailing address as a\ncondition of eligibility. (2)\n\nCitizens and eligible aliens. To be eligible to participate in the food stamp\nprogram, a person must be a citizen of the United States or be an eligible\nalien as set forth below. (i) Time-limited\neligibility for refugees and asylees. The following aliens are eligible for\nfood stamps until five years after the date: (a) the alien is admitted to the United\n\nStates as a refugee under section 207 of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct; (b) the alien is granted\nasylum under section 208 of the Immigration and Nationality Act; or\n(c) the alien's deportation is withheld under\nsection 243(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act. (ii)\n\nCertain permanent resident aliens. A\npermanent resident alien is eligible for food stamps if the alien: (a) is lawfully admitted to the United States\nfor permanent residence under the Immigration and Nationality Act; and\n(b) has worked 40 qualifying\nquarters of coverage as defined under title II of the Social Security Act or\ncan be credited with such qualifying quarters. In determining the number of\nqualifying quarters of coverage, an alien is credited with the following: (1)\nall qualifying quarters of coverage\nworked by the alien; (2)\nall\nqualifying quarters of coverage worked by a parent of such alien while the\nalien was under age 18; and\n(3)\nall\nqualifying quarters worked by the spouse of such alien during their marriage\nand the alien remains married to such spouse or such spouse is deceased; and\n\nFor purposes of clause (b) of this subparagraph, no\nqualifying quarters of coverage provided for in subclause (1) of this clause\nfor any period beginning after December 31, 1996 may be credited to an alien if\nsuch alien, for purposes of item (i) or the parents or spouse of such alien, for purposes of items (ii) and (iii) respectively, received any Federal\nmeans-tested public benefit during the period for which such qualifying quarter\nof coverage is credited. (iii)\n\nLawfully residing aliens who are\nveterans or are on active duty in the armed forces of the United States. An\nalien lawfully residing in this State is eligible for food stamps if the alien: (a) is a veteran with a discharge\ncharacterized as an honorable discharge and not on account of\nalienage; (b) is on active duty, other than duty for training, in the Armed Forces of the United States; or\n(c) is the spouse or unmarried\ndependent child of an individual described in clauses (a) and (b) of this\nsubparagraph. (iv)\n\nIneligibility under this paragraph does not apply until April 1, 1997 to an\nalien who was in receipt of food stamp benefits on August 22, 1996. (3)\n\nStudent. To be eligible, students must meet the requirements for student status as defined in section\n387.1\nof this Part. (4)\n\nEmployment registration. Household\nmembers, including migrant/seasonal laborers, must register for employment\nunless they are deemed to be exempt pursuant to section\n385.3\nof this Title. (5)\n\nSocial security numbers (SSN). All\nhouseholds applying for or participating in the food stamp program must provide\nthe social security number of each household member. When an individual does\nnot have an SSN, an application for one must be made. Where necessary, the\nlocal department must assist the household in obtaining an SSN. Failure to\napply for or provide an SSN shall result in the disqualification of that\nindividual from participation in the food stamp program. Applying for or\nproviding the SSN to the local department immediately brings the disqualified\nindividual into compliance with this requirement. (6)\n\nTransfer of resources. Households which\nhave transferred resources as defined in subdivision (b) of this section\nknowingly for the purpose of qualifying or attempting to qualify for food stamp\nbenefits shall be disqualified from participation in the food stamp program for\nup to one year from the date of the discovery of the transfer. This\ndisqualification period shall be applied if the resources are knowingly\ntransferred in the three-month period prior to application or after the\nhousehold is determined eligible for benefits. (i) Eligibility will not be affected by the\ntransfers of the following: (a) resources\nwhich would not otherwise affect eligibility; (b) resources sold or traded at or near fair\nmarket value; (c) resources which\nare transferred between members of the same household (including ineligible\naliens or disqualified persons whose resources are being considered available\nto the household); and\n(d) resources which are transferred for reasons other than qualifying or attempting\nto qualify for food stamp benefits. (ii)\n\nIf an applicant household knowingly\ntransferred resources for the purpose of qualifying or attempting to qualify\nfor food stamp benefits, the household shall be sent a notice of denial\nexplaining the reason for and length of the disqualification. The period of\ndisqualification shall begin in the month of application. If the household is\nparticipating in the food stamp program at the time of the discovery of the\ntransfer, a notice of adverse action explaining the reason for and length of\nthe disqualification shall be made effective with the first allotment to be\nissued after the notice of adverse action period has expired. (iii)\n\nThe length of the disqualification\nperiod shall be based on the amount by which nonexempt transferred resources, when added to other countable resources, exceeds the allowable resource limits. The following chart will be used to determine the period of disqualification: Amount in excess of the resource\nlimit\n\nPeriod of disqualification\n(months)\n$1 to 249.99\n1\n250 to 999.99\n3\n1,000 to 2,999.99\n6\n3,000 to 4,999.99\n9\n5,000 or more\n12\n(7)\n\nHousehold cooperation. (i) A household applying for food stamps must\ncooperate in the eligibility determination process. The eligibility\ndetermination process requires that the application form be completed and\nsigned, the household or its authorized representative be interviewed, and\ncertain information on the application be verified. (a) If a household refuses to cooperate in\ncompleting the eligibility determination process, the application must be\ndenied at the time of refusal. A household has refused to cooperate when the\nhousehold is able to cooperate, but clearly demonstrates that it will not take\nactions that it can take and that are required to complete the application\nprocess. The failure of a household to appear at a scheduled interview does not\nconstitute a refusal to cooperate unless the household has clearly refused to\nbe interviewed. If there is any question as to whether the household has merely\nfailed to cooperate, as opposed to refused to cooperate, the household's\napplication must not be denied. (b) A household's eligibility must be terminated if it refuses to cooperate with\nany subsequent review of its eligibility, including reviews generated by\nreported changes in circumstances and applications for\nrecertification. (c) A household\nwhose eligibility has been denied or terminated for refusal to cooperate may\nreapply for food stamps. Such household must not be determined eligible until\nit cooperates in completing the eligibility determination process. (ii)\nA household receiving SNAP\nbenefits or reapplying for SNAP must cooperate with any quality control review\nof its current or previous SNAP eligibility. A household refusing to cooperate\nin any quality control review must be determined ineligible to receive SNAP\nbenefits. (a) A household whose eligibility\nhas been terminated for refusal to cooperate with a quality control review may\nreapply for SNAP benefits. The household must not be determined eligible until\nit cooperates in the quality control review, except as set forth in clause (b)\nof this subparagraph. (b) A\nhousehold cannot be denied SNAP benefits for its refusal to cooperate in a\nquality control review if: (1)\nthe household\nwas terminated for refusing to cooperate with a quality control review during\nthe completed quality control review period; and\n(2)\nthe household reapplied for SNAP benefits\nmore than 125 days after the end of the annual review period, if it was\nterminated for refusal to cooperate with a State quality control review, or\nmore than nine months after the end of the annual review period, if it was\nterminated for refusal to cooperate with a federal quality control review; and\n(3)\nthe household provides\nverification of its eligibility for SNAP in accordance with section\n387.8\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (c) In the event\nthat one or more household members no longer reside with a household terminated\nfor refusal to cooperate, the penalty for refusal to cooperate will attach to\nthe household of the person(s) refusing to cooperate. (b) Resources. All\napplicants and recipients of food stamps must not exceed the resource limits\nset forth in this subdivision; however, households which are categorically\neligible for food stamps, as provided in section\n387.14\n(a) of this\n\nPart, are not subject to the resource limitations or any other requirements of\nthis subdivision. (1)\n\nLiquid and nonliquid\nresources of all members of the household cannot exceed $2,000 for the\nhousehold, except that, for households including a member or members age 60 or\nover, such resources cannot exceed $3,000. (i) Liquid resources are those resources\nwhich are readily available to the applicant or recipient including, but not\nlimited to the following: cash on hand, money in checking and savings accounts, savings certificates, stocks or bonds, lump sum payments as detailed in this\n\nPart, funds held (less the amount of penalty if any for early withdrawal), in\nindividual retirement accounts (IRA's) and funds held in Keogh plans which do\nnot involve the household member in a contractual relationship with individuals\nwho are not household members. In counting resources of a household with an IRA\nor Keogh plan (unless excluded pursuant to the provisions of subparagraph\n[3][ii] of this subdivision), the total cash value of the account or plan minus\nthe amount of the penalty (if any) that would be exacted for the early\nwithdrawal of the entire amount in the account or plan shall be\ncounted. (ii)\n\nNonliquid resources\ninclude personal property, licensed and unlicensed vehicles, buildings, land, recreational properties, and any other property not specifically excluded in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision. Nonexempt and nonliquid resources shall be\nvalued at the fair market value less encumbrances. Licensed vehicles shall be\ntreated in accordance with subparagraph (3)(iii) of this subdivision. (iii)\n\nThe resources of households containing\nsponsored aliens shall include that portion of the alien's sponsor and\nsponsor's spouse's resources that have been deemed available to the alien as\nprovided for in section\n387.10\n(b)(4)\nof\nthis Part. (iv)\n\nThe resources of\nineligible aliens, individuals disqualified due to intentional program\nviolations, individuals disqualified for failure to comply with a food stamp\nwork registration or work requirement as provided in section\n385.3\nof this Title and\nindividuals disqualified for failure to provide a social security number, as\nreferred to in the definition of household concept in section\n387.1\nof this Part, are counted in\nthe determination of the household's food stamp eligibility. (2)\n\nJointly owned resources. (i) Resources owned jointly by separate\nhouseholds shall be considered available in their entirety to each household, unless it can be demonstrated by the applicant household that such resources\nare inaccessible to that household. If the household can demonstrate that it\nhas access to only a portion of the resource, the value of only that portion of\nthe resource shall be counted toward the household's resource level. The\nresource shall be considered totally inaccessible to the household if: (a) the resource cannot practically be\nsubdivided; (b) the value of the\nresource is dependent upon the agreement of a joint owner to the liquidation of\nthe resource; and\n(c) the joint\nowner refuses to participate in the liquidation of the resource. (ii)\n\nResources shall be considered\ninaccessible to persons residing in shelters for battered women and children, as defined in this Part, if: (a) the\nresources are jointly owned by such persons and by members of their former\nhousehold; and\n(b) the shelter\nresident's access to the value of the resources is dependent on the agreement\nof a joint owner who still resides in the former household. (3)\n\nExclusion of\nresources. In determining the resources of a household, only the following\nshall be excluded: (i) The home and\nsurrounding property which is not separated from the home by intervening\nproperty owned by others. Public rights-of-way, such as roads which run through\nthe surrounding property and separate it from the home do not affect the\nexemption of the property. The home and surrounding property shall remain\nexempt when temporarily unoccupied for reasons of employment, training for\nfuture employment, illness, or uninhabitability caused by casualty or natural\ndisaster provided further that the household intends to return. Households that\ncurrently do not own a home, but own or are purchasing a lot on which they\nintend to build or are building a permanent home shall receive an exclusion for\nthe value of the lot and, if it is partially completed, for the home. (ii)\n\nHousehold goods, personal effects, including one burial plot per household member, and the cash value of life\ninsurance policies. The cash value of pension plans or funds shall be excluded, except that Keogh plans which involve no contractual relationship with\nindividuals who are not household members and individual retirement accounts\n(IRA's) shall not be excluded under this paragraph. (iii)\n(a) Licensed vehicles must have their entire value excluded when the vehicle meets\nany of the requirements set forth in subclauses (1) through (9) of this clause. However, when vehicles do not qualify for any of these exclusions, such\nvehicles must be valued according to the market value test as described in\nclauses (b), (c) and (d) of this subparagraph. The tests for exclusions are as\nfollows: (1)\nused primarily (over 50 percent\nof the time) for income-producing purposes; (2)\nannually producing income consistent with\nits fair market value, even if used only on a seasonal basis; (3)\nnecessary for long-distance travel, other\nthan daily commuting, if it is essential to the employment of a household\nmember or ineligible alien or disqualified person whose resources are being\nconsidered available to the household; (4)\nused as the household's home and is, therefore, excluded as such; (5)\nnecessary to transport a physically disabled household member or ineligible\nalien or disqualified person whose resources are being considered available to\nthe household regardless of the purpose of such transportation; (6)\nany vehicle operated on those Indian\nreservations that do not require vehicles driven by tribal members to be\nlicensed; (7)\nany vehicle leased by\na household member; (8)\nany vehicle\ntitle which is held by a non-household member so long as no member of the\nhousehold is permitted to access the cash value of the vehicle; or\n(9)\nany vehicle upon which a household\ndepends to carry fuel for heating or water for home use when such transported\nfuel or water is the primary source of fuel or water for the\nhousehold. (b) All\nlicensed vehicles not excluded under clause (a) of this subparagraph must be\nevaluated individually for their fair market value. That portion of the value\nwhich exceeds $4,600 through September 30, 1996, and $4,650 beginning October\n1, 1996 must be attributed in full toward the household's resource level, regardless of any encumbrances on the vehicle. (c) Licensed vehicles shall also be evaluated\nfor their equity value except for the following types of vehicles: (1)\nvehicles excluded under clause (a) of\nthis subparagraph; (2)\none general\npurpose licensed vehicle per household; (3)\nadditional licensed vehicles which are\nused by household members (or an ineligible alien or excluded individual whose\nresources are being considered available to the household) to attend training\nor education preparatory to employment, to travel to and from employment, or to\nseek employment in compliance with the job search requirements of the food\nstamp program. (d) In\nthe event a licensed vehicle is assigned both a fair market value in excess of\nthe amounts provided for in clause (b) of this subparagraph and an equity\nvalue, only the greater of the two amounts is to be counted as a\nresource. (iv)\n\nProperty\nwhich annually produces income consistent with its fair market value, even if\nonly used on a seasonal basis. Such property shall include rental houses and\nvacation homes. (v) Property, such\nas farm land and rental homes, or work-related equipment, such as the tools of\na tradesman or the machinery of a farmer, which is essential to the employment\nor self-employment of a household member, except that rental homes which are\nused by households for vacation purposes at some time during the year must be\ncounted as resources unless excluded by subparagraph (iv) of this paragraph. Property, such as land, equipment and supplies, which is essential to the\nself-employment of a household member engaged in farming must continue to be\nexcluded for one year from the date the household member terminates\nself-employment from farming. (vi)\n\nInstallment contracts for the sale of land or buildings if the contract or\nagreement is producing income consistent with its fair market value. The\nexclusion shall also apply to the value of the property sold under the\ninstallment contract, or held as security in exchange for a purchase price\nconsistent with the fair market value of that property. (vii)\n\nAny governmental payments which are\ndesignated for the restoration of a home damaged in a disaster, provided that\nthe household is subject to a legal sanction if the funds are not used as\nintended; for example, payments made by the Department of Housing and Urban\n\nDevelopment through the individual and family grant program or disaster loans\nor grants made by the Small Business Administration. (viii)\n\nResources having a cash value which is\nnot accessible to the household, such as but not limited to irrevocable trust\nfunds, security deposits on rental property or utilities, property in probate, and real property which the household is making a good-faith effort to sell at\na reasonable price. Any funds in a trust or transferred to a trust, and the\nincome produced by that trust to the extent it is not available to the\nhousehold, shall be considered inaccessible to the household if: (a) the trust arrangement is not likely to\ncease during the certification period and no household member has the power to\nrevoke the trust arrangement or change the name of the beneficiary during the\ncertification period; (b) the\ntrustee administering the funds is either: (1)\na court, or an institution, corporation, or organization which is not under the\ndirection or ownership of any household member; or\n(2)\nan individual appointed by the court who\nhas court-imposed limitations placed on his/her use of the funds; (c) the trust investments made on\nbehalf of the trust do not directly involve or assist any business or\ncorporation under the control, direction or influence of a household member; and\n(d) the funds held in\nirrevocable trust are either: (1)\nestablished\nfrom the household's own funds, if the trustee uses the funds solely to make\ninvestments on behalf of the trust or to pay the educational or medical\nexpenses of any person named by the household creating the trust; or\n(2)\nestablished from nonhousehold funds by a\nnonhousehold member. (ix)\n\nResources which have been counted as\nincome such as those of students or self- employed persons, which have been\nprorated as income. (x) Indian\nlands held jointly with the tribe, or land that can be sold only with the\napproval of the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Indian\n\nAffairs. (xi)\n\nResources which are\nexcluded for food stamp purposes by express provision of Federal\nstatute. (xii)\n\nWhere an exclusion\napplies because of use of a resource by or for a household member, the\nexclusion shall also apply when the resource is being used by or for an\nineligible alien or disqualified person whose resources are being counted as\npart of the household's resources.

(xvii)\n\nAny income tax refund made to a\nhousehold member or the member's spouse by reason of an earned income tax\ncredit, as authorized by the Internal Revenue Code, for the month of its\nreceipt and the month following the month of its receipt.

For\npurposes of this subparagraph, participation in the food stamp program is\nconsidered continuous when a household does not leave the program or\ntemporarily leaves the program for a period of one month or less. However, such\nhouseholds must continue to otherwise meet the income and resource criteria of\nthe food stamp program.
