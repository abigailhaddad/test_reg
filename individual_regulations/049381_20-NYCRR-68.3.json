(3)\n\nAt the time of application, an\napplicant must present positive proof of identification as prescribed in such\napplication. (4)\n\nNo fee is required\nto be submitted with the application. (b) An individual may submit an application\nto any office designated by the Department of Taxation and Finance for\naccepting such applications. An application will not be accepted prior to 30\ndays before the date for which the permit is requested to commence. (c) (1)\n\nUpon receipt, the Department of Taxation and Finance will evaluate and either\ndeny or approve each application for a special permit. Such an application may\nbe denied for a violation of any of the provisions of article 18 of the Tax Law\nor any rule or regulation adopted pursuant thereto. An application for a\nspecial permit may also be denied for failure to pay any tax imposed by or\npursuant to the Tax Law, or where an applicant has been convicted of a crime\nprovided for under such law or has been convicted under the laws of any other\ntaxing jurisdiction of a crime which, if committed in this State, would\nconstitute a similar crime under the Tax Law. A notice of denial may be given\nby registered or certified mail to the applicant at the address furnished in\nthe application. Such notice will outline the basis for denial and will contain\na statement that the denial may be protested through a hearing provided a\npetition therefor is filed within 90 days of the giving of the\nnotice. (2)\n\nUpon approval of the\napplication, the department will issue a special permit to the applicant. Such\npermit will set forth the applicant's name and address; the two-week period of\ntime for which such permit is valid; and any additional information or\nidentifying details as may be required by the department. The permit will also\nrequire purchase information to be completed with respect to each and every\npurchase by the applicant concerning the liquors imported. (d) (1)\nA\nspecial permit is valid for the two-week period set forth therein. A\ntwo-week period\nis that period of 14 consecutive days approved\nby the department. More than one special permit may be obtained during the\nyear; however, in no event may an individual import more than 360 liters of\nliquors into New York State in a one-year period without a full registration as\na distributor of liquors under section\n421\nof the Tax Law. (2)\nA special permit is also valid only with\nrespect to the individual to whom it was issued. (e) A special permit must accompany the\npermit holder importing the liquors into New York State and must be made\navailable for inspection by a peace officer, acting pursuant to such peace\nofficer's special duties, a police officer, any representative of the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance or any other person authorized by law to\ninquire into or investigate the importation of liquors into New York State. (Also, see section\n68.4\nof this Part for the manifest document requirement when transporting liquors\ninto or in New York State.)\n(f) (1)\n\nEvery individual to whom a special permit\nis issued must, on or before the 20th day after the date such permit expires, file with the Department of Taxation and Finance a tax return on a form\nprescribed by the department for such purpose and pay any alcoholic beverage\ntaxes due with the filing of such return. A return must be filed for every\nspecial permit issued by the department, even though no tax may be payable, and\nsuch permit must accompany the return. All of the provisions of article 18 of\nthe Tax Law relating to the filing of returns, the payment of tax and the\napplication of penalty and interest thereon and criminal penalties respecting\narticle 18 of the Tax Law shall apply to the return of tax and payment of tax\nrelating to the special permit. (2)\nA copy of the special permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this section\nand any records needed to verify the entries and accuracy of the return filed\nrelating to such permit must be retained for a period of three years, and upon\noral or written demand by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance must be made\navailable for use and inspection by the department. (3)\n\nSee, also, section\n531.6\nof this Title for rules concerning the filing of reports and payment of the\ncompensating use taxes imposed by and pursuant to articles 28 and 29 of the Tax\n\nLaw. The department may require that any compensating use taxes imposed on\nliquors imported into the State under the authority of a special permit be\nreported and paid in the same manner and at the same time as the alcoholic\nbeverage taxes. (g) (1)\nA special permit shall not be used to\ncircumvent the full registration requirements of a distributor of liquors as\nprovided for in section 421 of article 18 of the Tax Law or in violation of any\nother provisions of such article or of any rule or regulation promulgated\nthereunder. Such a use shall constitute grounds for denial, suspension or\nrevocation of a registration of a distributor of liquors (either full or\nabbreviated). In addition, such a use by the permit holder subjects the permit\nholder to the criminal penalties imposed pursuant to section 1813 of article 37\nof the Tax Law. (2)\nA special\npermit will not be issued in violation of section\n65-c\nof the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law\nto any individual under the age of 21 years. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
