Tit. 16 § 226.6 - Gas meters and accessories-test flow rates, out-test accuracy standards and test requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nGas meters and related accessories utilized by a utility\nshall conform to the following out-test accuracy standards and test\nrequirements at the specified flow rates. Only meters determined to be free of\nleaks and found upon test to comply with the following, where the test results\nare expressed to the nearest 0.1 percent proof, shall be labelled as out-tested\nand placed in service at a customer's premises: (a) Test flow rates. (1)\n\nThe check rate test for diaphragm, rotary\nand turbine meters is conducted at a flow rate not less than 10 percent nor\nmore than 40 percent of rated capacity. (2)\n\nThe open rate test is conducted at a flow\nrate as follows: (i) Diaphragm meters - not\nless than 80 percent nor more than 120 percent of rated capacity. (ii)\n\nRotary and turbine meters - not less\nthan 60 nor more than 100 percent of the rated capacity. (b) Out-test accuracy standards. (1)\n\nNontemperature compensating diaphragm, rotary and turbine gas meters. At the check and open rates, the percent proof\nshall be not less than 99.0 percent nor more than 101.0 percent. For diaphragm\nmeters the open rate test result shall not differ from the check rate result by\nmore than one percent. (2)\n\nTemperature compensating diaphragm, rotary and turbine gas meters. (i) Ambient temperature test. At the check\nand open rates, the percent proof shall be not less than 99.0 percent nor more\nthan 101.0 percent. For diaphragm meters the open rate test result shall not\ndiffer from the check rate result by more than one percent. (ii)\n\nAverage winter temperature test. At the\ncheck and open rates, the percent proof shall be not less than 99.0 percent nor\nmore than 102.0 percent. For diaphragm meters the open rate test result shall\nnot differ from the check rate result by more than one percent. (3)\n\nOrifice meters. The overall\ncumulative error of the metering system shall be not greater than +-1 percent\nthroughout its operating range. (4)\n\nMeters with correction devices. The percent proof, at test conditions, shall be\nnot less than 99.0 percent nor more than 101.0 percent. (c) Out-test requirements. (1)\n\nNontemperature compensating gas meters. (i) Each nontemperature compensating meter\nshall be out-tested prior to its installation. (ii)\n\nIn lieu of the test requirements in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, new nontemperature compensating meters may\nbe out-tested on an approved sampling basis by the utility if the\nmanufacturer's test equipment has been certified in accordance with section\n226.5\nof this Part and the\nmanufacturer has certified that each meter has been tested prior to\ndelivery. (2)\n\nTemperature compensating gas meters. (i) Each\ntemperature compensating meter shall be out-tested at both the ambient and\naverage winter temperature test conditions. (ii)\n\nIn lieu of the test requirements in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, new temperature compensating meters may be\nout-tested on an approved sampling basis at the ambient and average winter\ntemperature conditions by the utility, if the manufacturer's test equipment has\nbeen certified in accordance with section\n226.5\nof this Part and the\nmanufacturer has certified that each meter has been tested prior to\ndelivery. (iii)\n\nIn lieu of the test\nrequirements in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, temperature compensating\nmeters being returned to service after maintenance shall be out-tested at\nambient temperature conditions provided that a commission approved sample of\nsuch meters is also tested at the average winter temperature\nconditions. (3)\n\nCorrection devices. (i) Each correction device\nshall be tested and calibrated prior to installation at various pressures\nand/or temperature conditions representative of the device's range(s)\n(including the conditions expected to prevail at the sites where it may be\nplaced in service), or upon installation at the pressure and temperature\nconditions at the site. (ii)\n\nAfter\nbeing placed in service, the correction device shall be either monitored\nthrough a review of meter reading records at least once every six months to\ndetermine proper operation or be tested at least once every two years as set\nforth in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n226.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
