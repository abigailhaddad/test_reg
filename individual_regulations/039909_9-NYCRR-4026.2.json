  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4026.2 - Managing ownership\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Managing owner. No horse may race unless the entire management and control of\nits racing activities, and financial responsibility therefor, are held by a\nregistered managing owner registered with The Jockey Club. A managing owner may\nbe either an individual or a racing partnership, registered for such purpose\nwith The Jockey Club. A racing partnership may consist of only general\npartners, not to exceed four, each of whom shall own not less than a 25-percent\npartnership interest, and one of whom shall be designated as the managing\npartner under whose name or stable name the partnership's horses race, who is\nentitled to be credited with winnings on behalf of the partnership and who is\nresponsible for complying with the filing, registration and licensing\nrequirements of these rules. The managing owner of a horse shall be established\neither by registered ownership, registered written lease (or written notice\nthereof), or registered written designation as such, by the owner. The managing\nowner shall be responsible for all racing affairs of the horse, including the\nproper registration of the horse and its ownership, and all changes\nthereto. (b) Name of managing\nowner. The name of the programmed owner of a horse in a race shall be either\nthe name of the managing owner, if an individual, or, if a racing partnership, the name of the managing partner followed by the words as lessee or by\ndesignation, if either term applies. Should an individual register a stable\nname, such individual's real name may not be listed as managing owner. Nothing\nin these rules shall relieve any person of any statutory obligations related to\nbusiness filings and recordings with public officials, or rights or limitations\nincident thereto. (c) Managing\nowner by lease or designation. A managing owner established by ownership shall\nregister such ownership with The Jockey Club. A managing owner established by\nlease or designation shall register such lease or designation, executed by both\nthe lessor or designating owner and the managing owner, with The Jockey\n\nClub. (d) Licensing of managing\nowners. All individuals in the managing ownership of a horse must be licensed\nbefore such horse is entered or starts, unless for good cause the commission or\n\nState steward waives such requirement for a race. In no event, however, may a\nhorse start if the license of any individual in such horse's present or former\nmanaging ownership has been denied, suspended or revoked until such time as the\ncommission is satisfied that any withdrawal of such individual or transfer of\nsuch individual's entire interest is in good faith. (e) Coupled entries. Should the same\nindividual be present in the managing ownership of two or more horses in a\nrace, all such horses shall be coupled as an entry. (f) Credentials. Only managing owners of\nhorses to race at the meeting shall be entitled to track credentials as owners, including paddock and backstretch privileges. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
