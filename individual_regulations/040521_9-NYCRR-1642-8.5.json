  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1642-8.5 - Labor cost distribution\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. Exhibit 30 of Appendix S-8 indicates an analysis and distribution of\nlabor costs to the various cost and expense accounts as specified in the\naccount definitions. The account definitions, in general, place a much greater\nemphasis on the distribution of labor costs applicable to the 4000 group of\nexpense accounts than to the 1400 group of development cost accounts. The size\nand type of a local agency's operations may preclude adhering in detail to the\nmethods and procedures outlined herein. In such instance, the plan or method\nfollowed shall present, in substantially the same form, the analysis and\ndistribution of labor costs prescribed herein. (b) Payroll summary analysis. This form\n(Exhibit 30, Appendix S-8) serves as the basis for the distribution of the\ngross labor costs to the cost and expense accounts, and should be prepared at\nthe end of each payroll period. The information as to employee number, employee\nname, job title and gross payroll is obtained from columns (1), (2), (3) and\n(7) respectively, of the payroll form (Exhibit 29, Appendix S-8). The charges\nto cost or expense accounts shall be in accordance with the distribution\napproved in the budget for the applicable fiscal year. If the local agency is\nusing the Payroll Clearance account (1640), then it would be necessary to\ndistribute the payroll by means of a journal voucher as described in paragraph\n(5) of subdivision (c) of section\n1642-2.4. No financial statements\nshould be submitted to the division without the distribution of labor costs\nbeing reflected therein. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1642-8.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
