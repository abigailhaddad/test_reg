Hatch-loading systems must\ninclude a loading arm with a vapor collection system adapter, a vapor-tight\nseal between the adapter and hatch, and a method of preventing drainage of\nliquid gasoline from the loading arm when it is removed from the hatch or for\ncomplete drainage of the loading arm before such removal; (iii)\na vapor space connection on the\ngasoline transport vehicle equipped with vapor-tight fittings that\nautomatically and immediately close upon disconnection to prevent the release\nof gasoline vapors when loading is through means other than hatches; (iv)\na connecting device between the gasoline\ntransport vehicle and the dispensing equipment that interrupts the flow of\ngasoline to prevent overfilling and spillage; and\n(v) a system that prevents the flow of\ngasoline into gasoline transport vehicles unless the fuel product line and\nvapor collection system are both connected so as to prevent liquid product\nleaks or vapor loss; (4)\nthe design of any connecting devices required by this Part to control gasoline\nvapor emissions while loading gasoline transport vehicles at a gasoline bulk\nplant must be standardized to provide compatibility between different bulk\nplants and transport vehicles; or connecting adapters must be provided and\nused. The owner or operator of the gasoline bulk plant is responsible for\nensuring that the adapter is properly connected before dispensing gasoline. Connecting adapters must be adequate to ensure that the vapor collection system\nis vapor-tight. (d) Gasoline loading terminals. No person subject to this Part may load gasoline\ninto a gasoline transport vehicle from any gasoline loading terminal unless the\ngasoline loading terminal is equipped with gasoline vapor collection and vapor\ncontrol systems which are operating and in good working order and that satisfy\nthe following requirements: (1)\n\nThe gasoline\nvapor collection and control systems must capture gasoline vapors during\nloading and unloading of gasoline transport vehicles, and must condense, absorb, adsorb or combust the gasoline vapors so emissions do not exceed 0.67\npounds per 1,000 gallons of gasoline loaded or unloaded. Any equivalent control\nsystem is acceptable. Test methods to determine the level of gasoline vapors\nwhich are acceptable to the commissioner must be used to determine compliance\nwith this standard. Test methods described in Appendix A of 40 CFR part\n60\nare\nconsidered to be acceptable methods (see table 1, section\n200.9\nof this Title). (2)\nA vapor collection system required at a\ngasoline loading terminal consists of: (i) hatch-loading systems must include a loading arm with a vapor collection system\nadapter, a vapor-tight seal between the adapter and hatch, and a method of\npreventing drainage of liquid gasoline from the loading arm when it is removed\nfrom the hatch or for complete drainage of the loading arm before such\nremoval; (ii)\nbottom-loading\nsystems must include a connecting pipe or hose equipped with vapor-tight\nfittings that will automatically and immediately close upon disconnection to\nprevent the release of gasoline vapors; (iii)\na connecting device between the\ngasoline transport vehicle and the dispensing equipment that interrupts the\nflow of gasoline to prevent overfilling and spillage; and\n(iv)\na system that prevents the flow of\ngasoline into gasoline transport vehicles unless the fuel product line and\nvapor collection system are both connected so as to prevent liquid product\nleaks or vapor loss.

No\nperson may store volatile organic liquids in a tank subject to this Part\nunless: (1)\n\nFor a fixed roof storage tank, the tank is equipped with an internal floating roof with a liquid-mounted\nprimary seal and gasketed fittings, or equivalent control. Replacement of other\nthan liquid mounted seals is to be performed when the tank is cleaned and\ngas-freed for other purposes. (2)\n\nFor an external floating roof tank, the tank must be equipped with the control\nequipments as follows: (i) for external\nfloating roof storage tanks equipped with a mechanical shoe primary seal, the\ntank must be equipped with a rim-mounted secondary seal or equivalent\ncontrol; (ii)\nfor external roof\nstorage tanks equipped with vapor-mounted primary, the tank must be equipped\nwith a liquid-mounted primary seal and a rim-mounted secondary seal or\nequivalent control; (iii)\nfor\nexternal roof storage tanks equipped with liquid-mounted seals, the tank must\nbe equipped with a rim-mounted secondary seal or equivalent control when the\ntank is cleaned and degassed for other reasons; (iv)\nfor volatile organic liquid tanks with a\ncapacity greater than or equal to 10,000 gallons but less than 20,000 gallons, the tank must be equipped with submerged fill; and\n(v) for volatile organic liquid tanks with a\ncapacity of less than 10,000 gallons, the tank must be equipped with\nconservation vents.

(g) (1)\n\nThe commissioner may allow processes\nsubject to this Part to operate with a lesser degree of control than what is\nrequired provided that a process specific reasonably available control\ntechnology (RACT) demonstration has been made to the satisfaction of the\ncommissioner. Process specific RACT demonstrations must be submitted with the\napplication for a permit to construct, a certificate to operate, or renewal of\na certificate to operate for an existing source under the provisions of Part\n201 of this Title. Such process specific RACT demonstrations must be submitted\nto the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a revision to the State\n\nImplementation Plan and must address the technical and economic feasibility of: (i) utilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would achieve the degree of control\nrequired in subdivisions (a)-(f) of this section; (ii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nemission control technologies which would not achieve the degree of control\nrequired in subdivisions (a)-(f) of this section; and\n(iii)\nutilizing demonstrated and proven\nproduction modification methods which would result in real, documented, and\nenforceable reductions in the volatile organic compound emissions from the\nprocess. (2)\n\nFacilities\nwith processes subject to this Part with an annual potential to emit less than\nfive tons of volatile organic compounds will only be required to comply with\nsubparagraph (1)(i) and (1)(iii) of this subdivision in order to demonstrate\nthat a lesser degree of control is RACT for these processes. (h) The commissioner may allow\nsources which use natural gas fired afterburners as control devices for\nprocesses subject to this Part, to shut down these natural gas fired\nafterburners from November 1st through March 31st for the purposes of natural\ngas conservation, provided that the commissioner has determined that this\naction will not jeopardize air quality. Such evidence must be submitted with\nthe application for a permit to construct, a certificate to operate, or renewal\nof a certificate to operate for an existing source under the provisions of Part\n201 of this Title.
