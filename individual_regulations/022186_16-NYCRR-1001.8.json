  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 1001.8 - Exhibit 8: electric system production modeling\n\nState Regulations\n\nPrior to preparing this exhibit, the applicant shall\nconsult with DPS and DEC to develop an acceptable input data set, including\nmodeling for the applicant's proposed facility and inputs for the emissions\nanalysis, to be used in the simulation analyses. Exhibit 8 shall contain: (a) The following analyses that shall be\ndeveloped using GEMAPS, PROMOD or a similar computer-based modeling tool: (1)\nestimated statewide levels of\nSO\n2, NO\nx\nand\nCO\n2\nemissions, both with, and without the proposed\nfacility; (2)\nestimated minimum, maximum, and average annual spot prices representative of all NYISO zones\nwithin the New York control area, both with and without the proposed\nfacility; (3)\nan estimated capacity\nfactor for the facility; (4)\nestimated annual and monthly, on peak, shoulder and off-peak MW output\ncapability factors for the facility; (5)\nestimated average annual and monthly\nproduction output for the facility in MWhs; (6)\nan estimated production curve for the\nfacility over an average year; (7)\nan estimated production duration curve for the facility over an average year; and\n(8)\nestimated effects of the\nproposed facility on the energy dispatch of existing must-run resources, defined for this purpose as existing wind, hydroelectric and nuclear\nfacilities, as well as co-generation facilities to the extent they are\nobligated to output their available energy because of their steam\nhosts. (b) Digital\ncopies of all inputs used in the simulations required in subdivision (a) of\nthis section. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n1001.8\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
