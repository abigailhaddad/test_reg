  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4011.15 - Quinella\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The quinella is\na form of pari-mutuel wagering. Each bettor selects two horses to place first\nand second in the designated quinella race, the order of placing of the said\ntwo horses being immaterial. The quinella is not a parlay and this pool shall\nbe held entirely separate from all other pools, and is in no way a part of the\ndaily double, exacta, triple, superfecta, straight, place or show\npools. (b) [Reserved]\n(c) Races in which quinella pools are to be\nconducted shall be approved by the commission and shall be clearly designated\nin the racing program. Coupled entries and fields shall be allowed in quinella\nraces. (d) The design of quinella\ntickets shall be clearly and immediately distinguishable from other pari-mutuel\ntickets. (e) Scratch. If a horse is\nscratched or declared a nonstarter no further tickets may be issued designating\nsuch horse and all tickets previously issued designating such horse shall be\nrefunded and the money deducted from the gross pool. When such horse is part of\na coupled entry or field, the provisions of section\n4009.20\nof this Subchapter shall\ngovern. (f) Winning combination. The numbers of the first two horses as made official shall be the winning\ncombination regardless of their respective order of finish, except that where\nmore than one of such horses is part of a coupled entry or field with another\nof such horses, only the one best finisher of such horses shall be counted in\nthe winning combination for payoff, and the horse or horses not in such coupled\nentry or field finishing the same, or, if applicable, next finishing, shall be\nthe other part of the winning quinella combination. For example, if two horses\nin a coupled entry (or field): (1)\nfinish\nfirst and second, or in a dead heat for first, the winning combination will be\nthe number of such entry or field and the number of the third finishing horse\nnot part of such entry or field; (2)\nfinish first and in a dead heat for\nsecond, the winning combination will be the number of such entry or field and\nthe number of the other horse dead-heated for second who is not part of such\ncoupled entry or field; (3)\nfinish\nin a three-horse dead heat for win with another horse not part of such entry or\nfield, the winning combination will be the number of such entry and the number\nof the horse not part of such entry. (g) Failure to select a winning combination. If no ticket is sold on a winning combination in a quinella pool, the net pool\nshall be apportioned among those holding tickets designating the horse placing\nfirst with any other horse and those holding tickets designating the horse\nplacing second with any other horse, in the same manner in which a place pool\nis calculated. (h) Dead heat. In\ncase of a dead heat between two horses for the first place, that combination\nshall be the winner of the quinella pool. In cases of a dead heat for first\nplace involving more than two horses, the net pool shall be calculated and\ndistributed to holders of tickets combining any two dead-heated horses as in a\nwin pool dead heat. (i) In case of\na dead heat between two horses for second place, the pool shall be figured as a\n\" place pool,\" the holders of tickets combining the winning horse and one of\nthe two horses placing second participating in the payoff. (j) In case of a dead heat for second place\nand no tickets are sold on one of the two winning combinations, the entire net\npool shall be calculated as a win pool and distributed to those holding tickets\non the other winning combination. (k) If no tickets combine the winning horse\nwith either of the place horses in the dead heat, the pool shall be apportioned\namong those holding tickets designating the first place horse and any other\nhorse, and those holding tickets designating a second place horse with any\nother horse, as in a place pool in which a dead heat for place\noccurs. (l) If no ticket is sold\nthat would require distribution of a quinella pool to a winner as defined by\nthis section, the track shall make a complete and full refund of the quinella\npool. (m) In the event fewer than\nfour betting interests start, the quinella shall be declared off and the gross\npool refunded. (n) This section\nshall be prominently displayed throughout the betting area of each track\nconducting the quinella, and printed copies of this section shall be\ndistributed by the track to patrons upon request.
