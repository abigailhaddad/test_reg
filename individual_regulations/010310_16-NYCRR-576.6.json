  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 576.6 - Interpretation of lists of items\n\nState Regulations\n\nLists of items appearing in the texts of the accounts or\nelsewhere herein are for the purpose of more clearly indicating the application\nof the prescribed accounting. The lists are intended to be representative, but\nnot exhaustive. The appearance of an item in a list warrants inclusion of the\nitem in the account mentioned only when the text of the account also indicates\ninclusion, inasmuch as the same item frequently appears in more than one list. The proper entry in each instance must be determined by the texts of the\naccounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n576.6\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
