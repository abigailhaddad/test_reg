  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 940.2 - Definitions and conditions\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe several terms, words or phrases hereinafter mentioned\nshall be construed as follows: (a) Item No. In table I an item number is assigned to each\nspecifically designated waters or portions thereof. (b) Waters Index Number\nas\nappearing in table I shall mean that number or abbreviation which has been\nassigned to any specifically designated waters or portions thereof for the\npurpose of identification. (1)\n\nThe numbering\nor index system used to identify specific waters of New York State was adapted\nfrom that used by the New York State Conservation Department in its biological\nsurvey series of reports on watersheds of the State. The primary waters of a\ndrainage basin, such as rivers or large lakes are usually referred to by name\nor an abbreviation. Tributaries of primary waters are consecutively numbered\nprogressing upstream from the mouth. Ponds and lakes are numbered consecutively\nas they are encountered, such numbers being preceded by the letter P. Tributaries of such lakes and ponds are numbered consecutively as they enter, progressing clockwise around the lake or pond from its outlet or mouth. When\nisolated lakes and ponds are referenced by a waters index number, it is merely\nfor convenience of their identification and location within a subdrainage\nbasin, and it is not necessarily indicative of their being tributary to any\nwaters to which no surface connection is shown on the reference maps. (2)\n\nThis system was applied to the basin\nunder consideration by the Conservation Department in its biological survey of\nthe Hoosic River watershed and has been closely followed in connection with the\nidentification of the waters with the following exceptions: Some of the stream\nnumbers do not run consecutively due to the omission of streams originally\nshown on older maps employed by the Conservation Department at the time of its\nsurvey, but not shown on newer maps reproduced herein. Conversely, a few\nstreams not shown on the older maps but appearing on the newer maps are\ndesignated by the letters a, b, c, etc. (3)\n\nThe system as applied to the\nidentification of waters in the Hoosic River drainage basin may be illustrated\nas follows: Waters index\nnumber\n\nName\n\nExplanation\nH\nHudson River\n\nPrimary waters within New York State extending\nupstream from The Battery, New York City. H-264\n\nHoosic River\n\nThe 264th tributary entering the Hudson River in\n\nNew York State numbering consecutively upstream from the mouth at The\n\nBattery. H-264-4\n\nTomhannock Creek\n\nThe 4th tributary entering Hoosic River numbering\nupstream from the mouth. H-264-4-P 1095\n\nTomhannock Reservoir\n\nThe 1095th pond, lake or reservoir encountered in\nthe biological survey of the Upper Hudson River watershed, and specifically\nlocated in the drainage basin of Tomhannock Creek. H-264-4-P 1095-1\n\nOtter Creek\n\nThe 1st tributary entering the Tomhannock Reservoir\nnumbering clockwise from the mouth. (c) The abbreviations\ntrib., tribs., subtrib. and\nsubtribs. indicating tributary, tributaries, subtributary and subtributaries, respectively, shall mean any\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water which flows into any other\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water. Where no tributaries or\nsubtributaries are mentioned, the specifically designated waters shall include\nonly the stream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such\nwaters index number; where tributaries or subtributaries are mentioned after\nthe waters index number, the specifically designated waters shall include the\nstream, lake, pond or other body of surface water referenced by such waters\nindex number and all tributaries and subtributaries thereof, which are shown on\nthe reference maps, unless exceptions are expressly stated. (d) Name\nas appearing in\ntable I shall mean the name, if any, by which the specifically designated\nwaters are generally known and which may appear on the reference maps. In cases\nof specifically designated waters which have no name, the named tributary to\nwhich the unnamed waters are tributary is indicated as far as\npossible. (e) Description\nas appearing in table I shall mean a brief\nindication as to the location of the specifically designated waters. Entries\nmay include designations of segments or sections of waters to which a\nparticular assignment of a class and standards shall apply. Entries may also\ninclude any useful information pertinent to the classification and\nstandards. (f) Map Ref. No. as appearing in table I means map reference number and indicates\none or more of the following numbered maps reproduced herein completely, or in\npart, on which the specifically designated waters and their index numbers are\nshown. The following maps were produced from original maps which may be\nprocured through the Washington Distribution Section, Geological Survey. Map Ref. No. Name of\nquadrangle\n\nPublished by\n\nEdition\nH-25\n\nSchuylerville\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1947\nH-26SW\nCambridge\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nH-26SE\nShushan\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nJ-25\n\nCohoes\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1949\nJ-26SW\nGrafton\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nJ-26NW\nEagle Bridge\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nJ-26NE\nHoosick Falls\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nJ-26SE\nNorth Pownal\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1946\nK-26\n\nBerlin\nU.S. Geological Survey\n1898\n(g) Class\nas appearing in\ntable I, and denoted by the letters AA, A, B, C, D or AA-Special (AA-S)\nopposite each specifically designated waters, shall mean classes AA, A, B, C, D\nor AA-Special (AA-S) as the case may be, as set forth in Part 701, supra. (h) Standards\nas appearing in table I, and denoted by the letters\nAA, A, B, C, D or AA-Special (AA-S) opposite each specifically designated\nwaters shall mean the standards of quality and purity established for class AA, A, B, C, D or AA-Special (AA-S) as the case may be, as set forth in Part 703, supra. The symbol (T) appearing after any standard designation\nshall mean that the designated waters are trout waters and that the dissolved\noxygen specification for trout waters shall apply thereto. The symbol (TS)\nafter any standard designation shall mean that the designated waters are\nsuitable for trout spawning and that the dissolved oxygen specification for\ntrout spawning waters shall apply thereto. (i) The term\ntrout\nas used\nin this Part means any fish in the following genera: \"Coregonus\", \"Oncorhynchus\", \"Prosopium\", \"Salmo\", \"Salvelinus\" and \"Thymallus\". (j) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich appear as lines to indicate natural waters on the reference maps herein, and which are not specifically designated in table I, shall be assigned the\nsame classes and assigned standards as the specifically designated waters to\nwhich they are directly tributary. (k) All streams or other bodies of water\nwhich are not shown on the reference maps herein shall be assigned to class D, as set forth in Part 701, supra, except that any continuous\nflowing natural stream which is not shown on the reference maps shall have the\nsame classification and assigned standards as the waters to which it is\ndirectly tributary. (l) The Hoosic\n\nRiver drainage basin shall be deemed to include the following areas: All land\nand water areas, the natural surface water drainage from which is directly or\nindirectly tributary to the Hoosic River.
