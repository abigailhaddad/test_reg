Tit. 18 § 352.11 - Advance allowances\n\nState Regulations\n\nWhenever an advance allowance is authorized under this\n\nPart, such an allowance may be provided only where the recipient has made a\nrequest in writing for such an allowance, and has also requested in writing\nthat his or her monthly grant be reduced to recover such an allowance. The\nrecoupment must be 10 percent of the household's needs for family assistance\nand safety net assistance. However, where undue hardship is claimed and\nsubstantiated, the recoupment must not be less than five percent of the\nhousehold's needs. Such grant reduction must continue until such time as the\namount of the advance allowance is fully recouped. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
