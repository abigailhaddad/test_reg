  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 520.5 - Appeals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) (1)\n\nAn appeal under section\n130.15\nwill be\nacted upon by the authority next superior to the officer who imposed the\npunishment, if the person punished is still of the command of the officer who\nimposed the punishment at the time he appeals. If the punishment has been\nimposed under a delegation of a superior officer's power to impose non-judicial\npunishment, the appeal will be acted upon by the authority next superior to the\nofficer who delegated the power. If, however, at the time he appeals from the\npunishment, the person punished is no longer of the command of the person who\nimposed the punishment, the appeal shall be acted upon by the authority next\nsuperior to that present commanding officer of the offender who can impose the\nsame kind and amount of punishment as that imposed in the case or that\nresulting from any modification by other competent authority. The authority\n\"next superior\" to a particular commanding officer is the authority normally\nnext superior in the chain of command or such other authority as may be\ndesignated as being next superior for the purposes of section\n130.15\nby higher\nauthority. A superior authority who is a commanding officer exercising general\ncourt-martial jurisdiction or who is a general officer in command may delegate\nthose powers he has, as superior authority under section\n130.15\n(d), to a\ncommissioned officer of his command exercising the function of deputy or\nassistant commander. (2)\n\nOfficers\ndelegated the authority to impose certain types of non-judicial punishment\n(e.g., reductions), stand in the place of the delegating authority. Thus, the\nnext superior authority in such actions is that authority next superior to the\ndelegating authority, and his decision on the appeal is final. (3)\n\nAn unsuspended punishment imposed shall\nbe executed and not stayed, pending a decision on an appeal. (4)\n\nThe record shall not be forwarded from\nthe officer who imposed the punishment to the next superior authority until the\nelection of whether or not to appeal has been received (including returned\nunclaimed, addressee unknown, etc.) or the reply time has expired, whichever\ncomes first. (5)\n\nThe right to\nappeal is from the imposition of punishment whether on that date it was\nsuspended, unsuspended, mitigated, remitted or set aside. If the punishment is\nlater suspended, and the suspension is vacated, or if the punishment is later\nmitigated, remitted, or set aside, there is no right to appeal from such later\nactions. (6)\n\nOn appeals, the\nappellate authority may refer the record to the servicing JA for recommendation\nand review (DMNA form 1066 [Appendix L-2(A28)]). Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n520.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
