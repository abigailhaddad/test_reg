Tit. 1 § 111.16 - Refusal of certification privilege\n\nState Regulations\n(a) It is clearly recognized that in the\napplication of these procedures certain exceptional cases not clearly covered\nby the standards may arise. Any lot of seed may be rejected for certification\nif its quality in any respect not specifically covered by these standards is\nsuch that its value is not consistent with the purposes of seed\ncertification. (b) The\ncertification agency can withhold the privilege of tree seed certification from\nany person or group of persons for cause, if it deems this action to be in the\ninterest of maintaining the standards of seed certification. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1\n§\n111.16\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
