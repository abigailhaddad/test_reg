  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 482-2.4 - Annual fee and fee calculation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Fee. Each person subject to fees under this Subpart must submit an annual fee\nto the department. This fee is based on the facility's total annual emissions\nas described in section\n482-2.2\nof this Subpart. The fee\nper ton is assessed on emissions up to 7,000 tons annually of each regulated\nair contaminant. As of January 1, 2011, the fee per ton for 2011 is as follows: (1)\na fee of $45 per ton for facilities\nhaving total annual emissions less than 1,000 tons; (2)\na fee of $50 per ton for facilities\nhaving total annual emissions of 1,000 tons or more but less than 2,000\ntons; (3)\na fee of $55 per ton for\nfacilities having total annual emissions of 2,000 tons or more but less than\n5,000 tons; and\n(4)\na fee of $65\nper ton for facilities having total annual emissions of 5,000 tons or\nmore. (b) Fee\ncalculation. (1)\n\nThe department pursuant to\nsection\n72-0303\nof the Environmental\n\nConservation Law is required to calculate a fee by dividing the current State\nfiscal year appropriation for the operating permit program by the total tons of\nemissions of regulated air contaminants from sources subject to the operating\npermit program during the preceding calendar year, with consideration given to\nany surplus or deficit in the operating permit program account of the clean air\nfund established pursuant to section\n97-oo\nof\nthe State Finance Law, any loan repayment from the mobile source account of the\nsame clean air fund and the rate of collection of bills issued for the\nfee. (2)\n\nThe amount of each factor\nused in the fee calculation by the department for the current year is hereby\nestablished as follows: (i) the State fiscal\nyear 2011-12 appropriation for the operating permit program is\n$12,212,600; (ii)\nthe total tons of\nemissions of regulated air contaminants from sources subject to the operating\npermit program is 162,032 tons; (iii)\nas of March 31, 2011 the actual\noperating permit program account balance was negative $12,173,621. An\nadditional estimated $2,631,764 will be required to liquidate obligations made\npursuant to appropriations for fiscal years prior to 2011-12. The estimated\ndeficit of $14,805,385 will be applied towards the appropriation for State\nfiscal year 2011-12; (iv)\nthe loan\nrepayment from the mobile source account of the clean air fund is zero since no\nloan was made; (v) the collection\nrate of bills for the prior fiscal year is 98.26 percent. (3)\n\nThe calculation is as follows: ($12,212,600 - negative $14,805,385) / (162,032 x.9826)\n= $ 169.70\n\nHowever, as established in subdivision (a) of this\nsection, the fee assessed for 2011 is as follows: (i) $45 per ton for facilities having total\nannual emissions less than 1,000 tons; (ii)\n$50 per ton for facilities having total\nannual emissions of 1,000 tons or more but less than 2,000 tons; (iii)\n$55 per ton for facilities having total\nannual emissions of 2,000 tons or more but less than 5,000 tons; and\n(iv)\n$65 per ton for facilities having total\nannual emissions of 5,000 tons or more.
