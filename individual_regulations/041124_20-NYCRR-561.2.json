  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 561.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1101(b)(4)(ii), 1111(e)(6)\n(a) Automotive fuel. For the purpose of the prepaid sales tax on motor fuel, automotive fuel\nmeans motor fuel as defined in section 282.2\nof the Tax Law or diesel motor fuel as defined in section 282.14 of the Tax\n\nLaw. (1)\n(i) Motor fuel\nmeans\ngasoline, benzol or other product, except kerosene and crude oil, which is\nsuitable for use in the operation of any motor vehicle engine, but if kerosene\nor crude oil is compounded or mixed with any other product or products, and the\nresulting compound or mixture is suitable for use in the operation of any such\nmotor vehicle engine, such resulting compound or mixture in its entirety is\nmotor fuel. Motor fuel\nincludes, but is not limited to, gasoline, benzol, benzene, naphtha, ethanol, methanol, liquefied petroleum gas, compressed natural gas, propane gas, or any combination, or any other product, or combination of products which is suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine. (ii)\n\nHowever, any product that is not commonly or commercially known or sold as gasoline or a\nblend thereof, will not generally be considered to be suitable for use in the\noperation of a motor vehicle engine until one of the following, whichever is\nthe earliest, takes place. (a) The product is\ncompounded or otherwise mixed with any other product or products, the result of\nwhich is suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. Example 1: A sells gasoline, as well as other petroleum products that\nare used for industrial purposes. A also uses light naphtha and other\npetrochemicals for blending. Those additives, when compounded or otherwise\nmixed with gasoline, are motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine. A has produced additional motor fuel in this State. Consequently, A must be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay\nthe taxes imposed on such motor fuel. (b) The product is destined for use in the\noperation of a motor vehicle engine as is reasonably concluded from facts and\ncircumstances concerning such product. Example 2: B sells gasoline, gasohol and other motor fuels\nexclusively. B transports methanol to its motor fuel terminal in New York\n\nState. It can reasonably be concluded that such product is motor fuel suitable\nfor use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. B is deemed to have\nproduced motor fuel in this State because B established the methanol as motor\nfuel. Consequently, B must be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and\npay the taxes imposed on such motor fuel. (c) The product is specifically designated as\na fuel suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle engine. Example 3: C sells a variety of denatured alcohols, including\nanhydrous ethyl alcohol. These products are primarily used by C's customers as\nsolvents and reagents. C also sells a portion of the anhydrous ethyl alcohol as\nethanol fuel. Such product is motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a\nmotor vehicle engine when the specific designation is made. C is deemed to have\nproduced motor fuel in this State because C established the ethyl alcohol as\nmotor fuel on the sale thereof as motor fuel. Consequently, C must be\nregistered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay the taxes imposed on such\nmotor fuel. (d) The product\nis pumped into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle for use in the operation\nthereof on the public highways of New York State or is pumped into the fuel\ntank of a pleasure or recreational motor boat for use in the operation thereof\non the waterways of New York State, including any waterways bordering on the\n\nState. Example 4: D sells compressed natural gas for heating purposes. In\naddition, D sells such product to persons operating motor vehicles that have\nbeen specially adapted to operate on compressed natural gas. Such compressed\nnatural gas is motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of a motor vehicle\nengine when it is pumped into the fuel tank of a motor vehicle for use in the\noperation of the vehicle. D is deemed to have produced motor fuel in this State\nbecause D established the compressed natural gas as motor fuel. Consequently, D\nmust be registered under article 12-A of the Tax Law and pay the taxes imposed\non such motor fuel. (iii)\n\nMotor fuel that is suitable for use in\nthe operation of an engine of the diesel type is\ndiesel motor\nfuel\nas defined in paragraph (2) of this subdivision, and as such is\nsubject to the prepaid tax as diesel motor fuel pursuant to section\n1102 (a)(2)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (2)\n\nDiesel\nmotor fuel\nmeans kerosene, crude oil, fuel oil or other middle\ndistillate and also motor fuel suitable for use in the operation of an engine\nof the diesel type, excluding, however, any product specifically designated\n\"No. 4 Diesel fuel\" and not suitable as a fuel used in the operation of a motor\nvehicle engine. (See section\n430.1\n[b]\nof this Title for specifications as to what constitutes No. 4 Diesel fuel not\nsuitable as a fuel in such operation.)\n(3)\n\nFor the purposes of this Part, motor vehicle, as used in defining motor fuel, means any\nvehicle propelled by any power other than muscular, except boats (not including\npleasure craft), road-building machinery, power shovels, tractor cranes, tractors used exclusively for agricultural purposes, and such vehicles as are\nrun only on rails or tracks. (4)\n\nKero-jet fuel\nmeans a quality, highly refined kerosene product\nor derivative thereof, which meets kerosene-type jet fuel specifications and\nwhich is primarily used for commercial turbojet and turboprop aircraft\nengines. (b) Use. For the purpose of the imposition of the section 1102\nprepaid sales tax, the term\nuse\nshall mean the exercise of any\nright or power over motor fuel by any person, whether or not a purchaser, including but not limited to the receiving, storage or any keeping or retention\nfor any length of time, withdrawal from storage or any consumption of such\nmotor fuel. (c) Imports or causes to be imported. (1)\nA\nperson imports motor fuel or causes it to be imported into this State: (i) if such person has ownership of motor\nfuel at the time the fuel enters New York State's jurisdiction or at any time\nthereafter up to and including the off-loading of such fuel; (ii)\nif such person directs or controls the\nimportation of motor fuel into New York State; or\n(iii)\nif such person purchases motor fuel\nlocated outside New York State for delivery into New York State from a seller\nwho is not a registered distributor in New York State under article 12-A of the\n\nTax Law. Thus, more than one party in any particular importation\ntransaction may have imported motor fuel or caused it to be imported. The act\nof importation encompasses the acts of all the parties to any New York sales\ncommencing with the bringing of motor fuel into New York State and continuing\nto the off-loading of such fuel at or into any terminal, facility or land-sited\nrepository for use, distribution, storage or sale in this State. Accordingly, all persons who have ownership of motor fuel from the time it enters New York\n\nState's jurisdiction to the time it is off-loaded into a terminal, facility or\nland-sited repository for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State have\ncaused such motor fuel to be imported into this State. Ownership of motor fuel\nis evidenced by such factors as title, possession, control and/or risk of loss. The absence of title will not necessarily preclude ownership of motor fuel, and\npossession, control and risk of loss are given great significance in\ndetermining ownership. Unless the circumstances of the transaction clearly\nindicate otherwise, ownership vests in the buyer when the seller completes his\nperformance under the sales contract with respect to the physical delivery of\nthe motor fuel. (2)\n\nRegardless of the indications of\nownership discussed above, if the circumstances of an importation transaction\nindicate that a person or persons, other than the person indicated as the\nowner, is directing or controlling the importation of motor fuel, such person\nor persons directing or controlling the importation is importing motor fuel or\ncausing it to be imported into New York State. Factors indicating that a person\ndirects and controls an importation transaction include: (i) placement of the order with the\nout-of-state supplier for the motor fuel which is the subject of the\nimportation transaction; (ii)\narranging for the transportation of the motor fuel; (iii)\nfinancing or paying for the purchase\nand/or the transportation of the motor fuel; (iv)\nfinancing the direct parties to the\ntransaction and/or conducting their business activities; and\n(v) that transactions between the parties are\nnot conducted at arm's length. Example 1: Ownership. A contracts with B, a New York registered\ndistributor under article 12-A, for the purchase of motor fuel located outside\nthe State. A and B agree that B will deliver the motor fuel to A's terminal in\n\nNew York. B ships the motor fuel by common carrier C to A's terminal. B has\nimported motor fuel or caused motor fuel to be imported into this State. Although C transports the motor fuel into New York, it does so only as a common\ncarrier. Example 2: Ownership. D contracts with E, a New York registered\ndistributor under article 12-A, for the purchase of motor fuel located outside\nthe State. D and E agree that D will take delivery of the motor fuel at E's\nterminal outside the State. D arranges for the transportation from E's premises\nto its New York terminal. D has imported motor fuel or caused motor fuel to be\nimported into New York State. Example 3: Directing and controlling the importation. F incorporates a\nwholly owned subsidiary, G. G has only nominal assets and no employees; its\nactivities are conducted by the officers and employees of F. G purchases motor\nfuel from an out-of-state supplier and takes delivery of the fuel at the\nsupplier's out-of-state terminal. G delivers the fuel to F's terminal in New\n\nYork. F, as well as G, has imported motor fuel or caused it to be imported New\n\nYork, whether or not F has directly issued payment for the fuel and/or\ntransportation. Example 4: Unregistered out-of-state supplier. H contracts with J, who\nis not a New York registered distributor under article 12-A, for the purchase\nof motor fuel located outside the State. H and J agree that J will deliver the\nmotor fuel to H's terminal in New York. J ships the motor fuel by common\ncarrier to H's terminal. H, as well as J, has imported motor fuel or caused\nmotor fuel to be imported because H has purchased motor fuel located outside\nthe State for delivery into the State from a seller who is not a New York\nregistered distributor. (3)\n\nFor the purposes of the prepaid sales tax\nimposed by section\n1102\nof the Tax Law and the excise taxes on\nmotor fuel imposed by article 12-A of such law, New York State's jurisdiction\nincludes New York's territorial waters. When sales or transfers of motor fuel\noccur when such motor fuel is on New York territorial waters prior to its being\noff-loaded into a New York land-sited facility, all the parties to all such\nsales or transfers have caused the motor fuel to be imported into New York for\nuse, distribution, storage or sale in this State. Additionally, if the party\nowning the motor fuel at the time off-loading into a New York land-sited\nfacility commences is not registered as a distributor under article 12-A of the\n\nTax Law, the party owning the motor fuel immediately after its off-loading\nshall also have caused the motor fuel to be imported into New York. The owner\nof motor fuel at the time that off-loading is commenced at or into any\nterminal, facility or any other land-sited repository is responsible for\npayment of the taxes with respect to such motor fuel, and, in determining the\namount of the tax, the motor fuel is to be measured by the amount of motor fuel\nwhich is off-loaded into the terminal, facility or other land-sited repository. Persons owning motor fuel prior to the person owning it at the time off-loading\nis commenced are not liable for the tax. If, however, the owner of the motor\nfuel at the time that off-loading is commenced is not registered as a\ndistributor under article 12-A of the Tax Law, then the owner of the motor fuel\nimmediately after it is off-loaded is jointly and severally liable for payment\nof the tax (see section\n561.3\nof\nthis Part). In no event shall the tax be collected more than once with respect\nto the particular importation of motor fuel. (4)\n\nMotor fuel brought into the State in the\nordinary fuel tank connected with the engine of a motor vehicle, airplane, motorboat or other conveyance propelled by the use of motor fuel, and to be\nused only in the operation thereof, shall not be deemed imported within the\nmeaning of this definition, if not removed from such tank except as used in the\npropulsion of such engine. (d) Distributor. For the purposes of this Part, in general, the term\ndistributor\nas the same meaning as it has for purposes of the\nmotor fuel taxes imposed by and pursuant to the authority of article 12-A of\nthe Tax Law. Where the tangible personal property being sold is motor fuel, a\ndistributor\nmeans: (1)\n(i) Any person importing or causing to be\nimported motor fuel from without the State for use, distribution, storage or\nsale within the State, or who produces, refines, manufactures or compounds any\nmotor fuel within the State. (ii)\n\nAny person who or which imports or causes to be imported from without the State\nany motor fuel for use, distribution, storage or sale, even though such person\nis a retailer selling to customers for their consumption only. (iii)\n\nAny person who or which imports or\ncauses to be imported motor fuel from without the State for use, distribution, storage or sale within the State, even though such person is a consumer as\ndistinguished from a dealer in motor fuel. (2)\n\nAny person registered as a distributor of\nmotor fuel under article 12-A of the Tax Law for the purposes of the taxes\nimposed upon motor fuel by or pursuant to the authority of article 12-A is also\na distributor for purposes of the prepaid tax imposed by section 1102 of\narticle 28 of the Tax Law. (3)\nA\nperson shall not be a distributor for the purposes of the prepaid tax imposed\nby section\n1102\nof the Tax Law because such person is\na distributor solely of diesel motor fuel. (e) Filling station. The term\nfilling station\nmeans any place, location or station where automotive fuel is stored primarily for sale by\ndelivery directly into the ordinary fuel tank connected with the engine of a\nmotor vehicle to be consumed in the operation of such motor\nvehicle. (f) Owner of\na filling station. The term\nowner of a filling station\nmeans\nthe owner, lessee or operator of a filling station. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
