  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 541.1 - General\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1101(b)(4); 1105(c)(2), (3), (5); 1115(a) (15), (16); 1119 (c)\n(a) (1)\n\nThis Part summarizes the principal\nprovisions of the State and local sales and compensating use taxes as applied\nto contractors, subcontractors and repairmen. (2)\n\nHowever, the provisions of this Part are\nnot meant to supersede any tax imposed or exemption allowed by article 28 or\npursuant to the authority of article 29 of the Tax Law or those provisions of\nthe sales and use taxes more particularly described in other parts of this\n\nTitle. In particular, this Part does not address the amounts of tax to be\ncollected at the combined State and local rates. (b) The principal distinguishing feature of a\nsale to a contractor, as compared to a sale to other vendors who purchase\ntangible personal property for resale, is that the sale of tangible personal\nproperty to a contractor for use or consumption in construction is a retail\nsale and subject to sales and use tax, regardless of whether tangible personal\nproperty is to be resold as such or incorporated into real property as a\ncapital improvement or repair. Whenever a contractor uses materials, on which\nthe contractor has paid sales tax, in a repair or maintenance contract (except\ninterior cleaning and maintenance contracts of 30 days or more) subject to the\nsales tax on services under section\n1105 (c)\nof the Tax Law, the contractor may be entitled to a refund or credit of the portion of the tax\nhe paid attributable to the materials transferred to the customer. Cross-reference: For refund or credit, see section\n534.5\nof this Title. (c) Receipts\nfrom the performance of a capital improvement to real property by a contractor\nare not subject to the sales tax. Cross-reference: For additional information on capital improvements and\nrepairs see section\n527.7\nof this Title. (d) Receipts\nfrom the services of repairing, maintaining or servicing of real property\n(except the interior cleaning and maintenance contracts of 30 days or more\ndescribed in section\n527.7\n[c][3]\nof this Title) and tangible personal property, and the receipts from the\ninstallation of tangible personal property that remains tangible personal\nproperty are subject to the New York State and local sales tax unless otherwise\nexempt. (e) Tangible personal\nproperty purchased by a contractor that is to become an integral component part\nof real property owned by an organization described in section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax Law is\nexempt from the New York State and local sales tax. (For contracts with exempt\norganizations, see section\n541.3\nof this Part.)\n(f) Corrective work\nreceives the same tax treatment as the original work to which the corrective\nwork relates. Thus, for example, if the original contract was a capital\nimprovement and the contractor is required to repair windows broken in\ninstallation to make the work acceptable to a customer, the repair is\nconsidered a part of the original capital improvement contract. (g) Guarantee and warranty work. (1)\n\nPayments by a contractor to another\ncontractor to perform maintenance, service and repair of real and tangible\npersonal property when purchased to fulfill a guarantee or warranty are not\nsubject to tax. (2)\n\nWhere a\ncontractor services real or tangible personal property and a charge is made to\nthe customer, the charge is subject to the tax even though some of the work is\nperformed partially under a guarantee or warranty. (3)\n(i) The\ncontractor is not entitled to a refund or credit of the tax paid on the\npurchase of tangible personal property used in guarantee or warranty work in\nthe performance of a capital improvement. (ii)\n\nIf the guarantee or warranty work is on\na repair to real property, tangible personal property or tangible personal\nproperty that remains tangible personal property after installation, a refund\nor credit may be claimed by the contractor for the tax paid on the materials\nand parts transferred to the customer, whether or not a charge is made to the\ncustomer for the guarantee or warranty work, providing the claim is timely\nsubmitted as set forth in Part 534 of this Title. However, if any charge is\nmade to the customer, the charge is subject to tax. (h) A contractor purchasing an\nexisting business, or any portion of a business, or its assets, from a person\nrequired to collect tax is subject to the bulk sales provisions of the Tax Law. See Part 537 of this Title for complete information on bulk sales.
