  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 1205.3 - Powers and duties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Regional\n\nBoard of Review. (1)\n\nVariances. Each regional\nboard of review shall have the power to vary or modify, in whole or in part, any provision or requirement of the Uniform Code in cases where strict\ncompliance with such provision or requirement would entail practical\ndifficulties or unnecessary hardship or would otherwise be unwarranted. Any\nsuch variance or modification shall not substantially adversely affect\nprovisions for health, safety, and security; and equally safe and proper\nalternatives may be prescribed. When deciding whether to approve a variance or\nmodification, the board of review shall have the authority to fashion suitable\nadditional mitigating requirements as a condition to granting the variance or\nmodification, so as to protect the building occupants from the hazards of fire\nand inadequate building construction. The party seeking the variance or\nmodification shall show by the weight of the evidence that, in the particular\ncase before the board of review, strict compliance with the particular\nprovision or requirement: (i) would create an\nexcessive and unreasonable economic burden; (ii)\nwould not achieve the Uniform Code's\nintended objective; (iii)\nwould\ninhibit achievement of some other important public policy; (iv)\nwould be physically or legally\nimpracticable; (v) would be\nunnecessary either in light of alternatives which ensure the achievement of the\n\nUniform Code's intended objective or in light of alternatives which, without a\nloss in the level of safety, achieve the Uniform Code's intended objective more\nefficiently, effectively, or economically; or\n(vi)\nwould entail a change so slight as to\nproduce a negligible additional benefit consonant with the purposes of the\n\nUniform Code. (2)\n\nAppeals. Each regional board of review shall have the power to hear and decide\nappeals. An appeal may be of any order or determination, relating directly to\nthe provisions of the Uniform Code, of an administrative official authorized to\nenforce the Uniform Code, or the failure of an administrative official to make\nsuch an order or determination within a reasonable amount of time. The board of\nreview may fashion suitable remedies so as to do justice among the parties, including but not limited to: (i) where an\norder or determination has been made, sustaining, reversing, or modifying, in\nwhole or in part, such order or determination; and\n(ii)\nwhere an order or determination has not\nbeen made within a reasonable time, making any such order or determination or\ndirecting that any orders, determinations, permits, or authorizations be\nissued. (b) Department of State. The department shall have the sole discretion to determine\nwhether a petition for a variance shall be a routine case, an alternative\ncompliance case, or referred to a board of review. At the department's\ndiscretion, in making this determination the department may coordinate with the\npetitioner, the authority having jurisdiction, and any known interested\nparties. (c) Secretary of State. The secretary shall have the power and authority to evaluate and make\ndeterminations on petitions for routine cases and alternative compliance cases, in accordance with section\n1205.5\nof this Part.
