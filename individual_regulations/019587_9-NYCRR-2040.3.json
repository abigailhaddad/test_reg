  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 2040.3 - DHCR allocation process\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Funding\nrounds. The division will publish at least annually in the\n\nState Register\na notice of credit availability which informs\napplicants of submission dates and deadlines for the next funding round. (b) Documentation. Applicants requesting an allocation of credit\nmust submit an application in a form approved by DHCR. The division may request\nany and all information it deems necessary for project evaluation. If any\nsubmission or documentation is insufficient to complete any evaluation of the\nproposed project, processing will be terminated. DHCR will not request or\naccept updated information related to incomplete or insufficient exhibits or\nattachments used primarily for establishing eligibility or scoring and rating\nan application. (c) Processing fees. The division shall charge an application fee\nof $3,000, due at the time of application. The division shall charge a fee of\n$1,000 if a binding agreement or similar document is requested. A credit\nallocation fee of eight percent of the first year credit allocation amount is\ndue at the time of request for the issuance of carryover allocation. Non-profit, Minority-Owned Business Enterprise, Women-Owned Business Enterprise\nor Certified Service-Disabled Veteran Owned Business Enterprise applicants (or\ntheir wholly-owned subsidiaries) which will be the sole general partner or\npartners of the partnership/project owner or sole managing member or members of\nthe limited liability company/project owner may request and be approved to\ndefer payment of processing fees until the time of carryover\nallocation. (d) Credit\nallocation process. Only applications submitted by a published\ndeadline will be evaluated for an allocation. Applications will be reviewed for\ncompleteness, threshold eligibility, scoring, project feasibility, site\nsuitability, consistency with the division's underwriting standards, and\nwhether a proposed project advances the State's housing goals and objectives, including any goals set forth by the Regional Economic Development Council\nstrategic plan applicable to the area in which the project is located. The\ndivision expects to notify applicants within 150 days from the application\ndeadline on allocation decisions. The process the division employs for\nallocating credit entails the following: (1)\n\nCredit reservation or binding agreement. The division will determine, in its\nsole discretion, whether to provide the applicant with a credit reservation\nand/ or binding agreement or similar document based upon the readiness of the\nproject and the availability of credit. (i) Credit reservations will contain deadlines for: closing on construction\nfinancing in an amount sufficient to complete the project; attainment of\ncommitments for permanent financing in an amount sufficient to complete the\nproject; construction start; the timeframe for the project owner to incur more\nthan 10 percent of the reasonably expected basis in the project; and submission\nof documents necessary for the issuance of an allocation of credit. (ii)\n\nApplicants, after meeting the conditions\nof the credit reservation, may request a binding agreement, or similar\ndocument, if the applicant has obtained commitments from all sources of\nconstruction and permanent financing and has obtained all necessary local\napprovals. Generally, a binding agreement or similar document will be issued to\nan applicant qualifying for a credit reservation to facilitate a project's\nattainment of construction and/or permanent financing. (iii)\n\nIf the applicant does not comply with\nthe deadlines contained in the credit reservation or binding agreement, or\nsimilar document, the division may revoke the reservation or binding agreement, or similar document, and require the applicant to re-apply for\ncredits. (2)\n\nCarryover\nallocation. Carryover allocations issued by the division will contain any\nspecial conditions and specific performance standards. A carryover allocation\nmay be issued if the division determines that an applicant has met the\nrequirements contained in the credit reservation and has submitted the proper\ncertification that more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected basis in the\nproject has been incurred by the project owner or that the referenced\ncertification is expected to be submitted in a timeframe consistent with the\n\nCode. In making a determination to issue a carryover allocation the division\nwill consider the project's status with respect to environmental assessments, local reviews and financial commitments. The issuance of a carryover allocation\nby the division shall not impose upon the applicant more restrictive\nperformance deadlines than those specified in the credit reservation. (3)\n\nFinal credit allocation. All projects\nwhich receive a credit reservation, binding agreement or similar document\nand/or carryover allocation from the division, enter service and submit\nnecessary documentation will be evaluated for the final time prior to the final\ncredit allocation. The division may request additional information/documents to\ncomplete the evaluation of the project. Prior to the final credit allocation, the owner and the division shall execute a regulatory agreement. (4)\n\nWaiting list. Any complete application\nwhich meets the threshold eligibility review criteria but is not selected for a\ncredit reservation may be placed on a waiting list, at the division's\ndiscretion, which will be in effect until the next funding round, at which time\nthe waiting list will be terminated. Applicants on the waiting list will remain\neligible to be selected for a credit reservation if the division determines\nthere is sufficient availability of credits. (5)\n\nOther notifications. If an application is\nfound to be incomplete, ineligible, or not feasible the applicant will be\nnotified and no further action will be taken on the application. At any stage\nin the credit allocation process, the applicant must notify DHCR immediately of\nany proposed material changes to the project including but not limited to, changes in the project scope, ownership structure, development team, financing, budget, design features, and changes affecting threshold eligibility review\ncriteria and scoring and ranking criteria, tenant population, household income\nlevels served and any other significant factors. All proposed material changes\nare subject to DHCR's approval. (e) Threshold eligibility review\ncriteria. At each stage of processing (\ni.e., application, reservation, binding agreement or allocation) applications will be\nsubject to a threshold eligibility review, which will include, but not\nnecessarily be limited to, whether the project meets the following minimum\nrequirements as well as requirements described in a notice of credit\navailability, request for proposals, design requirements manual, capital\nprograms manual or other manual or document issued by the Division: (1)\n\nThe project meets the occupancy, rent\nrestrictions and any other requirements of the C ode.

(g) Determination of the amount for credit allocation. (1)\n(i) Evaluation of project. All projects considered for an allocation of credit\nshall be evaluated pursuant to the Code at the following times: at application; at allocation; and after the building is placed in service. The division will\nconsider the project ranking, analyze operating economics, financing and\ndevelopment cost for reasonableness and determine the amount of credit\nnecessary for the financial feasibility of the project and its viability as a\nqualified low-income housing project. The division will require that the\noperating economics of the project be fiscally sound and in compliance with\nLIHTC regulatory requirements; and, that all project costs, including\ndeveloper's fee, are necessary and reasonable based upon the project size, project characteristics, location and risk factors. Capitalized operating\nreserves shall be limited to real estate operations and may not be used to fund\nsocial services. The sources of all proposed financing for the project will be\nreviewed to ensure that the assistance proposed for the project does not exceed\nthat amount necessary for project feasibility. (ii)\n\nPreference in allocation of credit\ndollar amounts. Among the projects selected for a credit allocation, the Code\nmandates that preference in the dollar amount of the credit allocation will be\ngiven to projects which: (a) serve the lowest\nincome tenants; (b) are obligated\nto serve qualified tenants for the longest periods; and, (c) are located in a qualified census tract\nand their development contributes to a concerted community revitalization plan. These evaluations will be based upon the project's\nspecific economic needs subject only to statutory limitations. (2)\n\nCost\nstandards. If HUD assistance is proposed for the project, DHCR will apply HUD\nsubsidy review layering guidelines. Otherwise the Division shall apply the\nfollowing standards when calculating the maximum amount of the credit necessary\nfor the project: (i) Construction related\nitems (costs). The maximum allowable construction related costs shall be, in\nrelation to the contractor's contract: builder's profit of 6 percent; builder's\noverhead of 2 percent; and general conditions of 6 percent, or any combination\nof these costs totaling no more than 14 percent, based upon actual and\nreasonable construction costs. (ii)\n\nDeveloper's fee. The amount of developer fee compensation for services, overhead, and profit recognized in the adjusted project cost shall be 10\npercent of the acquisition and improvement cost associated with the low-income\nportions of the project. This can be increased up to a ceiling of 15 percent of\nimprovement cost of the low-income portion where either the developer or its\naffiliate provides to the satisfaction of the division both a cost completion\nguarantee and an operating deficit guarantee as those guarantees are set forth\nin the project owner's organizational documents. Notwithstanding any other\nprovision of this Part, the amount of the developer's fee for a high\nacquisition cost project shall be based upon the division assessment of risk\nassumed by the project owner, considering factors including, but not limited\nto, rent subsidies or other project operating support, location, financing\nsources, occupancy level, project type, and identity of interest. (iii)\n\nIdentity of interest. The division may\nreduce any allowable costs, including but not limited to the developer's fee, where an identity of interest has been found among the parties to the\ntransactions involving the acquisition, syndication, financing, development, construction and/or operation of the project, if it is determined that such\ncosts exceed reasonable amounts. At the time of application, all applicants\nwill be required to submit an affidavit disclosing the nature of any identity\nof interest. Where there exists such an identity of interest, the applicant\nwill be required to demonstrate expenditures to be customary given the\nfinancial structure of the project. At the time of carryover allocation and at\nthe time of the submission to the agency of the request for IRS form 8609, the\napplicant must disclose any additional identities of interest among the parties\nto transactions involving the syndication, financing, development, construction\nand/or operation of the project. (3)\n\nSyndication standards. The division will\nrequire that the value received on sale of the credit from projects receiving\nan allocation from the division be valued at market rates or greater. The\namount of equity capital contributed by investors to a project partnership\nshall not be less than the amount generally contributed by investors to similar\nprojects as determined by using sales of comparable credit projects and the\ndivision's evaluation of market trends. The division will base all calculations\nof the minimum net syndication proceeds available to the project on the\nassumption that 99.9 percent of the project has been sold to\ninvestors. (4)\n\nCalculation of\ncredit amount. The credit amount for a project shall be the lesser of the\neligible allocation or the gap amount. (i) Eligible allocation. The eligible allocation is the maximum amount the project\nis eligible for under the Code. It is determined by multiplying the qualified\nbasis of the project by the applicable credit percentage. (ii)\n\nGap amount. The gap amount is determined\nby subtracting the amount of supportable debt and other associated financing\nfrom the adjusted project cost and then dividing this financing gap by a factor\nbased upon either the market or syndication pricing proposed for the project, whichever is higher. (5)\n\nGeneral. (i) The division reserves the right\nto allocate credit in a manner which affirmatively advances fair housing, yields an equitable distribution of LIHTC throughout the State, to ensure the\nparticipation of qualified non-profit organizations, to implement such special\npriorities or demonstration programs contained in the notice of credit\navailability or request for proposals and/or other agency guidance, and to\nadvance coordinated investments by State, Federal, and local governmental\npartners. (ii)\n\nThe division also\nreserves the right, in its sole discretion, to: (a) assign scoring points as set forth in in\nsection\n2040.3\nof this Part to the extent a\nproject addresses HCR's underwriting standards, which may include an evaluation\nof project market support, operating economics and/or plan of finance, and/or\ndesign standards, as set forth in a request for proposals, design guidelines\nand/or other agency guidance; and\n(b) exclude a project from consideration for\nfunding if the division determines that the project's underwriting and/or\ndesign proposal negatively impacts prospective occupants and/or the\ncommunity. (iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the threshold eligibility review criteria and/or the scoring\ncriteria set forth herein, the division, it its sole discretion, may: (a) deny any request for an allocation of\ncredit to a project irrespective of the outcome of its threshold eligibility\nreview and/or the project scoring if such a request is either inconsistent with\nthe housing objectives of the Regional Economic Development Council applicable\nto the area in which the project is located, and/or presents issues not\naddressed in the threshold eligibility review or the project scoring which may\npose excessive risks, costs and/or negative impacts to the project, its\nprospective occupants and/or the community; and\n(b) allocate credit to a project irrespective\nof its scoring if such an intended allocation is in compliance with the Code, in furtherance of the State's housing goals as may be set forth in a request\nfor proposals and/or other agency guidance and is determined by the division to\nbe in the interests of the citizens of the State of New York. (6)\n\nSet-Asides. For the\npurpose of implementing the State's housing goals, including the housing\nobjectives of the Regional Economic Development Council applicable to the area\nin which the project is located, the division reserves the right to set aside\ncredit, including, but not limited to, set-asides for projects in\nwell-resourced areas, preservation projects, including such projects located in\nrural areas, and supportive housing projects. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n2040.3\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register May 26, 2021/Volume XLIII, Issue 21, eff. 5/26/2021\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register June 11, 2025/Volume XLVII, Issue 23, eff. 6/11/2025\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) Funding rounds. The\ndivision\nwill publish at least annually in the\n\nState\n\nRegister\na notice of credit availability which informs applicants of submission dates and deadlines for future funding rounds. (b) Documentation. Applicants requesting an allocation of credit must submit an application in a form approved by DHCR. The\ndivision\nmay\nrequest any and all information it deems necessary for\nproject\nevaluation. If any submission or documentation is insufficient to complete any evaluation of the proposed\nproject, processing will be terminated. DHCR will not request or accept updated information related to incomplete or insufficient exhibits or attachments used primarily for rating an application. (c) Processing fees. The\ndivision\nshall charge an application fee of $3,000, due at the time of application. The\ndivision\nshall charge a fee of $1,000 if a binding agreement is requested. A credit allocation fee of eight percent of the first year credit allocation amount is due at the time of request for the issuance of carryover allocation. Non-profit applicants (or their wholly-owned subsidiaries) which will be the sole general partner or partners of the partnership/\nproject\nowner or sole managing member or members of the limited liability\ncompany\n/\nproject\nowner\nmay\nrequest and be approved to defer payment of processing fees until the time of carryover allocation. (d) Credit allocation process. Only applications submitted by a published deadline will be evaluated for an allocation. Applications will be reviewed for completeness, eligibility, scoring, project\nfeasibility, site\nsuitability, consistency with the\ndivision\n's underwriting standards and whether a proposed\nproject\nadvances the\n\nState\n's housing goals and objectives, including any goals set forth by the Regional Economic Development\n\nCouncil\nstrategic\nplan\napplicable to the\narea\nin which the\nproject\nis located. The\ndivision\nexpects to notify applicants within 150 days from the application deadline on allocation decisions. The process the\ndivision\nemploys for allocating credit entails the following: (1)\n\nCredit reservation or binding agreement. The\ndivision\nwill determine, in its sole discretion, whether to provide the\napplicant\nwith a credit reservation or binding agreement based upon the readiness of the\nproject\nand the availability of credit. (i) Credit reservations will contain deadlines for: closing on construction financing in an amount sufficient to complete the\nproject; attainment of commitments for permanent financing in an amount sufficient to complete the\nproject; construction start; the\nproject\nowner to incur more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected basis in the\nproject; and submission of\ndocuments\nnecessary for the issuance of an allocation of credit. (ii)\n\nApplicants, after meeting the conditions of the credit reservation, may\nrequest a binding agreement if the\napplicant\nhas obtained commitments from all sources of construction and permanent financing and has obtained all necessary local approvals. Generally, a binding agreement will be issued to an\napplicant\nqualifying for a credit reservation to facilitate a\nproject\n's attainment of construction and/or permanent financing. (iii)\n\nIf the\napplicant\ndoes not comply with the deadlines contained in the credit reservation or binding agreement, the\ndivision\nmay\nrevoke the reservation or binding agreement and require the\napplicant\nto re-apply for credits. (2)\n\nCarryover allocation. Carryover allocations issued by the\ndivision\nwill contain any special conditions and specific performance standards. A carryover allocation will be issued if the\ndivision\ndetermines that an\napplicant\nhas met the requirements contained in the credit reservation and has submitted the proper certification that more than 10 percent of the reasonably expected basis in the\nproject\nhas been incurred by the\nproject\nowner. In making a determination to issue a carryover allocation the\ndivision\nwill consider the\nproject\n's status with respect to environmental assessments, local reviews and financial commitments. The issuance of a carryover allocation by the\ndivision\nshall not impose upon the\napplicant\nmore restrictive performance deadlines than those specified in the credit reservation. (3)\n\nFinal credit allocation. All projects which receive credit reservation, binding agreement or carryover allocation from the\ndivision, enter service and submit necessary documentation will be evaluated for the final time prior to the final credit allocation. The\ndivision\nmay\nrequest additional information/\ndocuments\nto complete the evaluation of the\nproject. Prior to the final credit allocation, the owner and the\ndivision\nshall execute a regulatory agreement. (4)\n\nWaiting list. Any complete application which meets the threshold eligibility review criteria but is not selected for a credit reservation will be placed on a waiting list which will be in effect until the next funding round, at which time the waiting list will be terminated. Applicants on the waiting list will remain eligible to be selected for a credit reservation if credits are made available to the\ndivision\nfrom a national credit pool, expired credit reservation or binding agreement, or recaptured credits. (5)\n\nOther notifications. If an application is found to be incomplete, ineligible, or not feasible the\napplicant\nwill be notified and no further action will be taken on the application. At any stage in the credit allocation process, the applicant must\nnotify DHCR immediately of any proposed material changes to the\nproject\nincluding but not limited to, changes in the\nproject\nscope, ownership structure, development team, financing, budget, design features, and changes affecting threshold eligibility review criteria and scoring and ranking criteria, tenant\npopulation, household\nincome levels served and any other significant factors. All proposed material changes are subject to DHCR's approval. (e) Threshold eligibility review criteria. At each stage of processing (\ni.e., application, reservation, binding agreement or allocation) applications will be subject to a threshold eligibility review, which will include, but not necessarily be limited to, whether the\nproject\nmeets the following minimum requirements as well as requirements described in a notice of credit availability, request for proposals, design requirements manual, capital programs manual or other manual or document issued by the\ndivision: (1)\n\nThe\nproject\nmeets the occupancy, rent\nrestrictions and any other requirements of the\ncode.

The\nproject\ndeveloper, owner and/or manager and their principals must inform the\ndivision\nin a timely manner of any notice of non-compliance issued at any time. (8)\n\nThe amount of requested annual credit allocation does not exceed either the maximum per\nproject\nor per unit amounts specified in the notice of credit availability issued by the\ndivision. Such amounts will be established based upon the expected availability of credit allocation\nauthority. The applicants\nmay\nrequest and the\ncommissioner\nmay\ngrant a waiver of this requirement if the\ncommissioner\ndetermines that there is sufficient credit available, the\nproject\nis in furtherance of the\n\nState\n's housing goals and in the best interests of the citizens of the\n\nState\nof New York. A written explanation shall be available to the general public for any waiver granted pursuant to this paragraph.

(15)\n\nProject\nconstruction has not started without prior authorization by the\ndivision. (16)\n\nThe\nproject\nwill: (i) be a qualified low-income housing\nproject\nsubject to a regulatory agreement with the\ndivision\nfor no less than 30 years, however, the minimum term\nmay\nbe increased as set forth in the annual request for proposals for each funding round; or\n(ii)\nbe conveyed pursuant to an effective\nplan\nfor existing tenants to purchase the\nproject\nat the end of the compliance period. (17)\n\nThe\nproject\n's design and construction must comply with green and energy efficiency sustainable building practices and measures appropriate for the type of building proposed as set forth in the annual request for proposals for each funding round. Rehabilitation projects must take into account, among other factors, cost effectiveness based on the scope of reconstruction necessary and the historic nature of the\nproject. All projects must identify how green and energy efficiency sustainable building requirements will be met and agree to provide, prior to construction closing, a certification from a responsible green and/or energy professional that the\nproject\nwill meet such requirements. (18)\n\nThe\ndivision\nhas completed a credit and background review of the\nproject\ndeveloper, owner, general contractor and/or manager and their principals with results acceptable to the\ndivision.

(g) Determination of the amount for credit allocation. (1)\n(i) Evaluation of\nproject. All projects considered for an allocation of credit shall be evaluated pursuant to the\ncode\nat the following times: at application; at allocation; and after the building is placed in service. The\ndivision\nwill consider the\nproject\nranking, analyze operating economics, financing and development cost for reasonableness and determine the amount of credit necessary for the financial\nfeasibility\nof the\nproject\nand its viability as a qualified low-income housing\nproject. The\ndivision\nwill require that the operating economics of the\nproject\nbe fiscally sound and in compliance with LIHTC regulatory requirements; and, that all\nproject\ncosts, including developer's fee, are necessary and reasonable based upon the\nproject\nsize, project\ncharacteristics, location and risk factors. Capitalized operating reserves shall be limited to real estate operations and\nmay\nnot be used to fund social services. The sources of all proposed financing for the\nproject\nwill be reviewed to ensure that the assistance proposed for the\nproject\ndoes not exceed that amount necessary for\nproject\nfeasibility. (ii)\n\nPreference in allocation of credit dollar amounts. Among the projects selected for a credit allocation, the\ncode\nmandates that preference in the dollar amount of the credit allocation will be given to projects which: (a) serve the lowest income tenants; (b) are obligated to serve qualified tenants for the longest periods; and\n(c) are located in a qualified census tract and their development contributes to a concerted community revitalization\nplan. These evaluations will be based upon the\nproject\n's specific economic needs subject only to statutory limitations. (2)\n\nCost standards. If\nHUD\nassistance is proposed for the\nproject, DHCR will apply\nHUD\nsubsidy review layering guidelines. Otherwise the\ndivision\nshall apply the following standards when calculating the maximum amount of the credit necessary for the\nproject: (i) Construction related items (costs). The maximum allowable construction related costs shall be, in relation to the contractor's\ncontract: builder's profit of 6 percent; builder's overhead of 2 percent; and general conditions of 6 percent, or any combination of these costs totaling no more than 14 percent, based upon actual and reasonable construction costs. (ii)\n\nDeveloper's fee. The amount of developer fee compensation for services, overhead, and profit recognized in the\nadjusted project cost\nshall be 10 percent of the acquisition and improvement cost associated with the low-income portions of the\nproject. This can be increased up to a ceiling of 15 percent of improvement cost of the low-income portion where either the developer or its affiliate provides to the satisfaction of the\ndivision\nboth a\ncost completion guarantee\nand an\noperating deficit guarantee\nas those guarantees are set forth in the\nproject\nowner's organizational\ndocuments. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, the amount of the developer's fee for a\nhigh acquisition cost project\nshall be based upon the\ndivision\n's assessment of risk assumed by the\nproject\nowner, considering factors including, but not limited to, rent\nsubsidies\nor other\nproject\noperating support, location, financing sources, occupancy level, project\ntype, and\nidentity of interest. (iii)\n\nIdentity of interest. The\ndivision\nmay\nreduce any allowable costs, including but not limited to the developer's fee, where an\nidentity of interest\nhas been found among the parties to the transactions involving the acquisition, syndication, financing, development, construction and/or operation of the\nproject, if it is determined that such costs exceed reasonable amounts. At the time of application, all applicants will be required to submit an affidavit disclosing the nature of any\nidentity of interest. Where there exists such an\nidentity of interest, the\napplicant\nwill be required to demonstrate expenditures to be customary given the financial structure of the\nproject. At the time of carryover allocation and at the time of the submission to the\nagency\nof the request for IRS Form 8609, the applicant must\ndisclose any additional identities of interest among the parties to transactions involving the syndication, financing, development, construction and/or operation of the\nproject. (3)\n\nSyndication standards. The\ndivision\nwill require that the value received on sale of the credit from projects receiving an allocation from the\ndivision\nbe valued at market rates or greater. The amount of equity capital contributed by investors to a\nproject\npartnership shall not be less than the amount generally contributed by investors to similar projects as determined by using sales of comparable credit projects and the\ndivision\n's evaluation of market trends. The\ndivision\nwill base all calculations of the minimum\nnet syndication proceeds\navailable to the\nproject\non the assumption that 99.9 percent of the\nproject\nhas been sold to investors. (4)\n\nCalculation of credit amount. The credit amount for a\nproject\nshall be the lesser of the eligible allocation or the gap amount. (i) Eligible allocation. The eligible allocation is the maximum amount the\nproject\nis eligible for under the\ncode. It is determined by multiplying the qualified basis of the\nproject\nby the applicable credit percentage. (ii)\n\nGap amount. The gap amount is determined by subtracting the amount of\nsupportable debt\nand other associated financing from the\nadjusted project cost\nand then dividing this financing gap by a factor based upon either the market or syndication pricing proposed for the\nproject, whichever is higher. (5)\n\nGeneral. The\ndivision\nreserves the right to allocate credit in a manner which affirmatively advances fair housing, yields an equitable distribution of credit throughout the\n\nState, to ensure the participation of qualified non-profit organizations, to implement such special priorities or demonstration programs contained in the notice of credit availability or request for proposals and to advance coordinated investments by\n\nState, Federal, and local governmental partners.
