  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 93.4 - Modification of types\n\nState Regulations\n\nPermission to use an approved type of meter is effective\nonly for those types which are of the same electrical design and assembly as\nthe type approved. If the manufacturer of an approved type changes its\nconstruction in a manner that may affect its operation or accuracy, the\nsponsoring entity or the entity intending to use the modified device shall\nnotify the commission staff specifying the changes. If the commission staff\ndetermines that the change is significant, the meter will be considered a new\ntype and subject to approval. Minor variations in mechanical construction which\nare not of such character as to affect the electrical operation will be\npermitted in meters of the same type, but the commission staff shall be\nnotified and reserves the right to make the determination. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n93.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
