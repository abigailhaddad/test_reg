  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17 § 3B.23 - Curb Markings\n\nState Regulations\nDELETE Paragraphs 02 through 05. INSERT the following paragraphs: Support: 01A Where used to delineate the curb, visibility is\ngenerally improved, especially during night hours. They become, in effect, edge\nmarkings delineating the edge of the roadway. Support: 06A This is considered good practice for the following\nreasons: In the winter, curb markings are frequently obliterated by\nsnow and ice; and\n\nRoad users with visual deficiencies can find it difficult\nto distinguish colors and/or read word markings on curbs, especially at\nnight. Standard: 07A A colored curb shall not be used to convey parking\nregulations. Signs shall be the primary method to indicate non-statutory\nparking regulations. Where curbs are marked, the colors shall conform to the\ngeneral principles of markings (see Section 3A.05). Option: 07B Legible word markings may be used to convey a general\nstatutory prohibition of parking within a specific distance of a STOP sign, driveway, fire hydrant, or crosswalk. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 17\n§\n3B.23\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
