(2)\n\nWhen a player splits pairs, the dealer\nshall deal a card to the first incomplete hand on the dealer's left before\nproceeding to deal any cards to any other hand. (3)\n\nAfter a second card is dealt to a split\npair, the dealer shall announce the point total of such hand and the player\nshall indicate the player's decision to stand, re-split, if the second card is\nidentical in value, draw or double down with respect thereto except that: (i) a player may not split pairs after the\nthird split on one betting position (a total of four hands) or after a double\ndown wager has been made on that hand; and\n(ii)\na player splitting aces shall have only\none card dealt to each ace and may not elect to receive additional\ncards. (iii)\n\nThe player is\nprohibited from splitting a pair of aces more than once.

Except for a natural\nblackjack, a player may elect to double down on the first two cards dealt to\nthe player or the first two cards of any split pair on the condition that one\nadditional card shall be dealt to the hand on which the player has elected to\ndouble down. In such circumstances, the one additional card may be dealt face\ndown and placed sideways on the layout, perpendicular to the two cards forming\nthe hand on which the player has elected to double down. (e) Insurance wagers. (1)\n\nWhenever the first card dealt to the\ndealer is an ace, each player shall have the right to make an insurance bet\nthat wins if the dealer's second card is a king, queen, jack or 10 and shall\nlose if the dealer's second card is an ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9. (2)\n\nAn insurance bet may be made by placing\non the insurance line of the layout an amount not more than half the amount\nstaked on the player's initial wager, except that a player may bet an amount in\nexcess of half the initial wager to the next unit that can be wagered in chips\nwhen, because of the limitation of the value of chip denominations, half the\ninitial wager cannot be bet. All insurance wagers shall be placed prior to the\ndealer inserting the dealer's hole card into the card reader device or\notherwise determining whether the dealer's hole card is a king, queen, jack or\n10. (3)\n\nAll winning insurance\nwagers shall be paid at no less than odds of 2:1. (4)\n\nAll losing insurance wagers shall be\ncollected by the dealer immediately after the dealer determines that the hole\ncard is not a king, queen, jack or 10. (f) Surrender. (1)\nA gaming facility may, after the first\ntwo cards are dealt to a player and the player's point total is announced, allow the player to discontinue play on the player's hand for that round by\nsurrendering one-half of the player's wager. All decisions to surrender shall\nbe made prior to such player indicating as to whether the player wishes to\ndouble down, split pairs, stand or draw as provided in this Part and after the\ndealer has determined that the dealer's hand does not have a blackjack if the\ndealer's up card is an ace or 10. (i) If the\nfirst card dealt to the dealer is a 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 or 9, the dealer shall\ncollect immediately one-half of the wager and return one-half to the\nplayer. (ii)\n\nIf the first card\ndealt to the dealer is an ace, king, queen or jack, the dealer shall place the\nplayer's wager on top of the player's cards or designated area for insurance\nwagers. When the dealer's second card is revealed, the hand shall be settled by\nimmediately collecting the entire wager if the dealer has blackjack, or by\ncollecting one-half of the wager and returning one-half the wager to the player\nif the dealer does not have blackjack. (2)\n\nIf the player has made an insurance wager\nand then elects to surrender, each wager shall be settled separately and one\nwager shall have no bearing on the other. (g) Drawing of additional cards by players\nand dealers. (1)\nA player may elect to draw\nadditional cards whenever such player's point count total is less than 21, except that a player: (i) electing to double\ndown shall draw only one additional card; and\n(ii)\nsplitting aces shall have only one card\ndealt to each ace and shall not be permitted to receive additional\ncards. (2)\n\nExcept as\nprovided in paragraph (3) of this subdivision, a dealer shall draw additional\ncards to the dealer's hand until the dealer has a total of 17, 18, 19, 20 or\n21, at which point no additional cards shall be drawn, unless the gaming\nfacility requires the dealer to draw an additional card if the dealer has a\nsoft 17, so long as the table inscription indicates such soft-17\nrule. (3)\nA dealer shall draw no\nadditional cards to the dealer's hand if doing so would have no effect on a\ngame outcome. (h) More\nthan one player wagering on a box. (1)\n\nIn the\ngames of blackjack, Spanish 21, blackjack switch and multiple-action blackjack, the gaming facility may permit one to three people to wager on any one box the\nlayout, provided that the first person wagering on that box consents to\nadditional players wagering on such box. (2)\n\nWhenever more than one player wagers on a\nbox, the player seated at that box shall have the exclusive right to call the\ndecisions with regard to the cards dealt to such box. In the case of no seated\nplayer, the person with the highest wager in the box shall have such\nright. (3)\n\nThe player calling the\ndecisions with respect to any box shall place a wager in the portion of the box\nclosest to the dealer's side of the table and all other players wagering on\nsuch box shall place their wagers immediately behind and in a vertical line\nwith the aforementioned wager. (4)\n\nWhenever more than one player is wagering on a box and the player calling the\ndecisions decides to double down, the other players may also double their\nwagers but shall not be required to do so. In any event, only one additional\ncard shall be dealt to the hand that is subject to the double-down\ndecision. (5)\n\nWhenever more than\none player is wagering on a box and the player calling the decisions decides to\nsplit pairs, the other players shall either make an additional wager to cover\neach split pair or the player's wager shall only apply to the first blackjack\nhand dealt after the split. (6)\n\nWhenever more than one player is wagering on a box, each player shall have the\nright to make an insurance bet, without regard to whether the other players on\nthat box make such a bet. (i) Irregularities. (1)\n\nAfter the initial two cards have been\ndealt to each player and the dealer and a card is drawn and exposed to the\nplayers in error, such card shall be dealt to the players or dealer as though\nit were the next card drawn from the shoe. Any player refusing to accept such\ncard shall not have any additional cards dealt to such player during such\nround. If the card is refused by all players and the dealer cannot use the\ncard, the card shall be burned. (2)\n\nIf the dealer misses dealing a card in the dealer's hand, the dealer shall\ncontinue dealing the first two cards to each player and then shall deal the\nappropriate number of cards to the dealer's hand. (3)\n\nIf no cards are dealt to the player's\nhand, that hand shall be declared dead and the player shall be included in the\nnext deal. If only one card is dealt to the player's hand, at the player's\noption, the dealer shall deal the second card to the player after all other\nplayers have received a second card. (4)\n\nIf, after receiving the first two cards, the dealer fails to deal an additional card or cards to a player who has\nrequested such card, then, at the player's option, the dealer shall either: (i) deal the additional card or cards after\nall other players have received their additional cards but prior to the dealer\nrevealing the dealer's hole card; or\n(ii)\ncall the player's hand dead, return the\nplayer's original wager and place the player's cards into the discard\nrack. (5)\n\nIf the dealer\ninserts the dealer's hole card into a card reader device when the value of the\ndealer's first card is not an ace, king, queen, jack or 10, the dealer, after\nnotification to a supervisor, shall continue play only if the particular card\nreader device in use does not provide the dealer or any player with the\nopportunity to determine the value of the hole card. (6)\n\nIf a gaming facility implements the\nprocedure by which on additional card is dealt face down to a hand on which a\nplayer has elected a double down and the dealer inadvertently deals such card\nface up, play shall continue and the player's wagers shall be settled in\ncompletion of the round of play. (7)\n\nIn the game of Spanish 21, if a 10 card\nof any suit is found in the shoe, such card shall not be used in the game and\nshall be removed and destroyed according to the requirements set forth in\nsubdivision (o) of section\n5322.15\nof this Subchapter. If more\nthan one 10 card is found in the shoe during the dealing of the cards, the\nround of play shall be void and the cards shall be re-shuffled. Play for that\nshoe shall cease and the decks shall be removed from the shoe and a floor\nsupervisor shall verify that all 10s have been removed prior to the dealer\nreshuffling and resuming play. The floor supervisor may also elect to place new\ndecks into play. (j) Whenever the cover card is reached in the deal of the cards, the dealer shall\ncontinue dealing the cards until that round of play is completed, after which\nthe dealer shall reshuffle the cards, including the cards remaining in the\ndealing shoe if a single dealing shoe is used. (k) At the conclusion of a round of play, all\ncards still remaining on the layout shall be picked up by the dealer in order\nand in such a way that they can be readily arranged to indicate each player's\nhand in case of question or dispute. The dealer shall pick up the cards\nbeginning with those of the player to the dealer's far right and moving\ncounterclockwise around the table. After all the players' cards have been\ncollected, the dealer shall pick up the dealer's cards against the bottom of\nthe players' cards and place them in the discard rack. (l) No player or spectator shall handle, remove or alter any cards except as permitted by this section and no dealer or\nother gaming employee shall permit a player or spectator to engage in such\nactivity. (m) Each player at the\ntable shall be responsible for correctly computing the point count of such\nplayer's hand and no player shall rely on the point counts required to be\nannounced by the dealer pursuant to this section without the player checking\nthe accuracy of such announcement.
