The election must be made by the due date, including any\nextensions, of the time to file a New York State nonresident personal income\ntax return for the first taxable year beginning on or after January 1, 1978. A\ntaxpayer who fails to make a timely election under this section must use the\nallocation method prescribed by section\n132.15\n(b) of this Part. Once the taxpayer uses the method prescribed by section\n132.15\n(b) of this Part, or elects to allocate in accordance with subdivision (c) of such\nsection, the taxpayer must continue to use the allocation method implemented\nunless, after application in writing to the Tax Commission, the Tax Commission\ndetermines that the method of allocation used no longer reflects income which\nis fairly applicable to New York State. If the Tax Commission permits the\ntaxpayer to revoke the method of allocation of income under this section, a\ncopy of such permission of revocation of election must be attached to the New\n\nYork State nonresident personal income tax return for the first taxable period\nto which such revocation of election is applicable. (b) In any method of apportionment and\nallocation permitted or required under section\n132.15\nof this Part, the commissions derived from the execution of purchase or sales\norders for the account of customers must be allocated and apportioned as\nfollows: (1)\n\nIf an order is received at the\n\nNew York State place of business of a broker for execution on an exchange\nlocated within New York State, and originates at a bona fide established office\nof the broker located within New York State, 100 percent of the commission in\nthe case of stocks, bonds and commodities must be apportioned and allocated to\n\nNew York State and constitutes income derived from or connected with New York\n\nState sources in the taxable period in which such order is executed. (2)\n\nIf the order is received at the New York\n\nState place of business of a broker for execution on an exchange located within\n\nNew York State, and originates at a bona fide established office of the broker\nlocated without New York State, 20 percent of the commission in the case of\nstocks, bonds and commodities must be apportioned and allocated to New York\n\nState and constitutes income derived from or connected with New York State\nsources in the taxable period in which such order is executed. (3)\n\nIf the order originates at the New York\n\nState place of business of a broker and is transmitted to a bona fide\nestablished office of the broker located without New York State for execution\non an exchange located without New York State, 80 percent of the commission in\nthe case of stocks, bonds and commodities must be apportioned and allocated to\n\nNew York State and constitutes income derived from or connected with New York\n\nState sources in the taxable period in which such order is executed. (4)\n\nFor taxable periods commencing on and\nafter January 1, 1978, the taxpayer may allocate commission income on the basis\nof actual experience if such taxpayer can demonstrate to the satisfaction of\nthe Tax Commission that the allocation pursuant to paragraphs (2) and (3) of\nthis subdivision does not fairly reflect the amount of commission income\nattributable to New York State. (5)\n\nCommission income derived from over-the-counter transactions must be\napportioned and allocated to New York State in the following manner: (i) If the order originates at or through a\n\nNew York State place of business of the taxpayer, 100 percent of the commission\nincome must be apportioned and allocated to New York State.
