  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 535.7 - Enforcement program\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nchief administrative officer shall be responsible for the enforcement of these\nrules (or of the rules of any individual institution supplementing or\nimplementing these rules) and shall designate the other administrative officers\nwho are authorized to take action in accordance with such rules when required\nor appropriate to carry them into effect. (b) It is not intended by any provision\nherein to curtail the right of students, faculty or staff to be heard upon any\nmatter affecting them in their relations with the institution. In the case of\nany apparent violation of these rules (or of the rules of any individual\ninstitution supplementing or implementing these rules) by such persons, which, in the judgment of the chief administrative officer or his designee, does not\npose any immediate threat of injury to person or property, such officer may\nmake reasonable effort to learn the cause of the conduct in question and to\npersuade those engaged therein to desist and to resort to permissible methods\nfor the resolution of any issues which may be presented. In doing so such\nofficer shall warn such persons of the consequences of persistence in the\nprohibited conduct, including their ejection from any premises of the\ninstitution where their continued presence and conduct is in violation of these\nrules (or of the rules of any individual institution supplementing or\nimplementing these rules). (c) In\nany case where violation of these rules (or of the rules of any individual\ninstitution supplementing or implementing these rules) does not cease after\nsuch warning and in other cases of willful violation of such rules, the chief\nadministrative officer or his designee shall cause the ejection of the violator\nfrom any premises which he occupies in such violation and shall initiate\ndisciplinary action as hereinbefore provided. (d) The chief administrative officer or his\ndesignee may apply to the public authorities for any aid which he deems\nnecessary in causing the ejection of any violator of these rules (or of the\nrules of any individual institution supplementing or implementing these rules)\nand he may request the State University counsel to apply to any court of\nappropriate jurisdiction for an injunction to restrain the violation or\nthreatened violation of such rules.
