Tit. 9 § 156.6 - Performance advance payments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Employees who complete one year of service in full-time employment status at a\nbasic annual salary rate which is below the job rate of their salary grade, whose performance at the completion of such year of service is rated other than\nunsatisfactory or an equivalent rating, or higher, shall be eligible to receive\na performance advance. (1)\n\nFor the purpose of\ndetermining the date upon which one year of service is completed, any pay\nperiod for which the employee was on leave without pay or leave with less than\nfull pay for the full payroll period will not be counted. (2)\n\nPerformance advances will be payable to\neligible employees effective the first day of the payroll period following the\ncompletion of the required period of service. (b) Employees with one year of service in\ngrade as of March 31, 1985 and who are otherwise eligible to receive a\nperformance advance shall receive a performance advance equal to one fourth of\nthe range between the hiring rate and the job rate for their grade. (c) Employees who are eligible to receive a\nperformance advance payable on and after June 13, 1985 shall receive a\nperformance advance equal to one fifth of the range between the hiring rate and\nthe job rate for their grade. (d) Each employee who receives a performance advance to the job rate of his/her\nsalary grade between March 31, 1985 and June 13, 1986 as established in\nsubdivision (a) of this section, shall receive a one-time, nonrecurring\nlump-sum payment equal to the dollar value of the difference between the\npartial performance advance received by the employee and the full performance\nadvance received by the employee and the full performance advance for the\nemployee's grade as of the date of the employee's performance advance in\naccordance with the provisions of subdivision (a) of this section. Such\none-time, nonrecurring lump-sum payment shall be paid as soon as practicable\nafter the effective date of the employee's performance advance. (e) In no case may a performance advance\nresult in a basic annual salary above the job rate for the employee's position.

(f) In no case shall an employee receive an\nadditional performance advance within one year of having received a performance\nadvance pursuant to these rules or Parts 147 through 158 of this Title.
