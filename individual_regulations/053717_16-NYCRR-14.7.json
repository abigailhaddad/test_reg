(3)\n\nThe notice required by this subdivision must be provided in the following\nmanner: (i) by personally serving it or\nmailing it to the owner or superintendent, as required by subparagraphs (i) and\n(ii) of paragraph (1) of this subdivision; (ii)\nby mailing it to the occupants and all\nlocal officials, as required by subparagraphs (iii), (iv), (v) and (vi) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision; and\n(iii)\nby posting it in a conspicuous place in\nthe public areas of the multiple dwelling. (4)\n\nThe utility must give 15 calendar days\nnotice if personally served or posted, and 18 calendar days notice if\nmailed. (5)\n\nThe notice to local\nofficials required by subparagraphs (iv) and (v) of paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision must be repeated not more than four nor less than two business days\nbefore termination. (6)\n\nWhenever a\nnotice of termination of service has been made in accordance with this\nsubdivision and the utility no longer intends to terminate service, the utility\nmust so notify the occupants of each unit in the same manner as it gave the\noriginal notice. (b) Procedures to avoid termination of service. (1)\nA utility following the requirements of\nthis section may require occupants in a multiple dwelling to pay no more than\nthe current charges incurred by the party to whom the last preceding bill has\nbeen rendered, and must not terminate service if such current charges are\npaid. (2)\n\nIf occupants in a\nmultiple dwelling find they are unable to reach an agreement with the utility\nto avoid termination of service, they may contact the commission's designee. After such a request is received, a designee will attempt to work out an\nagreement and will, if necessary, attempt to arrange a meeting with occupant\nrepresentatives, the utility, and the party responsible for making payment for\nservice. (3)\n\nThe commission's\ndesignee may stay a threatened termination of service to an entire multiple\ndwelling where it concludes that good faith efforts are being made by the\noccupants to arrange for the payment of current charges. (c) Physical termination of service. Paragraphs (c)(3) through (6) and subdivisions (d) through (f) of section\n14.4\nare applicable to the\ntermination of service to entire multiple dwellings. (d) Termination of heat-related service to\nmultiple dwellings during cold weather periods. During the cold weather period, the following procedure must be followed by a utility intending to terminate\nheat-related service to an entire multiple dwelling: (1)\nA utility must provide the notices\nrequired by subdivision (a) of this section not less than 30 calendar days\nbefore the intended termination. (2)\nA utility must provide each occupant with\na written notice, not less than 10 calendar days before the earliest date\ntermination may occur, advising the occupant that if any occupant in his or her\napartment has a serious illness or medical condition that may result in a\nserious impairment to health or safety by the loss of heat service, he or she\nshould immediately contact the utility. The notice must provide the name and\ntelephone number of a utility contact person. Whenever an occupant so notifies\na utility, the utility must conduct an onsite personal visit without delay, for\nthe purpose of determining whether the occupant may suffer a serious impairment\nto health or safety as a result of termination. If the utility determines that\nan occupant may suffer a serious impairment to health or safety as a result of\ntermination, the utility must refer such cases to the local department of\nsocial services and request the agency to investigate. (3)\nA utility referring such a case to the\n\nDepartment of Social Services must continue heat-related service to the\nmultiple dwelling or otherwise provide heat to the person who may suffer a\nserious impairment for at least 15 business days after the referral. A utility\nthat has referred such a case must not thereafter terminate heat-related\nservice to the dwelling during the cold weather period unless it otherwise\nprovides heat to the person who may suffer a serious impairment, or unless it\nis informed by the local department of social services that appropriate\nalternative arrangements to preclude a serious impairment to health or safety\nhave been made or that the claim of serious impairment is without merit. A\nutility thereafter intending to terminate service must provide at least five\ncalendar days written notice to the occupants that heat-related service will be\nterminated, and must, if so notified by the Department of Social Services, inform the individual of the finding of no serious impairment. Such notice must\nstate that any occupant may seek further review by the commission. (4)\n\nIf a utility is notified by the local\ndepartment of social services that an occupant in a multiple dwelling where the\nheat-related service has been terminated by the utility may suffer a serious\nimpairment to health or safety, it must reconnect heat-related service, or\notherwise provide heat to such person, and continue such service as provided\nfor in paragraph (3) of this subdivision.
