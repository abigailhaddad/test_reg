  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 800.5 - Permissible exposure limits\n\nState Regulations\n\nAn employee 's exposure to any substance listed in Table\nZ-1-A, Z-2, or Z-3 of this section shall be limited in accordance with the\nrequirements of the following paragraphs of this section. (a) TABLE Z-1-A. (1)\n\nSubstances in transitional limits columns\nwith limits preceded by \" C\"-ceiling values. An employee's exposure to any\nsubstance in Table Z-1-A under the transitional limits column, the exposure\nlimit of which is preceded by a \"C\", shall at no time exceed the exposure limit\ngiven for that material in Table Z-1-A under the transitional limits\ncolumns. (2)\n\nOther substances in\ntransitional limits columns-8-hour time weighted average. An employee's\nexposure to any substance in table Z-1-A under the transitional limits columns, the exposure limit of which is not preceded by a \"C\", shall not exceed the\n8-hour time weighted average given for that substance in table Z-1-A under the\ntransitional limits columns in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour work\nweek. (3)\n\nFinal rule limits\ncolumns. An employee's exposure to any substance listed in table Z-1-A shall\nnot exceed the time weighted average (TWA), short term exposure limit (STEL), and ceiling limit specified for that substance in table Z-1-A under the final\nlimits columns. (4)\n\nSkin\ndesignation. To prevent or reduce skin absorption, an employee's skin exposure\nto substances listed in table Z-1-A with an \"X\" in one or both of the skin\ndesignation columns following the substance name shall be prevented or reduced\nto the extent necessary in the circumstances through the use of gloves, coveralls, goggles, or other appropriate personal protective equipment, engineering controls or work practices. (5)\n\nDefinitions. The following definitions\nare applicable to the final rule limits columns of table Z-1-A: (i) Time weighted average\n(TWA)\nis the employee's average airborne exposure in any 8-hour work\nshift of a 40-hour work week which shall not be exceeded. (ii)\n\nShort term exposure limit\n(STEL)\nis the employee's 15-minute time weighted average exposure\nwhich shall not be exceeded at any time during a work day unless another time\nlimit is specified in a parenthetical notation below the limit. If another time\nperiod is specified, the time weighted average exposure over that time period\nshall not be exceeded at any time during the working day. (iii)\n\nCeiling\nis the\nemployee's exposure which shall not be exceeded during any part of the work\nday. If instantaneous monitoring is not feasible, then the ceiling shall be\nassessed as a 15-minute time weighted average exposure which shall not be\nexceeded at any time over a working day. (6)\n\nAdditional definition. The terms\nsubstance, air contaminant, and\nmaterial\nare\nequivalent in meaning for 29\nCFR\n1910.1000. ( 29 CFR\n1910\nwas previously\nfiled with the Secretary of State on February 2, 1988, under File Number 240. It is available for inspection at the NYS Department of State and the NYS\nDepartment of Labor, and can be obtained from the U.S. Government Printing\n\nOffice in Federal Register, Volume 52, No. 176, pp. 34460-34578, September 11, 1987). (b) Table\nZ-2. Table Z-2 is applicable for the transitional period and to the\nextent set forth in subdivision (f) of this section. (1)\n\nEight-hour time weighted averages. An\nemployee's exposure to any material listed in table Z-2, in any 8-hour work\nshift of a 40-hour work week, shall not exceed the 8-hour time weighted average\nlimit given for that material in table Z-2. (2)\n\nAcceptable ceiling concentrations. An\nemployee's exposure to a material listed in table Z-2 shall not exceed at any\ntime during an 8-hour shift the acceptable ceiling concentration limit given\nfor the material in the table, except for a time period, and up to a\nconcentration not exceeding the maximum duration and concentration allowed in\nthe column under \"acceptable maximum peak above the acceptable ceiling\nconcentration for an 8-hour shift\". (3)\n\nExample. During an 8-hour work shift, an\nemployee may be exposed to a concentration of Substance A (with a 10 ppm TWA, 25 ppm ceiling and 50 ppm peak) above 25 ppm (but never above 50 ppm) only for\na maximum period of 10 minutes. Such exposure must be compensated by exposures\nto concentrations less than 10 ppm so that the cumulative exposure for the\nentire 8-hour work shift does not exceed a weighted average of 10\nppm. (c) Table\nZ-3. Table Z-3 is applicable for the transitional period and to\nthe extent set forth in subdivision (f) of this section. An employee's exposure\nto any substance listed in table Z-3, in any 8-hour work shift of a 40-hour\nwork week shall not exceed the 8-hour time weighted average limit given for\nthat substance in the table. (d) Computation formulae. The computation formula which shall apply to employee\nexposure to more than one substance for which 8-hour time weighted averages are\nlisted in subpart Z of 29 CFR part\n1910\nin order to determine whether an\nemployee is exposed over the regulatory limit is as follows: (1)\n(i) The\ncumulative exposure for an 8-hour work shift shall be computed as follows: (E = C(a) T(a) + C(b) T(b) +.... C(n) T(n)) divided by\n8\n\nWhere: E is the equivalent exposure for the working shift. C is the concentration during any period of time T where\nthe concentration remains constant. T is the duration in hours of the exposure at the\nconcentration C. The value of E shall not exceed the 8-hour time weighted\naverage specified in Subpart Z or 29 CFR part\n1910\nfor the material\ninvolved. (ii)\n\nTo illustrate\nthe formula prescribed in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, assume that\n\nSubstance A has an 8-hour time weighted average limit of 100 ppm noted in table\nZ-1-A. Assume than an employee is subject to the following exposure: Substituting this information in the formula, we have\n\nTwo hours exposure at 150 p/m\n\nTwo hours exposure at 75 p/m\n\nFour hours exposure at 50 p/m\n(2 * 150 + 2 * 75 + 4 * 50) divided by 8 = 81.25 p/m\n\nSince 81.25 p.p.m. is less than 100 p.p.m., the 8-hour time\nweighted average limit, the exposure is acceptable. (2)\n(i) In\ncase of a mixture of air contaminants an employer shall compute the equivalent\nexposure as follows: E(m) = (C(1) divided by L(1) + C(2) divided by L(2)) +... (C)(n) divided by L(n))\n\nWhere: E(m) is the equivalent exposure for the mixture. C is the concentration of a particular contaminant. L is the exposure limit for that substance specified in\n\nSubpart Z of 29 CFR part\n1910. The value of E(m) shall not exceed unity (1). (ii)\n\nTo illustrate the formula\nprescribed in subparagraph (d)(2)(i) of this section, consider the following\nexposures: Substance\n\nActual concentration of 8-hour exposure\n(ppm)\n8 hr.TWA PEL (ppm)\nB....... 500\n1,000\nC....... 45\n200\nD....... 40\n200\n\nSubstituting in the formula, we have: E(m) = 500 divided by\n1,000 + 45 divided by 200 + 40 divided by 200 E(m) = 0.500 + 0.225 + 0.200 E(m)\n= 0.925\n\nSince E(m) is less than unity (1), the exposure combination\nis within acceptable limits. (e) To achieve compliance with subdivisions\n(a) through (d) of this section, administrative or engineering controls must\nfirst be determined and implemented whenever feasible. When such controls are\nnot feasible to achieve full compliance, protective equipment or any other\nprotective measures shall be used to keep the exposure of employees to air\ncontaminants within the limits prescribed in this section. Any equipment and/or\ntechnical measures used for this purpose must be approved for each particular\nuse by a competent industrial hygienist or other technically qualified person. Whenever respirators are used, their use shall comply with 1910.134. (f) Effective dates, start-up dates and\ntransitional provisions. (1)\n\nEffective\ndate. The effective date for the permissible exposure limits specified in the\nfinal rule limits columns of table Z-1-A is March 1, 1989. (2)\n(i) The\npermissible exposure limits specified in the final rule columns of table Z-1-A\nshall be achieved by any reasonable combination of engineering controls, work\npractices and personal protective equipment effective September 1, 1989, through December 30, 1992. (See note at end of table Z-1-A). (ii)\n(a) The permissible exposure limits specified in the final rule limits columns of\ntable Z-1-A shall be achieved by the method of compliance specified in\nsubdivision (e) of this section effective December 31, 1992, if by December 31, 1991, a final rule has been published in the Federal Register amending or\ndetermining not to amend subdivision (e) of this section. (b) If no final rule has been published in\nthe Federal Register by December 31, 1991, amending or determining not to amend\nsubdivision (e) of this section, then the permissible limits specified in the\nfinal rule limits columns of table Z-1-A shall be achieved by the methods of\ncompliance specified by subdivision (e) of this section effective December 31, 1993, and subparagraph (f)(2)(i) of this section shall remain in effect through\n\nDecember 30, 1993. (iii)\n\nThe skin designations in the final rule limits columns become effective\n\nSeptember 1, 1989. The skin designations in the transitional limits columns are\nin effect from March 1, 1989, through August 31, 1989. (3)\n\nTransitional provisions. (i) The permissible exposure limits specified\nin the transitional limits columns of table Z-1-A, table Z-2 and table Z-3\nshall continue to be achieved by the methods of compliance specified in\nsubdivision (e) of this section through December 30, 1992. If clause\n(2)(ii)(\nb\n) of this subdivision takes effect, this provision is\nextended through December 30, 1993. The permissible exposure limits specified\nin tables Z-2 and Z-3 for substances mentioned in the final rule limits column\nof table Z-1-A only by cross reference to table Z-2 or Z-3 shall remain in\neffect indefinitely and continue to be achieved by the methods of compliance\nspecified in subdivision (e) of this section. (ii)\n\nThe permissible exposure limits\nspecified in the transitional limits columns of table Z-1-A, Z-2 and Z-3 shall\nbe applicable to the extent cross referenced in 29 CFR parts\n1915, 1917\nand\n1918. (iii)\n\nIf any new or amended\nprovisions or new or revised limits for any substance or substances are either\nadministratively stayed or judicially stayed or vacated, then the existing\nprovisions or limits for those substances specified in the transitional limits\ncolumns of table Z-1-A, table Z-2 or table Z-3 shall remain in effect until\nsuch stay is lifted, or indefinitely, if the limit is vacated. (4)\n\nEnforcement of the limits are\nindefinitely stayed for: aluminum alkyls; ethylidene norbornene; hexafluoracetone; mercury (alkyl compounds); oxygen difluoride; phenylphosphine; and sulfur pentafluoride; until OSHA publishes in the Federal\n\nRegister a notice that a sampling and analytical technique is available. TABLE Z-1-A. LIMITS FOR AIR\nCONTAMINANTS\nNOTE: Footnotes specfic only to a limited\nnumber of substances are also shown within the table. * The transitional PELs are 8-hour TWAs unless otherwise\nnoted; a (C) designation denotes a celing limit. ** Unless otherwise noted, employers in General Industry\n(i.e., those covered by 29 CFR\n1910\n) may use any combination of controls to\nachieve these limits until December 31, 1993 as set forth in\n29 CFR\n1910.1000(f). *** As determined from breathing-zone air samples; a\n\nParts of vapor or gas per\nmillion parts of contaminated air by volume at 25 degrees C and 760\ntorr. b\n\nMilligrams of substance per\ncubic meter of air. When a numerical entry for a substance is in the mg/m(3)\ncolumn and not in the ppm column, then the number in the mg/m(3) is exact. When\nnumerical entries for a substance are in both the ppm and mg/m(3) columns, then\nthe number in the ppm column is exact and the number in the mg/m(3) column may\nbe rounded off. c\n\nDuration is for 15 minutes, unless otherwise noted. d\n\nThe final benzene standard in\n1910.1028 applies to all occupational exposures to benzene except some\nsubsegments of industry where exposures are consistently under the action level\n(i.e., distribution and sale of fuels, sealed containers and pipelines, coke\nproduction, oil and gas drilling and production, natural gas processing, and\nthe percentage exclusion for liquid mixtures); for the excepted subsegment, the\nbenzene limits in table Z-2 apply. e\n\nExposures under 10,000 ppm ato\nbe cited de minimus. f\n\nThe CAS number is for\ninformation only.
