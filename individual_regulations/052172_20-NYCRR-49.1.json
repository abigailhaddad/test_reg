Tit. 20 § 49.1 - Utility rate reduction and credit\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 186-a(8)\n(a) Any\nfirst class\nutility\n(see section\n44.2\n[a]\nof this Title) that is subject to tax pursuant to section\n186-a\nof the Tax Law shall provide, in\naddition to any other discount, a three percent reduction in the rate charged\nfor gas, electricity, steam or water sold, or gas, electric, steam or water\nservice rendered, for ultimate consumption or use within an area designated as\nan economic development zone pursuant to article 18-B of the General Municipal\n\nLaw by a business that: (1)\nhas been\ncertified pursuant to article 18-B of the General Municipal Law or has applied\nfor such certification; (2)\nis\neither incorporated or unincorporated; (3)\nis not a retail enterprise; and\n(4)\nhas claimed an economic development zone\nwage tax credit under section\n210 (19), section\n606 (k), section\n1456 (e)\nor\nsection\n1511 (g)\nof the Tax Law, excluding carryovers of such credit, during the previous 15 months as evidenced\nby a certificate issued by the Commissioner of Taxation and Finance. (b) The Commissioner of Taxation\nand Finance shall issue a certificate evidencing that a business has claimed an\neconomic development zone wage tax credit during the previous 15 months. Such\ncertificate shall be valid for a period beginning on the date the economic\ndevelopment zone wage tax credit is claimed (the date the report is filed or if\nit is filed early, the date the report is due) and ending on a date 15 months\nafter the beginning date. (c) To\nobtain the utility rate reduction, a business must give the original of such\ncertificate to the utility. Such business must also certify to the utility, in\na written statement sworn to and subscribed before a notary public, that it is\nnot a retail enterprise. (d) The\n\"first class\" utility may apply an amount equal to 97 percent of such rate\nreductions during the taxable year as a credit against the tax for such year. To evidence its right to claim such credit, the utility must retain each\ncertificate and sworn statement received. (e) For purposes of this section, the term\nretail enterprise\nmeans a taxpayer which is a registered\nvendor under article 28 of the Tax Law and is primarily engaged in the retail\nsale (as such term is defined in section\n526.6\nof\nthis Title) of tangible personal property. A taxpayer is \"primarily engaged\" in\nsuch activity if more than 50 percent of its receipts are derived from retail\nsales. (f) The following example\nillustrates the computation of the credit: Utility A sells electricity to Business B, which qualifies\nto receive the 3 percent rate reduction. Utility A's rates include both a basic\ncommodity charge as well as an additional amount designed to reflect the\nvarious gross receipts taxes utility A is required to pay as the result of\nproviding utility services. Business B uses 500 kilowatt hours of electricity\nin August 1988. Business B's basic commodity charge for the month, including\nthe fuel adjustment, is $69.85. The additional amount designed to reflect the\nvarious gross receipts taxes of utility A for providing the utility services is\n$4.80. Basic commodity charge\n$69.85\n\nAdditional amount\n4.80\n\nTotal charge before rate reduction and sales tax\ncalculation*\n$74.65\n\nRate reduction\n3%\nReduction in cost of electricity to Business B\n$ 2.24\n\nCredit rate\n97%\nCredit to be claimed by Utility A\n$ 2.17\n*\nNote: This computation\nis irrelevant to the example and is not detailed.
