  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 550.1 - Background and intent\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Section\n31.35\nof\nthe Mental Hygiene Law imposes the requirement of criminal history record\nchecks on each prospective operator, employee, or volunteer of certain mental\nhealth treatment providers who will have regular and substantial unsupervised\nor unrestricted physical contact with the clients of such providers. (b) This legislation was intended to enable\nproviders of services to persons with mental illness to secure appropriate and\nproperly trained individuals to staff their facilities and programs, by\nverifying criminal history information received from individuals seeking\nemployment or volunteering their services. (c) Pursuant to Chapter 501 of the Laws of\n2012, Section\n553\nof the\n\nExecutive Law was subsequently enacted to give the Justice Center for the\n\nProtection of People with Special Needs the authority to review and evaluate\nthe criminal history information for any person applying to be an employee, volunteer, or consultant for whom a criminal background check is required by\nlaw as a condition of employment at any facilities or provider agencies\nlicensed, operated, or certified by the Office of Mental Health (excluding\n\nMental Hygiene Law Article 10 secure treatment units and programs operated in\nfacilities under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections and\n\nCommunity Supervision). A technical correction to Chapter 501 was made via\n\nChapter 83 of the Laws of 2013, to change the reference to the Office of Mental\n\nHealth to the Justice Center in Mental Hygiene Law Section 31.35. (d) The purpose of this Part is to establish\nstandards and procedures for criminal history record checks that must be\nfollowed by mental health treatment providers that are subject to the\nprovisions of Mental Hygiene Law Section 31.35.
