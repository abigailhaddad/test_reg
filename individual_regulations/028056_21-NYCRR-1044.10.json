  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1044.10 - Animals\n\nState Regulations\n(a) No person, except as otherwise provided in subdivision (b) of this section, may bring any\nanimal on or into any conveyance or facility unless enclosed in a container and\ncarried in a manner which would not annoy other passengers. (b) Subdivision (a) of this section does not\napply to working dogs for law enforcement agencies, to service animals which\nhave been trained or are being trained to aid or guide a person with a\ndisability and are accompanying persons with disabilities, or to service\nanimals which are being trained by a professional trainer. All service animals\nmust be harnessed or leashed. (c) Upon request by a police officer or other designated employee of MTABC or the\nauthority, a trainer must display proof of affiliation with professional\ntraining school and that the animal is a licensed service animal or an animal\nbeing trained as a service animal. Upon request of a police officer or\ndesignated MTABC or authority personnel, a passenger must provide evidence that\nan animal claimed to be a service animal and thus exempt from the provisions of\nsubdivision (a) of this section qualifies as such or is being trained as a\nservice animal. Such evidence may be supplied through: the display of a service\nanimal license issued by the New York City Department of Health, New York State\n\nDepartment of Agriculture and Markets or by other governmental agencies in New\n\nYork or elsewhere authorized to issue such licenses, the display of an\nidentification from a professional training school that the animal is a trained\nservice animal, the presence of a harness or a marking on a harness, or the\ncredible verbal assurances of the person with a disability using the service\nanimal or animal being trained as such. For purposes of this paragraph, credible verbal assurances may include a description of one or more tasks that\nthe animal performs or is being trained to perform for the benefit of the\nperson with a disability. (d) As an\nalternative to any of the methods described in subdivision (c) of this section\nfor providing evidence that an animal meets the definition of service animal, persons with disabilities who use service animals who do not have a service\nanimal license or other written documentation that the accompanying animal is a\nservice animal may apply to the authority for a service animal identification\ncard. (e) Police officers or\ndesignated MTABC or authority personnel have the right to refuse admission to\nor eject any passenger accompanied by an animal, including a service animal, which poses a direct threat to the safety of other\npassengers.
