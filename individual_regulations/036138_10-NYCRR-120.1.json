The following rules and regulations shall apply to the following reservoirs belonging to the public water supply of the City of Little Falls, NY, and to all lakes, ponds, streams and other watercourses tributary thereto: Beaver Brook Reservoir, Spruce Creek Reservoir, Klondike Reservoir and the distributing reservoir near the City of Little Falls. (b) Definitions.

(2)\n\nThe term watercourse wherever used in this section is intended to mean and comprise every spring, stream, ditch, gutter or other watercourse of any kind, the waters of which when running, whether continuously or occasionally, eventually flow or may flow into either of the above-named reservoirs of the public water supply of the City of Little Falls, N.Y. (3)\n\nWherever distances from reservoirs or watercourses are mentioned, they are intended to mean the horizontal distances from the high-water line of such reservoir or the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (c) Privies adjacent to reservoirs or watercourses. (1)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle of any kind used for either temporary storage or the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed or maintained with its nearest point within 50 feet of any reservoir or watercourse of the Little Falls water supply. (2)\n\nNo privy, privy vault, pit, cesspool or any other receptacle used for the permanent deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, located, placed or maintained with its nearest point within 250 feet of any reservoir or watercourse of the Little Falls water supply. For points one mile or more distant upstream from the Beaver Brook Reservoir, Spruce Creek Reservoir, and Klondike Reservoir, on tributaries thereto, the above restricted distances shall be 150 feet and for points four miles or more up stream from these reservoirs the restricting distance shall be 50 feet.

(4)\n\nThe excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacles shall be removed and the receptacles thoroughly cleansed and deodorized as often as may be found necessary in order to maintain the privy in proper sanitary condition and to effectually prevent any overflow upon the soil or upon the foundations or floor of the privy. In effecting this removal, the utmost care shall be exercised that none of the contents be allowed to escape while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal hereinafter specified and that the contents, while being transferred from the privy to the place of disposal, shall be thoroughly covered and that the least possible annoyance and inconvenience be caused to occupants of the premises and the adjacent premises. (5)\n\nUnless otherwise specifically ordered or permitted by the State Commissioner of Health, the excreta collected in the aforesaid receptacle shall, when removed, be disposed of by burying in trenches or by thoroughly digging it into the soil in such place and manner as to effectually prevent them being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow and at distances not less than 300 feet, horizontal measurement, from the high-water mark of any reservoir or not less than 200 feet from the edge, margin or precipitous bank of any watercourse of the Little Falls water supply. (6)\n\nWhenever it shall be found that, owing to the character of the soil or of the surface of the ground or owing to the height or flow of subsoil or surface water or other special local conditions, the excremental matter from any privy or aforesaid receptacle or from any trench or place of disposal may, in the opinion of the State Commissioner of Health, be washed over the surface or through the soil into any reservoir or watercourse, then the said privy or such receptacle for excreta or the said trench or place of disposal shall, after due notice to the owner thereof, be removed to such greater distance or to such place as shall be considered safe and proper by the State Commissioner of Health.
