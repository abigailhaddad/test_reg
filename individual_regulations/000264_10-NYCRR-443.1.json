  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 443.1 - Preface\n\nState Regulations\n[ 2000 ]\n(a) A Listing of Accounts is a listing of\naccount titles, with numerical symbols, used in the compilation of financial\ndata concerning the assets, liabilities, capital, revenues and expenses of an\nenterprise. (b) An outline of the\nrequired Listing of Accounts for hospitals is presented in this Part along with\nan explanation of the numerical coding system. A description of the nature and\ncontent of each account required to be used and reported is included in the\n\nDescription of Accounts, Part 444 of this Article. It is recognized, however, that it is impossible to develop a Listing of Accounts that will fulfill all\nthe requirements of all hospitals. Many hospitals will not require the detailed\ninformation provided for in the Listing of Accounts; others may require even\nmore detailed classification. The Listing of Accounts is designed (at the zero\nlevel, except where noted) to provide the basis for a minimum standard of\nuniform accounting and reporting which will meet the needs of management, regulators, planners and others. (c) Hospitals are required to use for\nreporting purposes all balance sheet accounts which have capitalized titles and\nwhich have numerical codes with a fourth digit of zero when such balance sheet\nitems exist. These accounts are referred to as zero level accounts. (d) Hospitals are required to use for\nreporting purposes all revenue and expense accounts which have capitalized\ntitles and which have numerical codes with a fourth digit of zero when such a\nfunction as defined in this manual exists even though the activity is not\nseparately organized within the hospital. The only circumstance under which the\nhospital need not report an existing zero level account is when the patient\nservice provided in a daily hospital services cost center is not provided in a\ndiscrete unit. (e) Since the zero\nlevel accounts presented in this manual are required, all zero level accounts\npresented herein, except as noted above, must be reported by the hospital\nwherever the related item or function exists in that hospital. A hospital will\nnot be granted an exception to the establishment of an account solely because\nof reporting difficulty. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§\n443.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
