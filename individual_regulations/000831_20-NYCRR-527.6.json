  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 527.6 - Storage of tangible personal property\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1105(c)(4)\n(a) Definition. Storage\nis the provision of a place for\nthe safekeeping of goods, without regard to the manner of payment or length of\ntime of the service. (b) Imposition. (1)\n\nThe tax is\nimposed on the sale, except for resale, of the service of storing tangible\npersonal property, and the rental of safe deposit boxes and similar\nspace. (2)\n\nWhile the tax is imposed\non the service of providing storage space, it is not imposed on the lease of\nreal property for storage. A lease can be distinguished from the provision of\nstorage space, in that under a lease, the tenant contracts for a certain amount\nof footage in a specific location, the tenant has unlimited control of access\nto the space, and may supply his own racks, cabinets and other physical\nfacilities. (3)\n\nWhile the tax is\nimposed on storage of vehicles, it is not imposed on parking or garaging of\nvehicles. The terms parking and garaging connote circumstances under which a\nperson has regular and immediate access to his vehicle. Example 1: A person moors his boat in a slip, at a marina, during the\nsummer months, and places it in storage on land during the winter months. The\ncharges for mooring are not taxable; the charges for storage are\ntaxable. Example 2: A person stores his goods at a warehouse, in whatever space\nthe warehouse company has available. The charges for such storage are\ntaxable. Example 3: A person stores his goods in a specific space in a\nbuilding, and no other person has access to the space assigned. This is storage\nof tangible personal property and the charges are taxable. Example 4: A consumer who uses a refrigerated locker in a public\nwarehouse to store a quantity of meat products must pay sales tax on the\nstorage charge even though commodity stored is itself exempt from tax. Example 5: The charge made by a hotel for safekeeping of its guests'\nvaluables is a charge similar to that made for use of a safe deposit box and is\ntaxable. (c) Exclusions. The storage of property held for sale in the regular course\nof business, and the sale of the service of storage for resale is not\ntaxable. Example 1: A furniture store maintaining part or all of its inventory\nin a public warehouse is not liable for tax on the storage charges because the\ntangible personal property is held for resale in the regular course of\nbusiness. Example 2: A cleaning establishment offering clothing storage services\nto its customers has the articles stored in the facilities of a public\nwarehouse. Since the storage service acquired by the cleaning establishment is\nresold, no tax is due on the charge by the warehouse to the cleaning\nestablishment. When billing the customer for storage services, the cleaning\nestablishment must charge sales tax at the rate in effect at the point where\nthe clothing is accepted for storage (either the customer's residence or\nlocation of the business) even though the storage facility may be located in an\narea having a different tax rate.
