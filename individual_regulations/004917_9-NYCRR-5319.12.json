  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.12 - Maintenance of critical memory\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Critical memory storage shall be maintained by a methodology that enables\nerrors to be identified. Such methodology may involve signatures, checksums, partial checksums, multiple copies, timestamps and/or effective use of validity\ncodes. This section is not intended to preclude the use of alternate storage\nmedia types, such as hard disk drives, for the retention of critical data. Such\nalternate storage media still are expected to maintain critical data integrity\nin a manner consistent with the requirements in this section, as applicable to\nthe specific storage technology implemented. (b) Comprehensive checks of critical memory\nshall be made following game initiation but prior to display of game outcome to\nthe player. It is recommended that critical memory be monitored continuously\nfor corruption. The methodology shall detect failures with an extremely high\nlevel of accuracy. (c) An\nunrecoverable corruption of critical memory shall result in an error. The\nmemory error shall not be cleared automatically and shall result in a tilt\ncondition, which facilitates the identification of the error and causes the\ngaming device to cease further function. The critical memory error shall also\ncause any communication external to the gaming device to cease immediately. An\nunrecoverable critical memory error shall require a full NV-memory-clear\nperformed by a person authorized by the gaming facility's approved system of\ninternal controls. (d) Non-volatile\nmemory space that is not critical to gaming device security (e.g., video or\nsound) is not required to be validated. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5319.12\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
