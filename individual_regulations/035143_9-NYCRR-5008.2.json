  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5008.2 - Payment of prizes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Calculation of prizes. Prizes for the LOTTO game shall be\ncalculated as follows: (1)\n\nThe prize money\nallocated from the prize pool to the first prize category, plus any money\nbrought forward from a previous drawing and any money added from the LOTTO\nprize fund reserve or any other available source pursuant to a guaranteed first\nprize amount announcement, will be divided equally by the number of game panels\nqualifying for a first prize. (2)\n\nThe prize money allocated from the prize pool to the second prize category, plus any money brought forward from a previous draw, will be divided equally by\nthe number of game panels qualifying for a second prize, less any adjustment\nrequired by paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (3)\n\nThe prize money allocated from the prize\npool to the third prize category will be divided equally by the number of game\npanels qualifying for a third prize, less any adjustment required by paragraph\n(5) of this subdivision. (4)\n\nThe\nprize money allocated from the prize pool to the fourth prize category will be\ndivided equally by the number of game panels qualifying for a fourth prize, less any adjustment required by paragraph (5) of this subdivision. (5)\nA prize in a minimum amount of $1 shall\nbe awarded to the fifth prize category. If there are insufficient prize monies\nto award a minimum of $1 to all fifth prize winners, then the second, third, and fourth prize allocations shall contribute equally to provide sufficient\nmonies to pay a minimum $1 fifth prize. (b) First-prize payments. Each first-prize payment shall be subject to the following provisions of this\nsubdivision. (1)\n\nIf, pursuant to subdivision\n(a)(1) of this section, the calculated share for each game panel qualifying for\na first prize in a particular LOTTO drawing would provide annual payments of\n$10,000 or more, a winner shall receive an initial payment in an amount as\nsimilar as possible to the first annuity payment. After providing for such a\nfirst payment, the commission, as authorized by the comptroller, shall invest\nthe remaining first-prize money in securities authorized by the State Finance\n\nLaw for the investment of state funds at current rates payable over a period of\nyears. From the returns of principal and earnings on such investment, the\ncommission shall pay annual prize installments to each first-prize winner. Such\nannual prize installments shall be payable for a term of years to be determined\nby the commission. The number of years in the term payment schedule may be\nchanged by the commission from time to time. Any such change will be publicly\nannounced by the commission. Such announcement may be made in a news release, an advertisement, on the commission website, or in such other form as the\ncommission, in the commission's discretion, may prescribe to maximize public\nawareness. LOTTO players may elect whether a first prize shall be payable in\ninstallments over a term of years in accordance with the foregoing provisions\nof this paragraph or, alternatively, whether a first prize shall be payable in\na lump sum. If a prize is awarded in a lump sum as a result of a player having\nelected that option, the amount of the lump-sum payment shall be equal to the\nfirst prize discounted to present value based upon market rates on the business\nday following the drawing, divided by the number of game panels qualifying for\na first prize. A jackpot prize shall be paid, at the election of a player made\nno later than 60 days after the player becomes entitled to the prize, with\neither an annuity or lump-sum payment. If the payment election is not made by a\nplayer within 60 days after the player becomes entitled to the prize, then the\nprize shall be paid as an annuity prize. An election to take a lump-sum payment\nmay be made at the time of the prize claim or within 60 days after the winner\nbecomes entitled to the prize. An election made after the winner becomes\nentitled to the prize is final and cannot be revoked, withdrawn or otherwise\nchanged without the approval of the commission. (2)\n\nIf, pursuant to subdivision (a)(1) of\nthis section, the calculated share for each game panel qualifying for a first\nprize in a particular LOTTO drawing would provide annual payments of less than\n$10,000, a winner shall receive the entire prize in a single payment. Such\npayment shall be equal to the first prize discounted to present value based\nupon market rates on the business day following the drawing, divided by the\nnumber of game panels qualifying for a first prize. (c) Carryovers and guaranteed prize\namounts. (1)\n\nIf in any LOTTO\ndrawing, there is no game panel eligible for a first prize, the amount\nallocated from the prize pool to the first-prize category, plus any amount\nbrought forward from a previous drawing, shall be added to the first-prize\ncategory for the next drawing. (2)\n\nIf the commission has announced a guaranteed first-prize amount for any LOTTO\ndrawing, and if the amount allocated from the winning pool to the first-prize\ncategory, plus any amount brought forward from a previous drawing, is\ninsufficient to pay the guaranteed first prize, then the amount necessary to\nfulfill the guarantee shall be added from the LOTTO prize-fund reserve or any\nother available source to the first-prize category. If, however, there is no\ngame panel qualifying for the first-prize category in such drawing, no amount\nfrom the LOTTO prize-fund reserve shall be brought forward to the first-prize\ncategory for the next drawing. If the commission has announced a guaranteed\nfirst-prize amount for any LOTTO drawing, and if the amount allocated from the\nwinning pool to the first-prize category, plus any amount brought forward from\na previous drawing, exceeds the amount necessary to pay the guaranteed first\nprize, then the excess may be allocated to the LOTTO prize-fund reserve\nestablished pursuant to section\n5008.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nIf, in any LOTTO drawing, there is no game panel qualifying for the second-prize category, the amount\nallocated from the winning pool to the second-prize category, plus any amount\nbrought forward from a previous drawing, shall be added to the second-prize\ncategory for the next drawing. (d) First-prize winners. First-prize winners shall receive payment not earlier than the 14th day after\nthe relevant draw date. (e) Rounding. For the purpose of calculating any prize to be paid, the calculation shall be rounded down so the prize can be paid in multiples of\none dollar. (f) One prize\nper game panel. The holder of a winning ticket may win only one prize\nper game panel in connection with the winning numbers drawn for a particular\nLOTTO game, but shall be entitled to the highest prize won by those\nnumbers.
