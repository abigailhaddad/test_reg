COMBINATION RESPIRATORS\nAny combination of air-purifying and\natmosphere- supplying respirators\n\nProtection factor for type and mode of operation as\nlisted above\n30 CFR\n11, Sec. 11.63(b)\n*\n*\nThe documents referenced in this\n\nPart are available for review and copying at the New York State Department of\n\nLabor, State Campus, Building 12, Room 509, Albany, NY or the New York State\n\nDepartment of State, 162 Washington Ave., Albany, NY. 1\n\nFor use in the selection of\nrespiratory protective equipment to be used only where the contaminants have\nbeen identified and the concentrations, or possible concentrations, are\nknown. 2\n\nOnly for shaven faces and where\nnothing interferes with the seal of tight-fitting facepieces against the skin. Hoods and suits are expected. 3\n\nThe mode symbols are defined as\nfollows: CF = continuous flow\nD = demand\nNP = negative pressure, that is, negative phase during\ninhalation\nPD =pressure demand, that is, always positive pressure\nPP =positive pressure\nRD = demand, recirculating or closed circuit\nRP = pressure demand, recirculating or closed circuit\n4\n(a) The protection factor is a\nmeasure of the degree of protection afforded by a respirator, defined as the\nratio of the concentration of airborne radioactive material outside the\nrespiratory protective equipment to that inside the equipment, usually inside\nthe facepiece, under conditions of use. It is applied to the ambient airborne\nconcentration to estimate the concentrations inhaled by the wearer according to\nthe following formula: Concentration inhaled =\nAmbient airborne\nconcentration\n/\nProtection Factor\n(b) The protection factors apply: (i) Only for individuals trained in using respirators and\nwearing properly fitted respirators that are used and maintained under\nsupervision in a well-planned respiratory protective program. (ii) For air-purifying respirators only when high efficiency\nparticulate filters, above 99.97 percent removal efficiency by thermally\ngenerated 0.3 1/4m dioctyl phthalate (DOP) test or equivalent, are used in\natmospheres not deficient in oxygen and not containing radioactive gas or vapor\nrespiratory hazards. (iii) No adjustment is to be made for the use of sorbents\nagainst radioactive material in the form of gases or vapors. (iv) For atmosphere-supplying respirators only when supplied\nwith adequate respirable air. Respirable air shall be provided of the quality\nand quantity required in accordance with the National Institute for\n\nOccupational Safety and Health and the Mine Safety and Health Administration\ncertification described in 30 CFR\n11. Oxygen and air shall not be used in the\nsame apparatus. 5\n\nExcluding radioactive contaminants\nthat present an absorption or submersion hazard. For tritium oxide, approximately one-third of the intake occurs by absorption through the skin so\nthat an overall protection factor of less than 2 is appropriate when\natmosphere-supplying respirators are used to protect against tritium oxide. If\nthe protection factor for respiratory protective equipment is 5, the effective\nprotection factor for tritium is about 1.4; with protection factors of 10, the\neffective factor for tritium oxide is about 1.7; and with protection factors of\n100 or more, the effective factor for tritium oxide is about 1.9. Air-purifying\nrespirators are not suitable for protection against tritium oxide. See also\nfootnote\n9\nconcerning supplied-air suits. 6\n\nCanisters and cartridges shall not\nbe used beyond service-life limitations. 7\n\nUnder-chin type only. This type of\nrespirator is not satisfactory for use where it might be possible, such as, if\nan accident or emergency were to occur, for the ambient airborne concentrations\nto reach instantaneous values greater than 10 times the pertinent values in\n\nAppendix A-13, Table I, column 3. This type of respirator is not suitable for\nprotection against plutonium or other high-toxicity materials. The mask is to\nbe tested for fit prior to use, each time it is donned. 8\n(a) Equipment shall be operated in\na manner that ensures that proper air flow-rates are maintained. A protection\nfactor of no more than 1000 may be utilized for tested-and-certified\nsupplied-air hoods when a minimum air flow of 6 cubic feet per minute (0.17 m\n3\n/min) is maintained and calibrated air\nline pressure gauges or flow measuirng devices are used. A protection factor of\nup to 2000 may be used for tested and certified hoods only when the air flow is\nmaintained at the manufacturer's recommended maximum rate for the equipment, this rate is greater than 6 cubic feet per minute (0.17 m\n3\n/min) and calibrated air line pressure\ngauges or flow measuring devices are used. (b) The design of the supplied-air hood or helmet, with a\nminimum flow of 6 cubic feet per minute (0.17 m\n3\n/min) of air, may determine its overall\nefficiency and the protection it provides. For example, some hoods aspirate\ncontaminated air into the beathing zone when the wearer works with\nhands-over-head. This aspiration may be overcome if a short cape-like extension\nto the hood is worn under a coat or overalls. Other limitations specified by\nthe approval agency shall be considered before using a hood in certain types of\natmospheres. See footnote\n9. 9\n\nAppropriate protection factors\nshall be determined, taking into account the design of the suit and its\npermeability to the contaminant under conditions of use. There shall be a\nstandby rescue person equipped with a respirator or other apparatus appropriate\nfor the potential hazards and communications equipment whenever supplied-air\nsuits are used. 10\n\nNo approval schedules are\ncurrently available for this equipment. Equipment is to be evaluated by testing\nor on the basis of reliable test information. 11\n\nThis type of respirator may\nprovided greater protection and be used as an emergency device in unknown\nconcentrations for protection against inhalation hazards. External radiation\nhazards and other limitations to permitted exposure, such as skin absorption, must be taken into account in such circumstances. 12\n\nQuantitative fit testing shall be\nperformed on each individual, and no more than 0.02 percent leakage is allowed\nwith this type of apparatus. Perceptible outward leakage of gas from this or\nany positive pressure self-contained breathing apparatus is unacceptable\nbecause service life will be reduced substantially. Special training in the use\nof this type of apparatus shall be provided to the wearer. Note 1: Protection factors for respirators\napproved by the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the National Institute for\n\nOccupational Safety and Health, according to applicable approvals for\nrespirators for type and mode of use to protect against airborne radionuclides, may be used to the extent that they do not exceed the protection factors listed\nin this table. The protection factors listed in this table may not be\nappropriate to circumstances where chemical or other respiratory hazards exist\nin addition to radioactive hazards. The selection and use of respirators for\nsuch circumstances should take into account applicable approvals of the U.S. Bureau of Mines and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth. Note 2: Radioactive contaminants, for which\nthe concentration values in Appendix A-13, Table I, column 3 are based on\ninternal dose due to inhalation, may present external exposure hazards at\nhigher concentrations. Under these circumstances, limitations on occupancy may\nhave to be governed by external dose limits.

(2) uc/gm for solids. Note 1: Many radionuclides disintegrate into daughter products which\nare also radioactive. In expressing the concentations in Table 2 the activity\nstated is that of the parent radionuclide and takes into account the\nradioactive daughter products. Note 2: For purposes of Table 1, subdivision (a), where there is\npresent a combination of radionuclides, the limit for the combination shall be\nderived as follows: Determine for each radionuclide present the radio between\nthe concentration of the radionuclide in the combination and the exempt\nconcentration lised in Table 2. The sum of such ratios shall not exceed\nunity. Example. (1) Values are given only for those radionuclides normally used\nas gases. (2) uc/gm for solids. Concentration of Radionuclide A in Combination/Exempt\nconcentration of Radionuclide A + Concentration of Radionuclide B in\n\nCombination/Exempt concentration of Radionuclide B < =1\n\nFootnotes\na Where surface contamination by both alpha and beta-gamma\nemitting nuclides exists, the limits established for alpha and beta-gamma\nemitting nuclides should apply independently. b As used in this table, dpm (disintegrations per minute) means\nthe rate of emission by radioactive material as determined by correcting the\ncounts per minute observed by an appropriate detector for background, efficiency, and geometric factors associated with the instrumentation. c Measurements of average contamination level should not be\naveraged over more than one square meter. For objects of less surface area, the\naverage should be derived for each object. d The maximum contamination level applies to an area of not\nmore than 100 cm\n2. e The amount of removable radioactive material per 100\ncm\n2\nof surface area should be determined by wiping\nthat area with dry filter or soft absorbent paper, applying moderate pressure, and assessing the amount of radioactive material on the wipe with an\nappropriate instrument of known efficiency. When removable contamination on\nobjects of less surface area is determined, the pertinent levels should be\nreduced proportionally and the entire surface should be wiped. f The average and maximum radiation levels associated with\nsurface contamination resulting from beta-gamma emitters should not exceed 0.2\nmrad/hr at 1 centimeter and 1.0 mrad/hr at 1 centimeter, respectively, measured\nthrough not more than 7 mg/cm\n2\nof total\nabsorber. 1 For combinations of radioactive materials, consideration of\nthe need for an emergency plan is required if the sum of the ratios of each\nquantity of each radioactive material authorized to the quantity listed for\nthat material in Table 7 exceeds one. 2 Waste packaged in Type B containers does not require an\nemergency plan.
