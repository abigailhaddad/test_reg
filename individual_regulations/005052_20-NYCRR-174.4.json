  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 174.4 - Use of preprinted forms\n\nState Regulations\n\nEmployers should use the preprinted forms furnished to\nthem by the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance for the purpose\nof filing their New York State employer's returns of tax withheld (form WT-1)\nand/or their quarterly combined withholding and wage reporting returns. Where\nthis is impractical, the employer must exercise extreme care to show the\nemployer's name and identification number exactly as they appear on previous\nrelated forms. If an employer's preprinted forms are lost or damaged so as to\nrequire replacement, the employer should follow the instructions contained in\n\nPublication WT-100, \"New York State Withholding Tax Guide.\"\nNotes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20\n§\n174.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
