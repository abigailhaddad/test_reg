  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 §§ 360-4.8 - Determination of financial eligibility; effect of excess income and resources on eligibility\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Financial eligibility. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this subdivision, an applicant/recipient is financially\neligible for MA if his or her net available income and net available resources\ndo not exceed the appropriate standards. The standards are found in section\n360-4.7\nof this Subpart. (2)\n(i) A\npregnant woman is financially eligible for MA if her net available income does\nnot exceed the highest of the following three items: the applicable MA\nstandard; the applicable PA standard of need; or 100 percent of the applicable\npoverty line listed in section\n360-4.7\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (ii)\nA pregnant woman\nis financially eligible for comprehensive prenatal care services available\nunder the Prenatal Care Assistance Program, as listed in Public Health Law, section\n2522, if her\nnet available income exceeds the highest of the three items listed in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph but does not exceed 185 percent of the\napplicable poverty line listed in section\n360-4.7\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (3)\n\nAn\ninfant younger than one year of age is financially eligible for MA if his or\nher net available household income does not exceed 185 percent of the\napplicable Federal poverty line set forth in section\n360-4.7\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (4)\nA child at least\none year of age but younger than six years of age is financially eligible for\nMA if his or her net available household income does not exceed 133 percent of\nthe applicable Federal poverty line set forth in section 360-47(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (5)\nA child born after\n\nSeptember 30, 1983 who is at least six years of age but younger than 19 years\nof age is financially eligible for MA if his or her net available household\nincome does not exceed 100 percent of the applicable Federal poverty line set\nforth in section\n360-4.7\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. (6)\n\nApplicants/recipients who are financially eligible under paragraphs (1) through\n(5) of this subdivision will be authorized to receive MA if they also meet the\nnonfinancial eligibility requirements. The nonfinancial eligibility\nrequirements are found in Subpart 360-3 of this Part. (b) Reduction of excess resources. An MA\napplicant/recipient whose net available resources exceed the resource standards\nwill be ineligible for MA until he/she incurs medical expenses equal to or\ngreater than the excess resources. However, nonexempt resources transferred for\nless than their fair market value may still be considered available, under\nsection\n360-4.4\n(c) of\nthis Subpart. (c) Reduction of\nexcess income. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in\nparagraphs (4) and (5) of this subdivision, if an otherwise eligible MA\napplicant's or recipient's net available income exceeds the appropriate income\nstandard, he or she will be eligible for MA only after incurring medical\nexpenses equal to or greater than the amount of excess income, provided such\nmedical expenses are not subject to payment by a third party other than another\npublic program of the State or any of its political subdivisions. Once\ndeduction of incurred medical expenses reduces income to the income standard, the MA applicant or recipient is eligible for MA; however, no MA payment will\nbe made for those incurred medical expenses used to establish eligibility. The\nsocial services district will deduct from the MA applicant's income the\nfollowing medical expenses incurred by the applicant, by family members living\nwith the applicant for whom the applicant is legally responsible, and by\nlegally responsible relatives living with the applicant, in the order listed\nbelow and regardless of whether these expenses are subject to payment by\nanother public program of the State or any of its political subdivisions: (i) expenses incurred for Medicare and other\nhealth insurance premiums, deductibles, or coinsurance charges; (ii)\nexpenses incurred for necessary medical\nand remedial services that are recognized under State law but are not covered\nby MA; and\n(iii)\nexpenses incurred\nfor necessary medical and remedial services that are covered under the MA\nprogram. (2)\n\nBudgeting\nperiods. (i) To be eligible for MA coverage\nfor acute care in a medical facility, an applicant/recipient must incur medical\nexpenses equal to or greater than the amount of his/her excess income for a\nperiod of six months. Once that amount of medical expenses has been incurred, the applicant/recipient may receive full MA coverage for a period of six\nmonths. (ii)\n\nTo be eligible for MA\ncoverage of all medical care, services and supplies outside the medical\nfacility, as well as prosthetic appliances (including dentures), the\napplicant/recipient must incur medical expenses in the month equal to or\ngreater than the amount of his/her excess monthly income. When that amount of\nmedical expenses has been incurred, the applicant/recipient will receive MA\noutpatient coverage for any additional medical expenses incurred in that\nmonth. (iii)\n\nIf an MA recipient\nregularly receives home care in the community but is temporarily absent from\nthe home to receive respite care for a fixed period of up to four weeks in an\nintermediate care facility, skilled nursing facility, or residential health\ncare facility, he/she will be eligible for MA coverage of the respite care for\neach month in which incurred medical expenses are at least equal to the amount\nof monthly excess income. Respite care is infrequent and temporary substitute\ncare or supervision provided to a person on behalf of and in the absence of the\ncaregiver, in order to relieve the caregiver from the stresses or\nresponsibilities of providing constant care and to enable the caregiver to\nmaintain a normal routine. Respite care must be provided in accordance with the\nterms of approved Federal waivers. (3)\n\nFor services regularly requiring prior\napproval, after the social services district tells the recipient the amount of\nservices that are medically necessary for him/her, as determined by the\ndistrict according to applicable regulations, additional medical services over\nand above the amount which is medically necessary cannot be used to reduce the\namount of the recipient's excess income. (4)\n\nExcept as provided in paragraph (5) of\nthis subdivision, a social services district will authorize MA for an otherwise\neligible MA applicant or recipient who pays to the district the amount that his\nor her net available income exceeds the appropriate income standard, provided\nthat the district submits to the department and receives approval of a plan for\nthe pre-payment of excess income. (i) A plan\nfor the pre-payment of excess income must provide that: (a) the MA applicant or recipient has the\noption of participating in the pre-payment program; (b) the MA applicant or recipient must pay to\nthe social services district the amount that his or her net available income\nexceeds the appropriate income standard for the budgeting period specified in\nparagraph (2) of this subdivision, minus the amount of any medical expenses\nincurred during the budgeting period or credited pursuant to subparagraph (iii)\nof this paragraph which are not payable by the MA program; (c) the social services district must\nsafeguard the amounts paid to it by an MA recipient who participates in the\npre-payment program by depositing such amounts in a special pre-payment\naccount. (d) the social services\ndistrict must periodically reconcile the amount in the MA recipient's\npre-payment account with the amount of MA payments made on his or her behalf\nfor the budgeting period specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision to\ndetermine if a refund to the MA recipient or credit to the MA recipient's\npre-payment account for subsequent spenddown period(s) is appropriate; and\n(e) the social services\ndistrict must report to the department the pre-payment amounts collected minus\nany refunds made pursuant to subparagraph (iii) of this paragraph. (ii)\nA plan for the pre-payment of\nexcess income must include a detailed description of how the social services\ndistrict will: (a) administer the pre-payment\nprogram; (b) enroll MA applicants\nand recipients; and\n(c) meet the\nrequirements of subparagraphs (i) and (iii) of this paragraph. (iii)\n\nRefunds and credits. (a) If an MA recipient makes a payment\npursuant to this paragraph and then incurs medical expenses during the\nbudgeting period that are not payable by MA, the social services district must: (1)\nprefund to the MA recipient the amount of\nsuch medical expenses from the recipient's pre-payment account for that\nbudgeting period. If the amount of such medical expenses exceeds the MA\nrecipient's pre-payment account for that budgeting period, the district must\ncredit the remainder to the MA recipient's pre-payment account for the\nsubsequent spenddown period(s); or\n(2)\ncredit the amount of such medical\nexpenses to the MA recipient's pre-payment account for the subsequent spenddown\nperiod(s). A plan for the pre-payment of excess income may provide\nfor the social services district to make this refund separately as described in\nthis clause or as part of the periodic refund described in clause (b) of this\nsubparagraph. (b) The social services district will\nperiodically compare the amount in the MA recipient's pre-payment account, minus any amount to be refunded for medical expenses which are not payable by\nMA, to the amount of MA payments made on his or her behalf for the budgeting\nperiod specified in paragraph (2) of this subdivision. If the former exceeds\nthe latter, the social services district must periodically refund the\ndifference to the MA recipient or credit the difference to the recipient's\npre-payment account for the subsequent spenddown period(s). (iv)\n\nWhen a social services\ndistrict submits a pre-payment plan for excess income to the department for\napproval, the department will approve, disapprove, or request the social\nservices district to modify such plan within 90 days of receipt of the\nplan.
