  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 399.9 - Penalties\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For\nadministrative food stamp fraud (pre-August 1, 1983 acts). Individuals found to\nhave committed fraud through an administrative food stamp fraud hearing shall\nbe ineligible to participate in the Food Stamp Program for three months. The\nperiod is three months regardless of either the amount of food stamps\nfraudulently obtained or the number of fraudulent acts found in the hearing\ndecision to have been committed. (b) Individuals found guilty of criminal or\ncivil fraud by a court of appropriate jurisdiction where the acts of fraud all\noccurred prior to August 1, 1983, shall be ineligible to participate for not\nless than 6 months and not more than 24 months as determined by the court. Provided, however, that if the court fails to specify or address a\ndisqualification period for the fraudulent act(s), the local social services\ndistrict shall impose a 6-month disqualification period unless it is contrary\nto the court order. (c) For\nintentional program violation(s) (acts committed on or after August 1, 1983), individuals found to have committed an intentional program violation either\nthrough an administrative disqualification hearing or by a court of appropriate\njurisidiction, or who have signed either a waiver of right to an administrative\ndisqualification hearing or a disqualification consent agreement in cases\nreferred for prosecution, shall be ineligible to participate in the Food Stamp\n\nProgram for 6 months for the first violation, 12 months for the second\nviolation and permanently for the third violation. However, one or more acts of\nadministrative food stamp fraud which occurred prior to August 1, 1983, shall\nbe considered as only one violation for purposes of applying the\ndisqualification rules above. (d) Court determination. If a court of appropriate jurisdiction determines that an\nindividual has engaged in conduct that would constitute fraud as defined in\nsubdivision (a) of this section or an intentional program violation as defined\nin subdivision (c) of this section, the local social services district must\nimpose the penalties specified in this section. (1)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nsubdivision (c) of this section, an individual found guilty of an intentional\nprogram violation must be disqualified for the length of time specified by the\ncourt, if the court has imposed a disqualification period for such a\nviolation. (2)\n\nIf a court fails to\nimpose a disqualification period for an intentional program violation, the\nlocal social services district must impose the disqualification penalties\nspecified in subdivision (c) of this section, unless such imposition is\ncontrary to the court order. (3)\n\nIf\ndisqualification is ordered but a date for initiating the disqualification\nperiod is not specified, the local social services district must initiate the\ndisqualification period for currently eligible individuals within 45 days of\nthe date the disqualification was ordered. Any other disqualification imposed\nas the result of a court determination must begin within 45 days of the date\nthe court found that a currently eligible individual engaged in conduct\ndetermined to be civil or criminal misrepresentation or fraud. (e) Administrative determinations. The local social services district must disqualify the individual(s) found to\nhave committed an intentional program violation, or who have signed a waiver of\nright to an administrative disqualification hearing or disqualification consent\nagreement in cases referred for prosecution, but not the entire household of\nsuch individual(s), except as provided in subdivision (f) of this section. (1)\nA disqualified individual is ineligible\nto participate in the food stamp program for the periods provided in\nsubdivision (c) of this section. (2)\n\nIf an individual signs a disqualification\nconsent agreement, the period of disqualification begins within 45 days of the\ndate the individual signed the disqualification consent agreement unless a\ncourt imposes a disqualification period or specifies the date for initiating\nthe disqualification period, in which event the local social services district\nwill disqualify the individual in accordance with the court order. (3)\n\nIf an individual has signed a waiver of\nright to an administrative disqualification hearing or has been found to have\ncommitted an intentional program violation through an administrative\ndisqualification hearing, the period of disqualification will begin with the\nfirst month which follows the date the individual receives written notification\nof the disqualification. (f) The remaining household members in the\nhousehold in which an individual has been found to have committed an\nintentional program violation shall agree to make restitution within 30 days of\nthe date that the local social services district's demand letter is mailed or\nthe household's monthly allotment shall be reduced. If the remaining members\nagree to make restitution but fail to do so, the local social services district\nshall impose an allotment reduction on the household's monthly allotment. The\nremaining household members, if any, shall begin restitution during the period\nof disqualification imposed by the local district or a court of law. (g) Method of imposition. (1)\n\nIf there is a determination that a\nhousehold member has committed fraud or an intentional program violation, the\nlocal social services district must take immediate action to disqualify the\nindividual as set forth in sections\n399.6\n(h) and\n399.7\n(j) of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nIf the individual is not\neligible for or participating in the food stamp program at the time the\ndisqualification period is to begin, the period will be postponed until the\nindividual applies for and is determined eligible for benefits. (3)\n\nOnce a disqualification penalty has been\nimposed against a currently participating household member, the period of\ndisqualification continues uninterrupted until completed regardless of the\neligibility of the disqualified member's household. However, the disqualified\nmember's household continues to be responsible for repayment of the\nover-issuance which resulted from the disqualified member's intentional program\nviolation regardless of the household's eligibility for food stamps. (h) Reporting requirements. Local\ndistricts must report to the State Food Stamp Bureau information on individuals\nwho have been found to have committed food stamp fraud/intentional program\nviolation by a hearing decision or a court or who have signed a waiver of\nhearing or a disqualification consent agreement. The following data must be\nsubmitted on each individual: (1)\nfull\nname; (2)\nsocial security\nnumber; (3)\ndate of\nbirth; (4)\nnumber of\ndisqualification(s) (1st, 2nd, 3rd); (5)\ndate disqualification took effect for a\ncurrently otherwise eligible individual; and\n(6)\nlength of disqualification imposed or to\nbe imposed. This information is to be submitted no later than 20 days\nafter the date the disqualification took effect or would have taken effect for\na currently ineligible individual whose disqualification is pending future\neligibility and is to be updated by local districts where\nappropriate.
