  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 1960.7 - Pretreatment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Categorical\npretreatment standards. (1)\n\nNo person shall\ndischarge or cause to be discharged to any wastewater facilities, wastewaters\ncontaining substances subject to an applicable categorical pretreatment\nstandard promulgated by USEPA in excess of the quantity prescribed in such\napplicable pretreatment standards, except as otherwise provided in this\nsection. Categorical pretreatment standards found in 40 CFR parts\n405\n-\n471\nare\nhereby incorporated by reference, as enforceable conditions of this\n\nPart. (2)\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR part\n403.12 within 180 days after the effective date of a categorical pretreatment\nstandard or within 180 days after a final category determination submission\nunder 40 CFR part\n403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing industrial users\nsubject to such categorical pretreatment standards and currently discharging or\nscheduled to discharge to the water board POTW shall be required to submit to\nthe water board a baseline monitoring report (BMR). The BMR shall contain at a\nminimum: identification of the facility, indicate the permits held, describe\noperations, and contain flow and pollutant measurements, compliance\ncertification by a qualified professional, and the signature of an authorized\nrepresentative of the industrial user. (3)\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR part\n403.12(b) at\nleast 90 days prior to commencement of a new source, and sources that become\nindustrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical\npretreatment standard, shall be required to submit a BMR which contains at a\nminimum: identification of the facility, indication of the permits held, description of operations and contain flow and pollutant\nmeasurements. (4)\n\nAs required by 40\nCFR part\n403.12(d), a CIU must submit a report within 90 days after the final\ncompliance date, or for a new source, following the commencement of its\ndischarge, which contains: flow and pollutant measurements, a certification by\na qualified individual indicating whether pretreatment standards are being\nconsistently met, and if not whether additional operation and maintenance\nand/or additional pretreatment is required. (5)\n\nUpon application by an SIU, the director\nmay, subsequent to being granted such authority by the approval authority, revise any limitations on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment\nstandards to reflect removal of the substances by the water board's POTW to the\nextent that such revision is allowable under applicable Federal and State\nregulations, and that such revision would not cause an unacceptable decline in\nthe quality of the water board's POTW sludge. (6)\n\nUpon application by an SIU, the director\nmay, subsequent to being granted such authority by the approval authority, revise any limitation on substances specified in the applicable pretreatment\nstandards to consider factors relating to that SIU which are fundamentally\ndifferent from the factors considered by USEPA during the development of the\npretreatment standard to the extent that such adjustment is allowable under\napplicable Federal and State regulations. Requests for and determinations of a\nfundamentally different adjustment shall be in accordance with all applicable\n\nFederal and State regulations. (7)\n\nThe director shall notify any SIU affected by the provisions of this section\nand shall establish a reasonable and enforceable compliance schedule for each. However, industrial users are required to comply with the provisions of this\nsection regardless of whether the water board has notified the industrial user\nof such categorical pretreatment standards. (b) Reporting and compliance with\npretreatment regulations. (1)\n\nAll SIUs, including significant non-categorical users, and CIUs shall submit to the water\nboard, at least once every six months (February and August), a report\ndescribing the nature, concentration, mass (lbs/ day), and flow of pollutants\ndischarged from the user's property or facilities. These periodic compliance\nreports shall be based on sampling and analysis performed in the period covered\nby the report, and performed in accordance with the analysis procedures as\nnoted in 40 CFR part\n403.12(h). (2)\n\nAll reports, including BMRs, compliance reports regarding categorical\nstandards, 90-day compliance reports, periodic compliance reports and any\ncompliance schedule progress reports shall contain a certification statement\nwhich shall read: \"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all\nattachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with\na system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and\nevaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or\npersons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for\ngathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my\nknowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are\nsignificant penalties for submitting false information, including the\npossibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.\"\nand shall be signed by an authorized representative of\nindustrial user pursuant to 40 CFR part\n403.12(l). (3)\n\nCompliance schedules issued to require\nindustrial users to comply with pretreatment standards or categorical\npretreatment standards shall contain milestone dates for implementing necessary\npretreatment required to meet the applicable standard. No later than 14 days\nfollowing each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, the\nindustrial user shall submit a progress report to the water board, including, at a minimum, whether it complied with the increment of progress to be met on\nsuch date and, if not, the date on which it expects to comply with this\nincrement of progress; the reason for the delay; and the steps being taken to\nreturn to the schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between\nsuch progress reports to the water board. (4)\n\nPursuant to 40 CFR part\n403.12(j), all\nindustrial users shall notify the water board, the State and USEPA, in writing, of any discharge which would be considered hazardous waste, including the\nlisted or characteristic hazardous wastes, which if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR part\n261. (5)\n\nThe director may impose mass limitations\non industrial users as, in his judgment, may be required to meet applicable\npretreatment standards or requirements. In such cases, the report required by\nsubdivision (a) of this section shall indicate the mass of pollutants regulated\nby pretreatment standards in the effluent. These reports shall contain the\nresults of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the\nnature and concentration, or production and mass where requested by the\ndirector, of pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable\npretreatment standards. All analyses shall be performed in accordance with\nprocedure established and contained in 40 CFR, part\n403.12. (6)\n\nWhen pretreatment regulations are adopted\nby USEPA or NYSDEC for any industry, that industry shall conform to the USEPA\nor NYSDEC time-table for adherence to Federal or State pretreatment\nrequirements and any other applicable requirements promulgated by USEPA or\nNYSDEC in accordance with section 307 of the Clean Water Act. Additionally, such industries shall comply with any more stringent standards necessitated by\nlocal conditions as determined by the water board. (7)\n\nIf pretreatment or equalization of\nwastewater flows is permitted or directed by the director, the design of such\npretreatment process or equipment for wastewater flow equalization shall be\nsubject to the review and approval of the director prior to installation. Such\npretreatment or wastewater flow equalization facilities, where permitted or\ndirected, shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective\noperations by the owner or user at his own expense. (8)\n\nNo user shall increase the use of process\nwater or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or complete\nsubstitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations\ncontained in the pretreatment standards, or in any other pollutant specific\nlimitation developed by the water board or State. (c) Effect of Federal law. In the event that\nthe Federal government promulgates a regulation for a given new or existing\nuser in a specific industrial subcategory that establishes categorical\npretreatment standards or establishes that such a user is exempt from\ncategorical pretreatment standards, such Federal regulations shall immediately\nsupersede this section.
