  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 376.4 - Treatment standards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability of treatment standards. (1)\nA prohibited waste identified in the\ntable \"Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes\" may be land disposed only if\nit meets the requirements found in the table. For each waste, the table\nidentifies one of three types of treatment standard requirements: (i) all hazardous constituents in the waste\nor in the treatment residue must be at or below the values found in the table\nfor that waste (\"total waste standards\"); or\n(ii)\nthe hazardous constituents in the\nextract of the waste or in the extract of the treatment residue must be at or\nbelow the values found in the table (\"waste extract standards\"); or\n(iii)\nthe waste must be treated using the\ntechnology specified in the table (\"technology standard\"), which are described\nin detail in subdivision (c) of this section, Table 1-Technology Codes and\n\nDescription of Technology-Based Standards. (2)\n\nFor wastewaters, compliance with\nconcentration level standards is based on maximums for any one day, except for\nD004 through D011 wastes for which the previously promulgated treatment\nstandards based on grab samples remain in effect. For all nonwastewaters, compliance with concentration level standards is based on grab sampling. For\nwastes covered by the waste extract standards, the test method 1311, the\ntoxicity characteristic leaching procedure found in \"Test Methods for\n\nEvaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical Methods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, must be used to measure compliance. An exception is made for D004 and\nD008, for which either of two test methods may be used: method 1311, or method\n1310B, the extraction procedure toxicity test. For wastes covered by a\ntechnology standard, the wastes may be land disposed after being treated using\nthat specified technology or an equivalent treatment technology approved by the\ndepartment under the procedures set forth in paragraph (c)(2) of this\nsection. (3)\n\nWhen wastes with\ndiffering treatment standards for a constituent of concern are combined for\npurposes of treatment, the treatment residue must meet the lowest treatment\nstandard for the constituent of concern. (4)\n\nNotwithstanding the prohibitions\nspecified in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, treatment and disposal\nfacilities may demonstrate (and certify pursuant to section\n376.1\n[g][2][iv]\nof\nthis Part) compliance with the treatment standards for organic constituents\nspecified by a footnote in the table \"Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes\"\nin this subdivision, provided the following conditions are satisfied: (i) the treatment standards for the organic\nconstituents were established based on incineration in units operated in\naccordance with the technical requirements of section\n373-2.15\nof this Title, or based on\ncombustion in fuel substitution units operating in accordance with applicable\ntechnical requirements; (ii)\nthe\ntreatment or disposal facility has used the methods referenced in subparagraph\n(i) of this paragraph to treat the organic constituents; and\n(iii)\nthe treatment or disposal facility may\ndemonstrate compliance with organic constituents if good-faith analytical\nefforts achieve detection limits for the regulated organic constituents that do\nnot exceed the treatment standards specified in this subdivision by an order of\nmagnitude. (5)\n\nFor\ncharacteristic wastes (D001 through D043) that are subject to treatment\nstandards in the following table \"Treatment Standards for Hazardous Wastes,\"\nand are not managed in a wastewater treatment system that is regulated under\nthe Clean Water Act (CWA), that is CWA- equivalent, or that is injected into a\n\nClass I nonhazardous deep injection well, all underlying hazardous constituents\n(as defined in section\n376.1\n[b][1]\nof\nthis Part) must meet universal treatment standards, found in subdivision (j) of\nthis section, Table Universal Treatment Standards (UTS), prior to land disposal\nas defined in section\n376.1\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Part. (6)\n\nThe treatment\nstandards for F001-F005 nonwastewater constituents carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol apply to wastes which contain only one, two, or\nthree of these constituents. Compliance is measured for these constituents in\nthe waste extract from test method 1311, the toxicity characteristic leaching\nprocedure found in \"Test Methods for Evaluating Solid Waste, Physical/Chemical\n\nMethods,\" EPA Publication SW-846, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. If the waste contains any of these three constituents along with any of\nthe other 25 constituents found in F001-F005, then compliance with treatment\nstandards for carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and/or methanol are not\nrequired. (7)\n\nBetween August 26, 1996 and March 4, 1999 the treatment standards for listed carbamate wastes\nspecified in section\n371.4\n(c) of this\n\nTitle as EPA hazardous waste numbers K156-K161, and section in 371.4(d) of this\n\nTitle as EPA hazardous waste numbers P127, P128, P185, P188-P192, P194, P196-P199, P201-P205, U271, U277-U280, U364-U367, U372-U373, U375-U379, U381-U387, U389-U396, U400-U404, U407, and U409-U411; and soil contaminated\nwith these wastes; may be satisfied by either meeting the constituent\nconcentrations presented in the table \"Treatment Standards for Hazardous\n\nWastes\" in this section, or by treating the waste by the following\ntechnologies: combustion, as defined by the technology code CMBST in\nsubdivision (c) Table 1 of this section, for nonwastewaters; and, biodegradation as defined by the technology code BIODG, carbon adsorption as\ndefined by the technology code, CARBN, chemical oxidation as defined by the\ntechnology code CHOXD, or combustion as defined as technology code CMBST in\nsubdivision (c) Table 1 of this section, for wastewaters. (8)\n\nProhibited D004-D011 mixed radioactive\nwastes and mixed radioactive listed wastes containing metal constituents, that\nwere previously treated by stabilization to the treatment standards in effect\nat that time and then put into storage, do not have to be retreated to meet\ntreatment standards in this section prior to land disposal.

(3)\n\nAs an alternative to the otherwise\napplicable section\n376.4\ntreatment standards, lab\npacks are eligible for land disposal provided the following requirements are\nmet: (i) the lab packs comply with the\napplicable provisions of sections\n373-2.14\n(1)\nand\n373-3.14\n(i) of\nthis Title; (ii)\nthe lab pack does\nnot contain any of the wastes listed in Appendix 38 of this Title; (iii)\nthe lab packs are incinerated in\naccordance with the requirements of section\n373-2.15\nor\n373-3.15\nof this Title; and\n(iv)\nany incinerator residues\nfrom lab packs containing D004, D005, D006, D007, D008, D010, and D011 are\ntreated in compliance with the applicable treatment standards specified for\nsuch wastes in this section. (4)\n\nRadioactive hazardous mixed wastes are\nsubject to the treatment standards in subdivision (a) of this section. Where\ntreatment standards are specified for radioactive mixed wastes in the Table of\n\nTreatment Standards, those treatment standards will govern. Where there is no\nspecific treatment standard for radioactive mixed waste, the treatment standard\nfor the hazardous waste (as designated by EPA waste code) applies. Hazardous\ndebris containing radioactive waste is subject to the treatment standards\nspecified in subdivision (g) of this section. Note: Parts 380, 381, 382 and 383 of this Title may apply to\nfinal disposition of the treated radioactive hazardous mixed wastes or treated\nhazardous debris containing radioactive waste. (d) Treatment standards expressed as\nwaste concentrations. For the requirements previously found in this subdivision\nand for treatment standards in Table CCW - Constituent Concentrations in\n\nWastes, refer to subdivision (a) of this section. (e) Variance from a treatment\nstandard. (1)\n\nBased on a petition\nfiled by a generator or treater of hazardous waste with the EPA administrator, pursuant to\n40 CFR section\n268.44\nand the commissioner, the commissioner\nmay approve a variance from an applicable treatment standard if: (i) it is not physically possible to treat\nthe waste to the level specified in the treatment standard, or by the method\nspecified as the treatment standard. To show that this is the case, the\npetitioner must demonstrate that because the physical or chemical properties of\nthe waste differ significantly from waste analyzed in developing the treatment\nstandard, the waste cannot be treated to the specified level or by the\nspecified method; or\n(ii)\nit is in\nappropriate to require the waste to be treated to the level specified in the\ntreatment standard or by the method specified as the treatment standard, even\nthough such treatment is technically possible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate that: (a) treatment to the specified level or by\nthe specified method is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting in\ncombustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media); or\n(b) for remediation waste only, treatment to the specified level or by the specified method is environmentally\ninappropriate because it would likely discourage aggressive\nremediation; (iii)\nthe\nEPA administrator must also have approved the variance pursuant to\n40 CFR section\n268.44. (2)\n\nEach petition must be submitted in\naccordance with the procedures in section\n370.3\n(a) of this\n\nTitle. (3)\n\nEach petition must\ninclude the following statement signed by the petitioner or an authorized\nrepresentative: I certify under penalty of law that I have personally\nexamined and am familiar with the information submitted in this petition and\nall attached documents, and that, based on my inquiry of those individuals\nimmediately responsible for obtaining the information, I believe that the\nsubmitted information is true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there\nare significant penalties for submitting false information, including the\npossibility of fine and imprisonment. (4)\n\nAfter receiving a petition for variance\nfrom a treatment standard, the commissioner may request any additional\ninformation or samples which he may require to evaluate the petition. Additional copies of the complete petition may be requested as\nneeded. (5)\n\nThe commissioner will\ngive public notice in the New York\n\nState Register\nof the\nintent to approve or deny a petition and provide an opportunity for public\ncomment. The final decision on a variance from a treatment standard will be\npublished in the New York\n\nState Register. (6)\nA generator, treatment facility, or\ndisposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a variance from the\ntreatment standards must comply with the waste analysis requirements for\nrestricted wastes found under section\n376.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart. (7)\n\nDuring the petition\nreview process, the applicant is required to comply with all restrictions on\nland disposal under this Part. (8)\n\nBased on a petition filed by a generator or treater of hazardous waste with the\nEPA administrator, pursuant to\n40 CFR section\n268.44\nand the commissioner, the commissioner\nor his or her delegated representative may approve a site-specific variance\nfrom an applicable treatment standard if: (i) it is not physically possible to treat the waste to the level specified in the\ntreatment standard, or by the method specified as the treatment standard. To\nshow that this is the case, the petitioner must demonstrate that because the\nphysical or chemical properties of the waste differ significantly from waste\nanalyzed in developing the treatment standard, the waste cannot be treated to\nthe specified level or by the specified method; or\n(ii)\nit is inappropriate to require the waste\nto be treated to the level specified in the treatment standard or by the method\nspecified as the treatment standard, even tough such treatment is technically\npossible. To show that this is the case, the petitioner must either demonstrate\nthat: (a) treatment to the specified level or\nby the specified methods is technically inappropriate (for example, resulting\nin combustion of large amounts of mildly contaminated environmental media where\nthe treatment standard is not based on combustion of such media); or\n(b) for remediation waste only, treatment to\nthe specified level or by the specified method is environmentally inappropriate\nbecause it would likely discourage aggressive remediation; (iii)\nfor contaminated soil only, treatment\nto the level or by the method specified in the soil treatment standards would\nresult in concentrations of hazardous constituents that are below\n(\ni.e., lower than) the concentrations necessary to minimize\nshort- and long-term threats to human health and the environment. Treatment\nvariances approved under this paragraph must: (a) at a minimum, impose alternative land\ndisposal restriction treatment standards that, using a reasonable maximum\nexposure scenario: (1)\nfor carcinogens, achieve constituent concentrations that result in the total excess risk to an\nindividual exposed over a lifetime generally falling within the range from\n10-\n4\nto 10-\n6; and\n(2)\nfor constituents with\nnon-carcinogenic effects, achieve constituent concentrations that an individual\ncould be exposed to on a daily basis without appreciable risk of deleterious\neffect during a lifetime; (b) not consider post-land-disposal\ncontrols; (iv)\nfor\ncontaminated soil only, treatment to the level or by the method specified in\nthe soil treatment standards would result in concentrations of hazardous\nconstituents that are below (\ni.e., lower than) natural\nbackground concentrations at the site where the contaminated soil will land\ndisposed; (v) public notice and a\nreasonable opportunity for public comment must be provided before granting or\ndenying a petition; (vi)\nthe EPA\nadministrator must also have approved the variance pursuant to\n40 CFR section\n268.44. (9)\n\nEach application for a site-specific\nvariance from a treatment standard must include the information in section\n370.3\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Title. (10)\n\nAfter receiving an\napplication for a site-specific variance from a treatment standard, the\ncommissioner may request any additional information or samples which may be\nrequired to evaluate the application. (11)\nA generator, treatment facility, or\ndisposal facility that is managing a waste covered by a site-specific variance\nfrom a treatment standard must comply with the waste analysis requirements for\nrestricted wastes found under section\n376.1\n(g) of this\n\nPart. (12)\n\nDuring the application\nreview process, the applicant for a site-specific variance must comply with all\nrestrictions on land disposal under this Part. (13)\n\nFor all variances, the petitioner must\nalso demonstrate that compliance with any given treatment variance is\nsufficient to minimize threats to human health and the environment posed by\nland disposal of the waste. In evaluating this demonstration, the State may\ntake into account whether a treatment variance should be approved if the\nsubject waste is to be used in a manner constituting disposal pursuant to\nsection\n374-1.3\nof this Title. (f) PCB disposal. (1)\nPCB wastes regulated as hazardous waste\nby New York State solely due to the presence of PCBs pursuant to section\n371.4\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, shall be disposed of in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n761, (as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle), except: (i) As listed in Part 371, waste B002, from any source other than a spill, may not be stabilized or mixed\nwith any substance to conform with any provision of 40 CFR part\n761\nregarding\nland disposal.

Hazardous debris contaminated with a listed waste that is treated by an\nimmobilization technology specified in Table 1 is a hazardous waste and must be\nmanaged in a Part 373 facility. (4)\n\nTreatment residuals: (i) General\nrequirements. Except as provided by subparagraphs (ii) and (iv) of this\nparagraph: (a) residue from the treatment of\nhazardous debris must be separated from the treated debris using simple\nphysical or mechanical means; and\n(b) residue from the treatment of hazardous\ndebris is subject to the waste-specific treatment standards provided by this\nsection for the waste contaminating the debris.

Immobilization Technologies: 1. Macroencapsulation: Application of surface\ncoating materials such as polymeric organics (\ne.g., resins and\nplastics) or use of a jacket of inert inorganic materials to substantially\nreduce surface exposure to potential leaching media. Encapsulating\nmaterial must completely encapsulate debris and be resistant to degradation by\nthe debris and its contaminants and materials with which it may come into\ncontact after placement (leachate, other waste, microbes). None. 2. Microencapsulation: Stabilization of the debris\nwith the following reagents (or waste reagents) such that the leachability of\nthe hazardous contaminants is reduced: (1) Portland cement; or (2)\nlime/pozzolans (\ne.g., fly ash and cement kiln dust). Reagents\n(\ne.g., iron salts, silicates, and clays) may be added to\nenhance the set/cure time and/or compressive strength, or to reduce the\nleachability of the hazardous\nconstituents\n5. Leachability of the hazardous\ncontaminants must be reduced. None. 3. Sealing: Application of an appropriate material\nwhich adheres tightly to the debris surface to avoid exposure of the surface to\npotential leaching media. When necessary to effectively seal the surface, sealing entails pretreatment of the debris surface to remove foreign matter and\nto clean and roughen the surface. Sealing materials include epoxy, silicone, and urethane compounds, but paint may not be used as a sealant. Sealing\nmust avoid exposure of the debris surface to potential leaching media and\nsealant must be resistant to degradation by the debris and its contaminants and\nmaterials with which it may come into contact after placement (leachate, other\nwaste, microbes). None. 1\n\nHazardous debris must be\ntreated by either these standards or the waste-specific treatment standards for\nthe waste contaminating the debris. The treatment standards must be met for\neach type of debris contained in a mixture of debris types, unless the debris\nis converted into treatment residue as a result of the treatment process. Debris treatment residuals are subject to the waste-specific treatment\nstandards for the waste contaminating the debris. 2\n\nContaminant restriction means\nthat the technology is not BDAT for that contaminant. If debris containing a\nrestricted contaminant is treated by the technology, the contaminant must be\nsubsequently treated by a technology for which it is not restricted in order to\nbe land disposed (and excluded from Title 9, Article 27 (ECL)\nregulation). 3\n\"Clean debris surface\" means\nthe surface, when viewed without magnification, shall be free of all visible\ncontaminated soil and hazardous waste except that residual staining from soil\nand waste consisting of light shadows, slight streaks, or minor discolorations, and soil and waste in cracks, crevices, and pits may be present provided that\nsuch staining and waste and soil in cracks, crevices, and pits shall be limited\nto no more than 5% of each square inch of surface area. 4\n\nAcids, solvents, and chemical\nreagents may react with some debris and contaminants to form hazardous\ncompounds. For example, acid washing of cyanide-contaminated debris could\nresult in the formation of hydrogen cyanide. Some acids may also react\nviolently with some debris and contaminants, depending on the concentration of\nthe acid and the type of debris and contaminants. Debris treaters should refer\nto the safety precautions specified in Material Safety Data Sheets for various\nacids to avoid applying an incompatible acid to a particular debris/contaminant\ncombination. For example, concentrated sulfuric acid may react violently with\ncertain organic compounds, such as acrylonitrile. 5\n\nIf reducing the particle size\nof debris to meet the treatment standards results in material that no longer\nmeets the 60 mm minimum particle size limit for debris, such material is\nsubject to the waste-specific treatment standards for the waste contaminating\nthe material, unless the debris has been cleaned and separated from\ncontaminated soil and waste prior to size reduction. At a minimum, simple\nphysical or mechanical means must be used to provide such cleaning and\nseparation of nondebris materials to ensure that the debris surface is free of\ncaked soil, waste, or other nondebris material. 6\n\nDioxin-listed wastes are EPA\nHazardous Waste numbers F020, F021, F022, F023, F026, and F027. 7\n\nThermal desorption is\ndistinguished from Thermal Destruction in that the primary purpose of Thermal\n\nDesorption is to volatilize contaminants and to remove them from the treatment\nchamber for subsequent destruction or other treatment. 8\n\nThe demonstration \"Equivalent\n\nTechnology\" under section\n376.4\n(c)(2)\nmust\ndocument that the technology treats contaminants subject to treatment to a\nlevel equivalent to that required by the performance and design and operating\nstandards for other technologies in this table such that residual levels of\nhazardous contaminants will not pose a hazard to human health and the\nenvironment absent management controls. 9\n\nAny soil, waste, and other\nnondebris material that remains on the debris surface (or remains mixed with\nthe debris) after treatment is considered a treatment residual that must be\nseparated from the debris using, at a minimum, simple physical or mechanical\nmeans. Examples of simple physical or mechanical means are vibratory or trommel\nscreening or water washing. The debris surface need not be cleaned to a \"clean\ndebris surface\" as defined in note 3 when separating treated debris from\nresidue; rather, the surface must be free of caked soil, waste, or other\nnondebris material. Treatment residuals are subject to the waste-specific\ntreatment standards for the waste contaminating the debris. (h) Alternative\ntreatment standards based on HTMR. For the treatment standards previously found\nin this subdivision, refer to subdivision (a) of this section. (i) [\nReserved\n]\n(j) Universal treatment\nstandards. Table UTS identifies the hazardous constituents, along with\nthe nonwastewater and wastewater treatment standard levels, that are used to\nregulate most prohibited hazardous wastes with numerical limits. For\ndetermining compliance with treatment standards for underlying hazardous\nconstituents as defined in section\n376.1\n(b)(1)(xii)\nof this Part, these treatment standards may not be exceeded. Compliance with\nthese treatment standards is measured by an analysis of grab samples, unless\notherwise noted in the following Table UTS.

To determine the date any given listed hazardous waste contaminated any\ngiven volume of soil, use the last date any given listed hazardous waste was\nplaced into any given land disposal unit or, in the case of an accidental\nspill, the date of the spill. (2)\n\nPrior to land disposal, contaminated soil\nidentified by paragraph (1) of this subdivision as needing to comply with LDRs\nmust be treated according to the applicable treatment standards specified in\nparagraph (3) of this subdivision or according to the Universal Treatment\n\nStandards specified in subdivision (j) of this section applicable to the\ncontaminating listed hazardous waste and/or the applicable characteristic of\nhazardous waste if the soil is characteristic. The treatment standards\nspecified in paragraph (3) of this subdivision and the Universal Treatment\n\nStandards may be modified through a treatment variance approved in accordance\nwith subdivision (e) of this section. (3)\n\nTreatment standards for contaminated\nsoils. Prior to land disposal, contaminated soil identified by paragraph (1) of\nthis subdivision as needing to comply with LDRs must be treated according to\nall the standards specified in this paragraph or according to the Universal\n\nTreatment Standards specified in subdivision (j) of this section. (i) All soils. Prior to land disposal, all\nconstituents subject to treatment must be treated as follows: (a) For nonmetals except carbon disulfide, cyclohexanone, and methanol, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in\ntotal constituent concentrations, except as provided by clause\n(3)(i)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (b) For metals and carbon disulfide, cycolohexanone, and methanol, treatment must achieve 90 percent reduction in\nconstituent concentrations as measured in leachate from the treated media\n(tested according to the TCLP) or 90 percent reduction in total constituent\nconcentrations (when a metal removal treatment technology is used), except as\nprovided by clause (3)(i)(\nc\n) of this paragraph. (c) When treatment of any constituent subject\nto treatment to a 90 percent reduction standard would result in a concentration\nless than 10 times the Universal Treatment Standard for that constituent, treatment to achieve constituent concentrations less than 10 times the\n\nUniversal Treatment Standard is not required. Universal Treatment Standards are\nidentified in subdivision (j) of this section, Table UTS. (ii)\n\nSoils that exhibit the characteristic of\nignitability, corrosivity or reactivity. In addition to the treatment required\nby subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, prior to land disposal, soils that\nexhibit the characteristic of ignitability, corrosivity, or reactivity must be\ntreated to eliminate these characteristics. (iii)\n\nSoils that contain nonanalyzable\nconstituents. In addition to the treatment requirements of subparagraphs (i)\nand (ii) of this paragraph, prior to land disposal, the following treatment is\nrequired for soils that contain nonanalyzable constituents: (a) for soil that contains only analyzable\nand nonanalyzable organic constituents, treatment of the analyzable organic\nconstituents to the levels specified in subparagraphs (i) and (ii) of this\nparagraph; or\n(b) for soil that\ncontains only nonanalyzable constituents, treatment by the method(s) specified\nin subdivision (c) of this section for the waste contained in the\nsoil. (4)\n\nConstituents subject to treatment. When applying the soil treatment standards\nin paragraph (3) of this subdivision, constituents subject to treatment are any\nconstituents listed in subdivision (j) of this section, Table UTS-Universal\n\nTreatment Standards that are reasonably expected to be present in any given\nvolume of contaminated soil, except fluoride, selenium, sulfides, vanadium and\nzinc, and are present at concentrations greater than 10 times the universal\ntreatment standard. PCBs are not a constituent subject to treatment in any\ngiven volume of soil which exhibits the toxicity characteristic solely because\nof the presence of metals. (5)\n\nManagement of treatment residuals. Treatment residuals from treating\ncontaminated soil identified by paragraph (1) of this subdivision as needing to\ncomply with LDRs must be managed as follows: (i) soil residuals are subject to the\ntreatment standards of this subdivision; (ii)\nnon-soil residuals are subject to: (a) for soils contaminated by listed\nhazardous waste, the hazardous waste management standards applicable to the\nlisted hazardous waste; and\n(b) for\nsoils that exhibit a characteristic of hazardous waste, if the nonsoil residual\nalso exhibits a characteristic of hazardous waste, the treatment standards\napplicable to the characteristic hazardous waste.
