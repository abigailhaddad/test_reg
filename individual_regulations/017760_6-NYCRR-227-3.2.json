Tit. 6 §§ 227-3.2 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) To the extent\nthat they are not inconsistent with the specific definitions in subdivision (b)\nof this section, the general definitions of Parts 200, 201, and Subpart 227-2\nof this Title apply. (b) For the\npurposes of this Subpart, the following specific definitions apply: (1)\n\nBlack start resource. An electric generating unit used to bring a facility from\nshutdown to operational without reliance on external supplies or the electrical\nsystem. (2)\n\nCommon\ncontrol. Refers to two or more emission sources and/or electric\nstorage and/or renewable generation resources that are under the control of a\nsingle corporate entity. The corporate entity must: (i) have the right to decide when to operate\nthe plant; or\n(ii)\nhave the right\nto enter into a power purchase agreement or other agreement with the entity\nthat owns the emission source and/or electric storage and/or renewable\ngeneration resources and provides the necessary paperwork required under\nsection\n227-3.3\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nElectric storage resource. A resource capable of receiving electric energy from the\ngrid and storing it for later injection of electric energy back to the\ngrid. (4)\n\nHydroelectric energy. The conversion of potential and kinetic energy in the\nform of falling or fast-flowing water into mechanical energy which drives\nturbines producing electricity. (5)\nMWh. Megawatt hour of electricity. (6)\nNYISO. New York independent system operator. (7)\nORISPL. Office of regulatory information systems plant code\nassigned by the energy information administration to electric generating\nunits. (8)\n\nOzone\nseason.

Technology that directly converts the energy radiated by\nthe sun as electromagnetic waves into electricity by means of solar\npanels. (12)\n\nSubstation. An area or group of equipment to transform power from one\nvoltage to another or from one system to another. (13)\n\nTidal energy. The conversion of kinetic energy in the form of tide\nmovement into mechanical energy which drives turbines connected to a generator\nto produce electricity. (14)\n\nWind energy. The conversion of kinetic energy in the form of wind or\nair flows into mechanical energy which drives turbines connected to a generator\nto produce electricity. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
