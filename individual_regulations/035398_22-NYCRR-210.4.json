In addition, every paper filed in court, other than an\nexhibit or printed form, shall contain writing on one side only, except that\npapers that are fastened on the side may contain writing on both sides. Papers\nthat are stapled or bound securely shall not be rejected for filing simply\nbecause they are not bound with a backer of any kind. (b) Omission or Redaction of\n\nConfidential Personal Information in Civil Actions and Proceedings. (1)\n\nExcept for any action or\nproceeding arising under the Vehicle and Traffic Law, or prosecution of a\nviolation of an ordinance of a city, town or village, or in a petition for\nchange of name under the Civil Rights Law, or as otherwise provided by rule or\nlaw or court order, and whether or not a sealing order is or has been sought, the parties shall omit or redact confidential personal information in papers\nsubmitted to the court for filing. For purposes of this rule, confidential\npersonal information (\"CPI\") means: i. the taxpayer identification number of\nan individual or an entity, including a social security number, an employer\nidentification number, and an individual taxpayer identification number, except\nthe last four digits thereof; ii. the date of an individual's birth, except the year thereof; iii. the full name of an individual\nknown to be a minor, except the minor's initials; and\niv. a financial account number, including a credit and/or debit card number, a bank account number, an\ninvestment account number, and/or an insurance account number, except the last\nfour digits or letters thereof. (2)\n\nThe court sua sponte or on motion by\nany person may order a party to remove CPI from papers or to resubmit a paper\nwith such information redacted; order the clerk to seal the papers or a portion\nthereof containing CPI in accordance with the requirement of 22 NYCRR §\n216.1\nthat any sealing be no\nbroader than necessary to protect the CPI; for good cause permit the inclusion\nof CPI in papers; order a party to file an unredacted copy under seal for in\ncamera review; or determine that information in a particular action is not\nconfidential. The court shall consider the pro se status of any party in\ngranting relief pursuant to this provision. (3)\n\nWhere a person submitting a paper to\na court for filing believes in good faith that the inclusion of the full\nconfidential personal information described in subparagraphs (i) to (iv) of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision is material and necessary to the adjudication\nof the action or proceeding before the court, he or she may apply to the court\nfor leave to serve and file together with a paper in which such information has\nbeen set forth in abbreviated form a confidential affidavit or affirmation\nsetting forth the same information in unabbreviated form, appropriately\nreferenced to the page or pages of the paper at which the abbreviated form\nappears.

In the event\nthe defendant appears in such an action the defendant may without leave of\ncourt submit papers disclosing full account numbers to the extent necessary to\nensure that an order or judgment issued by the court contains proof\nsatisfactory to a credit reporting agency. In the event the defendant appears\nin such an action and denies responsibility for the identified account, the\nplaintiff may without leave of court amend his or her pleading to add full\naccount or CPI by (i) submitting such amended paper to the court on written\nnotice to defendant for in camera review or (ii) filing such full account or\nother CPI under seal in accordance with rules promulgated by the chief\nadministrator of the courts.
