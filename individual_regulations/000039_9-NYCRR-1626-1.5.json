  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1626-1.5 - Collection of rents\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The\nauthority is entitled to rent from date of acquisition. This includes former\nowners as well as regular tenants. Rents tendered covering any period prior to\ndate of acquisition shall not be accepted. (b) If tenant has paid rent to former owner\nfor period beyond date of acquisition, authority's counsel should be advised of\namount so that claim for amount can be made on former owner and deducted from\npurchase payment. However no action should be taken without verification\nthrough rent receipt or cancelled check. (c) Rents are to be paid on the first of each\nmonth. Legal steps for eviction should be scheduled so that eviction, if\nnecessary, can take place in the same month in which tenant became delinquent. Dilligent efforts will be made to collect from any site or offsite tenant who\nvacates owing rent or other charges. Judgments and garnishees will be sought\nwhere indicated. (d) No security\ndeposits are required from residential tenants occupying site and offsite\napartments, but the authority may require such deposit in case of a commercial\ntenant. (e) Site and offsite\ntenants eligible for admission to project must pay all arrears of rent or other\ncharges before they are admitted to project. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§§\n1626-1.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
