Page 1, Sections I and II, should\nthen be used for reporting only radial system interruptions and radial system\ncustomers served. Classifications of Electric Service Interruption\n\nCauses and Definitions\n\nEach electric corporation and municipality shall classify\nservice interruption causes used in reporting all electric service\ninterruptions of five minutes or longer to the Public Service Commission in\naccordance with the following criteria: 1. Major Storms Interruptions resulting from\na major storm. Interruptions occurring at a time of routine adverse weather\nshould not be reported to this classification. See definition for major\nstorm. 2. Tree Contacts\n\nInterruptions resulting from conductors or energized equipment coming in\ncontact with a tree (or vice versa), except when the tree or a limb is felled\nby lightning or by an employee, contractor or customer. An interruption caused\nby a tree or limb felled by a utility employee or utility contractor shall be\nreported under Classification 4; if felled by a customer or a nonutility\ncontractor, Classification 6 shall be used; if felled by lightning, Classification 9 shall be used. 3. Overloads Under this heading, report interruptions from the blowing of a\ntransformer and/or line fuse through overload. If the interruption is the\nresult of increased or abnormal customer loads or generation for which the\ncustomer is required to notify the utility, but failed to do so, Classification\n8 should be used instead. 4. Operating or Working Errors Under this heading, report interruptions resulting\nfrom errors by utility or utility contact personnel (including the improper or\nsubstandard installation or design of facilities or the installation of\nimproper equipment; e.g., undersized fuses, improper relay settings, etc.). An\ninterruption caused by a utility' s employee or contractor dropping a limb on a\nconductor shall be reported here. If the limb were dropped by a customer or\nnonutility contractor, Classification 6 shall be used. 5. Apparatus or Equipment Failures Under this\nheading, report interruptions resulting from the breakdown or failure of\notherwise properly selected, installed, and protected equipment and facilities; e.g., transformer failures (not due to external factors), broken poles or\ncrossarms, faulty protective devices, cracked (not by gun fire) or contaminated\ninsulators, defective cutouts, crossed or broken line and tie wires (not caused\nby tree contacts or lightning), improper relay operations, substandard\nconditions that were not present when the facilities were initially installed\n(e.g., slack conductors, etc.). 6. Accidents or Events Not Under Utility's Control Under this heading, report\ninterruptions resulting from events not under the control of the utility or its\nemployees or contractors, such as house fires not caused by the utility's\nservice; gun fire; crane contacts; automobile accidents; squirrel, bird, or\nother animal contacts; sabotage; customer tree fellings; etc. (Lightning\ninterruptions should be reported under cause Classification 9 even though they\nmay not be under the utility's control. Interruptions caused by failures of\napparatus and equipment shall be reported under Classifications 5 and 8 even\nthough the failures may not be the utility's fault. Tree or limb falling\ninterruptions caused by the utility's employees or contractors should be\nclassified under item 4. Those caused by a customer or a nonutility contractor\nshall be classified here.)\n7. Prearranged Under this heading, report interruptions resulting from actions\ndeliberately taken by the utility upon advance notice to the customers affected\n(prearranged). Deliberate interruptions (lasting at least five minutes) without\nprior notice to the customers affected shall be reported under the\nclassifications most directly related to the reasons the outages were needed. They shall be considered part of a forced interruption when they take place\nduring emergency conditions to facilitate restoration. 8. Customer's Equipment or Failures Under\nthis heading, report interruptions resulting from the failure of a customer's\nequipment or from a failure of the customer to take required action such as\nfailure to notify the utility of an increase in load when required by agreement\nor tariff to do so. The customer's problem must cause an interruption to other\ncustomers or cause a problem on the utility system (e.g., blown fuse) to be\nreportable. 9. Lightning Under this\nheading, report interruptions caused by lightning, including those resulting\nfrom either direct strikes or indirect immediate effects of lightning, on\ntransformers, oil switches, cutouts, etc., so long as the equipment hit or\nindirectly affected was in proper condition prior to the lightning. An\ninterruption resulting from a lightning strike to a tree limb that then comes\nin contact with or knocks down conductors should be included here. 10. Causes Unknown or Unclassified Under this\nheading, report interruptions for which the cause is unknown or for which none\nof the other classifications is appropriate. This classification shall not be\nused if an investigation could determine the proper cause of an interruption\nfor which one of the other classifications would be more appropriate. Utilities with network systems serving ten percent or more\nof the load in an operating district shall use the following classifications\nfor reporting interruptions to network customers.)\n11. Service Connections Under this heading, report network service interruptions resulting from grounds, short circuits, or\nbroken conductors on service connections. 12. Street Mains Cable Under this heading, report network service interruptions resulting from grounds, short circuits, or\nbroken conductors on secondary street mains cables. 13. Apparatus or Equipment Failures Under\nthis heading, report network service interruptions resulting from the breakdown\nor failure of otherwise properly selected, installed, and protected equipment\nand facilities; e.g.,transformer failures (not due to overloads or other\nexternal factors), faulty splices, insulation or protective devices, defective\ncutouts, improper relay operations, substandard conditions that were not\npresent when the facilities were initially installed. Also report interruptions\ncaused by network primary failures under this classification. 14. Accidents or Events Not Under the\n\nUtility's Control Under this heading, report network service interruptions\nresulting from events not under the control of the utility or its employees or\ncontractors, such as dig-ins, sabotage, etc. Interruptions caused by failures\nof apparatus and equipment are reported under Classifications 13 and 16 even\nthough the failures may not be the utility's fault. 15. Prearranged Under this heading, report\nnetwork service interruptions resulting from actions deliberately taken by the\nutility upon advance notice to the customers affected (prearranged). Deliberate\ninterruptions (lasting at least five minutes) without prior notice to the\ncustomers affected shall be reported under the classifications most directly\nrelated to the reasons the outages were needed. They shall be considered as\npart of a forced interruption when they take place during emergency conditions\nto facilitate restoration. 16. Customer's Equipment or Failures Under this heading, report network service\ninterruptions resulting from the failure of a customer's equipment or from a\nfailure of the customer to take required action, such as failure to notify the\nutility of an increase in load when required by agreement or tariff to do\nso. 17. Causes Unknown or\n\nUnclassified Under this heading, report network service interruptions for which\nthe cause is unknown or for which none of the other classifications is\nappropriate. This classification should not be used if an investigation could\ndetermine the proper cause of an interruption for which one of the other\nclassifications would be more appropriate. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n97.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
