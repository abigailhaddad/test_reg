  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 427.3 - Criteria for listing\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following criteria shall be used by the commissioner\nwhen determining if properties are eligible for listing on the State Register\nand by the commissioner, in consultation with the board, in determining which\neligible properties should be listed on the State Register: (a) The quality of significance in American\nhistory, architecture and culture is present in districts, sites, buildings, structures and objects that possess integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling and association, and: (1)\nthat are associated with events that have\nmade a significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history; or\n(2)\nthat are associated with the\nlives of persons significant in our past; or\n(3)\nthat embody the distinctive\ncharacteristics of a type, period or method of construction, or that represent\nthe work of a master, or that possess high artistic values, or that represent a\nsignificant and distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual\ndistinction; or\n(4)\nthat have\nyielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in prehistory or\nhistory. (b) Special\nconsiderations. Ordinarily, cemeteries, birthplaces or graves of historic\nfigures, properties owned by religious institutions or used for religious\npurposes, structures that have been moved from their original locations, reconstructed historic buildings, properties primarily commemorative in nature, and properties that have achieved significance within the past 50 years shall\nnot be considered eligible for the State Register. However, such properties\nwill qualify if they are integral parts of districts that do meet the criteria\nor if they fall within the following categories: (1)\na religious property deriving primary\nsignificance from architectural or artistic distinction or historical\nimportance; (2)\na building or\nstructure removed from its original location but which is significant primarily\nfor architectural value, or which is the surviving structure most importantly\nassociated with an historic person or event; (3)\na birthplace or grave of an historical\nfigure of outstanding importance if there is no appropriate site or building\ndirectly associated with his productive life; (4)\na cemetery which derives its primary\nsignificance from graves of persons of transcendent importance, from age, from\ndistinctive design features, or from association with historic\nevents; (5)\na reconstructed\nbuilding, when accurately executed in a suitable environment and presented in a\ndignified manner as part of a restoration master plan, and when no other\nbuilding or structure with the same association has survived; (6)\na property primarily commemorative in\nintent if design, age, tradition or symbolic value has invested it with its own\nhistorical significance; or\n(7)\na\nproperty achieving significance within the past 50 years if it is of\nexceptional importance.
