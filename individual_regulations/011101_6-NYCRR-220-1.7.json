  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 220-1.7 - Severability\n\nState Regulations\n\nEach provision of this Subpart shall be deemed severable. In the event that any provision of this Subpart is held to be invalid, the\nremainder of this Subpart shall continue in full force and\neffect. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n220-1.7\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register August 21, 2024/Volume XLVI, Issue 34, eff. 9/5/2024\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. (a) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nor\nclinker\ncooler must maintain a file of daily\nclinker\nproduction rates, kiln feed rates, and any particulate\nemission\nmeasurements. The production and feed rates must be summarized monthly. The records and summary must be retained for at least five years following the date of such records and summaries and must be made available for inspection by the\ndepartment\nduring normal business hours. (b) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nat a\ndry process plant\nor\nclinker\ncooler at either a dry or\nwet process plant, subject to section 220- 1.4(a) or (b) of this Subpart, must install, maintain, calibrate daily, and operate a device, approved by the\ndepartment, for continuously measuring and recording the\nopacity\nof emissions from such kiln or\nclinker\ncooler. If two or more kilns are vented through a single\nstack, an\nopacity\nmonitor in the common\nstack\nwould satisfy the requirements of this subdivision. Records of\nopacity\nmust be retained for at least five years following the date on which they are made. (c) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall demonstrate compliance with the NO\nx\nRACT\nemission\nlimit(s) established in section 220- 1.6(b) of this Subpart by measuring NO\nx\nemissions with a continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS). The CEMS shall comply with the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section or with equivalent requirements approved by the\ndepartment. Any approved equivalent CEMS requirements will be submitted by the\ndepartment\nto the United States Environmental Protection Agency for approval as separate\n\nState Implementation Plan\nrevisions. (d) CEMS requirements. (1)\n\nThe\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall install, calibrate, evaluate, operate, and maintain a CEMS, in accordance with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n75, for measuring NO\nx\nat locations approved in the CEMS certification protocol under paragraph (3) of this subdivision, and shall record the output of the system. (2)\n\nAs part of its application for a permit or permit\nmodification, the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall submit for\ndepartment\napproval a CEMS monitoring plan that complies with the provisions of 40 CFR part\n75, subpart F. (3)\n\nThe\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall submit for\ndepartment\napproval a CEMS certification protocol at least 60 days prior to CEMS certification testing. The certification protocol shall include the\nlocation\nof and specifications for each instrument or device, as well as procedures for calibration, operation, data evaluation, and data reporting. (4)\n\nThe procedures in subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this paragraph shall be used for determining compliance with the NO\nx\nRACT\nemission\nlimit established under section\n220-1.6\n(b) of this Subpart. (i) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall determine compliance daily on a 30\nday\nrolling average basis. The 30\nday\nrolling averages shall be calculated by dividing 30\nday\ntotal NO\nx\nemissions by 30\nday\ntotal\nclinker\nproduction. Only days when the kiln operates shall be included in the 30\nday\nrolling averages. (ii)\n\nAlong with any specific additional data requirements mandated by the\ndepartment\nfor a particular\nportland cement kiln, annual\nre-certifications, quarterly accuracy, and daily calibration drift tests shall be performed in accordance with 40 CFR part\n75, subpart C. (iii)\n\nWhen NO\nx\nemissions data are not obtained because of CEMS downtime, or for periods when no valid CEMS data is available, the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall use 40 CFR part\n75, subpart D, data substitution procedures. (5)\n\nIn addition to the requirements of subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall comply with the CEMS recordkeeping and reporting requirements of 40 CFR part\n75, subparts F and G. (i) The\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall notify the\ndepartment\nof the planned initial start-up date of any new CEMS. (ii)\n\nEmissions, monitoring, and operating parameter records or measurements required by this Subpart and any additional parameters required by the\ndepartment\nshall be maintained for at least five years and made available to the\ndepartment\nupon request. (iii)\n\nOn a semi-\nannual\nbasis, the\nowner\nor\noperator\nof a\nportland cement kiln\nshall tabulate and summarize applicable emissions, monitoring, and operating parameter measurements recorded during the preceding six months, and submit these records to the\ndepartment. These records shall be submitted in a format acceptable to the\ndepartment\nand shall include: (a) the 30\nday\nrolling average NO\nx\nemissions as specified under paragraph (4) of this subdivision; (b) identification of the operating hours when NO\nx\nemissions data are not included in a calculation of the 30\nday\nrolling average emissions and the reasons for not including that data; (c) a comparison of the NO\nx\nemissions to the NO\nx\nRACT emissions limit(s); (d) type and amount of\nfuel\nburned on a daily basis and the as burned heat content of the\nfuel; (e) the total daily NO\nx\nemissions and total daily\nclinker\nproduction; and\n(f) the results of CEMS accuracy assessments as required by 40 CFR part\n75, appendix A and B and any additional data quality information required by the\ndepartment. (e) Protocols, reports, summaries, schedules, and any other information required to be submitted to the\ndepartment\nunder provisions of this Subpart must be sent (in either hardcopy or electronically) as follows: (1)\none copy to the Division of Air Resources, New York State\n\nDepartment\nof Environmental Conservation, 625 Broadway, Albany, New York 12233; and\n(2)\none copy to the regional\nair pollution\ncontrol engineer at the appropriate regional office of the\ndepartment.
