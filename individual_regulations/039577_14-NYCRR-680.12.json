Such request for extension shall document, in writing, that the provider cannot file the report by the due date for reasons beyond its control, and shall include an explanation of such reasons. (ii)\n\nThe\ncommissioner\nmay grant an additional extension of 30 days if the provider applies for an extension in accordance with the procedure stated in section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(i)\nof this Part. The maximum allowable extension that may be granted will not exceed 60 days in total unless the\ncommissioner, upon investigation, finds that failure to report is beyond the control of the provider and/or enforcement of the reporting time frame requirements would jeopardize the program's operation. (iii)\n\nIf a provider fails to file the required reports, on or before the due dates, taking into account any granted extensions, the\ncommissioner\nmay, at his or her discretion, reduce the specialty hospital's existing rate, exclusive of State-paid items, by five percent for a period beginning on the first day of the month following the due date of the required reports and continuing until the last day of the calendar month in which the required information is received. (iv)\n\nIn the event that the rate for a specific rate period cannot be developed so that it will be effective on the first day of the rate period, due to the facility's not submitting the required reports by the due date, the rate in existence on the last day of the rate period (\ni.e., the length of time as determined by the\ncommissioner\nthat an approved rate is valid) prior to the subject rate period, will be in effect until such time as OPWDD can develop a new rate. The rate in existence on the last day of the rate period may be reduced by five percent according to the provisions of section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(iii)\nof this Part. (v) When OPWDD develops a new rate for a specialty hospital for which a rate was paid in accordance with section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(iv)\nof this Part, the rate developed will be effective on the first day of the first month following receipt of the required reports. The\ncommissioner\nmay, at his discretion and based on his finding that the factor(s) causing the delay has/have been corrected, make the rate retroactive to the beginning of the rate period in question if the provider makes such a request within 60 days subsequent to submission of the delinquent report. (5)\n\nRequirements for the revision of financial reports shall include the following: (i) In the event that OPWDD determines that the required financial report is incomplete, inaccurate, incorrect or otherwise unacceptable, the provider shall have 30 days from the date of its receipt of notification to submit revised financial reports or additional data. Such data or reports shall be certified by the provider's executive director or officer and an independent licensed public accountant or certified public accountant pursuant to the requirements stipulated in section\n680.12\n(b)(3)\nof this Part. (ii)\n\nIf the revised data referred to in section\n680.12\n(b)(5)(i)\nof this Part are not received within 30 days of the provider's receipt of notification, the facility's existing rate may be reduced in accordance with section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(iii)\nunless the\ncommissioner\nhas granted an extension pursuant to section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(i) or (ii). (iii)\n\nIn the event the provider discovers that the financial reports it has submitted are incomplete, inaccurate or incorrect prior to receiving its new rate, the provider must notify OPWDD that such error exists. The provider will have 30 days from the date such notification is received by OPWDD to submit revised reports or additional data. Such data or report shall meet the certification requirements of the report being corrected. If the corrected data or report are received within a reasonable time before the issuance of the rate, OPWDD shall incorporate the corrected data or report into its computation of the rate without the provider having to file an appeal application. However, OPWDD will not accept the resubmission of a January 1-December 31, 2008 cost report subsequent to January 1, 2011 for the purposes of the calculation of the rate effective July 1, 2011 as described in clause (d)(5)(ii)(\nf\n) of this section. (iv)\n\nIf the revised data or report referred to in section\n680.12\n(b)(5)(iii)\nof this Part are not received within the time periods set forth in section\n680.12\n(b)(5)(iii), the facility's existing rate may be reduced in accordance with section\n680.12\n(b)(4)(iii).

A separate expense and revenue account shall be established to properly identify the expense and revenues directly and indirectly attributable to ACD individuals. (4)\n\nAll such financial records and any related records shall be subject to audit by the\ncommissioner\nor his agent, the\n\nOffice\nof the State Comptroller, the State Department of Social Services and by agencies of the Federal government as provided by law.

(ii)\n\nThe audits may be performed on any financial or statistical records required to be maintained. (iii)\n\nAny finding of an above-described audit shall constitute grounds for recoupment at the discretion of the\ncommissioner, provided that such audit finding relates to the allowable costs, and to the extent that, except as authorized in 18 NYCRR\n517.16, the audit finding has been upheld in a decision after a hearing or a hearing has not been requested on such finding. (iv)\n\nThe six-year limitation shall not apply in situations in which fraud may be involved or where the provider or an agent thereof prevents or obstructs the\ncommissioner\nfrom performing an audit pursuant to this section. (3)\n\nAll administrative review (including hearings) of audits conducted to determine allowable Medicaid expenses and offsetting revenues shall be in accordance with 18 NYCRR Part\n517.

After the receipt and review of such additional documentation, a copy of the audit findings shall, within 120 days, be sent to the provider by certified mail, return receipt requested. In order to have the additional documentation considered, the provider must submit the documentation within the time specified. (ii)\n\nThe audit findings shall become final unless, within 30 days of receipt thereof, the provider requests an administrative review of the audit findings. (iii)\n\nRequest for administrative review of audit findings shall be sent to the\ncommissioner\nby registered or certified mail.
