Tit. 20 §§ 9-2.6 - Election by certain foreign limited partners\n\nState Regulations\n(Tax Law, section 209(1)(f))\n(a) (1)\nA\nforeign corporation that is a limited partner in one or more limited\npartnerships, that is subject to tax under article 9-A solely as a result of\nthe application of section\n1-2.3\n(b) of this\n\nSubchapter and that does not file on a combined basis for article 9-A purposes, may elect to compute its tax bases by taking into account only its distributive\nshare of each partnership item of receipts, income, gain, loss and deduction\n(including any modifications relating thereto) and its proportionate part of\neach partnership asset and liability, and each partnership activity, of all\nsuch limited partnerships that are doing business, employing capital, owning or\nleasing property, maintaining an office, or deriving receipts in New York\n\nState, whether or not such share is actually distributed. However, such\nelection may not be made with respect to a partnership if the limited\npartnership and corporate group are engaged in a unitary business wherever\nconducted. The election shall be applicable to all of those limited partnership\ninterests that are not engaged in a unitary business with the corporate group\n(\"election partnerships\"). The term corporate group means the corporate limited\npartner itself or, if it is a member of an affiliated group, the corporate\nlimited partner and all other members of such affiliated group. The term\naffiliated group shall have the same meaning as provided in section\n9-2.2\n(d)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. (2)\n\nIf the foreign\ncorporation makes the election allowed under this section, the foreign\ncorporation's distributive share of such partnership's items of income, gain, loss and deduction shall be presumed to be business income and its\nproportionate part of such partnership's assets and liabilities shall be deemed\nto be business capital and be apportioned entirely to New York, unless the\nforeign corporation proves otherwise. (3)\n\nIf the separate accounting election has\nbeen made and the foreign corporation has an interest in more than one election\npartnership, a separate business income base, capital base, and New York\nreceipts amount (used for purposes of computing the tax measured by the fixed\ndollar minimum) must be computed for each limited partnership interest. Each\namount is then aggregated, with negative amounts limited to zero, to determine\nthe foreign corporation's business income base tax, capital base tax, and fixed\ndollar minimum tax. Where such negative amounts are limited to zero in\ndetermining the business income base tax of the foreign corporation, the\ncorporation may generate an NOL for the taxable year equal to the negative\nbusiness income base computed for such partnership interest. Such NOL may only\nbe applied against the apportioned business income of the partnership\ngenerating such loss in accordance with Subpart 3-9. (b) The election is made at the time of\nfiling the original, timely filed return, determined with regard to valid\nextensions. Once an election is made, it may not be revoked by filing an\namended report and is binding with respect to all election partnerships for all\nfuture taxable years as long as the criteria in subdivision (a)(1) still\napplies. (c) Where a corporation\nmakes such an election, but is not allowed to make such an election with\nrespect to one or more other such partnerships as those partnerships and the\ncorporate group are engaged in a unitary business wherever conducted\n(\"nonelection partnerships\"), then, subdivision (a) of this section to the\ncontrary notwithstanding, the taxpayer shall compute its tax bases with respect\nto nonelection partnerships by reducing its receipts, income, gain, loss and\ndeductions by the amounts that are directly and indirectly attributable to such\nelection partnerships.
