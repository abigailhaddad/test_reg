  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 §§ 6-1.19 - Water quality\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Sample collection and analysis. Microbiological samples shall be collected from swimming pools when determined by the permit-issuing official to be necessary to evaluate water quality, and be examined in laboratories approved by the New York State Department of Health. (b) Microbiological quality. Coliform bacteria levels should not exceed 4 per 100 milliliters in more than one sample examined each month. When the membrane filter technique is used, or when the fermentation tube method is used, coliform bacteria shall not be present in more than 10 percent of portions analyzed in any month; also, total bacteria shall not exceed 200 per milliliter. (c) Chemical quality. (1)\n\nThe chemical quality of water in the pool shall not cause irritation to the eyes or skin of the bathers or have other objectionable physiological effects on bathers. (2)\n\nThe total alkalinity of the pool water shall be maintained within the range of 80 to 120 mg/l. (3)\n\nThe pool water shall be chemically balanced. The permit-issuing official may require that the operator determine the saturation index (see section 6- 1.30 of this Subpart) monthly or at any other frequency required to maintain pool clarity, proper disinfection, alkalinity, and pH levels. (d) Cleanliness. (1)\n\nThe bottom and sidewalls of swimming pools shall be kept free of sediment and visible soil, and the pool water surface shall be kept free of visible floating matter. (2)\n\nThe water in a swimming pool shall be sufficiently clear to permit a white and black object four inches in diameter, placed at any location on the bottom of the swimming pool, to be clearly visible from the sides of the swimming pool at all times. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10\n§§\n6-1.19\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
