  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 32.4 - Issuance of ID cards\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each insurance company or other authorized person, as prescribed herein, shall\nissue ID cards to a policyholder: (1)\nat the\ninception of; (2)\nupon the renewal\nof any liability insurance policy on a vehicle; (3)\nupon the addition or replacement of a\nvehicle; (4)\nupon the reissuance of\na policy with a lapse in coverage; or\n(5)\nupon the updating of or correction of\nrequired information. ID cards may be issued upon reinstatement of a policy\nwithout a lapse or as otherwise may be necessary in the course of\nbusiness. (b) ID cards\nshall only be issued by the following: (1)\nan\nagent, broker, agency, brokerage or insurance company licensed by the New York\n\nState Department of Financial Services (insurer shall have a valid DMV issued\nICC); (2)\nthe New York Automobile\n\nInsurance Plan (NYAIP); (3)\nor this\ndepartment. An agent, broker, agency, brokerage, insurance company or any other\nentity shall not provide ID card stock, software or means to issue ID cards to\npolicyholders or other persons not authorized herein. ID cards shall not be\nissued by or completed by a policyholder or other person not authorized\nherein. (c) Determination of registration status of customer at policy\ninception. An authorized ID card issuer shall determine whether a\nvehicle is already registered in New York State by the policyholder registrant\nor whether the policyholder registrant intends to register the vehicle in New\n\nYork State. (d) New\npolicyholder with vehicle(s) currently registered in New York State. An authorized ID card issuer shall obtain the registration\nname(s) and vehicle description information from current New York State\nregistration document(s) or electronic registration record for each vehicle to\nbe insured at policy inception. At the time of original policy issuance, all\nregistration names and vehicle information shall be incorporated, without\nmodification, into both the policy application or policy and ID cards issued\nfor specific vehicles. ID cards issued for individual vehicles shall be issued\nin a name corresponding to the registration name. (e) New policyholder without vehicle(s)\ncurrently registered in New York State. ID cards shall be issued in a name or names acceptable for\nregistration for each vehicle. DMV shall not register a vehicle without proper\ndocumentation of registrant name. Acceptable proof of identity is required for\nan individual. Legal documentation, such as incorporation papers or a DBA\nfiling with a county clerk is required for an organization (non-individual). Accordingly, at the time of original policy issuance, the policy and ID cards\nshall be issued in a name or names legally supported for registration. See\nsection\n32.15\n(g) of this\n\nPart for temporary NYAIP ID card (FS-75) identity and documentation\nrequirements. (f) Validation of VIN and New York State driver's license number (client\nID). A computerized process shall be employed by ID card issuers\nto validate the correctness of: (1)\nthe\ncomplete VIN for 1981 model year or newer vehicles; and\n(2)\nthe New York State driver's license\nnumber of individual policyholders. Such computerized process for VIN\nvalidation shall consist of the use of commercial VIN software or a check digit\ncomputation, as employed by the DMV developed software described herein. Such\ncomputerized process for New York State driver's license number validation\nshall consist of a check digit computation, as employed by the DMV developed\nsoftware described herein. (g) Basic requirements. (1)\nID cards shall not be issued in more than\ntwo individual names. (2)\nID cards\nshall not be issued in a combination of individual and organization\nnames. (3)\nID cards shall not be\nissued in more than one organization name. (4)\n\nAn individual DBA is considered to be an\norganization name for purposes of this Part. Example of an insured name for an\nindividual DBA: JOHN SMITH DBA SMITH TRUCKING. (i) Proof of DBA filing is required for\nregistration. (ii)\n\nIf ID cards are\nbeing issued for a reregistration (vehicle change on an existing registration), the existing registration must be in the DBA name to issue ID cards in a DBA\nname. If the current vehicle is registered in an individual name then ID cards\nshall be issued in the individual name unless the registrant elects to apply\nfor an original registration. (iii)\n\nAn ID card issued in an individual DBA name is not acceptable for registration\nin an individual name. (iv)\n\nAn ID\ncard issued in an individual name is not acceptable for registration in an\nindividual DBA name. Note: Effective in January of 2000, DMV began registering an\nindividual DBA name in accordance with the example in this subsection. An\nindividual DBA was registered last name first during calendar years 1997, 1998\nand 1999. DMV did not allow registration in the name of an individual DBA until\n\nFebruary of 1997. In many cases a vehicle is actually registered in an\nindividual name, not an individual DBA name. (5)\nID cards shall be issued in the full\nDBA name\nfor registering in an\norganization's\nDBA name. Example: The registrant/insured name Capital District Restaurant\n\nGroup DBA Gimme Pizza shall be Capital District Restaurant Group DBA Gimme\n\nPizza. The insurance ID card must include the name of the individual and the\ntrade name. (6)\n\nInsured (ID card\nand policy) names shall be the same as registration names. An insured name on\nan insurance policy and ID cards shall not be changed unless the registration\nname is first changed. DMV shall require proof, other than an ID card, of the\nname change, to change the registration name. A policy and ID cards shall be\nissued in the registration name regardless of whether or not such name is the\ncurrent name, e.g., maiden name. A name change to the policy\nand ID cards shall be made only after a change in registration name. Proof of a\nname change required by DMV to change a registration name shall not include\nsubmission of proof of a name change with an insurance company. The name change\nwith DMV shall come first. (7)\n\nAll\nregistration and ID card names shall be incorporated into the policy to ensure\ncompatibility of insured/additional insured names required to be submitted to\nDMV in accordance with provisions of Part 34 of this Title. (8)\n\nName editing for trusts (organization\nname). Such ID cards require special editing to meet legal requirements and to\nfit in the available space. Examples: (VIN).............................................................................................. MICHAEL;MOTORIST/TST.......................................................................... %MICHAEL;MOTORIST/STL\n(or/TR).......................................................................... (VIN).............................................................................................. M;&;C;MOTORIST/TST............................................................................... %M;&;C;MOTORIST/TST\n(or/TR)............................................................... TST=Trust...................................................................................................... STL=Settlor (Grantor or\n\nTrustor).................................................................... TR=Trustee..................................................................................................... (9)\nID cards shall not be issued using\nprefixes or occupations, e.g., DR, MR, REV, ATTORNEY AT\nLAW. (10)\nID cards shall not be\nissued with /, %,C/O or in care of as part of the name except as provided for\nherein. (11)\nID cards shall not\nshow an effective date prior to the actual effective date of\ncoverage. (12)\nID cards shall not\nshow an expiration date after the actual policy expiration date. (13)\nA producer shall not issue ID cards for\nan insurance company that he or she is not authorized to represent. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
