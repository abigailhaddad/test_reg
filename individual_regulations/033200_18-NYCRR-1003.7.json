  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 1003.7 - Notification of defects\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Fund will have 15 calendar days after receipt of an\ninvoice by the designated payment office to notify the contractor of: (a) defects in the delivered goods, property, or services; (b) defects in the\ninvoice; or\n(c) suspected\nimproprieties of any kind. The existence of such defects or improprieties will delay the\ncommencement of the time period specified in section\n1003.4\nof this Part until such\ndefects or improprieties are corrected. When the fund fails to notify a\ncontractor of such defects or suspected improprieties within 15 calendar days\nof receiving the invoice, the number of days allowed for payment of the\ncorrected proper invoice will be reduced by the number of days between the 15th\nday after receipt of the original invoice and the day that notification was\ntransmitted to the contractor. If the Fund fails to provide reasonable grounds\nfor its contention that a defect or impropriety exists, the date by which the\ncontract payment must be made in order for the Fund not to become liable for\ninterest payments will be calculated from the date of receipt of a proper\ninvoice. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 18\n§\n1003.7\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
