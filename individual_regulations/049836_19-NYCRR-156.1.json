A request to search the records of the department for\nthe availability of an organization name shall be in writing and be accompanied\nby the appropriate fee. If the search reveals that a name is not available, the\ndepartment in so responding need not state the reason why unless asked in\nwriting to do so. When the reason is that the name conflicts with the name of\nanother organization, the department need provide no more than one example\nunless specifically and separately asked to provide additional conflicting\nnames. (b) Other searches of\nrecords. Except for a name availability search, a request to search the records\nof the department need not be in writing. Unless the required fee accompanies\nthe request, the department shall limit the number of names searched to the\nnumber the law allows without fee. To determine if a fee is due, the department\nshall treat as one all requests received from the same source in the same\nbusiness day. (c) Effect of\navailability or reservation. By responding that a name is available or by\naccepting a reservation of a name, the department does not approve the name. Availability or reservation does not imply that the name satisfies any\nparticular requirement of law nor any particular standard of a body with power\nto grant or withhold its approval, license, or permit or to take any other\naction. No expenditure or other commitment should be made in reliance upon the\navailability of or reservation of a name. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
