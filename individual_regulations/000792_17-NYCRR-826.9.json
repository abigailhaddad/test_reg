An official or an employee of a corporation (see subdivision [a] of\nthis section) may not act as agent when such corporation acts as agent unless\nauthorized by the commissioner. (e) Agency corporation, tariffs to be filed in its name. (1)\nA corporation (see subdivision [a] of\nthis section) accepting powers of attorney making such corporation an attorney\nand agent shall issue its tariffs in the name of the corporation as agent. At\nthe bottom of the title page of each publication filed by the corporation as\nagent shall be shown the name and title of the official of the corporation who\nhas been appointed by such corporation to handle tariff matters with the\ncommissioner. (2)\nA corporation\n(see subdivision [a] of this section) acting as a publishing agent under powers\nof attorney shall forward to the commissioner a certified minute[FN*] of the\nmeeting of the board of directors of such corporation showing the name and\ntitle of the official who has been appointed to handle all tariff matters with\nthe commissioner. (f) Carriers' limitation of authority to agents. Powers of attorney authorized by\nthis section must indicate exactly the authority conferred and may be limited\nto the issuance and filing of tariffs containing (1) freight rates, (2)\nclassifications, (3) classification exceptions, (4) rules, or (5) a specific\ntariff, but not otherwise. If it is intended that the authority granted shall\ninclude reissues of a specifically named tariff, the designation of such tariff\nmust be followed by \"or successive issues thereof\". (g) Printing size; notice of changes. Powers\nof attorney shall be printed on good paper of durable quality, no larger than\n81/2 inches by 11 inches in size, and shall be signed as indicated in Note 2 of\nthe form following subdivision (b) of this section. Each power of attorney\nshall be given a form and serial number which shall be shown on the upper right\nhand corner and immediately thereunder shall be shown the form and number of\nthe power of attorney, if any, which is canceled thereby. If the instrument to\nbe canceled contains more authority or is broader in scope than the new\ninstrument, such new instrument must bear an effective date at least 60 days\nafter the date on which it is received by the commissioner. When the new\ninstrument is broader in scope than the instrument which is to be canceled, no\nnotice is required. (h) Filing, triplicate copies. All instruments must be prepared in triplicate. Except when\nthere is specific instruction in individual rules to send originals to an\nagent, the original of the instrument shall be filed with the commissioner, the\nduplicate sent to the agent to whom such authorization is directed, and the\nthird copy retained by the issuing carrier. (i) Duplicating authority. Powers of attorney\nmay not contain authority to delegate to another the power thereby conferred. In giving authority to an agent to publish and file rates for the carrier by\nwhom such authority is issued, care must be taken to avoid duplicating to two\nor more agents authority which, if used, would result in conflicting rates or\nprovisions. (j) Alternate agent. When a power of attorney is issued to an individual to act as agent (see\nsubdivision [b] of this section), such instrument shall name an alternate agent\nto act in the event of the death or disability of the principal agent. On or\nbefore the date of filing of the first tariff or supplement by the alternate\nagent under the authority granted in the instrument, such alternate agent shall\nsubmit to the commissioner a sworn statement setting forth the reason or\nreasons which justify such exercise of authority. The term \"disability\" as used\nin the instrument means resignation, permanent transfer to other duties, or\nother permanent absence of the principal agent, and does not mean temporary\nabsence of the principal caused by vacation, illness, or other similar cause. After an alternate agent has once exercised the authority granted by the\ninstrument, the principal agent may not thereafter act under that\ninstrument. (k) Transfer of\nauthority. (1)\n\nWhen it is desired to transfer\nauthority from one agent to another agent, such transfer may be accomplished by\nfiling a new power of attorney naming the agent (and alternate when necessary)\nthereafter to serve, which shall specifically cancel the previous power of\nattorney. (2)\n\nWhen a power of\nattorney has been issued to an individual and an alternate (see subdivision [b]\nof this section), in the event of the death or disability of either the\nprincipal or alternate agent, new powers of attorney canceling the previously\neffective powers of attorney and naming the agent and alternate agent\nthereafter to serve shall be filed within 180 days. The new powers of attorney\nshall bear no effective date. The originals thereof shall not be sent direct to\nthe commissioner, but shall be forwarded to the new agent, which agent, after\nall the necessary instruments have been secured, shall file the originals with\nthe commissioner all at one time. Such powers of attorney will become effective\nupon the date they are received by the commissioner. (l) Revocation. A power of attorney may be\nrevoked upon not less than 60 days' notice to the commissioner by filing a\nnotice of revocation with the commissioner, serving at the same time a copy\nthereof on the agent in whose favor such power of attorney was executed. Such\nnotice shall not bear a serial number, but shall specify the form and number of\nthe power of attorney to be revoked, shall name the agent (and alternate agent\nwhen form DOT-NY M.T. 1 is being revoked) in whose favor the power of attorney\nwas executed, shall specify a date upon which revocation is to become effective\n(which must be not less than 60 days subsequent to the date of its receipt by\nthe commissioner), and shall be executed in the following manner on good\nquality paper no larger than 81/2 inches by 11 inches.
