  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 720-6.2 - Electric fuel statements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Where\ncorporations and municipalities elect to file fuel adjustment statements in\naccordance with section\n720-6.1\nof this Subpart, the\nstatements must contain: (1)\nidentification\nof the schedules and service classifications to which they apply; (2)\nthe base cost of fuel (separately, when\nmore than one base is used in the schedule); (3)\nthe present average cost to the\nutility; (4)\nthe date at which, and\nthe period for which, the average was determined; (5)\nthe amount per unit of consumption\naffected; and\n(6)\nthe date when the\nincrease or decrease in rates shall become effective and the period it will\nremain in effect. (b) The following definitions apply in connection with this section: (1)\n\nThe term cost of fuel is defined as the\ncost of fossil, hydro and nuclear fuel used by the company in generation for\nits customers, plus the cost of economy energy purchased for its customers, plus the fuel costs of other energy purchased for its customers, estimated if\nnot known, plus any necessary adjustment correcting estimated fuel costs of\npurchased energy of previous months; except that fuel costs associated with\nnuclear generating plants whose capital costs have not been reflected in the\nrate base for rate determination purposes may be priced at the base cost of\nfuel. A period of four months shall be allowed for determining the estimated\nfuel costs after which the estimate shall be adjusted to the utility's average\nfuel cost at the time of purchase. (2)\n\nThe term base cost of fuel is defined as\nthe cost of fuel per unit which is established as the basis in computing the\nfuel surcharge. It shall be clearly stated, together with the method of\narriving at it, in connection with the filing of the fuel surcharge\nprovision. (3)\n\nThe average cost of\nfuel is defined as the cost of fuel defined in paragraph (1) of this\nsubdivision divided by the total generated and purchased energy minus the\nenergy sold to other utilities except utilities covered by the fuel cost\nadjustment clause, minus transmitting and pumping losses associated with energy\nsupplied for pumped storage generating units. The determination of the\nutility's own fuel cost shall be derived using the averaging method, i.e., the\ntotal cost of fuel on hand at the beginning of the month, plus the cost of fuel\nreceived during the month divided by the sum of the total quantity of fuel on\nhand at the beginning of the month and the total amount of fuel received during\nthe month. (4)\n\nThe term economy\nenergy is defined as that energy purchased in compliance with the economy\nenergy definition of the New York Power Pool, plus that energy purchased at a\ntotal charge equal to or less than the utility's avoided fuel cost. (5)\n\nThe term fees is defined as amounts paid\nto brokers, agents, individuals or clearinghouses which are directly associated\nwith identifiable gas supply purchases. To be considered a part of the cost of\nfossil fuel purchases, and includable in the fuel adjustment clause, such fees\nare subject to the following conditions: (i) such fees must provide a net reduction in the delivered cost to the utility on\nan avoided cost basis, i.e., the combination of gas costs, delivery costs and\nfee payments must be less than the cost of the supply that would have been\ntaken but for this purchase; (ii)\nthe fee payment may not be to an affiliate of the utility, nor may it be for\ngas ultimately purchased from an affiliate; (iii)\ncosts attributable to utility personnel\nmay not be included in such fee payment; (iv)\nthe fee payment may not cause the price\nof the subject gas supply to exceed its maximum lawful price pursuant to the\n\nNatural Gas Policy Act of 1978; (v) the fee payment must be related to a specific gas volume and may not be of a\ngeneral nature, such as an expense for performing a survey or a start-up\nexpense for a broker, agent, individual, or clearinghouse; (vi)\nlump sum fees must be recovered over the\nestimated quantities with which such fees are associated; (vii)\nwhere applicable, the utility must\nfully detail and justify all such costs in annual gas cost recovery\nreconciliations and in rate case presentations as part of the review of gas\npurchasing practices; and\n(viii)\nin\nconjunction with the first claim for recovery of each fee through the electric\nadjustment clause, workpapers supporting such filings must clearly set forth\nthe new fee and include a statement that the gas supply was not available to\nthe utility without this payment.
