Codes R. & Regs. tit. 16, Appendices, app 9-A\nState Regulations\nTESTING OF METERS; REPORTS OF TESTS\nINSTRUCTIONS FOR REPORTING METER TESTS ON REVISED FORM NO. 2\n\nStatus of Meter Testing\n\nThe data required under this heading is self-explanatory and is\nthe same as that previously reported under the same heading on Revised Form No. I. General Instructions\n\nRevised Quarterly Report, Form 2, is designed to reveal the\nresults of meter testing and to furnish certain data relating to meters\nprepared for service. The primary purpose is to determine the results of the\ntesting of so-called Time and Registration Limit meters and to ascertain the\nmanner in which such meters are being prepared for return to service. For the\npurpose of this report Time and Registration Limit meters are those meters\nwhich have reached or exceeded the limits shown in subdivision (b) of section\n500.1\nof the rules and regulations\ngoverning the testing of water meters, as ordered by the Public Service\n\nCommission. For example, a 5/8-inch meter in service 5 years or a 2-inch meter\nin service 4 years without having been tested is a Time Limit meter and\nlikewise any 5/8-inch meter in service through which 750,000 gallons of water\nhave passed without testing of the meter is designated as a Registration Limit\nmeter. Of coure, many meters are removed from service for reasons other than\nbecause they are Time or Registration Limit meters, as for example, a 5/8-inch\nmeter removed from a vacant house after two years of service. Such meters are\naccordingly classed as \"Other Meters\" and, whereas Form 2 [following] indicates\nthat information is required as to the test results of such meters upon removal\n(Table A), data is not requested regarding the preparation of such meters for\nservice (Table B). A 6-inch current meter tested once each year would be\nclassed as a Time Limit meter, but if a particular 6-inch meter is tested for a\nsecond time in any one year, the second test would be included under \"Other\n\nMeters\" since the second test was not required in accordance with P.S.C. regulations and is therefore not strictly a Time Limit test. In other words, meters removed from service for testing or meters tested in the field for the\npurpose of complying with the P.S.C. regulations regarding time and\nregistration intervals are classed Time or Registration Limit Meters; all other\nmeters removed for test or tested in the field after having been in service are\nclassed as \"Other Meters\". It is important to note that if a meter should stop\nregistering and should also be a Time Limit meter, it should be so identified\nin both respects as the Form requires a recording of such information, and the\ncause of removal for such a meter should be \"Stopped--Time Limit\" and not\nmerely \"Stopped\". Obviously, this will provide information as to whether\nstopped or non-registering meters have exceeded the time or registration limits\nor not, as the case may be. Similarly for frozen meters, the proper\nsub-designation should be given, although the added sub-designation \"Time or\n\nRegistration Limit\" in such cases is not quite so important. The form provides space to indicate whether the meter upon\ntesting passed the P.S.C. test. Thus, if the test result meets the requirements\nindicated in the paragraphs relating to \"Tests of Meters\" of the P.S.C. Regulations, it is recorded as \"Passed P.S.C. Test\". For example, a 5/8-inch\nmeter is removed from service and classified as \"Time Limit\". It is tested at\nthe shop with the following results: Rate of\nflow\n\nAccuracy of\nregistration\nG.P.M. per cent\n20.0\n98.5\n2.0\n101.0\n0.25\n\nSteady Movement\n\nThis meter would be recorded as \"Passed P.S.C. Test\", since it\ndid not fall below 98.0 per cent and did not exceed 101.0 per cent at the\nselected rates within \"Normal Test Flow Limits\" and it also showed proper\nsensitivity at the \"Minimum Test Flow\" of 0.25 g.p.m. If this meter had\nrecorded 97.0 per cent at 20.0 g.p.m. or if it had exceeded 101.0 per cent at\n2.0 g.p.m. or if it had failed to move at all at 0.25 g.p.m., it would then\nhave failed in one of the three instances to meet the P.S.C. test requirements. All requirements of the Regulations have to be met in order to classify the\nmeter as \"Passed P.S.C. Test\". TABLE A\nThis part of the form shows the results of the routine testing\nof meters and also indicates the number of \"non-registering\" meters brought\ninto the shop or found stopped in the field. The data required appears to be\nself-explanatory. The number of new meters tested for the given period is shown\nin Column (b) and all such meters either passed the P.S.C. test or were\nre-geared or calibrated to meet the test requirements. Column (c) shows the\nnumber of Time Limit meters tested and Column (d) indicates how many \"Passed\nthe P.S.C. Test\" requirements with the obvious conclusion that the difference\nfailed to pass. Columns (i), (j) and (k) show the number of Time and\n\nRegistration Limit Meters which were brought in because stopped, those in\n\nColumn (k) having been frozen and the others having stopped from other causes. Columns (l) and (m) Other Meters are to show those which were neither Time nor\n\nRegistration Limit Meters and were found stopped or frozen. TABLE B\nTable B explains how Time and Registration Limit meters were\nprepared for reinstallation in service and how many meters were retired. Column\n(o) shows the number of Time Limit meters made ready for service, that is, they\nwere tested and perhaps re-geared or repaired to meet the P.S.C. test\nrequirements pertaining to all meters ready for service. There may or may not\nbe any direct relation between the meters shown in Table A and those shown in\n\nTable B. It is recognized that a number of meters during any one quarterly\nperiod may be tested and the results reported for that quarter, but that the\nrepair work or preparation of such meters for service may not be done until the\nnext quarter and should thus be reported in the proper quarterly report; hence, meters, made ready for service shown in Table B, may or may not be the same\nmeters for which test results are shown in Table A. In general where field\ntests are concerned, there will be a relation between Tables A and B as field\nwork on any particular meter is generally completed in one day. The report shows the number of Time Limit Meters [Column (o)]\nmade ready for service, and the manner in which they were made ready is\nindicated in Columns (p) (q) and (r). Those shown in Column (p) are meters\nwhich upon removal from service passed the P.S.C. test requirements and were\nconsidered as again ready for service without any extensive repairs beyond\nperhaps wiping off or painting the main casing or perhaps the replacement of a\nbroken register box glass or a defective register box screw or perhaps even a\nnew or repaired register; however, the meters were not disassembled so that the\ninternal working parts could be examined, such as gear trains, chambers, discs, pistons, and so forth. Also, the only test performed was the one which\nindicated that the meters upon removal tested within the requirements. Column (q) shows the number of meters that failed to pass the\nP.S.C. test requirement but it was possible to re-gear the meters to bring them\nwithin the requirements; also, that no extensive repairs were made. The only\ndifference between the meters shown in Column (q) as compared with those shown\nin Column (p) is that it was necessary to re-gear and hence re-test those in\n\nColumn (q). Column (r) shows the number of meters, whether or not they\npassed or failed the P.S.C. test requirements, which were disassembled and\ncompletely examined or overhauled with the performance of any necessary repairs\nor replacement of major or minor parts. Such meters, of course, would be\nre-tested after being reassmbled and would be calibrated to meet all P.S.C. requirements. Practice in certain companies dictate that all meters be\ndisassembled and all parts examined, regardless of whether the meters passed or\nfailed to pass the test when removed from service or when tested in service. The purpose of the report is to reflect the practice and results of the\nparticular company making the report. The fact that columns are provided for\nreporting the manner of preparing meters for return to service according to the\ncompany's practice in no way indicates approval of such practice. The figures\nshown in Column (s) are not related to those shown in Column (o). Column (s)\nmerely gives information as to the number of meters retired. These are in\naddition to the number returned to service. Columns (t) to (x) require similar\ndata for Registration Limit meters. Meters retired which have reached neither the Time Limit nor\nthe Registration Limit should be entered in Column (x) and be denoted by a\ndouble asterisk (**) The total of the meters entered in Columns (s) and (x)\nshould equal the total number of meters which, during the period, were retired\non the company's books.
