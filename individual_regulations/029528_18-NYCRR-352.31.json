  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.31 - Estimate of need and application of income\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For applicant or recipient. (1)\n\nThe estimate of need for any applicant or\nrecipient shall include all items of need as specified in these regulations for\npersons in the circumstances under which such items are allowed. The amount to\nbe included for each item of need shall be the appropriate amount provided in\naccordance with schedules and other provisions of these regulations. To the\nextent that an item offered is otherwise provided, it shall not be included in\nthe estimate of need, but the manner in which such item is provided shall be\nrecorded. (2)\n\nAll available and\nunrestricted income of a legally responsible relative in the home and/or a\nrelative required to be in the public assistance household pursuant to section\n352.30\nof this Part must be\napplied against his/her own needs and the needs of the other persons in the\npublic assistance household. In determining eligibility and standard of need, if one of the relatives referenced in this paragraph is sanctioned under Part\n347, 349, 352, 369, 370 or 385 of this Title, all of that person's income, minus any appropriate disregards under section 352.19 or\n352.20\nof this Part, must be\napplied against the needs of the public assistance household. (3)\n\nThe amount of income received by the\napplicant or recipient in excess of $15 per month from a lodger, or in excess\nof income of $60 per month from a boarding lodger, shall be considered as\nincome to the applicant or recipient, unless such applicant or recipient\ndocuments that the actual out-of-pocket expenses incurred in providing the room\nfor the lodger exceed $15 per month, or that such expenses for room and board\nfor the boarding lodger exceed $60 per month. If documented expenses exceed $15\nor $60, actual expenses shall be allowed and the excess considered income to\nthe applicant or recipient. (4)\n\nSupport payments made pursuant to an order of the Family Court or other\nappropriate court by an individual through a social services district's support\ncollection unit on behalf of a safety net assistance applicant or recipient, must be applied in the safety net assistance category as follows: an amount of\ncurrent child or child and spousal support collected on behalf of the safety\nnet assistance household must be disregarded and paid to the safety net\nassistance household pursuant to section\n352.15\nof this Part. The remaining\namount must be used for purposes of determining eligibility for public\nassistance, and then applied as reimbursement for public assistance paid to the\nsafety net assistance household on whose behalf such support payments are\ncollected. (5)\n\nSupport payments\nrequired to be made directly to a recipient by an individual pursuant to an\norder of the Family Court or other appropriate court will be treated in the\nsafety net assistance category only as follows: (i) If there has been habitual failure to\nmake court-ordered support payments or where the circumstances are such that\nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that such support payments will not be\nmade, the income therefrom may be considered as irregular as to amount or\nuncertain as to receipt and the provisions of subdivision (c) of this section\nshall be considered as applicable. (ii)\n\nFailure to make at least three payments\nin full during the preceding three-month period shall be deemed to constitute\nan habitual failure to make payments. (iii)\n\nThe following shall constitute\nreasonable grounds to believe that court-ordered support payments will not be\nmade by the individual who has been ordered to make such payments: (a) the individual has failed to make at\nleast three consecutive court-ordered support payments in full; or\n(b) the whereabouts of the individual are\nunknown; or\n(c) the individual is\nknown to be unemployed; or\n(d) the\nindividual's sole means of support is known to be public assistance or\nsupplemental security income or both; or\n(e) the individual is confined to a medical\ninstitution or is obviously too ill or incapacitated to work; or\n(f) the individual is incarcerated in a penal\ninstitution. (iv)\n\nIn\ncases in which the individual is making payments on a regularly recurring\nbasis, but in an amount less than the amount stated in the court order, such\nlesser amount only shall be applied against the needs of the applicants or\nrecipients in determining the amount of the grant. (v) For current child or child and spousal\nsupport received directly by a safety net assistance household in a month, an\namount determined pursuant to section\n352.15\nof this Part must be\ndisregarded. (6)\n\nUpon\nnotification by the support collection unit of the amount of current support\ncollected for a month for a recipient of public assistance, the public\nassistance unit must review the household's eligibility to receive public\nassistance. This review must be conducted no later than the second month after\nthe month in which the public assistance unit receives from the support\ncollection unit the report of the current support collected for the month. In\ndetermining whether the amount of current support collected was sufficient to\nmake the family ineligible for assistance during the month for which the\nsupport was collected, the public assistance unit must treat the amount of\nsupport collected, less the portion disregarded pursuant to section\n352.15\nof this Part, as income. If\nsuch treatment makes the family ineligible for assistance, the public\nassistance unit must notify the family and the support collection unit of the\neffective date of the household's ineligibility for assistance. If such\ntreatment does not make the household ineligible for an assistance payment, the\nassistance payment will be calculated without regard to the amount of support\ncollected. (7)\n\nIf assistance which\nis countable under the durational time limit provisions of section 369.4 or\n370.4\nof this Title continues to\nbe paid after the effective date of ineligibility pursuant to paragraph (6) of\nthis subdivision, the social services district shall adjust the time limit\ncount of trackable individuals in the case to remove the months of\nineligibility during which countable assistance was issued. (8)\n\nAny amount of support paid to the\nhousehold pursuant to section\n347.13\n(b)(3)(iv), (v), (vi), (vii), (c)(2)(iii), (iv), or (v) of this Title must be treated as\nincome in the month after the month in which the payment is received by the\nhousehold. (b) [\nReserved\n]\n(c) Temporary changes in earned income. When there is a temporary change in earned income, no\nadjustment will be made to the regularly recurring public assistance grant. However, changes in earned income that last for less than 30 days must be\nsupplemented when the following conditions are met: (1)\na supplement has been\nrequested; (2)\nverification of the\nreduced earned income amount has been provided no later than 10 days after the\nmonth in which the reduction occurred; and\n(3)\nthe recipient has established that the\nreduction in earned income was beyond the recipient's control. Beyond\nthe recipient's control\nmeans that the reduction resulted from: (i) a mental or physical problem that the\nrecipient had; (ii)\nthe employer's\ndetermination to reduce hours of work or wages; or\n(iii)\nother extenuating circumstances under\nwhich the recipient could not reasonably be expected to earn the same amount of\nincome. (d) Recovery of overpayments. (1)\n\nSocial services districts shall take all reasonable steps necessary to promptly\ncorrect any overpayments, including overpayments resulting from assistance paid\npending a hearing decision, subject to the following conditions: (i) Social services districts must recover an\noverpayment from: (a) the assistance unit\nthat was overpaid; (b) any\nassistance unit of which an adult member of the overpaid assistance unit, as\ndefined in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, has subsequently become a\nmember; and\n(c) any adult\nindividual member of the overpaid assistance unit, as defined in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, whether or not currently a recipient. (ii)\n\nThe term\nadult, as used in this subdivision, refers to any member of\nthe assistance unit who at the time of overpayment occurrence exceeds the age\nrequirements of an eligible child as set forth in section\n369.2\n(c) of this\n\nTitle. A child meeting the eligible child age requirements as set forth in\nsection\n369.2\n(c) of this\n\nTitle who is a member of the assistance unit at the time of overpayment\noccurrence must not be held liable for overpayment recoupment/recovery by\noperation of clauses (i)(\nb\n) or (\nc\n) of this\nparagraph. (2)\n\nThe\nproportion of the current assistance grant that must be deducted for recoupment\nmust be 10 percent of the household's needs for family assistance and safety\nnet assistance. If undue hardship is claimed and substantiated, the recoupment\nmust not be less than five percent of the household's needs. However, when the\ngrant amount is less than 10 percent of such needs for family assistance or\nsafety net assistance, or less than five percent in undue hardship situations, the full grant must be recouped. For purposes of this paragraph, the\nhousehold's needs include the following allowances: (i) an allowance for regularly recurring\nneeds and home energy as contained in schedules SA-2a, SA-2b and SA-2c of\nsection\n352.2\n(d) of this\n\nPart; (ii)\nan allowance for rent in\naccordance with section\n352.3\n(a) and (d)\nof this Part; (iii)\nan allowance\nfor fuel for heating as contained in schedules SA-6a, SA-6b and SA-6c of\nsection\n352.5\n(b) of this\n\nPart; (iv)\nan allowance for\npersonal needs in accordance with section\n352.8\nof this Part; (v) a restaurant allowance and an allowance\nfor home delivered meals as contained in schedule SA-5 of section\n352.7\n(c) of this\n\nPart; (vi)\nan allowance for chattel\nmortgages or conditional sales contracts in accordance with section\n352.7\n(h) of this\n\nPart; (vii)\na pregnancy allowance\nin accordance with section\n352.7\n(k) of this\n\nPart; and\n(viii)\nan allowance for\nwater in accordance with section\n352.3\n(b) of this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nIf through\nrecoupment, the amount payable to the assistance unit is reduced to zero, members of the assistance unit are still considered recipients of family\nassistance or safety net assistance. (4)\n\nIn cases which have both an underpayment\nand an overpayment, the social services district shall offset one against the\nother in correcting the payment. (5)\n\nRecovery shall be made by appropriate\nlegal action against the income or resources of those individuals who are no\nlonger recipients. However, social services districts may waive recovery of an\noverpayment from an individual no longer receiving assistance if the amount of\nthe overpayment is less than $125 and the overpayment was not the result of\nfraud on the part of the recipient as defined in section\n348.1\nof this Title. In cases\ninvolving fraud, social services districts must continue to make an effort to\nrecover the overpayment, regardless of the amount. When the overpayment is $125\nor more and does not involve fraud, social services districts may elect to\ndiscontinue collection procedures when it is determined that the cost of\nrecovery is greater than the cost of collection and reasonable efforts to\nrecover the overpayment have been made. Reasonable efforts\nmust include notification of the amount of and reason for the overpayment and\nthat repayment is required. If recovery is not made, the social services\ndistrict must recoup the amount of overpayment if the assistance unit reapplies\nand is found eligible. (6)\n\nWhen a\nrecipient who is subject to recoupment moves from one social services district\nto another, the new district of residence shall recover overpayments made by\nthe social services district of original residence in accordance with the\nprovisions of this Part. (7)\n\nSocial\nservices districts shall take one of the following three actions by the end of\nthe quarter following the quarter in which the overpayment is first identified: (i) recover the payment; (ii)\ninitiate action to locate and/or recover\nthe overpayment from a former recipient; or\n(iii)\ninitiate recoupment from a current\nrecipient's grant. (8)\n\nWhen an overpayment, or any portion of an overpayment, represents assistance\nreceived during a period of ineligibility for such assistance, and when such\nassistance was countable toward a time limit pursuant to the provisions of\nsection 369.4 or\n370.4\nof this Title, social\nservices districts shall take the following actions: (i) identify the specific whole calendar\nmonth(s) of ineligibility for countable assistance; (ii)\nidentify the amount of countable\nassistance for each whole calendar month of ineligibility; (iii)\ntrack repayment or recovery of the\namount of the overpayment to determine when a previous whole calendar month of\ncountable assistance has been fully recouped or recovered; and\n(iv)\nadjust the individual's time limit count\nto remove each calendar month of ineligible receipt of countable assistance as\nthe full amount of countable assistance for that month is recouped or\nrecovered. (e) Overpayments to aliens. (1)\n\nAny sponsor of an alien and the alien\nshall be jointly and severally liable for any overpayment of public assistance\nmade to the alien during the three years after the alien's entry into the\n\nUnited States due to the sponsor's failure to provide correct information under\nthe provisions of section\n352.33\nof this Part. (2)\n\nWhen a sponsor is found to have good\ncause or to be without fault for not providing information to the social\nservices district, the sponsor will not be held liable for the overpayment and\nrecovery will not be made from such sponsor. The sponsor shall have good cause\nor be without fault if the information requested was not known and could not\nhave been known to the sponsor or the documentation requested was not available\nto the sponsor. (3)\n\nAn overpayment\nfor which the alien or the sponsor and the alien are liable shall be repaid to\nthe social services district or recovered in accordance with subdivision (d) of\nthis section. If the social services district is unable to recover the\noverpayment through this method, funds to reimburse the agency shall be\nwithheld from future payment to which the alien or sponsor is entitled under: (i) family assistance or safety net\nassistance; or\n(ii)\nany\nfederally-administered cash benefit program established by the Social Security\n\nAct. (f) Correction of underpayments to current recipients. (1)\n\nSocial services districts must correct\nany underpayments to current recipients, and to those who would be current\nrecipients if the error causing the underpayment had not occurred, by making\nappropriate payments in each case within 30 days after discovery of the\nunderpayments. Such retroactive payments will not be considered as income or as\na resource in the month paid or in the next following month. Judicial\ndeterminations which enjoin or declare invalid departmental policy do not\ncreate an underpayment. (2)\n\nPersons\nwho join an existing public assistance filing unit, who are required to be\nmembers of the unit and, whose presence causes an underpayment to be made to\nthe case will have an underpayment adjustment made only: (i) for those months in which the filing unit\nmet all eligibility requirements; or\n(ii)\nfor the period retroactive to the date\nthat the persons joined the existing filing unit when the change in household\ncomposition is reported within 10 days of its occurrence, and if the\nappropriate eligibility requirements are met within such 10-day\nperiod.
