All keys, set screws, bolts and similar projections on shafts, pulleys, gears, collars and couplings and other revolving members, where such projections are\nnot countersunk or protected by location from accidental contact by persons, shall be guarded by smooth, cylindrical safety sleeves constructed of wood or\nmetal which completely surrounds each such projection, or each such projection\nshall be guarded by a stationary enclosure of sheet metal, wire mesh, expanded\nmetal or other suitable material. Any openings in such enclosures shall reject\na ball one-half inch in diameter. (c) Power-driven saws. (1)\n\nEvery portable, power-driven, hand-operated saw which is not provided with a saw table, except chain saws and\ncircular brush saws, shall be equipped with a fixed guard above the base plate\nwhich will completely protect the operator from contact with the saw blade when\nthe saw is operating and with a movable self-adjusting guard below the base\nplate which will completely cover the saw blade to the depth of the teeth when\nsuch saw blade is removed from the cut. Note: Electrically-driven portable saws are also subject\nto the provisions of section\n23-1.10\nof this Part\n(rule). (2)\n\nEvery\npower-driven saw, other than a portable saw, shall be equipped with a guard\nwhich covers the saw blade to such an extent as will prevent contact with the\nteeth. In operation, such guard shall rise automatically by pressure from the\nmaterial being cut or shall be so adjusted that as the saw cuts the material, the distance from the material to the underside of the guard does not exceed\none-half inch. The exposed teeth of the saw blade beneath the table shall be\neffectively guarded. Every such saw shall be provided with a cut-off switch\nwithin easy reach of the operator without his leaving the operating position. Exception:Any arm saw whose upper blade half is enclosed\nand which is provided with a front blocking bar or rod is not required to be\nguarded by the automatic rising pressure guard. (3)\n\nEvery table circular saw used for ripping\nshall be provided with a spreader securely fastened in position and with an\neffective device to prevent material kickback. (d) Sprockets and gears. Sprockets and gears\nwhich are not protected by location or design from accidental contact by\npersons shall be completely enclosed or shall be provided with band guards\nwhich cover the periphery and which have side flanges which extend below the\nroots of the teeth. (e) Belts, pulleys and flywheels. All belts except conveyor belts and all pulleys and\nflywheels which are less than seven feet above the ground, floor, working\nplatform, runway or equivalent surface where persons work or pass and which are\nnot protected by location from accidental contact by persons, shall have all\nmoving parts guarded by substantial enclosures or by safety railings\nconstructed and installed in compliance with this Part (rule) which will\nprevent persons from approaching within a horizontal distance of 18 inches. Enclosures required by this Part (rule) may be temporarily removed when\nstarting a machine or for machine adjustment or maintenance, but shall be\nreplaced immediately thereafter. (f) Friction-disc drives. Friction-disc\ndrives which are not guarded by design or location from accidental contact with\nany person shall be completely enclosed or shall be provided with band guards\nwith side flanges. (g) Wire rope. The nip points between power winches or sheaves and wire ropes shall be guarded\nby substantial enclosures or by safety railings constructed and installed in\ncompliance with this Part (rule).
