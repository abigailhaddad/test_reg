  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 537.5 - Seller's, transferrer's or assignor's rights, obligations and liabilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The seller, transferrer or assignor of business assets in bulk is, at all times, responsible for the payment of any tax for which he is liable under article 28\nand pursuant to the authority of article 29 of the Tax Law. (b) The seller, transferrer or assignor must\nkeep and make available to the Division of Taxation all books and records\nrequired to determine his or her tax liability (see Records, section\n533.2\nof this\n\nTitle). (c) Upon receipt from the\n\nDivision of Taxation of a notice requesting that he produce his books and\nrecords for the purpose of an audit, the seller, transferrer or assignor is\nrequired to make his books and records available. (d) Where the seller, transferrer or assignor\nceases the conduct of a business, he is required to file a final sales and use\ntax return within 20 days after ceasing the conduct of the business, make\npayment of all taxes due with such return and surrender his certificate of\nauthority to collect taxes. (e) The\nseller, transferrer or assignor must give each prospective purchaser of his\nbusiness a copy of the notice to prospective purchasers relating to the\npurchaser's bulk sale notice requirements. Such notice accompanies the\ncertificate of authority. A copy of such notice may be obtained from the\n\nTaxpayer Assistance Bureau, Department of Taxation and Finance, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227, or from the Taxpayer Assistance Bureau at any district office\nof the Department of Taxation and Finance. (f) (1)\n\nThe\nseller, transferrer or assignor, in anticipation of the sale of business\nassets, may, prior to the sale, transfer or assignment in bulk of business\nassets, request an audit of his books and records to determine his tax\nliability up to the prospective date of sale of the business assets. Each\nseller is limited to one such request during any three-year period. The request\nfor such an audit must be made to the Bulk Sales Unit, Central Sales Tax\n\nSection, Audit Division, State Campus, Albany, NY 12227. The request should\ninclude a showing that a sale is intended by attaching thereto a notice or an\nadvertisement of sale, list of prospective buyers, or other evidence of\nintended sale. The department may request additional information and may\nrequire that such additional information be provided on a form obtained at the\n\nBulk Sales Unit. The Division of Taxation will, in its discretion, determine\nwhether such an audit will be performed. When it is decided that such an audit\nwill be performed, the district tax office serving the county in which the\nbusiness is located will fix the place and date for the seller, transferrer or\nassignor to appear with his books and records for the purpose of the\naudit. (2)\n\nUpon completion of the\naudit, the Division of Taxation will issue to the seller a bulk sales tax\ncertificate stating the amount of any liability due up to a date set forth in\nthe certificate. Such certificate may also state that no taxes are due or may\nstate the amount of taxes due up to the date of sale. The certificate may be\npresented to the purchaser, transferee or assignee at the time of transfer of\nthe business assets and is to be accepted by the purchaser, transferee or\nassignee as proof of the amount of the seller's liability, if any, for the\ntaxes listed thereon up to the date indicated upon the certificate. Such\ncertificate does not relieve a purchaser of his obligation to give notice of\nthe bulk sale to the Department of Taxation and Finance as required by\nsubdivision (c) of section\n1141\nof the Tax Law, and section\n537.2\nof this Part. Example 1:Upon audit, the seller's tax liability up to the\ndate of sale is determined to be $8,000. The seller pays the $8,000 to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance and is given a bulk sales tax certificate\nstating he has no tax liability up to the date of sale. The purchaser, upon\nreceipt from the seller of the bulk sales tax certificate, may pay over all the\nfunds to the seller. Example 2:Upon audit, the seller's tax liability is\ndetermined to be $12,000. The seller pays $2,000 to the department in part\nsatisfaction of his liability. The fair market value and the purchase price of\nthe business assets are both $8,000. The seller is given a bulk sales tax\ncertificate indicating that a tax liability of $10,000 up to the date of sale\nstill exists against the seller. The purchaser's liability is limited to\n$8,000. In addition, the purchaser will be liable for any tax, plus any penalty\nand interest, due on the sale of tangible personal property between the seller\nand the purchaser. Example 3:Assume the same facts as in Example 2, except\nthat the seller pays $8,000 instead of $2,000, and the certificate indicates\nthat the seller's liability has been ascertained to be $4,000 up to February\n28, 1979, a date one month prior to the date of closing. The purchaser may rely\non such fact. However, since there may be additional liability subsequent to\nthat date, the purchaser is required to withhold the total purchase price\npending the receipt of a notice of total tax due or authority to release the\nfunds. Example 4:Upon audit, the seller's tax liability up to the\ndate of sale is determined to be $6,000. The seller pays $4,000 to the\n\nDepartment of Taxation and Finance in part satisfaction of his liability. The\nfair market value and purchase price of the business is $8,000. The seller is\ngiven a bulk sales tax certificate indicating that a tax liability up to the\ndate of sale of $2,000 still exists against the seller. The purchaser, upon\nreceipt of the bulk sales tax certificate, must withhold such $2,000. (3)\n\nThe purchaser may rely on the\ncertificate as a statement of the seller's liability for the period stated\nthereon. However, the certificate is not an assessment or the 90-day notice\nrequired to be given by the Division of Taxation. (4)\n\nThe seller is not excused from any\nobligations or liabilities on his part, either because of the purchaser's\nfailure to comply with the provisions set forth in section\n537.3\nof this Part or because of the failure of the Department of Taxation and\n\nFinance to comply with its obligations set forth in section\n537.6\nof this Part; provided, however, nothing contained in this Part limits the\nright of the seller to have his tax due finally and irrevocably fixed pursuant\nto the provisions of subdivision (c) of section\n1138\nof the Tax Law.
