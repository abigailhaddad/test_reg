  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 663.9 - Items lists\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe items lists are provided for the purpose of clearly\nindicating the application of the prescribed accounting in specific cases. These lists are published separately by the director of the Office of\n\nAccounting and Finance or his designee. Companies shall be guided by the lists\nin recording the cost of specific assets in the telecommunications plant in\nservice detail accounts (accounts 2111 through 2690). These lists do not\ncomprise all of the items to be recorded in the specific accounts but are\nconsidered to be representative of them. The appearance of an item in a list\nwarrants the recording of such item in the designated account only when the\ntext of the account also indicates inclusion in the account, inasmuch as the\nsame item frequently appears in more than one list. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n663.9\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
