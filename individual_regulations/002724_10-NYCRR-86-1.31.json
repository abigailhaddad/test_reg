(3)\n\nThe indirect GME payment per discharge added to the case payment rates of teaching hospitals shall be calculated in accordance with section\n86-1.20\nof this Subpart, except the ratio of residents to beds used in the calculation shall be based on the total residents and beds of all such hospitals subject to the merger, acquisition, or consolidation. (4)\n\nThe non-comparable payment per discharge added to the case payment rates shall be calculated by dividing the total reported Medicaid costs for qualifying non-comparable cost categories for all hospitals subject to the merger, acquisition, or consolidation by the total reported Medicaid discharges reported by such hospitals in the applicable base period. (b) Closures, mergers, acquisitions, consolidations and restructurings. (1)\n\nThe commissioner may grant approval of a temporary adjustment to the non-capital components of rates calculated pursuant to this Subpart for eligible general hospitals.

(4)\n(i) Such written proposal shall be submitted to the commissioner at least 60 days prior to the requested effective date of the temporary rate adjustment and shall include a proposed budget to achieve the goals of the proposal. Any temporary rate adjustment issued pursuant to this section shall be in effect for a specified period of time as determined by the commissioner, of up to three years. At the end of the specified timeframe, the facility shall be reimbursed in accordance with the otherwise applicable rate-setting methodology as set forth in applicable statutes and this Subpart.
