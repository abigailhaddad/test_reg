  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 1 § 2.39 - Construction and repair of containers and equipment-item 11p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) All multiuse containers and equipment\nused in manufacturing, processing, packing, or holding of milk or milk products\nshall be so designed and of such material and workmanship as to be adequately\ncleanable, and shall be adequately maintained to protect against allergen\ncross-contact and contamination. Equipment shall be made of smooth, impervious, corrosion-resistant, and non-toxic material. (1)\n\nEquipment and utensils shall be designed, constructed, and used in such a manner in order to avoid the adulteration of\nfood with lubricants, fuel, metal fragments, contaminated water, or any other\ncontaminants. (2)\n\nEquipment, containers, and utensils used to convey, hold, or store raw materials and other\ningredients, food in process, rework, or other food shall be constructed, handled, and maintained during manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding\nin a manner that protects against allergen cross-contact and against\ncontamination. (3)\n\nEquipment shall\nbe installed so as to facilitate the cleaning and maintenance of the equipment\nand of adjacent spaces. (b) All milk-contact surfaces of multiuse\ncontainers and equipment consist of: (1)\nstainless steel of the AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) 300\nseries; (2)\nequally\ncorrosion-resistant metal which is nontoxic and nonabsorbent; (3)\nheat-resistant glass; or\n(4)\nplastic or rubber and rubberlike\nmaterials which are relatively inert, resistant to scratching, scoring, decomposition, crazing, chipping and distortion under normal use conditions; which are nontoxic, fat-resistant, relatively nonabsorbent, and do not impart\nflavor or odor to the product; and which maintain their original properties\nunder repeated use conditions. (c) All joints in containers, equipment and\nutensils are flush and finished as smooth as adjoining surfaces. Where a\nrotating shaft is inserted through a surface with which milk or milk products\ncome into contact, the joint between the mixing and stationary surfaces shall\nbe closefitting. Where a thermometer or temperature sensing element is inserted\nthrough a surface with which milk or milk products come into contact, a\npressure-tight seal shall be provided ahead of all threads and\ncrevices. (d) All openings in\ncovers of tanks, vats, separators, etc., are protected by raised edges, or\notherwise to prevent the entrance of surface drainage. Condensation-deverting\naprons shall be provided as close to the tank or vat as possible on all pipes, thermometers or temperature-sensing elements, and other equipment extending\ninto a tank, bowl, vat or distributor, unless a watertight joint is\nprovided. (e) All surfaces with\nwhich milk or milk products come into contact are easily accessible or\ndemountable for manual cleaning or are designed for mechanical cleaning. All\nproduct-contact surfaces shall be readily accessible for inspection and shall\nbe self-draining. Wing nuts, bayonet locks and similar devices shall be used\nwhenever possible in lieu of bolts and nuts, to promote easy\ndisassembly. (f) There are no\nthreads used in contact with milk or milk products except where needed for\nfunctional and safety reasons, such as in clarifiers, pumps and separators. Such threads shall be of a sanitary type. (g) All multiuse containers and other\nequipment have rounded corners, are in good repair and free from breaks, crevices and corrosion. Milk cans shall have umbrella-type covers. (h) Strainers, if used, are of perforated\nmetal design, and so constructed as to utilize single-service strainer media. Multiple-use woven material shall not be used for straining milk; provided, that, when required for function reasons inherent to the production of certain\nmilk products, such as buttermilk, whey and dry milk products, woven material\nmay be used where it is impractical to use perforated metal. However, woven\nmaterial parts shall be mechanically cleaned by such methods that thoroughly\nclean the woven material and do not contaminate the product. (i) All single-service containers, closures, gaskets and other articles, with which milk or milk products come in contact, are nontoxic. (j) The manufacture, packing, transportation and handling of single-service containers, closures, caps, gaskets and similar articles are approved by the commissioner. Inspections and tests shall be made by the commissioner or any agency\nauthorized by him. (k) Copper\nkettles for Swiss cheese and copper evaporators and brass fillers for\nevaporated milk may be approved if free from corroded surfaces and kept in good\ncondition. Wooden churns in use may be approved temporarily if maintained in\ngood condition. Nonmetallic parts having product-contact surfaces shall be of\nmaterial that is resistant to abrasion, scratching, scoring and distortion, that is nontoxic, fat-resistant, and relatively inert, nonabsorbent or\ninsoluble, and that will not adversely affect the flavor of the\nproducts.
