If an eligible surviving non-mortgagor spouse lives at the\nmortgage premises, such spouse may live in the property for the rest of his or\nher life as long as they cure any default in payment of property charges and\nremain there as their primary residence; (3)\nthe mortgagor, without notifying the\nmortgagee of an anticipated date of return and making arrangements satisfactory\nto mortgagee for the maintenance of the real property, ceases, in any 365-day\nperiod, to use the real property as his or her principal place of residence or\nin excess of 180 nonconsecutive days. This provision is subject to the\nfollowing: (i) The mortgagee's consent to the\narrangements made pursuant to this paragraph shall not be unreasonably\nwithheld. (ii)\nA mortgagor staying\nin a rehabilitative facility or nursing home is not subject to the notice\nrequirements of this subsection. (iii)\nA mortgagor staying in a rehabilitative\nfacility or nursing home will not trigger termination for failure to use the\nreal property as his or her principal place of residence until such failure\npersists for 12 consecutive months. (4)\nthe mortgagor's real estate taxes or\ninsurance premiums, as required pursuant to the security agreement, are in\narrears; (5)\nthe mortgagor: (i) is the subject of an involuntary petition\nin bankruptcy that is not discharged within 90 calendar days after it is filed; or\n(ii)\napplies for or permits the\nappointment of a receiver, trustee or custodian for the real property securing\nthe loan which is not discharged within 90 calendar days after the date of\nappointment; provided, however, that the appointment of a conservator, guardian, committee or other fiduciary of the person to act on the mortgagor'\nbehalf in connection with a determination by a court that the mortgagor is\nincompetent will not terminate the loan; or\n(6)\nthe mortgagor fails to maintain the real\nproperty in accordance with section\n79.6\nof this Part.

(d) All lenders must\nprepare a form entitled \"Lender's Limited Waiver of the Right of Foreclosure.\"\nThis document shall, clearly and conspicuously, identify every event, as\nprovided for in this section that would give the mortgagee authority to\nterminate the loan, and shall be provided to and signed by the mortgagor at the\nclosing of every loan. The lender shall furnish a copy of the executed form to\nevery mortgagor at closing and shall keep the original form on file for the\nlife of the loan, and thereafter in accordance with applicable\nstatutes.

It shall be the obligation of the mortgagor and any authorized\ndesignee to provide the mortgagee with current mailing information for any\nperson designated to receive such additional notice. (f) In the event that a mortgagee seeks to\nforeclose on a reverse mortgage loan solely on the basis of any event listed in\nsubdivisions (a)(3) or (a)(4) of this section, the mortgagee shall make efforts\nto verify the mortgagor' principal place of residence and, if, during the\nverification process, no responses are received in response to mailings\nrelating thereto, such mortgagee shall cause a telephone call to be made to the\nmortgagor, or, if the mortgagor is unreachable by telephone, either an\nauthorized designee (s) or, in the event that the mortgagor has no authorized\ndesignee, then the local or county office for the aging and an in person visit\nto be made to the mortgagor at the mortgaged real property.
