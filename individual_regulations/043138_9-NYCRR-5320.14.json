  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5320.14 - Multi-site central computer requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Approvals. A gaming facility that offers\nmulti-site progressive games shall submit for commission approval a system of\naccounting and internal controls. (b) Location of central monitoring system. The central computer shall be in a secure location with controlled and limited\naccess. (c) Method of communication\nfor multi-site gaming devices. The method of communication may be a non-shared, dedicated line or equivalent. Dial-tone systems may be used so long as devices\nat the local site are not able to be disabled from another outside line or\nmanipulated by any other means. When the method of communication is a shared\nline, appropriate encryption and security shall be in place to avoid corruption\nor compromise of data. (d) Data\ncollection requirement. Multi-site systems shall ensure that security\ninformation and the amounts-wagered information is communicated at least once\nevery 60 seconds for terrestrial lines (dedicated phone lines) and in a\nreasonable amount of time for radio frequency, from each participating gaming\ndevice to the central computer system. (e) Multi-site encryption method. All\nmulti-site property systems shall use an encryption method that has been\napproved by the laboratory approved by the commission pursuant to Part 5318 of\nthis Subchapter. Such encryption method shall include the use of different\nencryption keys or seeds so that encryption can be changed in a real-time\nfashion. (f) Multi-site monitoring\nand other online system requirements. The online system shall monitor the meter\nreadings and error events of each gaming device regardless of any outside\nmonitoring system. (g) Central\nmonitoring system power supply. The central computer site shall be equipped\nwith uninterruptible power supply that shall allow the central computer to\nconduct an orderly shutdown if power is lost. Should the central monitoring\nsystem use hard-disk peripherals, the central computer shall be capable of\nonline data redundancy. (h) Communication failure. A gaming device shall disable itself immediately and\nsuspend play if communication is lost to the local collection unit hub. The\ngaming device may resume play only when communication to such local hub is\nrestored. If communication is lost between the local hub and the central\ncomputer, a gaming device may continue to play, so long as the progressive\ninformation from all games connected to the local hub is buffered. Once the\nlocal hub's buffer is full, the hub shall disable games that are connected to\nsuch hub. Upon reestablishing communication with the central computer, such hub\nshall relay accurately all buffered progressive information to the central\nsystem and the system-wide totals are to be updated. (i) Central monitoring system required\nreports. Credits contributed to the system after a jackpot occurs in real-time, but during the same polling cycle, shall be deemed to have been contributed to\nthe progressive amount prior to such jackpot. Credits contributed to the system\nsubsequent to the jackpot message being received, as well as credits\ncontributed to the system before the jackpot message is received by the system, but registered after the jackpot message is received at the system, will be\ndeemed to have been contributed to the progressive amount of the next jackpot. Any multi-site system shall supply, as requested, the following reports: (1)\n\nProgressive summary. A report indicating\nthe amount of, and basis for, the current jackpot amount (the amount currently\nin play). (2)\n\nAggregate report. A\nreport indicating the balancing of the system with regard to system wide\ntotals. (3)\n\nPayoff report. A report\nthat clearly demonstrates the method of arriving at the payoff amount. Such\nreport shall include the credits contributed, beginning at the polling cycle\nimmediately following the previous jackpot, and shall include all credits\ncontributed up to and including the polling cycle that includes the jackpot\nsignal. (j) Multi-site\nsystem meter readings. All meter reading data shall be obtained in real time in\nan on-line, automated fashion. When requested to do so, the system shall return\nmeter readings on all gaming devices attached to the system. The meter readings\nshall be identical to the meter information retained in the gaming device\naccounting meter (or gaming devices accounting meters). Manual reading of meter\nvalues is not permitted to be substituted for the requirements of this\nsubdivision. The meter, in either credit or monetary value, shall account for\nall amounts wagered. The purpose of the credits-bet meter reading is to verify\nand compare the progressive amount, or amounts, in conjunction with the rate of\nprogression. (k) Multi-site system\ndoor monitoring. A multi-site progressive system shall have the ability to\nmonitor entry into the front door of a gaming device and report any such entry\nto the central system immediately. (l) Jackpot wins during poll cycle. If a\njackpot is recognized in the middle of a system-side poll cycle, the overhead\ndisplay may contain a value less than the aggregated jackpot amount calculated\nby the central system. The credit values from the remaining portion of such\npoll cycle shall be received by the central system but not the local site, in\nwhich case the jackpot amount paid always shall be the higher of the two\nreporting amounts. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n5320.14\n\nAdopted\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 16, 2016/Volume XXXVIII, Issue 46, eff. 11/16/2016\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
