  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 417.3 - Duties and responsibilities of transporters relating to manifests\n\nState Regulations\n(a) In addition to\nthe making of the uniform manifest required by section\n417.2\nof this Part (and other requirements relating thereto), transporters of motor\nfuel have the additional duties and responsibilities described\nherein. (b) Where motor fuel is\nbeing imported for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State, the\ntransporter must verify that the name of the person importing or causing such\nmotor fuel to be imported is listed as a registered distributor of motor fuel\non the current listing prepared by the department (as such listing may be\namended to reflect any suspension or cancellation notices issued by the\ndepartment). The transporter is presumed to have knowingly aided and abetted a\nperson who is not registered as a distributor of motor fuel in the importation\nof motor fuel for the purpose of license cancellation or suspension under\nsection\n283-a (4)(iii)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw if the name of the person is not so listed. Aside from other sanctions, the\nimportation of motor fuel by other than a registered distributor subjects such\nmotor fuel and the vehicle or other means of transportation used to transport\nsuch motor fuel to seizure and forfeiture under section\n1848\nof the Tax Law. (c) (1)\n\nUpon completion of offloading of motor fuel at a terminal in New York, the\ntransporter must, if applicable, correct the date and time of delivery and the\nnumber of gallons of motor fuel delivered and cause the manifest with respect\nto such motor fuel to be presented to the terminal operator for verification\nof, and any further corrections to, the information therein as it applies to\nthe delivery of motor fuel to such terminal operator. Provided that, in the\ncase of a pipeline delivery, such manifest may be given to the terminal\noperator as soon as practicable after the completion of the delivery. (2)\n\nUpon completion of offloading of motor\nfuel at a facility in New York other than a terminal, the transporter must, if\napplicable, correct the date and time of delivery on the manifest with respect\nto such motor fuel and correct the number of gallons of motor fuel\ndelivered. (d) (1)\n\nWhere motor fuel is offloaded at a\nterminal in New York, the transporter must, at the time such motor fuel is\noffloaded, provide a copy of the manifest to the operator of the terminal\n(except that in the case of a pipeline delivery it must be provided as soon as\npracticable after the completion of delivery). (2)\n\nWhere motor fuel was imported for use, distribution, storage or sale in the State, a copy of the manifest must also be\nprovided to the distributor who imported or caused such fuel to be\nimported. (3)\n\nThe transporter must\nretain the original of the manifest. (4)\n\nThe manifest or copies thereof must be\nretained by the transporter, terminal operator or distributor, as the case may\nbe, for a period of three years from the end of the month in which the fuel was\ndelivered.
