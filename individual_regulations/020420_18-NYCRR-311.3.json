The former district of residence shall not continue to\ngrant assistance when the recipient takes up residence outside the\n\nState. (2)\n\nWhen a recipient of\nmedical assistance only removes from one social services district to another\ndistrict within the State, the social services official administering medical\nassistance only, may continue to administer medical assistance to such person\nfor a period not to extend beyond the last day of the calendar month next\nsucceeding the calendar month in which such removal occurred, provided such\nperson is otherwise eligible for such assistance and has not become a recipient\nof public assistance or care in the district to which he has removed. (3)\n\nWhen a family receiving transitional\nchild care moves from one social services district to another district within\nthe State, the new social services district of residence is responsible for\npayments for transitional child care beginning with the second full month that\nthe family has lived in that district, provided the recipient continues to be\neligible for such child care. The former social services district is obligated\nto continue payment for transitional child care during the month the family\nmoves to a different district, and the first full month following the month of\nsuch move. (b) The new\ndistrict of residence shall provide necessary service for the former district\nof residence and emergency assistance to the recipient in accordance with\ninstructions issued by the department. (c) When an inter-district jurisdictional\ndispute exists relating to an otherwise eligible applicant for public\nassistance or medical assistance, either district may request a fair hearing to\ndetermine the district of responsibility, and the decision shall be binding\nupon both districts. (1)\n\nThe district in which\nthe applicant is found shall be responsible to arrange, provide and pay for\npublic assistance and care during the period pending resolution of the\ninter-district jurisdictional dispute; and shall be reimbursed for all\nexpenditures authorized in behalf of the applicant by the district subsequently\ndetermined responsible for the provision of assistance and care. (2)\nA fair hearing shall be initiated by\nsending written notice to the other district and to the department, including a\nbrief statement of fact and law upon which the determination of responsibility\nwas based. (3)\nA fair hearing may\nbe requested by a district receiving a notice pursuant to this subdivision by\nrequesting same in writing to the department within 30 days of the date of the\nnotice. (4)\n(i) On receipt of a request for a fair\nhearing pursuant to this subdivision the department shall notify both districts\nof the date and place of the hearing, said notice to be given at least six\nworking days prior to the date of the hearing. (ii)\n\nIn the event any district given notice\npursuant to this section fails or refuses to request or attend a fair hearing, the department shall issue a decision based upon the notice and other documents\nsubmitted by a district, and such decision shall be binding upon both\ndistricts. (5)\n\nThe\ndistrict which is responsible during the interim period described in paragraph\n(1) of this subdivision shall not be denied reimbursement by the district\nultimately held responsible for assistance and care rendered after notification\nto the liable district so long as the district of interim responsibility\nexercised reasonable care in determining client eligibility and making payment, notwithstanding the fact that procedures used by the district ultimately\nresponsible for the cost of assistance and care would have resulted in an\ninitial denial of or lowering of payment.
