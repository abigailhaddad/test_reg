Tit. 12 § 177.4 - Nurse coverage plans\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every health care employer shall implement a nurse coverage plan, taking into\naccount typical patterns of staff absenteeism due to illness, leave, bereavement and other similar factors. Such plan should also reflect the health\ncare employer's typical levels and types of patients served by the health care\nfacility. (b) The plan shall\nidentify and describe as many alternative staffing methods as are available to\nthe health care employer to ensure adequate staffing through means other than\nuse of mandatory overtime including contracts with per diem nurses, contracts\nwith nurse registries and employment agencies for nursing services, arrangements for assignment of nursing floats, requesting an additional day of\nwork from off-duty employees, and development and posting of a list or roster\nof nurses seeking voluntary overtime. (c) The plan must identify the supervisor(s)\nor administrator(s) at the health care facility or at another identified\nlocation who will make the final determination as to when it is necessary to\nutilize mandatory overtime. The plan may require a nurse to assist in making\ntelephone calls consistent with the nurse coverage plan to find his or her own\nshift replacement, but may not require a nurse to self-mandate\novertime. (d) The plan shall\nrequire documentation of all attempts to avoid the use of mandatory overtime\nduring a patient care emergency and seek alternative staffing through the\nmethods identified in subdivision (b) of this section. In the event that the\nhealth care employer does utilize mandatory overtime, the documentation of such\nefforts to avoid the use of mandatory overtime shall be made available, upon\nrequest, to the nurse who was required to work the mandatory overtime and/or to\nthe nurse's collective bargaining representative, provided, however, that the\nnames and other personal identifying information about patients shall not be\nincluded unless authorized under State and Federal law and\nregulations. (e) The plan shall be\nin writing and upon completion or amendment of such plan, it shall: (1)\nbe made readily available to all nursing\nstaff through distribution to nursing staff, or conspicuously posting the plan\nin a physical location accessible to nursing staff, or through other means that\nwill ensure availability to nursing staff, e.g., posting on the employer's\nintranet site or its functional equivalent; (2)\nbe provided to any collective bargaining\nrepresentative representing nurses at the health care facility; and\n(3)\nbe provided to the Commissioner of Labor, or his or her designee, upon request. (f) Nothing herein shall be read to establish\nthe nurse coverage plans required herein as standards to be used in assessing\nthe health care employer's compliance with any other obligation or requirement, including facility accreditation. (g) All such plans were to have been prepared\nby October 13, 2009 in accordance with emergency regulations that were in\neffect. For health care employers who were not operating covered facilities on\n\nOctober 13, 2009, a nurse coverage plan shall be in place prior to the time\nthey commence operations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
