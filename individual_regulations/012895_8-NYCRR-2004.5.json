  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 8 § 2004.5 - Suspension\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Scope and\nduration. A suspension may affect all aspects of an institution's or lender's\nparticipation in programs under this Chapter or only a portion thereof. The\nduration of a suspension may be set to extend until the president has\ndetermined that the basis for the suspension has been removed and that a\nrepetition of such violation appears unlikely; provided, however, that the\nperiod of suspension shall not exceed 60 days, unless the institution or lender\nand the president agree to an extension or unless limitation or termination\nprocedings are initiated pursuant to section\n2004.6\nof this Part within this\nperiod of time, in which case the period of suspension may be extended until\nthe completion of such proceedings. (b) Procedures. (1)\n\nExcept as provided in subdivision (c) of\nthis section, suspensions shall only be made pursuant to notice and opportunity\nto show cause as provided in this paragraph. (2)\n\nSuspension proceedings shall be initiated\nby the president mailing to the institution or lender in question, a notice, by\ncertified mail with return receipt requested: (i) informing the institution of the\ncorporation's intent to suspend the institution's or lender's eligibility and\nof the basis for such action; (ii)\nspecifying the proposed effective date of the suspension and the consequences\nof such action; and\n(iii)\ninforming\nthe institution or lender of its rights, if exercised within a stated period of\ntime, to submit written material and to request a meeting before the president\nor president's designee to show cause why such action should not be taken, prior to the time of suspension becomes effective. The notice shall also\nprovide information about the nature of the meeting and such other information\nabout the matter as the president may determine appropriate. The notice shall\nalso invite voluntary efforts to correct the violation which led to the\ninitiation of these proceedings. (3)\n\nThe proposed effective date for\nsuspension provided for in paragraph (2) of this subdivision shall not be less\nthan 15 days after the notice of intent has been sent. The period of time\nwithin which the institution or lender may submit written material or request a\nmeeting to show cause shall not be less than 10 days after such notice has been\nsent. If such a meeting is requested, the president shall set a time and place\nfor it, which time shall not be less than five days nor more than 30 days after\nthe request is received by him. If a meeting is requested, but it cannot be\nheld prior to the proposed effective date of suspension, the date shall be\npostponed until the completion of such meeting. (4)\n\nThe president shall consider any timely\nmaterial presented to him in writing, any material presented to him during the\ncourse of the informal meeting provided for in paragraph (3) of this\nsubdivision and any showing that the institution or lender has adequately\ncorrected the violation which led to the initiation of suspension proceedings. If, after considering such material, the president concludes that the\ninstitution or lender has failed to show cause why its eligibility should not\nbe suspended, he may suspend eligibility in whole or part and subject to such\nterms and conditions as he shall specify. Notice of such suspension shall be\npromptly transmitted to the institution or lender and shall become effective\nupon the date of transmittal. The institution of suspension proceedings or any\nsuspension imposed shall not operate to waive the corporation's right to take\naction based upon the violations found to exist, including but not limited to\nthe taking of limitation or termination proceedings or the imposition of such\nsanctions. (c) Emergency\naction. The president may withhold the issuance of further commitments of\nguaranty to a lender or with respect to loans for all students attending an\ninstitution, upon three days' prior written notice if he determines that such\nimmediate action is necessary in order to prevent an unreasonable risk of a\nsubstantial loss of funds either to the State or the students involved if\nfurther disbursements under this Part were permitted and that such risk is\nsufficiently serious to outweigh the importance of following the procedures set\nforth in subdivision (b) of this section. Such emergency action shall be\ninitiated by sending the institution or lender a notice, by certified mail and\nreturn receipt requested, informing the institution or lender of the suspension\nand the grounds therefor. Such emergency action shall not exceed seven days in\nlength unless suspension proceedings are initiated pursuant to subdivision (b)\nof this section or limitation or termination proceedings as initiated pursuant\nto section\n2004.6\nof this Part within such\nseven-day period, in which case the president may continue to withhold\ncommitments of insurance until the conclusion of such proceedings. If\nlimitation or termination proceedings are initiated, the president shall\nprovide the institution or lender, if it so requests, an opportunity to show\ncause why the action should be rescinded pending the outcome of such\nproceedings.
