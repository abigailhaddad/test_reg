  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 598-3.2 - General operating requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Installation requirements. (1)\n\nCategory 1 requirements. Piping in\ncontact with the ground must be installed in accordance with the following: (i) Backfill. Piping that is installed\nunderground must use backfill material that is a non-corrosive, porous, homogeneous substance and the backfill material must be placed completely\naround the piping and compacted to ensure that the piping is fully and\nuniformly supported. Backfill of at least six inches in depth must be placed\nunderneath the piping. (ii)\n\nBurial\ndepth. Piping buried underground must be installed so that the top of the\npiping is at least 18 inches below the surface of the ground. Should conditions\nmake compliance with this requirement impracticable, precautions must be taken\nto prevent physical damage to the piping. It is not necessary to cover the\nportion of the piping to which an access port is affixed. (iii)\n\nInspection of piping in contact with\nthe ground. ('a')\n\nPrior to covering, enclosing, or placing piping in use, the piping must be inspected by a\nqualified inspector in accordance with a consensus code, standard, or practice\ndeveloped by a nationally recognized association or independent testing\nlaboratory which meets the requirements of this subparagraph. This inspection\nmust include: ('1')\nweld breaks; ('2')\npunctures; ('3')\nscrapes of protective\ncoatings; ('4')\ncracks; ('5')\ncorrosion; ('6')\nstructural damage; and\n('7')\nimproper\ninstallation. ('b')\n\nBefore being placed in service, the piping must be tested for tightness in\naccordance with 'paragraph 3.3(d)(2) of this Part. ('c')\n\nAll joints must be liquid-tight and\nair-tight. If piping is found not to be tight or to be defective, all repairs\nnecessary to remedy the leaks or deficiencies in the piping must be performed\nprior to the piping being placed in service. ('d')\n\nUpon completion of the tightness test\nand inspection, the inspector must sign and date a statement certifying that\nthe system meets the standards of this subdivision. ('e')\n\nThe inspector's statement and records\nof the tightness test and repairs must be kept for five years following the\ndate of installation and made part of the spill prevention\nreport. (iv)\n\nInstallation\n\nInstructions. In addition to the above requirements, all piping in contact with\nthe ground must be installed in strict accordance with the manufacturer's\ninstructions and a consensus code, standard, or practice developed by a\nnationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory consistent\nwith the standards of this subparagraph, such as API 1615. (See section\n1.16\nof this Part). This includes\nrepair of any damaged coatings prior to backfilling. (2)\n\nCategory 2 requirements. Tank systems\nmust be installed in accordance with the following: (i) Foundation design. ('a')\nASTs must have a stable and well\ndrained foundation, footing and structural support which are capable of\nsupporting the total weight of the tank when filled to its design capacity. Supports, foundations and anchorage of all tanks must be in accordance with\nNFPA 30, 1993 section 2-6.1, 2-6.2, 2-6.3, 2-6.4 and 2-6.5 (see section\n1.16\nof this Part). ('b')\n\nHorizontal ASTs must be supported in\nsuch a manner as to permit expansion and contraction and to prevent the\nconcentration of excessive loads on the supporting portion of the shell. The\nbearing afforded by the saddles must extend over at least 1/3 of the\ncircumference of the shell. If bearing of less than 1/3 is used, the design\nmust be approved by a qualified engineer and be documented or referenced in the\nspill prevention report. Suitable means for preventing corrosion must be\nprovided on that portion of the tank in contact with the foundations or\nsaddles. ('c')\n\nTank systems that\nare exposed to temperatures of less than 32 degrees Fahrenheit must be\nsupported in such a way, or supplied with heat, to prevent the effects of\nfreezing and frost heaving of the foundation. (ii)\n\nAvoiding traffic hazards. AST systems\nmust be protected from physical damage that may result from moving machinery or\nvehicles, such as forklifts, automobiles or trucks. (iii)\n\nSeparation of incompatible substances. All ASTs must assure separation of incompatible substances. One means of\naccomplishing this separation is by installing separate independent secondary\ncontainment systems capable of preventing the mixing of the incompatible\nsubstances in the event of a leak, spill or overfill. (iv)\n\nEmergency response equipment. All AST\nsystems and dikes must be accessible for emergency response (e.g., firefighting\nequipment). (v) Backfill. Tank\nsystems that are installed underground must use backfill material that is a\nnon-corrosive, porous, homogeneous substance and it must be placed completely\naround the tank system and compacted to ensure that the tank system is fully\nand uniformly supported. Backfill of at least six inches in depth must be\nplaced underneath the piping. (vi)\n\nBurial depth. Piping buried underground must be installed so that the top of\nthe piping is at least 18 inches below the surface of the ground. Should\nconditions make compliance with this requirement impracticable, precautions\nmust be taken to prevent physical damage to the piping. It is not necessary to\ncover the portion of the piping to which an access port is affixed. (vii)\n\nInspection of tank systems. ('a')\n\nPrior to covering, enclosing, or\nplacing a tank system in use, the tank system must be inspected by a qualified\ninspector in accordance with a consensus code, standard, or practice developed\nby a nationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory which\nmeets the requirements of this subparagraph. This inspection must include: ('1')\nweld breaks; ('2')\npunctures; ('3')\nscrapes of protective\ncoatings; ('4')\ncracks; ('5')\ncorrosion; ('6')\nother structural damage; and\n('7')\nimproper\ninstallation. ('b')\n\nIn\naddition to the above, tank systems must be tested for tightness in accordance\nwith paragraphs 3.3(c)(1) and 3.3 (d)(2) of this Part and inspected in\naccordance with a consensus code, standard or practice developed by a\nnationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory which meets\nthe standards of this subparagraph, such as API 650 or API 620. (See section\n1.16\nof this Part). ('c')\n\nAll joints must be liquid-tight and\nair-tight. If the tank system is found not to be tight or to be defective, all\nrepairs necessary to remedy the leaks and deficiencies in the tank system must\nbe performed in accordance with subdivision (d) of this section or in\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions prior to it being placed in\nservice. ('d')\n\nUpon completion of\nthe tightness test and inspection, the inspector must sign and date a statement\ncertifying that the system meets the standards of this subdivision. ('e')\n\nThe inspector's statement and records\nof the tightness test and repairs must be kept for five years following the\ndate of installation and made part of the spill prevention\nreport. (viii)\n\nQualifications of tank system installers. Installation of an AST system must be\nperformed by a qualified installer or technician who is trained in the\nengineering methods for installing AST systems. (ix)\n\nInstallation Instructions. In addition\nto the above requirements, all tank systems must be installed in strict\naccordance with the manufacturer's instructions and a consensus code, standard, or practice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent\ntesting laboratory consistent with the standards of this subparagraph, such as\nAPI 1615. (See section\n1.16\nof this Part). This includes\nrepair of any damaged coatings prior to\nbackfilling. (b) Spill and overfill prevention. (1)\n\nLabelling requirements. (i) The design and working capacities of each\ntank in the tank system, the tank system identification number as shown on the\nregistration certificate, and the chemical name (or common name if the chemical\nname is not appropriate) of the substance stored must be marked on each\ntank. (ii)\n\nWhere filling or\nemptying is remotely operated, the design capacity, working capacity, and\nidentification number of the tank as shown on the registration certificate must\nbe clearly marked at the remote operating station. (iii)\n\nAll Category 2 aboveground piping must\nbear a stencil, label or plate which contains the chemical name or common name\nif the chemical name is not appropriate, for the substance stored. The stencil, label or plate must be located at all valves, pumps, switches and on each side\nof any wall where piping enters or exits. At least one conspicuously visible\nlabel must be provided at each end of the piping. (iv)\n\nAll fill and dispensing ports for tanks\nwhich are remote from the tank must be labeled with the chemical name or common\nname or category of substance and must display legible and clearly visible\nhazard warnings. In addition, fill ports must contain information on the point\nof delivery. For a registered tank system, this would be the tank\nidentification number. Valves and controllers which govern the filling and\nemptying of a tank system must contain information on closed and open\npositions. (v) Labeling of\nsafety/pressure/vacuum relief valves. Where safety, pressure relief or vacuum\nrelief valves are used, each must be permanently labeled with the information\nlisted below. The labeling may be provided on the valve itself, or on a plate\nor plates securely fastened to the valve. Labels may be stamped, etched, impressed or cast in the valve or nameplate. The label must include the\nfollowing information: ('a')\nthe name or\nidentifying trademark of the manufacturer; ('b')\nthe manufacturer's design or type\nnumber; ('c')\nthe pipe size of the\ninlet; ('d')\nthe set pressure or\nvacuum, in PSIG; ('e')\nthe full open\npressure or vacuum, in PSIG; and\n('f')\nthe capacity at the indicated pressure\nor full open vacuum in either cubic feet of gas per minute or cubic feet of gas\nper hour and be so designated. (2)\n\nDelivery to tank systems. (i) Responsibility for transfers. The\noperator, when on the premises or when in control of a hazardous substance\ntransfer, is responsible for transfer activities. If the operator is not on the\npremises and is not in control of a hazardous substance transfer, the carrier\nis responsible for transfer activities. The requirements of subparagraphs (ii)\nthrough (vii) of this paragraph apply to the person responsible for the\ntransfer activities. The operator or carrier must employ practices for\npreventing transfer spills, overfills, and releases. (ii)\n\nImmediately prior to the transfer, the\noperator/carrier must determine that the hazardous substance will be\ntransferred to the proper tank, that the receiving tank has available capacity\nto receive the hazardous substance amount to be transferred, and that all tank\nvalving and flow control devices are in the proper positions to accept\ndelivery. All couplings and other connections must be inspected to ensure that\nthey are leak free, undamaged, and fully functional. During and after the\ntransfer, all couplings and other connections must be monitored for\nleaks. (iii)\n\nBrakes must be set and\nwheels chocked on all rail cars before and during loading and\nunloading. (iv)\n\nWhen a truck, rail\ncar, or container is connected to a transfer line, caution signs must be in\nplace to give warning to persons approaching from any potential direction. Signs must remain in place until operations are completed, all connections are\nremoved, and outlets properly closed. (v) During the entire transfer, and while the\ntank system is connected to the loading or unloading device, the\noperator/carrier must always supervise, monitor, and control the transfer to\nprevent overfilling and spilling. The operator/carrier must be trained in the\nproper transfer procedures and must take immediate action to stop the transfer\nof the hazardous substance when the working capacity is reached, or if an\nequipment failure or emergency occurs. (vi)\n\nDuring the transfer of a hazardous\nsubstance with a flash point below 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37.8 degrees\n\nCelsius) or wherever flammable vapors may be present, all potential ignition\nsources must be controlled. Sources of ignition include open flames, lightning, smoking, cutting, welding, hot surfaces, friction, heat, sparks from static, electrical or mechanical sources, spontaneous ignition, chemical and\nphysical-chemical reactions, and radiant heat. (vii)\n\nEquipment or practices that prevent the\nmixing of incompatible substances must be in-place. This must include mating of\ncouplings to prevent mixing, written site procedures that prevent delivery of a\nsubstance to the wrong tank and which prohibit transfer of incompatible\nsubstances at the same time within the same transfer station, or equivalent\npractices. Any written procedures developed pursuant to this paragraph, must be\nspecified in the spill prevention report required by section 1.9 of this\n\nPart. (c) Daily, annual, and\nfive-year inspections. (1)\n\nDaily inspections. The owner or operator must visually inspect the aboveground tank system for\nspills and leaks each operating day. In addition, the owner or operator must\ncheck to ensure that drain valves are closed if not in use and there are no\nunpermitted discharges of contaminated water or hazardous substances. (2)\n\nAnnual inspections. (i) The structure-to-electrolyte potential of\ncathodic protection systems used to protect the bottom of tanks and piping in\ncontact with the ground which are subject to corrosion must be inspected\nannually by a qualified technician. If the system fails to provide the\nnecessary protection, action must be taken in accordance with paragraph (d)(2)\nof this section. (ii)\n\nThe owner or\noperator must conduct comprehensive annual inspections of the aboveground tank\nsystem. This inspection must include: ('a')\nvisually inspecting for cracks, areas\nof wear, corrosion, poor maintenance and operating practices, excessive\nsettlement of structures, separation or swelling of tank insulation, malfunctioning equipment, safety interlocks, safety trips, automatic shutoffs, leak detection, and monitoring, warning or gauging equipment which may not be\noperating properly; ('b')\nvisually\ninspecting dikes, transfer station secondary containment, and other secondary\ncontainment systems for erosion, cracks, evidence of releases, excessive\nsettlement and structural weaknesses; ('c')\nchecking on the adequacy of exterior\ncoatings, corrosion protection systems, exterior welds and rivets, foundations, spill control equipment, emergency response equipment and fire extinguishing\nequipment; ('d') visually checking equipment, structures and foundations for\nexcessive wear or damage; and ('e') reviewing compliance with this\n\nPart. (3)\n\nFive-year inspections. Tanks must, at least every five years, be inspected in\naccordance with paragraph 3.3(c)(3) of this Subpart. If thinning of one\nmillimeter per year or greater occurs on the tank walls, or the calculated\nexpected remaining useful life as determined by the inspection is less than 10\nyears, then reinspection must be performed on the tank at one half of the\nremaining useful life. (4)\n\nRecordkeeping. Records of the annual inspections required by this subdivision\nmust be retained for 5 years. Records of the five-year inspections required by\nthis subdivision must be retained for 10\nyears. (d) Maintenance and repairs. (1)\n\nIf the tank system or any component\nthereof is inadequate or not tight, or any inspection shows that continuation\nof an operation or practice will result in a leak, then: (i) the operation or practice must be\nmodified or discontinued immediately; (ii)\nthe tank system or tank system component\nmust be immediately replaced; or\n(iii)\nthe tank system must be immediately\nemptied and taken out of service in accordance with subdivision\n3.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (Examples which may indicate that a leak is imminent include: leaking\nvalves, pumps, and pipe joints; inadequate gauges; tightness test failures; excessive thinning of the tank shell which would indicate structural weakness\nwhen the tank is filled; and malfunctioning pressure or temperature\ngauges.)\n(2)\n\nIf the tank\nsystem or any component thereof, or continuation of an operation or practice, is not in imminent danger of causing a leak, but an inspection shows that the\ntank system is malfunctioning or is in disrepair, and that a leak is likely or\nprobable unless action is taken, then: (i) the operation or practice must be modified or discontinued\nimmediately; (ii)\nthe tank system\nor tank system component must be replaced within 90 days (unless a shorter time\nis deemed necessary by the department); or\n(iii)\nthe tank system must be taken out of\nservice in accordance with subdivision\n3.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart before the necessary repairs and required subsequent testing are\nperformed, unless the tank system is permanently closed in accordance with\nsubdivision\n3.6\n(b) of this\n\nSubpart. (Examples of such equipment disrepair include: secondary containment\ndikes with erosion or rodent damage; deficiencies in coatings for preventing\ncorrosion caused by exposure to the environment; malfunctioning leak detection\nequipment; and cathodic protection systems which fail to provide the necessary\nelectric current to prevent corrosion.)\n(3)\n\nInspection of repaired equipment. All\nrepaired equipment must be inspected for tightness and soundness in accordance\nwith paragraphs 3.3(c)(1) or 3.3(d)(2) of this Subpart before it is returned to\nservice. (e) Tank\nlinings. (1)\n\nTanks must be lined in\naccordance with: (i) API 652 (see section\n1.16\nof this Part); or\n(ii)\na code of practice developed by a\nnationally recognized association or independent testing laboratory and\napproved by the department. (2)\n\nTank linings must be compatible with the\nsubstance stored. (3)\n\nLinings of\ncarbon steel tanks must be applied no later than eight hours after abrasive\nblasting and cleaning of the internal surface or in accordance with a code of\npractice developed by a nationally recognized association or independent\ntesting laboratory and approved by the department. Visible rust, moisture or\nforeign matter must not be present. (4)\n\nAll linings must be of sufficient\nthickness, density and strength to form an impermeable shell which will not\ncrack, soften, flake, or separate from interior surfaces. The lining must\nmaintain a permanent bond to the equipment. (5)\n\nThe lining's coefficient of thermal\nexpansion must be compatible with the equipment to which it is applied so that\nstress due to temperature changes will not be detrimental to the soundness of\nthe lining. (6)\n\nThe lining material\nmust be applied and cured in strict accordance with the lining manufacturer's\nspecifications. (7)\n\nThe lining must\nbe checked for blisters and air pockets and electrically tested for pinholes. The thickness of the lining must be checked with an Elcometer Thickness Gauge\nor equivalent method and the hardness checked with a Barcol Hardness Tester or\nequivalent method to assure compliance with manufacturer's specifications. Any\ndefects must be repaired. (8)\n\nThe\ndate of installation of the lining, condition of the tank, installation\nmethods, and other pertinent information must be kept in the spill prevention\nreport for the life of the tank system. (f) Replacement of rupture disks. All rupture\ndisks must be replaced with new ones at least every three years, or in\naccordance with any other frequency recommended by the disk manufacturer or\njustified on the basis of operating experience in the spill prevention\nreport. (g) Switching from one\nhazardous substance to another hazardous substance. If the substance stored\nwithin a tank system is to be switched from one hazardous substance to another, then the tank system must be evaluated by a qualified engineer before the\nchange to the different hazardous substance is made to determine that materials\nare compatible, pressure and vacuum relief systems are adequate, and that the\ntank system is properly designed and suitable. (h) Requirements for tanks subject to\nflooding. Any tank system susceptible to inundation by water from any source\nmust be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement\nthat might be caused by hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the\neffect of buoyancy. In determining whether a tank system is susceptible to\ninundation by water, the facility must include consideration of the future\nphysical climate risk due to sea level rise, storm surges, and flooding, based\non available data predicting the likelihood of future extreme weather events, including hazard risk analysis data if applicable. Tanks must be designed, installed and maintained in accordance with operating standards set forth in\nNFPA 30, 1993 section 2-6.6 (see section\n1.16\nof this Part) and in\naccordance with State and local flood plain regulations. Dikes in flood plains\nmust be designed and installed to withstand structural damage and overtopping\nby a 100-year flood. If tanks are ballasted with water during flood warning\nperiods, tank valves and other openings must be closed and secured in a locked\nposition in advance of the flood. Ballast water removed from the tank after the\nflood must not be discharged to the waters of the State unless such discharge\nis in conformance with the standards of Parts 701, 702, 703 and 750 of this\n\nTitle, as applicable. (i) Vegetation within secondary containment. No vegetation must be allowed to grow\nwithin secondary containment systems unless vegetation is required for the\nsecondary containment to function properly and does not interfere with the\nrequirements of clauses 3.1(b)(1)(i)('c'), 3.1(b)(1)(ii)('c'), 3.1(b)(2)(i), and 3.1(b)(2)(ii)('c') of this Subpart. Any grass within the secondary\ncontainment system must be trimmed to no longer than six inches. No\naccumulation of dead vegetation which could endanger the tank, if ignited, is\nallowed within the secondary containment system. (j) Uninspected tank systems. If any portion\nof a tank system is not tested or inspected as required by this section, the\nowner or operator must take the uninspected portion of the tank system\nout-of-service pursuant to the requirements of subdivision\n3.6\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart.
