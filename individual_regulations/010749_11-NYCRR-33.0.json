  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 11 § 33.0 - Preamble\n\nState Regulations\n\nSome insurance companies have entered into contracts with individuals or organizations, commonly referred to as managing general agents or managers, to manage all or part of their insurance business. This may represent a shifting of an insurance company's responsibilities to a person, firm, association or corporation outside of its organization. This Part is promulgated because the Department of Financial Services is concerned that such delegation of authority has been subject to abuses detrimental to both insurance companies and insureds. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 11\n§\n33.0\n\nAmended\n\nNew\n\nYork State Register November 20, 2019/Volume XLI, Issue 47, eff. 3/19/2020\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
