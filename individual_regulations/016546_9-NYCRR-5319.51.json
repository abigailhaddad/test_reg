  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.51 - Electronic metering within the gaming device\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Credit meter units and display. The\ncredit meter shall be maintained in credits or cash value and at all times\nindicate all credits or cash available for the player to wager or cash out, with the exception of when the player is viewing an informational screen such\nas a menu or help-screen item. Such screen should be displayed to the player\nunless a tilt condition or malfunction exists. (b) Tokenization. If the currency amount is\nnot an even multiple of the tokenization factor for a game or the credit amount\nhas a fractional value, the credits displayed for such game may be displayed\nand played as a truncated amount (i.e., fractional part removed). However, the\nfractional credit amount shall be made available to the player when the\ntruncated credit balance is zero. (c) Credit meter, incrementing. The value of\nall prizes awarded shall be added to the player's credit meter, except for\nhand-pays or merchandise. (d) Progressives. Progressive awards may be added to the credit meter if either: (1)\nthe credit meter is maintained in\ncurrency; (2)\nthe progressive meter\nis incremented to whole credit amounts; or\n(3)\nthe progressive prize in currency is\nconverted properly to credits upon transfer to the player's credit meter in a\nmanner that does not mislead the player (i.e., make unqualified statement \"wins\nmeter amount\" and then rounds down on conversion or cause accounting\nimbalances). See also Part 5321 of this Subchapter. (e) Collect meter. There shall be a collect\nmeter, which shall show the number of credits or cash, collected by the player\nupon a cash-out. This meter should be displayed to the player unless a tilt\ncondition or malfunction exists. The number of credits or cash collected shall\nbe subtracted from the player's credit meter and added to the collect meter. This meter may include hand pays. (f) Software meter information access. The\nsoftware meter information shall be accessible only by an authorized gaming\nfacility employee and shall have the ability to be displayed on demand using a\nsecure means. (g) Electronic\naccounting and occurrence meters. Electronic accounting meters shall be at\nleast 10 digits in length. These meters shall be maintained in credit units\nequal to the denomination or in dollars and cents. If the meter is being used\nin dollars-and-cents format, eight digits shall be used for the dollar amount\nand two digits used for the cents amount. Devices configured for\nmulti-denomination play shall display the units in dollars and cents. The meter\nshall roll over to zero upon the next occurrence, any time the meter exceeds 10\ndigits and after 9,999,999,999, or any other value that is logical, has been\nreached. Occurrence meters shall be at least eight digits in length. Occurrence\nmeters are not required to roll over automatically. Meters shall be labeled so\nsuch meters may be clearly understood in accordance with their functions. All\ngaming devices shall be equipped with a device, mechanism or method for\nretaining the value of all meter information specified in this section, which\nshall be preserved in the event of power loss to the gaming device. The\nfollowing paragraphs (1) through (22) describe accounting meters, except where\nnoted otherwise. (1)\n\nCoin in.

(2)\n\nCoin out. A gaming device\nshall have a meter that accumulates the total value of all amounts directly\npaid by the device as a result of winning wagers, whether the payout is made to\na credit meter or by any other means.
