  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6200.10 - Disclosure of independent expenditures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Purpose and Overview. The purpose of this\n\nRegulation is to set forth the requirements under the New York State Election\n\nLaw regarding compliance with Independent Expenditure disclosure. The New York\n\nState Election Law mandates how financial activity, including independent\nexpenditures, is to be disclosed. Article 14 of the Election Law (\"EL\") sets\nforth the requirement that independent expenditures be disclosed through the\nfiling of campaign financial disclosure reports. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nIndependent Expenditure means an\nexpenditure made by an independent expenditure committee conveyed to 500 or\nmore members of a General Public Audience or any paid internet or digital\nadvertisement targeted to 50 or more members of the General Public Audience, provided such expenditure is in a form described in subpargraph (i) and meets\none of the three content and timing criteria described in subparagraph (ii) and\nis not a communication exempted from the definition of independent expenditure\nby paragraph (2) of this subdivision or other provision of law. (i) An independent expenditure shall be in\nthe form of: (a) an audio or video\ncommunication via broadcast, cable or satellite; (b) a written communication via\nadvertisements, pamphlets, circulars, flyers, brochures, letterheads; (c) other published statements which shall\ninclude, but not be limited to, d.igital media; or\n(d) any paid internet or digital\nadvertisement as defined in paragraph 11 of this section. (ii)\n\nAn independent expenditure shall have\nthe following attributes: (a) irrespective of\nwhen such communication is made, contains words such as \"vote,\" \"oppose,\"\n\"support,\" \"elect,\" \"defeat,\" or \"reject,\" which call for the election or\ndefeat of the Clearly Identified Candidate; (b) refers to and Advocates For or Against a\n\nClearly Identified Candidate or ballot proposal on or after January 1st of the\nyear of the election in which such candidate is seeking office or such proposal\nshall appear on the ballot; or\n(c) within 60 days before a general or special election for the office sought by\nthe candidate or 30 days before a primary election, includes or references a\nclearly identified candidate. (1)\n\nFor\npurposes of this regulation Advocates for or Against means-in the absence of\nexplicit words of advocacy for or against a candidate or ballot proposal-that\nthe expenditure, through the use of images, photos, or language, promotes, supports, attacks, or opposes the Clearly Identified Candidate or ballot\nproposal. (2)\n\nFor purposes of\ndetermining that a communication is advocating for or against a candidate or\nballot proposal, the following factors shall be considered, but shall not be\nlimited to: (i) whether it identifies a\nparticular candidate by name or other means such as party affiliation or\ndistinctive features of a candidate's platform or biography or identifies a\nballot proposal; (ii)\nwhether it\nexpresses approval or disapproval for said candidate's positions or actions or\nfor a ballot proposal; (iii)\nwhether it refers to a candidate or ballot proposal and is part of an ongoing\nseries by the group on the same issue and the expenditure is made on or after\n\nJanuary 1st of the year of the election in which such candidate is seeking\noffice or such proposal shall appear on the ballot; (iv)\nwhether the issue raised in the\ncommunication has been raised as a distinguishing characteristic amongst the\nreferenced candidates; and\n(v) whether its timing and the identification of the candidate are related to a\nvote on legislation or a position on legislation by an officeholder who is also\na candidate and is made on or after January first of the year of the election\nin which such candidate is seeking office. (3)\n\nFor purposes of determining that a\ncommunication is not advocating for or against a candidate or ballot proposal, the following factors shall be considered, but shall not be limited to: (i) Whether it is part of an ongoing series\nby the group on the same issue and does not refer to a candidate or ballot\nproposal; and\n(ii)\n\nWhether its\ntiming and the identification of the candidate or ballot proposal are related\nto a non-electoral event (e.g. a vote on legislation or a position on\nlegislation by an officeholder who is also a candidate) and is not made on or\nafter January 1st of the year of the election in which such candidate is\nseeking office or such proposal shall appear on the ballot. (4)\n\nHowever, even if some of the\nabove factors in item (2) or (3) of this subclause are found, the communication\nmust still be considered in its context before arriving at any\nconclusion. (2)\n\nIndependent Expenditure shall not\ninclude: (i) payments or expenditures made by\na party or constituted committee that is required to file disclosure reports\nunder the Election Law; (ii)\ncommunications where such candidate, the candidate's political committee or its\nagents, a party committee or its agents, or a constituted committee or its\nagents or a political committee formed to promote the success or defeat of a\nballot proposal or its agents, did authorize, request, suggest, foster or\ncooperate in such communication; (iii)\npayments or expenditures where\n\nCoordination occurs in the creation, formation, or operation of the independent\nexpenditure committee making the payment or expenditure.
