  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 4.156 - Executive order no. 156: establishing a negotiated rule making program\n\nState Regulations\nWHEREAS, negotiated rule making is a process which reflects\nan agency's recognition that regulatory objectives, consistent with legislative\ndirectives, can be accomplished in more that one way; WHEREAS, negotiated rule making brings together the\nregulating agency and regulated and other interested parties during the\ndevelopmental stages of a rule to negotiate and resolve potential problems with\nthe rule making in order to implement a rule acceptable to all interested\nparties, avoid delay in implementation and reduce litigation, while ensuring\nthat the agency carries out its statutorily mandated responsibilities; WHEREAS, negotiated rule making may improve the substance\nof proposed rules and shorten the length of time needed to implement final\nrules, thereby effectuating legislative purposes and aiding in the prompt\ndelivery of governmental services; and\nWHEREAS, negotiating a potentially controversial rule\nmaking during its formulation may reduce time and expense to the State in\npromulgating the rule and the need for judicial intervention; NOW, THEREFORE, I, Mario M. Cuomo, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby establish a Negotiated Rule Making Program\nwhich agencies may use to increase acceptance and improve the substance of\nrules through negotiations with regulated and other interested parties. I. Initiating a Negotiated Rule Making\nA. Decision to negotiate a rule making. An\nagency may initiate a negotiated rule making procedure if the head of the\nagency determines that the use of such procedure is in the public interest. In making such a determination, the agency shall consider\nwhether: 1. there is a need for a\nrule; 2. the governing statute\nallows flexibility in implementation; 3. there are a limited number of identifiable\ninterests that will be significantly affected by the rule and the\nrepresentatives of such interests have sufficient expertise and resources to\ncontribute to the negotiation process; 4. there is a reasonable likelihood that a\ncommittee can be convened with a balanced representation of the affected\ninterests and that all representatives are willing to negotiate in good faith\nto reach a consensus on the proposed rule; 5. there is a reasonable likelihood that a\ncommittee will reach a consensus on the proposed rule within a fixed period of\ntime; 6. the negotiated rule making\nprocedure will not unreasonably delay the adoption of the final rule; 7. the agency has adequate resources and is\nwilling to commit such resources, including technical assistance, to the\ncommittee; and\n8. the agency, to\nthe maximum extent possible consistent with its statutory responsibilities and\nauthority, will use the consensus of the committee as the basis for the\nproposed rule. B. Use of\nfacilitators. A \"facilitator\" means a person who impartially assists an agency\nin determining whether establishing a negotiated rule making committee is\nfeasible and appropriate in a particular rule making, and impartially aids in\nthe discussions and negotiations of the members of a negotiated rule making\ncommittee to develop a proposed rule. 1. Selecting facilitator. The agency shall designate an impartial individual, who\nmay be an agency employee or an individual from a list of facilitators\nestablished by the Office of Business Permits and Regulatory Assistance, as a\nfacilitator for the negotiated rule making. A person designated to represent\nthe agency in substantive issues may not serve as facilitator or otherwise\nchair the committee. 2. Duties of\nfacilitator. A facilitator shall assist the agency in determining whether\nestablishing a negotiated rule making committee is feasible and appropriate in\na particular rule making, chair the meetings of the committee in an impartial\nmanner, impartially assist the members of the committee in conducting\ndiscussions and negotiations, and manage the keeping of any minutes and\nrecords. 3. Payment, if any, for\nthe services of a facilitator shall be made by the regulating agency. The\nagency shall also be responsible for providing any administrative support\nneeded by the committee and the facilitator. C. Notice of proposed negotiated rule making. If, upon determination by the agency head that a negotiated rule making is in\nthe public interest, an agency proposes to establish a negotiated rule making\ncommittee, the agency shall publish a notice of proposed negotiated rule making\nin the State Register and, as appropriate, in trade or other specialized\npublications. A notice of proposed negotiated rule making shall\ninclude: 1. an announcement that the\nagency intends to establish a negotiated rule making committee to negotiate and\ndevelop a proposed rule; 2. a\ndescription of the subject and scope of the rule to be developed and the issues\nto be considered; 3. a list of the\ninterests which are likely to be significantly affected by the rule; 4. a proposed agenda and schedule for\ncompleting the work of the committee, including a target date for publication\nby the agency of a proposed rule for notice and comment; 5. the proposed membership of the negotiated\nrule making committee, including, to the extent feasible, an identification of\nthe persons proposed to represent the agency and outside interests; and\n6. an explanation of how a\nperson may apply for membership on the committee, as provided in paragraph D of\nthis section. D. Applications for membership. Persons who will be significantly affected by a\nproposed rule and who believe that their interests will not be adequately\nrepresented by any person identified in a notice published under paragraph C of\nthis section may apply to the agency for membership on the negotiated rule\nmaking committee to represent such interests. II. Establishment of Committee\nA. Determination to establish committee. If, after considering comments and applications submitted under paragraphs C and D\nof Section I, the agency head determines that a negotiated rule making\ncommittee can adequately represent the interests that will be significantly\naffected by a proposed rule and that it is feasible and appropriate in the\nparticular rule making, the agency may establish a negotiated rule making\ncommittee. Such committee will be comprised of persons representing interests\nidentified through the process set forth in paragraphs C and D of Section I, one or more representatives of the agency, and a facilitator. The agency will\npublish notice of the establishment of the committee, or the decision to forego\nestablishing a committee, in the State Register and any other publications\ndeemed appropriate by the agency. B. Duties of committee. Each negotiated rule\nmaking committee shall consider the matter proposed by the agency for\nconsideration and shall attempt to reach a consensus concerning a proposed rule\nwith respect to such matter and any other matter the committee determines is\nrelevant to the proposed rule. Unless otherwise agreed to by the committee, \"consensus\" shall mean unanimous concurrence among the interests represented on\nthe committee. The committee may adopt procedures for its operation. The\ncommittee should consider coming to agreement that issues on which a consensus\nis reached will not be litigated by the parties to the negotiated rule\nmaking. C. Representative of agency\non committee. The person or persons representing the agency on a negotiated\nrule making committee shall be fully authorized by the agency to represent its\ninterests in the committee's discussions, negotiations and decisions and shall\nparticipate in the deliberations and activities of the committee with the same\nrights and responsibilities as other members of the committee. D. Reconvening committee. A committee may\nreconvene after a negotiated rule is published in a notice of proposed rule\nmaking to consider any public comments received by the agency. III. Report of Committee\n\nIf a committee reaches a consensus on a proposed rule or\nany portion thereof, at the conclusion of negotiations, the committee shall\ntransmit to the agency head that established the committee and the Office of\n\nBusiness Permits and Regulatory Assistance a report containing details of the\nconsensus reached. The committee may include in a report any other information, recommendations, or materials that the committee considers appropriate. Any\ncommittee member may include as an addendum to the report additional\ninformation, recommendations, or materials. An agency shall identify in a\nnotice of proposed rule making any rule or portion thereof which was the result\nof a negotiated rule making or the subject of a negotiated rule making on which\nconsensus was not reached. IV. Responsibilities of the Office of\n\nBusiness Permits and Regulatory Assistance\n\nThe Office of Business Permits and Regulatory Assistance\nwill develop and maintain a roster of individuals, including State agency\npersonnel, who are interested in and capable of serving as facilitators in\nnegotiated rule making proceedings. The office may consult with alternative\ndispute resolution organizations to compile its roster of facilitators. Agencies may utilize this roster or alternative sources for facilitators, including personnel of other State agencies. The office will compile and maintain information related to\nnegotiated rule making and advise agencies and regulated parties on conducting\nand participating in negotiated rule makings. The office will monitor\nnegotiated rule making proceedings and, periodically, encourage agencies to\nutilize the negotiated rule making process. V. Responsibilities of the Department of\n\nEconomic Development\n\nThe Department of Economic Development will work with the\nbusiness community to identify regulatory issues that are critical to their\ncompetitiveness for the future and that might be appropriate for the negotiated\nrule making process. The department will recommend to agencies regulatory\nissues that may be addressed appropriately by negotiated rule making and\nparticipate in the deliberations of any negotiated rule making committee that\nis considering a rule which presents significant economic issues. VI. Initial Projects\n\nThe Commissioner of Environmental Conservation, after\nconsultation with the Commissioner of Economic Development, shall establish\nnegotiated rule making committees to consider such matters concerning the Clean\n\nAir Act and pesticide notification requirements as are appropriate for the\nnegotiated rule making process. The Department of Economic Development shall\nassist in identifying representative of interests affected by such matters for\nmembership on the negotiated rule making committees and participate in the\ndeliberations of the committees. VII. Assistance of Other Agencies\n\nThe Office of Business Permits and Regulatory Assistance, the Department of Economic Development and any agency undertaking a negotiated\nrule making project may request and shall receive from any department, division, board, bureau, commission or from any public corporation, assistance, services and data as they deem necessary to carry out the purpose of this\nprogram.
