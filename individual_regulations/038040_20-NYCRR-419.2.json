  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 419.2 - Jeopardy assessments\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 288-a\n(a) If the Department of Taxation and Finance\nbelieves that the collection of any tax will be jeopardized by delay, the\ndepartment may, prior to the filing of a return and prior to the date such\nreturn is required to be filed, determine and assess the amount of such tax, together with all interest and penalties provided by law, against any person\nliable therefor. Such amount becomes due and payable by the person against whom\nthe assessment is made as of the date a notice of the jeopardy assessment is\ngiven personally or by registered or certified mail to such person. The\ndepartment may abate any such assessment if it finds that jeopardy does not\nexist. (b) The collection of any\njeopardy assessment may be stayed pending a hearing or a proceeding under\narticle 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules by filing with the department a\nbond (issued by a surety company authorized to transact business in this State\nand approved by the Superintendent of Insurance as to solvency and\nresponsibility) or by depositing with the department other acceptable security\nin the amount of the tax, interest and penalty assessed. If such a bond or\nsecurity is filed or deposited and thereafter a proceeding under article 78 is\ncommenced, the deposit of the taxes, penalties and interest assessed is not\nrequired as a condition precedent to the commencement of such\nproceeding. (c) Where a jeopardy\nassessment is made, any property seized for the collection of the tax may not\nbe sold until the expiration of the time to apply for a hearing and if such\napplication is timely filed until the expiration of four months after the Tax\n\nAppeals Tribunal has given notice of its determination. Provided, however, property may be sold at any time if the person against whom the assessment is\nmade fails to attend a hearing of which such person has been duly notified or\nif such person consents to the sale. Further, property may be sold if the\ndepartment determines that the expenses of conservation and maintenance of the\nproperty would greatly reduce the net proceeds obtainable or if such property\nis perishable. (d) The provisions\nof section\n419.1\nof\nthis Part and section 288 of article 12-A of the Tax Law apply to any\ndetermination of a jeopardy assessment, except to the extent that they may be\ninconsistent with the provisions of this section and section 288-a of such\narticle of the Tax Law. (e) See\n\nPart 2394 of this Title for procedures concerning predecision warrants and\nhearings in respect thereto. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
