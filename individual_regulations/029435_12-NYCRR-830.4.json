  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12 § 830.4 - Period for which penalties are assessed\n\nState Regulations\n\nPenalties are calculated by calendar day. If an employer\nhas not corrected a violation by the abatement date, the first day for which a\npenalty will be assessed is the day following the abatement date. Penalties\nwill continue to run until such time as the department has confirmed that the\nemployer has corrected the violation. The last day for which a penalty will be\nassessed is the compliance date. An order to comply with section\n27-a\nof the Labor\n\nLaw shall be issued to the employer following the compliance date, notifying\nthe employer of the final amount of penalties due; however, nothing in this\nsection shall limit the right of the commissioner to enforce the payment of\npenalties due in connection with any violation prior to the date on which such\nviolation is complied. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 12\n§\n830.4\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
