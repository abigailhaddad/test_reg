(a) \"farecard\" means a value-based, magnetically encoded card containing stored monetary value from which a\nspecified amount of value is deducted as payment of a fare; (b) \"unlimited farecard\" means a farecard\nthat is time-based, magnetically encoded and which permits entrance an\nunlimited number of times into facilities and conveyances for a specified\nperiod of time; and\n(c) \"doctored\nfarecard\" means a farecard that has been bent or manipulated or altered so as\nto facilitate a person's access to transportation services, without paying the\nlawful charge.
