A properly completed exempt organization\ncertification issued by the exempt organization to a contractor constitutes\nproof of the organization's exempt status for purposes of the State and local\nsales and compensating use taxes. Cross-reference: For further details on nongovernmental exempt\norganizations, see sections\n529.7\n-529.9 of this Title. (d) Contracts with exempt organizations. (1)\n\nTangible personal property incorporated\ninto real property owned by a governmental entity or by an exempt organization\nis exempt, whether the contract is on a lump sum, time and material, cost-plus, or other basis. (2)\n\nPurchase for\ncontracts (other than agency contracts). (i) Tangible personal property sold to a contractor, subcontractor, or repairman\nfor use in erecting, repairing, adding to, or altering a structure or building\nowned by an exempt organization, described in section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax Law, is\nexempt when it is to become an integral component part of such structure or\nbuilding. Example 1: An exempt organization contracts to have a building erected\non its land. Purchases by its contractor of tangible personal property, such as\nnails, sheetrock, and plywood that become part of the structure are\nexempt. Example 2: A building is being erected for an exempt organization. Glass in the windows is broken and a glazier is engaged by the general\ncontractor to repair the windows. The charges for such repairs are exempt and\nthe purchase of the new glass is exempt. Example 3: A contractor builds a structure on speculation and\nsubsequently sells the structure to an exempt organization. The contractor is\nnot entitled to the tax exemption on the purchase of tangible personal property\nincorporated into the structure. Example 4: The owner of real property enters into a contract to erect\na building to be leased, under a long-term lease, to an exempt organization. The contractor's purchases are not exempt as the owner of the building is not\nan exempt organization. Example 5: A contractor or a nonexempt entity owns land on which a\nbuilding is erected to the specifications of an exempt organization. Under the\nterms of the contract, the organization will not own the land or the building\nuntil it is completed and ready for occupancy. The building materials are not\nexempt as the exempt organization will not own the building at the time the\nmaterials are incorporated into the real property. (ii)\n\nPurchases of tangible personal property\nincorporated into the real property of an exempt organization by subcontractors\nand repairmen are accorded the same treatment as purchases by the prime\ncontractor. (iii)\n\nTangible personal\nproperty purchased by a contractor, which remains tangible personal property\nafter installation, is exempt from the tax when purchased for and sold to an\nexempt organization. Example 6: An exempt organization contracts to have a new wing built\nonto their existing building. The new wing includes the addition of a\ncafeteria. The contractor may purchase, exempt from the tax, the tangible\npersonal property that becomes part of the capital improvement to real property\nand the tangible personal property which remains tangible personal\nproperty. (iv)\n\nExcept for\nagency contracts, contractors' purchases of construction supplies which do not\nbecome part of an exempt organization's real property and are used or consumed\nby the contractor, as well as purchases of taxable services, such as\nelectricity used by the contractor, are subject to the tax. Cross-reference: For purchases under an agency contract, see paragraph (4)\nof this subdivision. The following types of property and services are\nrepresentative, but not intended to be all-inclusive, of contractor's purchases\nwhich are subject to tax, irrespective of whether the contractor has a time and\nmaterial, lump sum, or other type of contract (except agency contract), with an\nexempt organization: (a) construction\nmachinery and equipment, including rentals and repair parts; (b) contractors' office supplies; (c) contractors' supplies, tools, and\nmiscellaneous equipment, whether purchased or rented, including materials to\nmake forms and scaffolding; and\n(d) any other items purchased or rented by a contractor for his use in performing\nthe contract and not incorporated into the realty. Example 7: Lumber and other materials which are used to build forms\nare not exempt since they do not become a component part of the\nstructure. Example 8: Equipment rentals under the dominion and control of the\ncontractor, such as rentals of cranes, bulldozers, backhoes, etc. for use 3 in\nbuilding a structure for an exempt organization are subject to\ntax. (v) Documents. (a) If the customer is a\ngovernmental entity, copies of signed contracts and government purchase orders\nare sufficient evidence to establish the exempt status of the job between the\ngovernmental entity and the prime contractor. With respect to the documents\nrequired between a prime contractor and the subcontractors, a signed document\nbetween them which identifies the project, location, and exempt owner, will\nform the basis for tax exemption of tangible personal property purchased for\nincorporation into the exempt project. When purchasing such tangible personal\nproperty for the exempt project, the contractor or subcontractor will issue a\nproperly completed contractor exempt purchase certificate to the\nsupplier. (b) If the customer is an\nexempt organization other than a governmental entity, the prime contractor must\nobtain an exempt organization certification from his customer and retain it as\npart of his records. Copies of the certification must also be furnished to all\nsubcontractors on the job. The subcontractors must retain a copy of the\ncertification in their records with a copy of the contract which identifies the\nproject and the location. When purchasing tangible personal property for\nincorporation into the exempt project, the prime contractor and subcontractor\nwill issue a properly completed contractor exempt purchase certificate to the\nsupplier. (3)\n\nMaintaining, installing, repairing and servicing tangible personal property and\nreal property. Charges for maintaining, installing, repairing and servicing\ntangible personal property and real property are exempt from the tax when the\nexempt organization is the payer of record. When these charges are billed to\nand paid by a tenant, the charges (excluding charges for interior cleaning and\nmaintenance services of a janitorial nature performed on a regular contractual\nbasis for a term of not less than 30 days) are subject to the tax on the full\ninvoice price, except for the charges billed to and paid by a tenant which\nqualifies as an exempt entity pursuant to section\n1116 (a)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw. (4)\n\nAgency contracts. (i) If an exempt organization described in\nsection\n1116 (a)(3) (4) (5) or (6)\nof the Tax Law enters into an agency\ncontract with the prime contractor and all subcontractors, all purchases for\nsuch contract are exempt as long as the property and services are purchased by\nthe contractor or subcontractor as agent for the exempt organization. In order\nto create a principal/agent relationship all of the following conditions must\nbe met: (a) purchases must be billed or\ninvoiced by the vendor to the exempt organization or to the contractor\nspecifying that the contractor is acting as agent for the exempt organization\n(\ne.g., X contractor, as agent for Y, name of exempt\norganization) and identify the place of delivery; (b) payment must be made by the exempt\norganization or by the contractor, acting as agent, directly to the vendor from\na special fund created by the exempt organization for this specific\npurpose; (c) deliveries must be\nmade to the job site; or under certain circumstances (such as where the\nmaterials require additional fabrication before installation on the job site or\nfor storage to protect the materials from theft or vandalism prior to\ninstallation at the job site) deliveries may be made to a site, other than the\njob site, providing the ultimate delivery of the materials is made to the job\nsite. Where delivery is made to a site, other than the job site, the purchases\nmust be billed or invoiced by the vendor to the exempt organization or to the\ncontractor as agent, identify the place of delivery, the exempt organization's\nfull name and address and the job site location where the materials will\nultimately be delivered for installation; and\n(d) the contractor must furnish the vendor\nwith the exempt organization certification when acting as agent for such\norganization. A statement signed by a responsible officer of the exempt\norganization which identifies the contract and the contractor, as agent for the\nexempt organization, must be either made on the exempt organization\ncertification or appropriately attached thereto. If the proposed agency contract differs from the\nrequirements of this subparagraph, copies of the proposed contract and\nprocedures may be submitted for an opinion to the Instructions and\n\nInterpretations Unit, Sales Tax Section, Technical Services Bureau, W.A. Harriman Campus, Albany, NY 12227. (ii)\n\nAll purchases or rentals of materials, equipment, tools, and supplies by an exempt organization or by a contractor or\nsubcontractor, as agent for an organization which is exempt from sales taxes\nunder section 1116(a)(3), (4), (5) or (6), are exempt from sales and use taxes\nwhen the contract fully complies with the requirements set forth in\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. (iii)\nA contractor is liable for the tax due\non purchases or rentals of equipment, tools and supplies made under a purported\nexempt organization agency contract if subsequently it is determined the\ncontract does not qualify as an agency contract. Example 9: A contractor enters into a purported agency contract with\nan exempt organization for the construction of a capital improvement to real\nproperty. The exempt organization or the contractor, acting as agent for the\nexempt organization, makes tax free purchases or rentals of materials, tools\nand/or equipment and supplies. Subsequently, it is determined the contract does\nnot qualify as an agency contract. The contractor is liable for the tax due on\nthe purchases or rentals of tools and/or equipment and supplies. The purchase\nof materials incorporated into the capital improvement to real property owned\nby the exempt organization is exempt from the tax, providing proper exempt\ndocumentation is given to the vendor of the materials.
