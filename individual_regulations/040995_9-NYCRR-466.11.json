  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 466.11 - Provision of reasonable accommodation by employers, pursuant to human rights law, sections 292.21, 292.21-e, 295.5, 296.3 and 296.3-a\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Reasonable accommodation. (1)\n\nReasonable accommodation is defined in\nthe Human Rights Law at section 292.21 -e, as follows: The term \"reasonable accommodation\" means actions taken which\npermit an employee, prospective employee or member with a disability to perform\nin a reasonable manner the activities involved in the job or occupation sought\nor held and include, but are not limited to, provision of an accessible\nworksite, acquisition or modification of equipment, support services for\npersons with impaired hearing or vision, job restructuring and modified work\nschedules; provided, however, that such actions do not impose an undue hardship\non the business, program or enterprise of the entity from which action is\nrequested. (2)\n\nReasonable\naccommodations may include, but are not limited to: making existing facilities\nmore readily accessible to individuals with disabilities; acquisition or\nmodification of equipment; job restructuring; modified work schedules; adjustments to work schedule for treatment or recovery; reassignment to an\navailable position; adjustment of examinations, training materials or policies; providing readers or interpreters. (3)\n\nReasonable accommodation does not include\namong other things: providing for personal care needs, such as a personal care\nassistant, although such a personal care assistant should be accommodated where\nprovided by the employee at no cost to the employer; providing non-work-related\naids, such as a personal hearing aid or wheelchair, which are the employee's\nown responsibility. (b) Determination of reasonableness. (1)\n\nWhether\nan accommodation that has been requested or is under consideration is a\nreasonable accommodation required by the Human Rights Law will turn on a\nbalancing of the following factors: (i) efficacy or benefit provided by the accommodation toward removing the\nimpediments to performance caused by the disability; (ii)\nconvenience or reasonableness of the\naccommodation for the employer, including its comparative convenience as\nopposed to other possible accommodations; and\n(iii)\nthe hardships, costs, or problems it\nwill cause for the employer, including those that may be caused for other\nemployees. (2)\n\nAccommodations that pose an undue hardship on the employer will not be\nrequired. Undue hardship means significant difficulty or expense to the\nemployer. In determining whether an accommodation would result in undue\nhardship, consideration will be given to any relevant factor. Relevant factors\ncan include, but are not necessarily limited to, those set forth in the Human\n\nRights Law, at section 296.3(b): (i) the\noverall size of the business, program or enterprise with respect to the number\nof employees, number and type of facilities, and size of budget; (ii)\nthe type of operation which the\nbusiness, program or enterprise is engaged in, including the composition and\nstructure of the workforce; and\n(iii)\nthe nature and cost of the\naccommodation needed, including consideration of any money available from other\nsources to assist the employer in paying the cost. (c) Covered disabilities. (1)\n\nThe Human Rights Law protects from\ndiscrimination those individuals with disabilities which, with or without\nreasonable accommodation, do not prevent the individual from performing the\nduties of the job in a reasonable manner. The definition of disability in the\n\nHuman Rights Law is more comprehensive than that under Federal law in that it\ncovers many conditions that have been found to be not a disability under the\n\nFederal Americans with Disabilities Act. (2)\n\nThe term disability is defined in the\n\nHuman Rights Law at section 292.21 to mean: (i) a physical, mental or medical impairment\nresulting from anatomical, physiological, genetic or neurological conditions\nwhich prevents the exercise of a normal bodily function or is demonstrable by\nmedically accepted clinical or laboratory diagnostic techniques; (ii)\na record of such an impairment; or\n(iii)\na condition regarded by\nothers as such an impairment. With regard to employment, the term is limited to\ndisabilities which, upon the provision of reasonable accommodations, do not\nprevent the complainant from performing in a reasonable manner the activities\ninvolved in the job or occupation sought or held. (3)\n\nNot every disability covered by the Human\n\nRights Law will require the consideration of reasonable accommodations. Only\nthose disabilities which actually impede, as a matter of fact, the individual\nin performing the job will give rise to a consideration of accommodation. This\nis understood to include those situations in which the job impedes the\nindividual's recovery or ability to obtain treatment, and accommodation can\nmake recovery or treatment possible while the individual continues to be\nemployed. (d) Who is\nentitled to a reasonable accommodation. (1)\n\nTo\nbe entitled to the protection of the Human Rights Law, the disabled individual\nmust have the requisite job qualifications as well as be able to satisfactorily\nperform in the job. (i) The disabled\nindividual must be otherwise qualified for the job by education, skill, experience, ability, etc., to the same extent that such education, skill, experience, ability, etc., are required as bona fide job qualifications for\nnondisabled applicants or employees. See further, paragraph (f)(4) of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nThe disabled\nindividual must be able, with or without accommodation, to attain reasonable\nperformance. Reasonable performance is not perfect performance or performance\nunaffected by the disability, but reasonable job performance, reasonably\nmeeting the employer's needs to achieve its business goals. See further, paragraphs (f)(1)-(3) of this section. (2)\n\nTo be entitled to a reasonable\naccommodation, the individual must meet the qualification and performance\nstandards set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision, and must have a\ndisability and a need for an accommodation which are known, or are made known, to the employer. (e) Circumstances giving rise to the requirement that the employer consider\nreasonable accommodation, in accordance with the factors set forth in\nsubdivision (b) of this section. (1)\n\nReasonable accommodation must be considered where the disability and need for\naccommodation are known to the employer. (2)\n\nReasonable accommodation must be\nconsidered when a qualified applicant or employee with a disability informs the\nemployer of the disability (if the employer does not already know of its\nexistence) and requests an accommodation. (3)\n\nReasonable accommodation must be\nconsidered when a current employee with a disability informs the employer of\nthe disability (if the employer does not already know of its existence) and\nrequests an accommodation, even if there has been no change in the employee's\nmedical condition. (f) Ability to reasonably perform the activities involved in the job or occupation; job restructuring. (1)\n\nAbility to reasonably\nperform the activities involved in the job or occupation means the ability, with or without accommodation, to satisfactorily perform the essential\nfunctions of the job or occupation. See further, subparagraph (d)(1)(ii) of\nthis section. (2)\n\nSatisfactory\nperformance means minimum acceptable performance of the essential functions of\nthe job as established by the employer. The employer's judgment as to what is\nminimum acceptable performance will not be second-guessed, so long as standards\nfor performance are applied equivalently to all employees in the same position. Such standards for satisfactory performance may include minimum productivity\nstandards or quotas. (3)\n\nEssential\nfunctions are those fundamental to the position; a function is essential if not\nperforming that function would fundamentally change the job or occupation for\nwhich the position exists. What is an essential function is a factual question\nto be resolved by all relevant evidence. Evidence for determining the essential\nfunctions of a particular position would include, but would not be limited to, the following: (i) the employer's judgment as\nto which functions are essential, particularly where so indicated in a\npre-existing written job description; (ii)\nhow often the function is actually\nperformed by other employees in the position; (iii)\nhow many other employees are available\nto whom the function could be reallocated by job restructuring; (iv)\nthe direct and specific consequences to\nthe employer's business if the function is not performed by the particular\ndisabled individual; (v) the terms\nof a collective bargaining agreement. (Labor organizations are also required to\nreasonably accommodate the disabilities of a member, pursuant to section\n296.3.)\n(4)\n\nWhen an\nemployer fills a position with a specific purpose of acquiring special ability\nor expertise (for example: technical expertise, foreign language skill, physical strength in a firefighter), even if the amount of time actually spent\non the job using the special ability or expertise is small, this ability or\nexpertise is a bona fide qualification for the job. See further, subparagraph\n(d)(1)(i) of this section. (5)\n\nAs\nis true in any area covered by the Human Rights Law, the employer may hire the\napplicant who is most qualified with regard to the bona fide job\nqualifications, and is not required to hire a disabled applicant simply because\nthe applicant meets the minimum job qualifications if there are other more\nqualified applicants. (6)\n\nThe Human\n\nRights Law does not require, as a reasonable accommodation in the form of job\nrestructuring, the creation of a completely unique position with either\nqualifications or functions tailored to the disabled individual's\nabilities. (7)\n\nReasonable\naccommodation, in the form of job restructuring, is required if a disabled\nindividual meets the bona fide job qualifications, and can satisfactorily\nperform the essential functions of the position; the duties that the disabled\nindividual cannot perform due to the disability, and that are not essential to\nthe position, must not be required of the disabled individual. (g) Safety concerns; objectionable\nbehaviors. (1)\n\nThe Human Rights Law does not\nrequire accommodation of behaviors that do not meet the employer's workplace\nbehavior standards that are consistently applied to all similarly situated\nemployees, even if these behaviors are caused by a disability. This would\ninclude, but not be limited to: (i) dress\ncodes, grooming standards and time and attendance policy, though reasonable and\nnecessary deviations must be allowed as accommodations; (ii)\nconduct standards, including those which\nprohibit aggressive or threatening behavior; (iii)\ndiscipline for theft of company\nproperty by a kleptomaniac; and\n(iv)\ndiscipline for intoxication or\nimpairment on the job by an alcoholic. (2)\n\nReasonable accommodation is not required\nwhere the disability or the accommodation itself poses a direct threat. (i) Direct threat means a significant risk of\nsubstantial harm to the health or safety of the employee or others that cannot\nbe eliminated or reduced by reasonable accommodation. (ii)\n\nIn determining whether a direct threat\nexists, the employer must make an individualized assessment, based on\nreasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best\navailable objective information, to ascertain: the nature, duration, and\nseverity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually\noccur; and whether reasonable accommodations, such as modification of policies, practices, or procedures, will mitigate the risk. (iii)\n\nSome jobs may have a bona fide\nclassification as safety sensitive, such as, for example, vehicle operators or\npersons who work with children. Heightened consideration of direct threat is to\nbe encouraged in bona fide safety sensitive jobs. (h) Drug addiction and alcoholism. (1)\n\nAlcoholism and drug addiction are\ndiseases. However, an individual who is currently using drugs illegally (see\nparagraph [4] of this subdivision), is not protected in this regard by the\n\nHuman Rights Law. The law does protect an individual who is a\nrecovered/recovering alcoholic or drug addict. (2)\n\nAdjustments to the work schedule, where\nneeded to allow for ongoing treatment, must be allowed as an accommodation\nwhere reasonable, if the individual is still able to perform the essential\nfunctions of the job including predictable and regular attendance. (3)\n\nThe recovered/recovering alcoholic or\ndrug addict should be expected to perform job tasks just as anyone else with\nsimilar skills, experience and background. (4)\n\nWhere the employer has knowledge of the\ncurrent illegal use of drugs, the employee is not entitled by law to\naccommodation, and may be terminated. (i) Current illegal use of drugs means illegal use of drugs that occurred recently\nenough to justify a reasonable belief that a person's drug use is current or\nthat continuing use is a real and ongoing problem. (ii)\n\nIn determining whether recent use is\nenough to justify a reasonable belief in current use, the individual's\nsuccessful participation in a program for rehabilitation or recovery since the\nrecent use is relevant. (5)\n\nEmployers are encouraged, where the\nemployer knows of current illegal use of drugs, or where job performance of an\nalcoholic or drug addict deteriorates to below acceptable standards, to utilize\nthe practice of leave of absence and required attendance at a rehabilitation\nprogram, along with a last chance agreement requiring acceptable performance\nand attendance upon return. If an employee denies the problem and refuses the\nleave, treatment and last chance agreement, the employee may be terminated or\ndisciplined for the documented performance problems. (6)\n\nDrug testing. (i) A test to determine the illegal use of\ndrugs is not to be considered a medical test. (ii)\n\nNothing in these regulations is to be\nconstrued to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the conducting of drug tests for\nthe illegal use of drugs by job applicants or employees, or the making of\nemployment decisions based on the test results. (iii)\n\nNothing in these regulations is to be\nconstrued to encourage, prohibit, restrict or authorize the otherwise lawful\nexercise by entities subject to the jurisdiction of the United States\n\nDepartment of Transportation, of authority to test applicants for or employees\nin safety sensitive positions for the illegal use of drugs or for on-duty\nimpairment by alcohol, or to remove persons who test positive from safety\nsensitive duties. (iv)\n\nAny\ninformation regarding the medical condition or history of any applicant or\nemployee obtained from a drug test, except information regarding illegal use of\ndrugs, must be kept confidential, and may not be used in any way to the\ndisadvantage of the applicant or employee. (i) Temporary disabilities. (1)\nA current employee experiencing a\ntemporary disability is protected by the Human Rights Law where the individual\nwill be able to satisfactorily perform the duties of the job after a reasonable\naccommodation in the form of a reasonable time for recovery. (2)\n\nThe Human Rights Law requires no more\nthan de minimis accommodations for temporary disabilities in the areas of\nworksite accessibility, acquisition or modification of equipment, job\nrestructuring, or support services for persons with temporarily impaired\nhearing or vision. (3)\n\nThe Human\n\nRights Law may require reasonable accommodation of temporary disabilities in\nthe areas of modified work schedules, reassignment to an available position or\navailable light duty, or adjustments to work schedules for recovery. The\nemployer's past practice, pre-existing policies regarding leave time and/or\nlight duty, specific workplace needs, the size and flexibility of the relevant\nworkforce, and the employee's overall attendance record will be important\nfactors in determining reasonable accommodation in this context. (j) Rights and duties of the\nemployer. (1)\n\nThe employer must not make\npre-employment inquiries with regard to the existence of a disability or need\nfor accommodation. The employer should provide information to applicants and\nnew employees as to their rights with regard to reasonable accommodation of\ndisability, and as to procedures to be followed in requesting reasonable\naccommodation. (2)\n\nThe employer\nshould advise all current employees on a regular basis as to their rights with\nregard to reasonable accommodation of disability, and as to procedures to be\nfollowed in requesting reasonable accommodation. (3)\n\nThe employer has the duty to reasonably\naccommodate known disabilities, where the need for the accommodation is\nknown. (4)\n\nThe employer has a duty\nto move forward to consider accommodation once the need for accommodation is\nknown or requested. The employer has the duty to clearly request from the\napplicant or employee any documentation that is needed. (5)\n\nOnce an accommodation is under\nconsideration, the employer has the right to medical or other information that\nis necessary to verify the existence of the disability or that is necessary for\nconsideration of the accommodation. The employer must maintain the\nconfidentiality of individuals' medical information. (6)\n\nThe employer has the right to select\nwhich reasonable accommodation will be provided, so long as it is effective in\nmeeting the need. (7)\n\nIt is\nrecommended that the employer have a written policy and procedure for\nreasonable accommodation of disability. A sample procedure is available from\nthe division. (k) Rights\nand duties of the employee. (1)\n\nThe employee\nmust make the disability and need for accommodation known to the\nemployer. (2)\n\nAn employee with a\ndisability has a right to request an accommodation at any time, even if his/her\nmedical condition has not changed. (3)\n\nThe employee must cooperate with the\nemployer in the consideration and implementation of the requested reasonable\naccommodation. (4)\n\nThe employee\nmust cooperate in providing medical or other information that is necessary to\nverify the existence of the disability or that is necessary for consideration\nof the accommodation. The employee has a right to have his/her medical\ninformation kept confidential. (5)\n\nThe employee has the right to refuse an accommodation despite the existence of\na disability, if the employee can perform the job in a reasonable manner\nwithout the accommodation. Notes\nN.Y.
