Tit. 15 § 54.33 - Changes in approval requirements\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, at his discretion, reserves the right to alter or change the requirements specifications or to\nrequire additional or supplementary tests at any time. The commissioner further\nreserves the right to require the manufacturer to furnish without cost a\nreasonable number of samples selected by the commissioner from manufacturers', distributors', or retailers' stock for verification reports. The cost of\nverification tests shall be borne by the manufacturer. If any such report\ndiscloses any unapprovable deviation from the standards upon which the approval\nwas based, the commissioner may, upon due notice to the manufacturer, revoke\nthe approval. Approval may be withdrawn at any time and for any cause deemed\nreasonable by the commissioner or the commissioner may require new approvals\nany time he may deem necessary or reasonable. Notes\nN.Y.
