  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 14 § 812.5 - Limits on executive compensation\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Limits on executive\ncompensation. Except if a covered provider has obtained a waiver pursuant\nto section\n812.6\nof this Part, a covered\nprovider as defined in this regulation shall not use State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments for executive compensation given directly or\nindirectly to a covered executive in an amount greater than $199,000 per annum, provided, however, that the Division of Budget shall review this figure\nannually to determine whether adjustment is necessary based on appropriate\nfactors and subject to the approval of the Director of the Division of the\n\nBudget. Commencing on July 1, 2013, the limits on executive compensation\npursuant to this Part shall be effective and applicable to each covered\nprovider on the first day of each covered provider's respective covered\nreporting period. (b) Program services rendered by covered executives. The limit on executive compensation pursuant to this Section\nshall not be applied to limit reimbursement with State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments for reasonable compensation paid to a covered\nexecutive for program services, including but not limited to supervisory\nservices performed to facilitate the covered provider's program services, rendered by the executive outside of his or her managerial or policy-making\nduties. Documentation of such program services rendered shall be used by the\ncovered provider to determine that percentage, if any, of the covered\nexecutive's compensation that is attributable to program services and that\ncompensation shall not be considered in the calculation of his or her executive\ncompensation. Such documentation shall be maintained and provided to the office\nor its designee upon request. Clinical and program personnel in a hospital or\nother entity providing program services, including chairs of departments, heads\nof service, chief medical officers, directors of nursing, or similar types of\npersonnel fulfilling administrative functions that are nevertheless directly\nattributable to and comprise program services shall not be considered covered\nexecutives for purposes of limiting the use of State funds or State-authorized\npayments to compensate them. (c) Covered providers with multiple\nsources of State funds or State-authorized payments. If a covered provider receives State funds or\n\nState-authorized payments from multiple sources, the provider's compliance with\nthe limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a) of this section shall\nbe determined based upon the total amount of such funding received and the\nreimbursements received from all sources of State funds or State-authorized\npayments. As set forth in section\n812.7\nof this Part, the covered\nprovider shall report all of such State funds and State-authorized payments in\nthe form specified by the office or its designee. (d) Subcontractors and agents of\ncovered providers. The limits on executive compensation in subdivision (a) of\nthis section and the reporting requirements in section\n812.7\nof this Part shall apply to\nsubcontractors and agents of covered providers if and to the extent that such a\nsubcontractor or agent has received State funds or State-authorized payments\nfrom the covered provider to provide program or administrative services during\nthe reporting period and would otherwise meet the definition of a covered\nprovider but for the fact that it has received State funds or State-authorized\npayments from the covered provider rather than directly from a governmental\nagency. A covered provider shall incorporate into its agreement with such a\nsubcontractor or agent the terms of these regulations by reference to require\nand facilitate compliance. Upon request, covered providers shall promptly\nreport to the funding or authorizing agency the identity of such subcontractors\nand agents, along with any other information requested by that agency or by the\noffice or its designee. A covered provider shall not be held responsible for a\nsubcontractor's or agent's failure to comply with these\nregulations. (e) Covered providers receiving State funds or State-authorized payments from\ncounty or local government or an entity on contracting on its behalf. The office or its designee, rather than the county or local\nunit of government, shall be responsible for obtaining the necessary reporting\nfrom and compliance by such covered providers, and shall issue guidance to\naffected county and local governments to set forth the procedures by which the\noffice or it designee shall do so. (f) Other limits on executive\ncompensation. If the contract, grant, or other agreement is subject to more\nstringent limits on executive compensation, whether through law or contract, such limits shall control and shall not be affected by the less stringent\nlimits imposed by these regulations. However, the definition and interpretation\nof terms in this Part shall not be affected or limited by the definition or\ninterpretation of terms in other regulations or agreements. (g) A covered provider's contract or other\nagreement with a covered executive agreed to prior to July 1, 2012 shall not be\nsubject to the limits in this section during the term of the contract, except\nthat: (1)\ncovered providers must apply for a\nwaiver for any contracts or agreements with covered executives for executive\ncompensation that exceeds or otherwise fails to comply with these regulations\nif such contracts or agreements extend beyond April 1, 2015; and\n(2)\nrenewals of such contracts or agreements\nafter the completion of their term must comply with these\nregulations.
