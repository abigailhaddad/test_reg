  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 84.1 - Label requirements\n\nState Regulations\n(a) There\nshall be affixed to or imprinted upon each container of alcoholic beverages a\nbrand label which shall conform with the appropriate authority rules and\n\nFederal Alcohol Administration Act regulations and the term brand labels as\nused in this Part shall mean all labels required by such rules and\nregulations. (b) No manufacturer or\nwholesaler shall sell to any retailer nor shall any retailer purchase any\nalcoholic beverages unless labeled in accordance with the authority's rules and\n\nFederal regulations and unless such label shall be registered with and approved\nby the State Liquor Authority. (c) Each label affixed to any container of alcoholic beverages sold in this State\nshall be registered with the authority and any difference whatsoever in the\ninformation stated on the label except as to fluid contents shall be regarded\nas establishing a separate label. (d) Until September 30, 1963, all labels\nregistered with the authority pursuant to this Part shall be deemed approved by\nthe authority unless and until the registrant is notified of disapproval by the\nauthority, provided such label had been previously filed with the authority on\nor before May 1, 1963. (e) Labels\nshall not contain any statement or representation, irrespective of truth or\nfalsity, which, in the judgment of the authority, would tend to deceive the\nconsumer. (f) Beer means and\nincludes any fermented beverages of any name or description containing one half\nof one percent or more of alcohol by volume, manufactured from malt, wholly or\nin part, or from any substitute therefor. Brand label registration is not\nrequired for cereal beverages which contain less than one half of one percent\nalcohol by volume. (g) (1)\n\nPursuant to the Alcoholic Beverage\n\nControl Law, any fermented beverage of any name or description manufactured\nfrom malt, wholly or in part, or from any substitute therefor, is beer. Liquor\nis limited to distilled or rectified spirits or similar alcoholic beverages. Hence, the use of the term liquor (whether alone or in combination with any\nother word, such as malt liquor), on labels affixed to any container containing\nfermented malt beverages, is misleading, tends to deceive consumers and the\ngeneral public and contravenes the intent and purpose of the Alcoholic Beverage\n\nControl Law. (2)\n\nIn order to\nprohibit deception of the consumer and the general public, and to afford them\nadequate and accurate information as to the quality and identity of alcoholic\nbeverages offered for sale in this State, each label affixed to any container\ncontaining fermented beverages manufactured from malt, wholly or in part, or\nfrom any substitute therefor, shall have the word beer prominently displayed on\nthe main label thereof; provided, however, that the word beer is not required\nto appear on any label which: (i) identifies\nthe contents of the container to which it is affixed as \"lager,\" \"ale,\"\n\"stout,\" \"porter\" or \"alcoholic malt beverage\"; and\n(ii)\ndoes not contain the word liquor or any\nother word which, in common usage, connotes a distilled spirit or a fermented\nbeverage not manufactured wholly or in part from malt or from any substitute\ntherefor. (3)\n\nThe\nprovisions of this subdivision shall be effective with respect to all labels\naffixed to containers sold, offered for sale or delivered in this State from\nand after July 1, 1975. If and to the extent that the provisions of this\nsubdivision are inconsistent with any other provision of this section, the\nprovisions of this subdivision shall govern. (h) Where there is any conflict between the\nprovisions of this Part and any rule or regulation of the Federal Alcohol\n\nAdministration Act, the provisions of this Part shall prevail. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n84.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
