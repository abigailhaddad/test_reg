  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 352.36 - Factors when providing temporary housing assistance to certain sex offenders\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Statement of\npurpose. (1)\n\nChapter 568 of the Laws of 2008\nrequires the Division of Parole (DOP), the Division of Probation and\n\nCorrectional Alternatives (DPCA), and the Office of Temporary and Disability\n\nAssistance (OTDA) to promulgate regulations to provide guidance concerning the\nplacement and/or approval of housing for certain sex offenders. (2)\n\nThe State has previously enacted laws\nconcerning sex offenders, including the Sex Offender Registration Act, the Sex\n\nOffender Management and Treatment Act, the Electronic Security and Targeting of\n\nOn-Line Predators Act (e-STOP) and laws restricting certain sex offenders who\nare under probation or parole supervision from entering school grounds. Chapter\n568 of the Laws of 2008 continues the State's efforts in the area of sex\noffender management and specifically in the area of the placement and housing\nof sex offenders. Sex offender management, and the placement and housing of sex\noffenders, are areas that have been, and will continue to be, matters addressed\nby the State. These regulations further the State's coordinated and\ncomprehensive policies in these areas, and are intended to provide further\nguidance to relevant State and local agencies in applying the State's\napproach. (3)\n\nPublic safety is a\nprimary concern, and these regulations are intended to better protect children, vulnerable populations and the general public from sex offenders. The State's\ncoordinated and comprehensive approach also recognizes the necessity to provide\nemergency shelter to individuals in need, including those who are sex\noffenders, and the importance of stable housing and support in allowing\noffenders to live in and re-enter the community and become law-abiding and\nproductive citizens. These regulations are based upon, and are intended to\nfurther, best practices and effective strategies to achieve these\ngoals. (4)\n\nIn implementing this\nstatute and the State's comprehensive approach, DOP, DPCA, OTDA and the\n\nDivision of Criminal Justice Services' Office of Sex Offender Management\n(DCJS/OSOM) recognize that: (i) Not all sex\noffenders are equally dangerous. Some sex offenders may pose a high risk of\ncommitting a new sexual crime; others may pose only a low risk. (ii)\n\nAll reasonable efforts should be made to\navoid an ill-advised concentration of sex offenders in certain neighborhoods\nand localities. What constitutes such a concentration will depend on many\nfactors, and may vary depending on housing availability and the locality and\ncommunity. In addition, it is sometimes safer to house sex offenders together. Law enforcement, probation, and parole officers may more effectively monitor\noffenders, and service providers may more easily offer transitional services to\noffenders in these congregate settings. Further, some social services officials\nand departments rely on congregate housing for sex offenders who seek emergency\nshelter because of the limited, or lack of other housing options available for\nthis population. All public officials who are responsible for finding or\napproving housing for sex offenders should recognize that an over-concentration\nof sex offenders may create risks and burdens on the surrounding community, and\nthat their responsibility is to make judgments that are reasonable under the\ncircumstances. (iii)\n\nAll social\nservices districts are required by statute, regulation and directive to arrange\ntemporary housing assistance for eligible homeless individuals, including those\nwho are sex offenders. (iv)\n\nTo\nreduce recidivism it is important that offenders be able to re-enter society\nand become productive and law-abiding citizens whenever possible. A stable\nliving situation and access to employment and support services are important\nfactors that can help offenders to successfully re-enter society. (v) Maintaining and/or finding suitable\nhousing for sex offenders is an enormous challenge that impacts all areas of\nthe State. Offenders reside in all regions of the State and may have\nlong-established residences in their respective communities. Even offenders who\ndo not have such long-established relationships are often discharged from\nprison to the community where they previously lived. As a result, it is not\nappropriate for any one community or county to bear an inappropriate burden in\nhousing sex offenders because another community has attempted to shift its\nresponsibility for those offenders onto other areas of the State. The\nproliferation of local ordinances imposing residency restrictions upon sex\noffenders, while well-intentioned, have made it more challenging for the State\nand local authorities to address the difficulties in finding secure and\nappropriate housing for sex offenders. (vi)\n\nDecisions as to the housing and\nsupervision of sex offenders should take into account all relevant factors and\nno one factor will necessarily be dispositive. These factors should include, but not be limited to, the factors enumerated in the statute, the risk posed by\nthe offender, the nature of the underlying offense, whether housing offenders\ntogether or apart is safer and more feasible, the most effective method to\nsupervise and provide services to offenders, and the availability of\nappropriate housing, employment, treatment and support. (b) Applicability and factors. (1)\n\nWhen a social services district has\nreceived advance written notice, pursuant to section\n259-c\n(17)\nof the Executive Law, that an inmate who\nis designated a level two or level three sex offender pursuant to the sex\noffender registration act is likely to seek to access local social services for\nhomeless persons, and such individual is determined by the social services\ndistrict to be in immediate need of shelter, the local social services\nofficials shall consider the following factors when making a determination in\nregard to the placement of such individual in shelter, provided that the\nindividual is otherwise eligible for temporary housing assistance: (i) the location of other sex offenders\nrequired to register pursuant to the sex offender registration act, specifically whether there is a concentration of registered sex offenders in a\ncertain residential area or municipality; (ii)\nthe number of registered sex offenders\nresiding at a particular property; (iii)\nproximity of the entities with\nvulnerable populations; (iv)\naccessibility to family members, friends or other supportive services, including but not limited to locally available sex offender treatment programs\nwith preference for placement of such individuals into programs that have\ndemonstrated effectiveness in reducing sex offender recidivism and increasing\npublic safety; and\n(v) investigation and approval of such placement by the State Division of\n\nParole. (2)\n\nWhen one or\nmore of the factors set forth in paragraph (1) of this subdivision are not\nrelevant or not practicable in determining a placement for such individual, within the timeframe necessary to meet the immediate need for shelter, the\nlocal social services officials shall place the individual in the most\nappropriate available shelter.
