Thereafter, at 180-day intervals or such other time period as determined by the\n\nReview Committee, the Review Committee shall designate additional participating\nagencies, the rules and paperwork requirements of which shall be examined\npursuant to this Order. Such designations shall continue until the review of\nrules and paperwork of all State agencies has been completed. 5. Each agency designated to participate in\nthe Review Program following such designation, shall issue a public invitation\nto comment, published in the State Register by mail to interested parties, and\nthrough other appropriate venues and media which shall invite comment on\nwhether any of the agency's existing regulations are unnecessary, unbalanced, unwise, duplicative or unduly burdensome.

Every designated agency, in conjunction\nwith the Review Committee, shall assess and analyze the responses to the\ninvitation for comment, along with criticism and comment received by the\nagency, or comment available from public sources, within the past three years\nabout any of the agency's significant current rules and paperwork requirements. Each designated agency thereafter shall select those regulations (not less than\ntwo or more than 10 in total) that have generated the most widespread or\nsubstantive criticism and opposition. 7. The agency, in conjunction with the Review\n\nCommittee, shall decide upon such steps as may be helpful for further analysis, including solicitation of additional comment (including comments from\nsupporters of the regulation at issue), statistical analyses, surveys, and\ncomparisons with other states. 8. The agency shall analyze and report on such regulations, in a form designated\nby the Review Committee, and which shall be submitted by agencies to the Review\n\nCommittee within 45 days after selection of regulations in accordance with\nparagraph 6.
