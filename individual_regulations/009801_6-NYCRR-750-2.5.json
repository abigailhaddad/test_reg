  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 750-2.5 - Routine monitoring, recording, and reporting\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe permittee shall comply with all\nrecording, reporting, monitoring and sampling requirements specified in the\npermit. (2)\n\nSamples and\nmeasurements taken to meet the monitoring requirements specified in a SPDES\npermit shall be representative of the quantity and character of the monitored\ndischarges. Unless otherwise specified in the permit or directed by the\nregional water engineer in writing, the following shall apply to such sample\ncollection: (i) A representative sample is one\nthat adequately reflects the actual condition of the wastewater. The most\nrepresentative sample will be drawn from a point that represents the wastewater\ndischarged. When appropriate, that point should be at a depth where the flow is\nturbulent and well-mixed and the likelihood of solids settling is\nminimal. (ii)\n\nFor all parameters\nexcept volatile organics and oil and grease, composite samples required by a\nSPDES permit shall be composed of a minimum of eight grab samples, collected\nover the specified collection period, either at a constant sample volume for a\nconstant flow interval or at a flow-proportioned sample volume for a constant\ntime interval. Where continuous flow monitoring equipment is not available or\nwhere effluent flows do not vary more than 10 percent over the course of\ncomposite sample collection, composite samples may be composed of equal size\ngrab samples taken at equal time intervals. (iii)\n\nFor volatile organics and oil and\ngrease, composite samples required by a SPDES permit shall be collected as\nindividual aliquots that must be combined in the laboratory for analysis. At\nleast four (rather than eight) aliquots or grab samples should be collected\nover the specified collection period, either at a constant sample volume for a\nconstant flow interval or at a flow-proportioned sample volume for a constant\ntime interval. Where flow monitoring equipment is not available or where\neffluent flows do not vary more than 10 percent over the course of composite\nsample collection, composite samples may be composed of equal size grab samples\ntaken at equal time intervals. (iv)\n\nGrab sample\nmeans a single sample, taken over a period of time\nnot exceeding 15 minutes. (v) Sample collection shall be scheduled to be representative of the normal\ndischarge. Representative sample collection schedules include schedules set at\nleast one month prior to when the samples are to be collected. A true and\naccurate copy of the schedule shall be kept readily available for reference at\nthe wastewater treatment facility and shall be provided to the department upon\nrequest. The schedule may only be changed for good cause including but not\nlimited to sampling equipment failure and unanticipated process shutdown. Samples may be scheduled as follows: (a) randomly; (b) day of the week or\nmonth, provided that scheduling by day of week or month does not persistently\ncoincide with or exclude recurrent discharges; (c) for storm water: based on availability of\na suitable storm water event; and\n(d) any other method of scheduling that is\nrepresentative and acceptable to the regional water engineer. (3)\n\nAccessible sampling\nlocations must be provided and maintained by the permittee. New sampling\nlocations shall be provided by the permittee if existing locations are deemed\nunsuitable by the department. (4)\n\nUnless otherwise specified in the permit or directed by the regional water\nengineer, actual measured values of all positive analytical results obtained\nabove the method detection limit (MDL) for all monitored parameters shall be\nrecorded and reported, as required by the permit. (5)\n\nFor instrumentation that is not used by a\ncertified laboratory, but which is used to measure discharges to the\nenvironment as specified in a SPDES permit, the permittee shall periodically\ncalibrate and perform maintenance procedures to ensure accuracy of\nmeasurements. Verification of maintenance shall be logged into the record\nbook(s) of the facility. The permittee shall notify the department's regional\noffice in the discharge monitoring report if any required instrumentation\nbecomes inoperable. In addition, the permittee shall verify the accuracy of its\nmeasuring equipment to the department's regional office or its designated field\noffice upon request. (6)\n\nNo person\nshall falsify, tamper with, or knowingly render inaccurate any monitoring\ndevice or method required to be maintained under the permit. (b) Signatories and\ncertification. (1)\n\nAll SPDES\napplications and reports required by a SPDES permit shall be signed as provided\nin\n40\nCFR\n122.22\n(see section 750-1.25 of this\n\nPart) except that, in lieu of a signature, the department may permit the use of\na unique identifier assigning responsibility for the veracity of the\ninformation contained in an application to the same person or persons that\nwould otherwise be required to sign the application in this section. Such a\ndocument with a unique identifier shall be considered a signed document with a\ncertifying signature and a written instrument that could subject the signatory\nto liability under the New York State Penal Law for officers concerning perjury\nand false written statements pursuant to articles 175 and 210 of said\nlaw. (2)\n\nNo person shall knowingly\nmake any material false statement, representation, or certification in any\napplication, record, report, plan, or other document filed or required to be\nmaintained under this permit, including monitoring reports or reports of\ncompliance or noncompliance. Any person who violates this subsection shall be\nliable for violation of ECL section 71-1933 and subject to a fine and/or\nimprisonment thereunder. (3)\n\nAll\napplications, reports, or notifications required or authorized to be made or\nfiled by this article or ECL article 17, title 7 or 8, or by the provisions or\nconditions of any permit issued pursuant thereto, by or on behalf of a\npermittee, applicant for a permit or person subject to the requirement of a\npermit shall be sworn to in respect to all statements of fact therein or shall\nbear an executed statement as provided in section 210.45 of the New York State\n\nPenal Law to the effect that false statements made therein are made under\npenalty of perjury. (c) Recording of monitoring activities and results. (1)\n\nThe permittee shall retain records of all\nmonitoring information, including all calibration and maintenance records and\nall original strip chart recordings for continuous monitoring instrumentation, copies of all reports required by a SPDES permit, and records of all data used\nto complete the application for the permit, for a period of at least five years\nfrom the date of the sample, measurement, report or application. This period\nmaybe extended by written request of the department, provided that the\nextension is necessary to implement the provisions of this Part or ECL and that\nthe reason or reasons for the extension are provided in the request. (2)\n\nRecords of monitoring information shall\ninclude: (i) the date, exact place, and time\nof sampling or measurements; (ii)\nthe individual(s) who performed the sampling or measurements; (iii)\nthe date(s) analyses were\nperformed; (iv)\nthe individual(s)\nwho performed the analyses; (v) the\nanalytical techniques or methods used; (vi)\nthe results of such analyses; and\n(vii)\nquality assurance/quality\ncontrol documentation. (3)\n\nWhen records are stored electronically, the records must be preserved in a manner that reasonably assures their\nintegrity and are acceptable to the department. Such records must also be in a\nformat which is accessible to the department. (4)\n\nThe permittee shall make available to the\ndepartment for inspection and copying or furnish to the department within 25\nbusiness days of receipt of a department request for such information, any\ninformation retained in accordance with this subdivision. (d) Test and analytical\nprocedures. (1)\n\nMonitoring and analysis\nconducted in accordance with an issued SPDES permit must be conducted using\ntest procedures promulgated, pursuant to 40 CFR part\n136\n(Test Procedures - see\nsection 750-1.25 of this Part), except: (i) when the permit specifies an alternative procedure; or\n(ii)\nwhen the permittee applies to the\ndepartment and the department approves an alternative test method in accordance\nwith applicable law and regulation. (2)\n\nAny laboratory test or sample analysis\nrequired by this permit for which the State Commissioner of Health issues\ncertificates of approval pursuant to section\n502\nof the\n\nPublic Health Law shall be conducted by a laboratory that has been issued a\ncertificate of approval. (3)\n\nApplication for approval of alternative test procedures shall be made to the\ndepartment's regional permit administrator, and shall contain: (i) the name and address of the applicant or\nthe responsible person making the discharge, the DEC permit number and\napplicable SPDES identification number of the existing or pending permit, name\nof the permit issuing agency, name and telephone number of applicant's contact\nperson; (ii)\nthe names of the\npollutants or parameters for which an alternate testing procedure is being\nrequested, and the monitoring location(s) at which each testing procedure will\nbe utilized; (iii)\njustification\nfor using test procedures, other than those approved in subdivision (a) of this\nsection; and\n(iv)\na detailed\ndescription of the alternate procedure in accordance with requirements set\nforth in 40 CFR part\n136\n(see section 750-1.25 of this Part) or other\napplicable law and regulation. (e) Reporting of monitoring results\nand other information. (1)\n\nThe\npermittee shall submit the results of any wastewater or ambient monitoring\nresults required by the permit at the end of each month, unless otherwise\nspecified by the department. Such reports shall be made on the reporting forms\nsupplied to the permittee by the department, in a format acceptable to the\ndepartment, or by the electronic transfer of data as approved by the\ndepartment. Electronic submissions shall conform to the format, standards and\nother conditions specified by the department. The regional water engineer may\nalso require the submittal of such other information as is necessary to\ndetermine the validity of monitoring results submitted in accordance with\npermit requirements. In no event shall reports on discharges to surface waters\nrequired by this subdivision be submitted at a frequency of less than once per\nyear. (2)\n\nFor any parameter, analytical results shall be reported to the same number of significant digits\nas the permit limits or action level for that parameter. If the permit does not\nclarify the number of significant digits to which results should be reported, the results must be reported to two significant digits, except in cases of\neffluent TSS or BOD where single digit effluents are achieved. In these cases\nsingle digits may be reported. (3)\n\nOn each discharge monitoring report, the permittee shall include the ELAP\nidentification number or numbers for the certified laboratory or laboratories\nwho performed the analyses, the results of which, are summarized on that\ndischarge monitoring report. Where the monitoring is not performed under ELAP, the permittee shall provide the MDL for the parameter monitored. (4)\n\nIf the permittee monitors any pollutant\nat the discharge or monitoring point or points described in the permit or if\nthe permittee monitors the waters of the State to which the permittee\ndischarges more frequently than required by the permit and, where the analysis\nfor that monitoring is performed by a certified laboratory or where such\nanalysis is not required to be performed by a certified laboratory, such\nmonitoring results shall be appended to the discharge monitoring report for the\nperiod during which the monitoring was performed.
