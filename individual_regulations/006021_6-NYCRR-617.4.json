  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 § 617.4 - Type I actions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The purpose of the list of Type I actions in this section is to identify, for\nagencies, project sponsors and the public, those actions and projects that are\nmore likely to require the preparation of an EIS than Unlisted actions. All\nagencies are subject to this Type I list. (1)\n\nThis Type I list is not exhaustive of those actions that an agency determines\nmay have a significant adverse impact on the environment and requires the\npreparation of an EIS. However, the fact that an action or project has been\nlisted as a Type I action carries with it the presumption that it is likely to\nhave a significant adverse impact on the environment and may require an EIS. For all individual actions which are Type I or Unlisted, the determination of\nsignificance must be made by comparing the impacts which may be reasonably\nexpected to result from the proposed action with the criteria listed in section\n617.7\n(c) of this Part. (2)\n\nAgencies may\nadopt their own lists of additional Type I actions, may adjust the thresholds\nto make them more inclusive, and may continue to use previously adopted lists\nof Type I actions to complement those contained in this section. Designation of\na Type I action by one involved agency requires coordinated review by all\ninvolved agencies. An agency may not designate as Type I any action identified\nas Type II in section\n617.5\nof this\n\nPart. (b) The following\nactions are Type I if they are to be directly undertaken, funded or approved by\nan agency: (1)\nthe adoption of a\nmunicipality's land use plan, the adoption by any agency of a comprehensive\nresource management plan or the initial adoption of a municipality's\ncomprehensive zoning regulations; (2)\nthe adoption of changes in the allowable\nuses within any zoning district, affecting 25 or more acres of the\ndistrict; (3)\nthe granting of a\nzoning change, at the request of an applicant, for an action that meets or\nexceeds one or more of the thresholds given elsewhere in this list; (4)\nthe acquisition, sale, lease, annexation\nor other transfer of 100 or more contiguous acres of land by a state or local\nagency; (5)\nconstruction of new\nresidential units that meet or exceed the following thresholds: (i) 10 units in municipalities that have not\nadopted zoning or subdivision regulations; (ii)\n50 units not to be connected (at the\ncommencement of habitation) to existing community or public water and sewerage\nsystems including sewage treatment works; (iii)\nin a city, town or village having a\npopulation of 150,000 persons or less, 200 units to be connected (at the\ncommencement of habitation) to existing community or public water and sewerage\nsystems including sewage treatment works; (iv)\nin a city, town or village having a\npopulation of greater than 150,000 persons but less than 1,000,000 persons, 500\nunits to be connected (at the commencement of habitation) to existing community\nor public water and sewerage systems including sewage treatment works; or\n(v) in a city or town having a\npopulation of 1,000,000 or more persons, 1000 units to be connected (at the\ncommencement of habitation) to existing community or public water and sewerage\nsystems including sewage treatment works; (6)\nactivities, other than the construction\nof residential facilities, that meet or exceed any of the following thresholds; or the expansion of existing nonresidential facilities by more than 50 percent\nof any of the following thresholds: (i) a\nproject or action that involves the physical alteration of 10 acres; (ii)\na project or action that would use\nground or surface water in excess of 2,000,000 gallons per day; (iii)\nparking for 500 vehicles in a city, town or village having a population of 150,000 persons or less; (iv)\nparking for 1,000 vehicles in a city, town or village having a population of more than 150,000 persons; (v) in a city, town or village having a\npopulation of 150,000 persons or less, a facility with more than 100,000 square\nfeet of gross floor area; (vi)\nin a\ncity, town or village having a population of more than 150,000 persons, a\nfacility with more than 240,000 square feet of gross floor area; (7)\nany structure exceeding 100\nfeet above original ground level in a locality without any zoning regulation\npertaining to height; (8)\nany\n\nUnlisted action that includes a nonagricultural use occurring wholly or\npartially within an agricultural district (certified pursuant to Agriculture\nand Markets Law, article 25-AA, sections 303 and 304) and exceeds 25 percent of\nany threshold established in this section; (9)\nany Unlisted action (unless the action is\ndesigned for the preservation of the facility or site), that exceeds 25 percent\nof any threshold established in this section, occurring wholly or partially\nwithin, or substantially contiguous to, any historic building, structure, facility, site or district or prehistoric site that is listed on the National\n\nRegister of Historic Places (Volume 36 of the Code of Federal Regulations, parts 60 and 63, which is incorporated by reference pursuant to section\n617.17\nof\nthis Part), or that is listed on the State Register of Historic Places or that\nhas been determined by the Commissioner of the Office of Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation to be eligible for listing on the State Register of\n\nHistoric Places pursuant to sections\n14.07\nor\n14.09\nof the Parks, Recreation and\n\nHistoric Preservation Law; (10)\nany\n\nUnlisted action, that exceeds 25 percent of any threshold in this section, occurring wholly or partially within or substantially contiguous to any\npublicly owned or operated parkland, recreation area or designated open space, including any site on the Register of National Natural Landmarks pursuant to  36\nCFR part\n62\n( which is incorporated by reference pursuant to section\n617.17\nof\nthis Part); or\n(11)\nany Unlisted\naction that exceeds a Type I threshold established by an involved agency\npursuant to section\n617.14\nof this Part.
