All persons associated with the university who park on university\nproperty must register their vehicles with the university. Registration\nentitles registrants to park in designated parking lots if a space is\navailable. (2)\n\nWhen to register. Individuals must register their vehicles prior to any vehicle use on campus, after acquisition of a vehicle, on returning to campus or starting employment\nat the university, and must re-register when there is any change, such as\nmoving in or out of a residence hall, change in employment status, etc. (i) Faculty/staff. Incoming faculty or staff\nmembers should register their vehicles on line or at the student\naccounts/parking services office. The times and places of registration are\nannounced by bursar/student accounts/parking services. (ii)\n\nStudents. All resident student permits\nmay be issued for a one year period. Commuter student permits are issued for a\nmulti-year period. All resident student vehicles must be registered annually. The times and places of registration for continuing students and initial\nregistration for qualified students will be announced by the bursar/office of\nstudent accounts/parking services. (3)\n\nPermits. One permit will be issued by\nparking services when vehicles are registered. The permit must be removed if\nassociation with the university is terminated or the vehicle sold. Vehicles are\nconsidered registered only when the issued permit is displayed as required. Any\npermit obtained through misrepresentation or in violation of these motor\nvehicle regulations is void. A registered vehicle must be parked in the\ndesignated lot on campus to which it is assigned. The permit must be displayed\nin such manner to assure that pertinent data is visible, i.e., facing the front of the vehicle. (4)\n\nRegistration revocation. If a registrant is disciplined by revocation of central\ncampus parking privileges or cancellation of campus registration, the\nrevocation applies to any motor vehicle registered in the registrant's name for\non-campus use. The revocation of a campus motor vehicle registration and a loss\nof parking privileges for the balance of the academic year may occur upon a\nfinding that 5 or more campus parking violations have been incurred, irrespective of the payment of fines. See section\n584.4\n(b)(5)(ii)\nof\nthis Part concerning TAB actions. (5)\n\nChange of ownership. A campus parking\npermit is not transferable. A permit registrant may be held liable for any\nsummonses issued involving that permit. (6)\n\nLost/stolen permits. The permit\nregistrant shall immediately report a lost/stolen permit to the parking\nservices office. Recovered lost/stolen permits are null and void and should be\ndestroyed. A replacement fee shall be assessed irrespective of the permit being\nreported \"lost\" or \"stolen.\"\n(7)\n\nAlteration, misuse, or misrepresentation in use of any parking related permit, including handicap permit, is prohibited. Discovery of such violation may\nsubject the individual to ticketing and other sanctions. (b) Parking. (1)\n\nWhere to park. (i) Campus parking zones are limited for use\nby motor vehicles assigned to these areas during restricted hours. Each\noperator must use the assigned area when parking on campus. The permit received\nwhen a motor vehicle is registered indicates the zone available for parking. Each parking zone is identified by signs at the entrance. Parking is not\npermitted in locations not explicitly identified for this purpose, such as\nroads, parking lot aisles, walkways and grass areas. In paved lots, parking is\npermitted only within spaces marked for parking by parallel lines on\npavement. (ii)\n\nParking may be\nrestricted, in designated areas of any parking lot, to limited categories of\nvisitors or persons having business with the university and/or conditioned upon\npayment of a parking fee. (iii)\n\nParking is prohibited between the hours of 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. in the LIRR\ncommuter lot parking lot. (iv)\n\nAccess to parking and enforcement of parking regulations in the Hilton Garden\nlots shall be in accordance with written agreement between the\nparties. (2)\n\nPermitted\nhours. (i) Any special regulations applicable\nto the summer and winter sessions will be announced by the office of the Senior\n\nVice President for Administration. Variations in these regulations designed to\nmeet unusual circumstances may be announced from time to time by the DOPTS or\nuniversity police department. (ii)\n\nParking in faculty/staff lots is restricted to holders of faculty/staff permits\nfrom 7 a.m. to 4 p.m., Monday through Friday. After 4 p.m. and until 7 a.m. any\nregistered car may be parked in these lots, except for faculty/staff lots which\nare designated as 24-hour restricted by signs posted at each lot. Resident\nparking lots are restricted to holders of resident permits from 7 a.m. to 4\np.m., Monday-Friday, except for those resident lots designated as 24-hour\nrestricted by posted sign. There are no restrictions on weekends until 7 a.m. on Mondays. Specially designated reserved spaces are restricted at all times: i.e., spaces for the disabled, service vehicles, State\nvehicles, police vehicles, etc. (iii)\n\nAny special regulations applicable to\nthe hours of operation of a parking lot are posted at the entrance(s) to that\nlot and may not necessarily conform to general campus practices. (3)\n\nImproper parking. (i) The assignment of a parking permit does\nnot guarantee space in the designated zone. The driver is responsible for\nfinding an approved space for the vehicle. If the owner/operator is unable to\nfind a space in a parking lot, he or she may park in a commuter lot (bus\nservice is provided from these lots). (ii)\n\nAll drivers are cautioned that the\nuniversity, having marked approved spaces, does not mark all areas where\nparking is prohibited. Each lot is marked by a sign at the entrance. Any area\nnot so designated is not considered a legitimate parking area. An approved\nspace is designated by parallel lines painted on the pavement. In certain\nunimproved, i.e., unpaved lots are not lined out for parking\npurposes, so that the definition of approved spaces does not apply. Note: Certain unimproved lots are not lined out for parking\npurposes, so that the definition of approved spaces does not apply. (c) Exceptions. (1)\n\nThe regulations\nas written specify who may park in particular parking areas. (2)\n\nMotorists may request an exception from\nthese regulations in particular cases. Requests from motorists must be\npresented to the Senior Vice President for Administration or designee. Documentation must be submitted that is sufficient to help the Senior Vice\n\nPresident for Administration or designee make a clear finding that the\napplication of these regulations will create: (i) a financial hardship due to inability to\nmeet inflexible job schedules; or\n(ii)\na personal hardship related to health or\nsafety, and that the hardship can be reasonably resolved only by an\nexception.
