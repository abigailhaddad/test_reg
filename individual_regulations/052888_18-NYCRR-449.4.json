(3)\n\nIf an\napplicant discloses in the sworn statement furnished in accordance with\nsubparagraph (1)(iv) of this subdivision that he or she has been convicted of a\ncrime, the authorized agency operating the supervised setting program must\ndetermine, in accordance with guidelines developed and disseminated by OCFS, whether to hire the applicant or to use the volunteer or consultant. If the\nauthorized agency determines it will hire the applicant or use the applicant as\na volunteer or consultant, the authorized agency must maintain a written\nrecord, as part of the application file or employment or other personnel record\nof such person, of the reason(s) why such person was determined to be\nappropriate and acceptable as an employee, volunteer or consultant. (4)\n\nInquiries to the Statewide Central\n\nRegister of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. (i) With regard to any person who is actively being considered for employment, or\nto any individual or any person who is employed by an individual, corporation, partnership or association which provides goods or services to the authorized\nagency, the authorized agency operating the supervised setting program must\ninquire of OCFS whether any such person is the subject of an indicated report\nof child abuse or maltreatment on file with the Statewide Central Register of\n\nChild Abuse and Maltreatment. In addition, the authorized agency may inquire\nwhether any current employee or any person who is being considered for use as a\nvolunteer or for hiring as a consultant with youth who are being cared for by\nthe supervised setting program is the subject of an indicated report of child\nabuse or maltreatment on file with the Statewide Central Register of Child\n\nAbuse and Maltreatment. An inquiry regarding any current employee may be made\nonly once in any sixmonth period. (ii)\n\nPrior to making an inquiry pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the authorized agency must notify, in the\nform prescribed by OCFS, the person who will be the subject of an inquiry that\nthe inquiry will be made to determine whether such person is the subject of an\nindicated report of child abuse or maltreatment on file with the Statewide\n\nCentral Register of Child Abuse and Maltreatment. (iii)\n\nExcept as set forth in clause\n(\na\n) of this subparagraph, an authorized agency may not permit\na person hired by the authorized agency or a person who is employed by an\nindividual, corporation, partnership or association which provides goods or\nservices to the authorized agency to have contact with youth in the care of the\nsupervised independent living program prior to obtaining the result of the\ninquiry required by this subdivision. (a) An\nemployee of an authorized agency or an employee of a provider of goods and\nservices to the authorized agency may have contact with youth cared for by the\nsupervised independent living program prior to the receipt by the authorized\nagency of the result of the inquiry required by this subdivision only where\nsuch employee is visually observed or audibly monitored by an existing staff\nmember of the authorized agency. Such employee must be in the physical presence\nof an existing staff member for whom: (1)\nthe\nresult of an inquiry required by section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law has been received by the authorized agency and the\nauthorized agency hired the existing staff member with knowledge of the result\nof the inquiry; or\n(2)\nan inquiry\nwas not made because such staff member was hired before the effective date of\nsection\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law. (iv)\n\nWhen the person who is the subject of\nthe inquiry is an applicant for employment, OCFS will charge a five-dollar fee\nwhen it conducts a search of its records within the Statewide Central Register\nof Child Abuse and Maltreatment to determine whether such applicant is the\nsubject of an indicated report. (a) The\nrequired fee must either accompany the inquiry form submitted to OCFS or, for\nan inquiry submitted by a social services district, the district may elect to\nhave the fee subtracted from its claims for reimbursement submitted pursuant to\nsection\n601.1\nof this Title. (b) Fees must be paid by authorized agency\nbusiness check, certified check, postal or bank money order, teller's check or\ncashier's check made payable to \"New York State Office of Children and Family\n\nServices\". Personal checks and cash are not acceptable forms of\npayment. (v) If the\napplicant, employee or other person about whom the authorized agency has made\nan inquiry is found to be the subject of an indicated report of child abuse or\nmaltreatment, the authorized agency must determine, on the basis of information\nit has available and in accordance with guidelines developed and disseminated\nby OCFS, whether to hire, retain or use the person as an employee, volunteer or\nconsultant, or to permit the person providing goods or services to have access\nto youth being cared for by the authorized agency. Whenever such person is\nhired, retained, used or given access to youth, the authorized agency must\nmaintain a written record, as part of the application file or employment or\nother personnel record of such person, of the specific reason(s) why such\nperson was determined to be appropriate and acceptable as an employee, volunteer, consultant, or provider of goods or services with access to youth\nbeing cared for by the supervised setting program. (vi)\n\nIf the authorized agency denies\nemployment or makes a decision not to retain an employee, not to use a\nvolunteer, not to hire a consultant, or not to permit a person providing goods\nor services to have access to youth being cared for by the supervised setting\nprogram, the authorized agency must provide a written statement to the\napplicant, employee, volunteer or consultant or other person indicating whether\nthe denial or decision was based in whole or in part on the existence of the\nindicated report and, if so, reasons for the denial or decision. If the denial\nor decision was based in whole or in part on such indicated report, the\nstatement must also include written notification, in the form prescribed by\nOCFS to the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person that: (a) he or she has the right, pursuant to\nsection\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law, to request a hearing before OCFS regarding the record\nmaintained by the Statewide Central Register of Child Abuse and\n\nMaltreatment; (b) the request for\nsuch a hearing must be made within 90 days of the receipt of the written notice\nindicating that the denial or decision was based on the existence of the\nindicated report; and\n(c) the sole\nissue at any such hearing will be whether the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person has been shown by a fair preponderance of the\nevidence to have committed the act or acts of child abuse or maltreatment\ngiving rise to the indicated report. (vii)\n\nIf in a hearing held pursuant to a\nrequest made in accordance with subparagraph (vi) of this paragraph and section\n424-a\nof\nthe Social Services Law a decision issued by OCFS finds that there was a\nfailure to show by a fair preponderance of the evidence that the applicant, employee, volunteer, consultant or other person committed the act or acts upon\nwhich the indicated report is based, OCFS will notify the authorized agency\nwhich made the inquiry that, pursuant to the hearing decision, the authorized\nagency's decision to deny the application, discharge the employee, not to use\nthe volunteer or consultant, or not to permit the person providing goods or\nservices to have access to youth being cared for by the authorized agency\nshould be reconsidered. Upon receiving such notification from OCFS, the\nauthorized agency should review its denial or other decision without\nconsidering the indicated report. (5)\n\nReview of applicants.
