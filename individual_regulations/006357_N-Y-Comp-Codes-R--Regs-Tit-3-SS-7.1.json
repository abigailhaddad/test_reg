  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 7.1 - General statement\n\nState Regulations\n\nFrom time to time, documents executed in foreign countries\nmust be submitted to the Banking Department. Such documents include\napplications by a foreign banking corporation for a license to open a branch or\nagency in New York, appointment of New York branch manager as well as\ncertifications as to paid-in-capital stock, surplus fund and undivided profit. Such requirements are found, for example, in article V of the New York State\n\nBanking Law and Supervisory Procedure CB 104. On October 15, 1981, the United States became a party to\nthe Hague Convention Abolishing the Requirement of Legalization for Foreign\n\nPublic Documents. The convention simplified the procedure for having a foreign\ndocument legalized. Each country which is a party to the convention designates\nthe authority or authorities who may certify public documents. A certification, also known as an apostille, is affixed to the document by the competent local\nauthority of the foreign country where the document originated. The form of the\napostille is set forth in section\n7.2\nof this supervisory policy in\nthe same form as set forth in the convention. Further legalization of documents\nwill not be required for submission to the New York State Banking Department in\nthe case of documents originating in countires which are parties to the\nconvention. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3\n§\n7.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
