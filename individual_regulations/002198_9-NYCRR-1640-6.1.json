  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1640-6.1 - Federal taxes\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of\n\nInternal Revenue, in opinions obtained by the division and various authorities, regards local housing authorities organized under the New York State Public\n\nHousing Law as agencies of the State of New York, and, as such, entitled to\nenjoy the same exemption from Federal taxes as the State itself and local\npolitical subdivisions of the State, such as municipalities. The actual\napplication of the exemption provisions of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code with\nrespect to the various Federal taxes, is somewhat technical. In some cases, the\nexemption of the local agency from the tax is automatic; in other cases, the\nlocal agency must take certain steps and follow certain procedures in order to\nestablish its right to the exemption. A check list of the classes of Federal\ntaxes with which a local agency may ordinarily be concerned follows. Each will\nbe discussed, in turn, in the following subdivisions of this section. (2)\n\nCheck list of Federal taxes. (i) Income taxes. (ii)\n\nEmployment taxes. (iii)\n\nStamp and transfer taxes on documents\nand other instruments. (iv)\n\nTax on\nsafe deposit box rentals. (v) Retailers' excise taxes. (vi)\n\nManufacturers' excise taxes. (vii)\n\nTransportation and communication taxes. (b) Income taxes. Under subdivision (a) of section\n115\nof the Internal Revenue Code, the income\nof local agencies is exempt from Federal income taxes. The exemption is\nautomatic and local agencies are not required to establish their exempt\ncharacter with the Commissioner of Internal Revenue or file annual information\nreturns as are organizations claiming exemption under section 501 of the code. The income of officers and employees of a local agency is, however, subject to\nincome tax and local agencies must comply with the requirements of the Internal\n\nRevenue Code with respect to withholding the income tax on salaries and wages\npaid by them, the filing of returns in connection therewith, etc. Interest on\nobligations issued by a local agency, such as temporary loan notes, is exempt\nfrom income tax. (c) Employment taxes. (1)\n\nFederal\nunemployment insurance taxes. Local agencies are exempt from these\ntaxes. (2)\n\nSocial security. Local\nauthority employees who are not eligible to join a public retirement system may\nbe covered by social security, effective October 1, 1953. Recent Federal\nlegislation, ratified by State legislation in 1957, has been extended to\nemployees who are members, or eligible to be members of a public retirement\nsystem. Participation is optional for a local authority. The coverage is also\noptional for those who are in the employment of the authority at the time the\nauthority elects to be covered, but mandatory for those who become employees\nafter the effective date of coverage. The coverage of a local authority differs\nfrom that of a private employer in two respects: (i) The local authority files its periodic\nreturns with and makes its remittances to the New York State Social Security\n\nAgency, Department of Audit and Control, Governor Alfred E. Smith State Office\n\nBuilding, Albany 1, New York. Private employers report and pay the tax direct\nto the Federal District Director of Internal Revenue. (ii)\n\nThe local authority is charged with its\npro rata share of the State's annual cost of administering the social\nsecurity's contribution fund. This charge is in addition to the employer's\ncontribution matching the employee's deduction. Private employees do not pay\nthis charge. Full details as to procedure to be followed in applying\nfor social security coverage, forms, instructions, resolutions, proposed\nagreements, etc., may be obtained from the New York State Social Security\n\nAgency, with whom the authority should correspond direct. (3)\n\nWithholding taxes. Local agencies are subject to the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code\nrequiring every employer making payment of wages to deduct and withhold income\ntaxes upon such wages. Wages, as defined in the code, include\nthe fair value of quarters furnished to employees by the employer except where\nsuch arrangements are made for the convenience of the employer. Local agencies\nshould apply this test to apartments occupied by resident managers, superintendents or other employees. Ordinarily, the division will not approve\nthe occupancy of apartments by local agency employers unless such occupancy is\nfor the convenience of the local agency in operating the project. Wages for\ncasual labor employed by a local agency would appear to be subject to\nwithholding inasmuch as such labor would, ipso facto, be \"in\nthe course of the employer's trade or business\". To comply with the\nrequirements of the code, local agencies should maintain the following records\nand make the following reports: (i) Form W-4, Withholding Exemption Certificate. The local agency\nshould obtain this certificate from every person in its employ. (ii)\n\nEmployee's individual payroll\nrecord. This record, which shows the wages paid and the amounts\nwithheld for income taxes, on a current and cumulative basis, should be\nmaintained for each employee. Stock forms are available for this\npurpose. (iii)\n\nForm W-1, Quarterly Return of Withholdings. Employers are required to file\nreturns with the District Director of Internal Revenue on form W-1 on or before\nthe last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter-that is\non or before April 30, July 31, October 31 and January 31, accompanied by a\nremittance for the taxes withheld. The attention of local agencies is called to\nthe fact that the regulations state that employers who withhold more than $100\nduring a month are under a \"duty\" to pay the amounts to an authorized\ndepositary, such as a bank insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance\n\nCorporation, within 15 days after the close of the calendar month. In such\nevent, the depositary receipts will be attached to form W-1. (iv)\n\nForm W-2, Withholding\n\nStatement. The form shows the wages paid during the calendar year and\nthe amount of tax withheld on such wages and must be furnished to each employee\non or before January 31 of the succeeding year or not later than 30 days\nfollowing the day on which the last payment of wages is made, if the employment\nis terminated during the year. One copy of form W-2, identified as form W-2a, is sent to the director with the last quarterly return (form W-1) for the year, the local agency retaining a copy (form W-2b) for its records. With the exception of the individual payroll records, which is a stock form obtainable at most stationers, supplies of the above\nforms are obtained from the office of the District Director of Internal\n\nRevenue. The director will also furnish tables showing the rates of tax to be\nwithheld. While it does not appear that employees of local agencies, who are\nnot covered by social security, are required to obtain social security\nidentification numbers, it is recommended that they do so. Applications may be\nobtained at the local post office. Local agencies, who have employees covered\nby social security are required to obtain employers' identification\nnumbers. (d) Stamp and transfer taxes. Issue and transfer taxes, payable by means of adhesive\nstamps affixed to the related documents or instruments, do not apply to bonds, notes or other instruments issued by the United States, by any State, territory, the District of Columbia or any local subdivision of a State, territory, the District of Columbia or any local subdivision of a State. Temporary loan notes and certificates of indebtedness issued by a local agency\n(see Part 1643, Financing) are therefore exempt from stamp taxes upon issue or\ntransfer thereof. Inasmuch as, in practice, excess local agency funds will\nordinarily be invested in U.S. government obligations (see Part 1645, Investments), no stamp tax will be payable upon the acquisition or disposition\nof such investments by the local agency. Deeds conveying real estate by a local\nagency are subject to the stamp tax imposed upon the seller, by the Federal\ngovernment at the rate of: (1)\n\nNo tax\non the first $100. (2)\n\nFifty-five\ncents on the next $400. (3)\n\nFifty-five cents on each additional $500 or fraction. In calculating the amount of stamps which must be\naffixed to a deed of conveyance, the tax is computed upon the full\nconsideration for transfer less all encumbrances which rest on the property\nbefore the sale and are not removed by the sale. If, however, property is\nconveyed to a municipality as a gift or to \"promote public welfare\", the\nconveyance is specifically exempt by the Revenue\n\nAct. (e) Tax\non safe deposit box rentals. Section 4286 of the Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax\nof 10 per cent of the amount collected for the use of any safe deposit box. While the code itself is silent as to exemptions, local agencies would appear\nto be exempt from the tax inasmuch as, in the language of the code, the tax is\nimposed on \"the person paying for the use of the safe deposit\nbox\". (f) Retailers'\nexcise taxes. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax, at the rate of\n10 per cent of the retail sales price, on the following items: (1)\n\nJewelry, watches, clocks, binoculars. (2)\n\nFurs and fur\narticles. (3)\n\nToilet preparations\nand cosmetics. (4)\n\nLuggage-trunks, traveling bags, valises, suitcases, briefcases, wallets, billfolds, etc. The tax is ordinarily shown on the retailers' or other\nsupplier's invoice as a separate item. Local agencies are exempt from the\n\nFederal retailers' excise tax. To obtain the exemption, the local agency, at\nthe time of the purchase of any of the articles subject to the tax, must supply\nan exemption certificate executed by a duly authorized officer to the retailer\nor other supplier. The exemption certificate is not furnished by the Bureau of\n\nInternal Revenue, but is prepared by the local agency and may be printed, mimeographed or typed on the back of the purchase order or on separate sheets\nattached to the purchase order or delivered separately. If it is impracticable\nto furnish a separate exemption certificate for each order, a certificate\ncovering all orders between given dates (the period not to exceed one month)\nwill be acceptable. A specimen exemption certificate is shown as Exhibit 1 of\n\nAppendix S-6. (g) Manufacturers' excise tax. (1)\n\nThe Internal Revenue Code imposes excise taxes of varying amounts on\nmanufacturers' sales of an extensive variety of articles. These taxes are paid\nby the manufacturer at the time of the manufacturers' sale and are, in many\ncases, based on the manufacturers' sales price. Local agencies are exempt from\npayment of manufacturers' excise taxes. To obtain the exemption, local agencies\nat or prior to the time of sale, should advise the seller of the tax exempt\ncharacter of the sale and must furnish him with an exemption certificate, executed by a duly authorized officer of the agency. If the sale is from a\nmerchant or dealer, the certificate will be delivered, in turn, to the\nmanufacturer and will enable him to obtain a refund of the tax he has paid. The\nexemption certificates are not supplied by the Bureau of Internal Revenue but\nare prepared by the local agency and may be printed, mimeographed or typed on\nthe back of the purchase order or delivered separately. A specimen exemption\ncertificate is shown as Exhibit 2 of Appendix S-6. If it is impracticable to\nfurnish a separate exemption certificate for each order, a certificate covering\nall orders between given dates (the period not to exceed one month) will be\nacceptable. (2)\n\nQuotations of\nprices on articles subject to manufacturers' excise taxes will not ordinarily\nshow the excise tax as a separate item, as both manufacturers and dealers are\nunderstandably reluctant to disclose manufacturers' sales prices to the general\npublic. Local agencies should, however, require invoices to show the\nmanufacturer's price as well as the dealer's so that it can be clearly\nestablished that the local agency is not receiving an exemption from the tax\nbut also that the exemption is for the full amount of the tax. A list of\narticles subject to manufacturers' excise taxes and the rates of tax follow: Tires, made wholly or in part of\nrubber, natural or synthetic, and purchased for replacement. The tax is based\non total weight of metal rims or rim bases and does not apply to tires\nfurnished as part of the original equipment of autos, trucks, tractors\netc. 8 cents per pound\n\nInner Tubes, made wholly or in part\nof rubber, natural or synthetic, and purchased for replacement. The tax does\nnot apply to tubes furnished as part of the original equipment of autos, trucks, tractors etc. 9 cents per pound\n\nTrucks and Buses\n10 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nPassenger Automobiles\n7 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nAutomobile Parts and\n\nAccessories\n5 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nTires, inner tubes and automobile radios are not\nincluded in this classification, being taxed at other rates. The tax is on\nparts and accessories sold separately. Radios, Phonographs, Records, Musical\n\nInstruments and Radio and Phonograph Parts such as Tubes\n10 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nMechanical Refrigerators-Household\n\nType\n5 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nAir Conditioning Units\n10 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nElectric, Gas and Oil\n\nAppliances\n5 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nThe tax applies to the following appliances: electric fans and air circulators; electric, gas, or oil water heaters; electric flat irons, electric air heaters (not including furnaces); electric\nimmersion heaters; electric heating pads and blankets; electric, gas, or oil\nappliances of the type used for cooking, warming or keeping food or beverages\nfor consumption on the premises; electric mixers, whippers and juicers.

Electric Light Bulbs and Tubes\n10 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nFirearms, Shells and\n\nCartridges\n11 per cent of manufacturer's sales price\n\nMatches, except fancy wooden or\ndecorated\n2 cents per thousand\n\nMatches, fancy wooden or\ndecorated\n5 1/2 cents per thousand\n\nGasoline and Diesel Fuel\n3 cents per gallon\n\nLubricating Oils, but not including\ngrease\n6 cents per gallon\n(h) Transportation and communication\ntaxes. (1)\n\nTax on\ntelegraph, telephone, radio, and cable facilities. Local agencies are\nexempt from Federal taxes on telephone and telegraph including radiotelephone\nand cable services, as follows: Long distance telephone or radiotelephone message\nor conversation for which the charge for each message is more than 24\ncents. 10 per cent\n\nTelegraph, cable or radio dispatches or\nmessages\n(i) Domestic\n10 per cent\n(ii) International\n10 per cent\n\nLeased wire, teletype or talking circuit special\nservice\n10 per cent\n\nWire and equipment service, including burglar or\nfire alarm service\n8 per cent\n\nLocal telephone service\n10 per cent\n\nNo exemption certificate is necessary when payment for\nthese services is made directly to the companies furnishing same. The local\nauthority need only indicate on the invoice or contract that it is a political\nsubdivision of the State and entitled to the exemption. (2)\n\nTax on transportation of persons. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax of 10 per cent\non the amount paid for the transportation of persons by rail, motor vehicle, water, or air. The tax does not apply to fares which do not exceed 35 cents. Members of a local agency and officers or employees thereof are exempt from\nthis tax when traveling on official business in connection with the affairs of\nthe local agency. To obtain exemption from this tax, an exemption certificate\nshould be presented to the carrier at the time the ticket is purchased. The\nexemption certificate is on Treasury Department form AC856, copies of which may\nbe obtained from the District Director of Internal Revenue, travel agencies and\nticket agencies. Form AC856 is shown as Exhibit 3 of Appendix\nS-6. (3)\n\nTax on\ntransportation of property. The Internal Revenue Code imposes a tax of three per\ncent upon the amount paid for the transportation of property, other than coal, by rail, motor vehicle, water, or air. The tax on the transportation of coal is\nat the rate of four cents per short ton of 2000 pounds. Local agencies are\nexempt from this tax, which is ordinarily shown as an addition to the other\ncharges. However, to obtain the benefits of the exemption, the shipping papers\nmust clearly show that the shipment is consigned to the local agency, as the\nexemption does not apply to shipments consigned to a dealer or distributor, even though such dealer or distributor subsequently sells or delivers the\nshipment to a local agency. Where the purchase is made through a dealer or\ndistributor, local agencies may obtain the exemption by instructing the dealer\nto have the shipment consigned to the local agency or to the local agency in\ncare of the dealer. The carrier is authorized to accept shipping papers on\nwhich the consignor or consignee is a local authority as proof that the\nshipment is exempt from tax. No exemption certificate is required. The effect\nof such instructions is to transfer title with the attendant risks and\nliabilities, to the local agency, rather than to the dealer. Local agencies\nshould give some consideration to this factor before issuing such\ninstructions. (i) Refunds of Federal taxes. The payment of Federal taxes improperly made by local\nagencies will be regarded as an ineligible expenditure by the division. Procedure in applying for refunds of Federal taxes varies with the particular\ntax. Generally speaking, the Director of Internal Revenue will consider a claim\nfor refund only from the person who has actually paid the tax to him and filed\nthe return for the tax in question. For example, claims for refund of\nmanufacturers' excise taxes must be made by the manufacturer, the local agency\nmerely furnishing the manufacturer with the exemption certificate and, if\nrequired, other supporting evidence. Claims for refunds of Federal taxes paid\nby the local agency directly to the Director of Internal Revenue are filed with\nthe director to whom the tax was paid on Treasury Department form 843 and\nshould be made before the time within which such claims may be legally filed\nexpires. Supplies of these forms may be obtained from the office of the local\n\nDirector of Internal Revenue. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
