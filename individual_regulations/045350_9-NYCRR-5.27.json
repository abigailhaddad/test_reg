Tit. 9 § 5.27 - Executive order no. 27: requiring the attorney general to supersede the district attorney of bronx county with respect to the murder of police officer kevin gillespie\n\nState Regulations\nTO: THE HONORABLE DENNIS C. VACCO\nTHE ATTORNEY GENERAL OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\nSTATE CAPITOL\nALBANY, NEW YORK 12224\nWHEREAS, article 4, section 3 of the Constitution of the\n\nState of New York obliges the Governor of the State of New York to take care\nthat the laws are faithfully executed, and I have solemnly sworn pursuant to\narticle 13, section 1 of the Constitution to support the Constitution and\nfaithfully discharge the duties of my office as Governor; WHEREAS, chapter 1 of the Laws of 1995 restored the death\npenalty as a sentencing option in specified circumstances involving intentional\nkillings, and requires that District Attorneys determine whether to seek the\nimposition of the death penalty after making informed, reasoned decisions on a\ncase-by-case basis; WHEREAS, on March 7, 1995, the same day chapter 1 of the\n\nLaws of 1995 was signed into law, the Bronx County District Attorney publicly\nstated that it was his \"present intention not to utilize the death penalty\nprovisions of [chapter 1 of the Laws of 1995],\" a statement he has never\nretracted and to which his actions have remained consistent; WHEREAS, a District Attorney who has instituted a blanket\npolicy not to seek the death penalty violates his obligation to make informed, reasoned decisions on a case-by-case basis and thereby violates as well his\nsworn obligation to uphold the laws of this State. In addition, such a failure\nto exercise discretion must command my attention, for it implicates my sworn\nobligations to take care that the laws are faithfully executed, support the\n\nConstitution and faithfully discharge my duties as Governor; WHEREAS, such a policy threatens the validity of death\nsentences imposed in cases prosecuted in other counties, because chapter 1 of\nthe Laws of 1995 requires the Court of Appeals to determine whether a sentence\nof death is excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in similar\ncases; WHEREAS, the Bronx County District Attorney afforded\nadditional reason to conclude that he indeed has a policy not to seek the death\npenalty when he precipitously announced in December of 1995, within hours of\nthe arrest of Michael Vernon on charges that he had brutally murdered five\ninnocent persons in Bronx County, that he would not seek the death\npenalty; WHEREAS, and pursuant to my constitutional obligations, I\ninquired of the District Attorney whether his determination in the Vernon case\nreflected \"a policy decision not to seek the death penalty in any case in Bronx\n\nCounty.\" The Bronx County District Attorney refused expressly to answer my\ninquiry, and thereby further heightened my concern that contrary to the law he\nwas substituting his personal sense of right and wrong for that of the\n\nLegislature. Nonetheless, mindful of the gravity of the consequences for the\n\nDistrict Attorney, I decided not to exercise my authority to supersede him in\nthe prosecution of Michael Vernon. However, I cautioned the District Attorney\nthat I would take all appropriate action needed to ensure that chapter 1 of the\n\nLaws of 1995 was faithfully executed in Bronx County; WHEREAS, in light of the brutal murder of Police Officer\n\nKevin Gillespie in the Bronx last week under circumstances strongly indicating\nthat the case is one in which the death penalty is particularly warranted, on\n\nMarch 18, 1996 I directed Paul Shechtman, the State Director of Criminal\n\nJustice, to contact the Bronx County District Attorney. Mr. Shechtman spoke\nwith the District Attorney and requested his assurance that if the Bronx County\n\nDistrict Attorney's Office were to proceed with the prosecution of the persons\narrested for officer Gillespie's murder and determined not to seek the death\npenalty, the District Attorney would so inform the Governor before taking any\naction that would irrevocably preclude the imposition of the death penalty. However, the Bronx County District Attorney declined to provide such an\nassurance; WHEREAS, I therefore wrote to the Bronx County District\n\nAttorney on March 19, 1996, again requested his assurance that he did not have\na policy against the death penalty, and expressly asked him whether there were\ncircumstances under which he would seek the death penalty in Bronx County. However, the District Attorney once again did not provide this assurance and\nrefused to answer my direct question. Moreover, the District Attorney\nreaffirmed his March 7, 1995 statement that it was his \"present intention not\nto utilize the death penalty provisions\" of the law. Inexplicably, the District\n\nAttorney maintained that this statement somehow \"left the door ajar, however\nslight,\" to exercising the option of seeking the death penalty. However, no\nrational reading of the March 7, 1995 statement is consistent with the exercise\nof discretion in a conscientious fashion; WHEREAS, other facts further confirm that the Bronx County\n\nDistrict Attorney has an impermissible policy not to seek the death penalty in\nany case. Apart from the Vernon case, the District Attorney has indicted six\nother persons for first-degree murder and has determined not to seek the death\npenalty in any of these cases. Although this fact alone is not sufficient to\ndemonstrate the existence of such an improper policy, the surrounding\ncircumstances are telling. For example, I am informed that in one of these\ncases (as in the Vernon case) the District Attorney announced that he would not\nseek the death penalty within hours of the defendant's arrest--weeks before he\nwas even indicted. And in another, the District Attorney made his announcement\njust two days after the defendant's arrest; again, this announcement occurred\nweeks before the District Attorney indicted the defendant. Clearly the speed\nwith which the District Attorney made these announcements is completely\ninconsistent with a careful, reasoned case-by-case evaluation. Furthermore, the\n\nDistrict Attorney has never asserted that he has established either an internal\nreview committee or guidelines for assessing whether to seek the death penalty; and\nWHEREAS, the foregoing compels me to conclude that my\nconstitutional obligations require both that I supersede the Bronx County\n\nDistrict Attorney with respect to the prosecution of those persons responsible\nfor the murder of Police Officer Kevin Gillespie and that I do so before the\n\nDistrict Attorney takes any action that would effectively prevent the Attorney\n\nGeneral or his deputy from conducting an informed, reasoned assessment of\nwhether to seek the death penalty; NOW, THEREFORE, I, GEORGE E. PATAKI, Governor of the State\nof New York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by article 4, section 3 of\nthe Constitution of the State of New York, the provisions of subdivision 2 of\nsection\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law and the statutes and law in such cases made and provided, do\nhereby require that you, the Attorney General of this State, as you deem\nappropriate and necessary after investigation, attend in person, or by one or\nmore of your assistants or deputies, a term or terms of the Supreme Court to be\nheld in and for the County of Bronx and that you, in person or by said\nassistants or deputies, appear before any grand jury drawn for any term or\nterms of said court, for the purpose of managing and conducting in said court\nand before said grand jury and said other grand juries any and all proceedings, examinations and inquiries and any and all criminal actions and proceedings\nwhich may be had or taken or before said grand jury and grand juries and\nproceedings which may be had or taken or before said grand jury and grand\njuries concerning or relating to: (a) any and all unlawful acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions relating to\nthe killing of Police Officer Kevin Gillespie and any involvement therein that\n\nJesus Mendez, Ricardo Morales, Angel Diaz or any other person may have\nhad; (b) any other alleged crimes\nor unlawful acts or omissions related to or committed incident to these alleged\ncrimes or unlawful acts or omissions, or discovered in the investigation or\nprosecution thereof; and\n(c) any\nand all acts or omissions or alleged acts or omissions occurring heretofore or\nhereafter to obstruct, hinder or interfere with any inquiry, prosecution, trial\nor judgment pursuant to or connected with this requirement; and that you\nconduct, manage, prosecute and handle such other proper actions and proceedings\nrelating thereto as may come before said terms of court, or any term of said\ncourt at which any and all indictments which may be found and which may\nhereafter be tried, pursuant to or in connection with this requirement, and in\nthe event of any appeal or appeals or other proceedings connected herewith, to\nmanage, prosecute, conduct and handle the same; and that in person or by your\nassistants or deputies you, as of the date hereof, supersede and in the place\nand stead of the District Attorney of the County of Bronx exercise all the\npowers and perform all the duties conferred upon you by statutes and law in\nsuch case made and provided and this requirement made hereunder, and that in\nsuch proceedings and actions the District Attorney of the County of Bronx shall\nexercise only such powers and perform such duties as are required of such\n\nDistrict Attorney by you or your assistants or deputies so attending. Pursuant to subdivision 8 of section\n63\nof the\n\nExecutive Law, I also find it to be in the public interest to require that you\ninquire into matters concerning the public peace, public safety and the public\njustice with respect to the subjects which are within the scope of this\nrequirement, and I so direct you to do so in person or by your assistants or\ndeputies and to have the powers and duties specified in such subdivision for\nthe purposes of this requirement.
