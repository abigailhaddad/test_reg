  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 19 § 192.10 - Decontamination and infection control\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. As used in this section: (1)\nOSHA means the Occupational Safety and\n\nHealth Administration and the statutes, rules and regulations relevant\nthereto. (2)\nEPA means the\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency. (3)\n\nCleaning is the removal of gross\ncontamination from an object or surface by the physical removal of all visible\ndust, soil, and any other foreign material. (4)\n\nDisinfection is the process that kills or\ndestroys a specific number of disease producing organisms, the number of which\nis determined by the level of disinfectant used. (5)\n\nSterilization is the process that kills\nall disease producing organisms (including bacteria, viruses, fungi and\nspores). (b) The\ndispenser shall follow the OSHA Standard for Bloodborne Pathogens\n(29 CFR §\n1910.1030\n) and the OSHA Standard for\n\nHazardous Material Communication (29 CFR §\n1910.1200\n), where appropriate, incorporated\nby reference herein. In addition, the dispenser shall comply with the\nprocedures, where not in conflict with OSHA regulations, set forth in this\nsection. Such Federal regulations are authored by the United States Department\nof Labor, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, revised as of July 1, 1999, and published by the United States Government Printing Office via GPO\nAccess, Washington, DC. A copy is available for public inspection and copying\nat the Division of Administrative Rules, Department of State, One Commerce\n\nPlaza, 99 Washington Avenue, Suite 650, Albany, NY 12231-0001. (c) General procedures for cleaning, disinfection and sterilization. The dispenser shall use scientifically accepted\ninfection prevention techniques appropriate for the cleaning and disinfection\nor sterilization of instruments, devices, materials and work surfaces, utilization of protective garb, and the storage of contamination-prone\nequipment. Such techniques shall include but not be limited to the following: (1)\n\nPrior to disinfection or sterilization, all items and surfaces must first be cleaned of gross contamination. This\nshould be accomplished by cleaning with warm water and soap or detergent, rinsing thoroughly, drying with clean or disposable toweling, or allowing to\nthoroughly air dry. Disinfection and sterilization must be accomplished in\naccordance with the manufacturer's recommendations for the item or\nsurface. (2)\n\nAll disinfectant\nprocesses prescribed herein must be accomplished by the use of an EPA-approved\nhospital grade disinfectant. (3)\n\nSterilization may be accomplished by using an autoclave or by soaking for a\nminimum of 10 hours in an approved two percent glutaraldehyde solution or in\nany other EPA-approved chemical sterilant solution in accordance with the\nmanufacturer's directions. Porous items should not be soaked in glutaraldehyde\nsolution. (4)\n\nItems for autoclaving\nmust be packaged prior to sterilization. Gloves must be worn when handling\nchemical sterilant solution and precautions must be taken to insure that the\nsolution does not come into contact with any skin surface. (5)\n\nFollowing disinfection or sterilization, items must be rinsed, dried and stored in a clean drawer, cabinet or covered\ncontainer. (6)\n\nAll solutions and\nequipment used for disinfection and sterilization must be stored, maintained\nand monitored according to the manufacturer's directions so as to protect from\ncontamination and to assure the continued integrity of the intended process. Such solution and equipment must be maintained in the original packaging with\nactive ingredients and scope of use clearly described on the original\nlabel. (7)\n\nEach registered business\nlocation must have on file all material safety data sheets (MSDS) for\ninspection. MSDS must be stored in a metal file accessible to all\nemployees. (8)\n\nAll \"clean\" and\n\"dirty\" equipment or items must be transported to and from remote locations in\ncovered containers. Clean items and supplies must be kept in containers\nseparate from those that have been used and all items and supplies must be\nmarked according to their status. (d) Specific procedures and schedules for\ncleaning, disinfection and sterilization of surfaces and implements. (1)\n\nHearing aids and earmolds must be cleaned\nand disinfected prior to any handling by office staff. Hearing aids must be\ndisinfected using an approved wipe or spray; earmolds must be disinfected using\napproved wipe, spray or submersion system. In all cases, disinfection must be\naccomplished according to the manufacturer's directions. In addition, clients\nmust be instructed in the appropriate manner of cleaning and disinfecting\nappliances for their own use. (2)\n\nIn general, headphone ear cushions, bone conduction oscillators, and headbands\nmust be cleaned and disinfected using an approved disinfectant wipe or spray at\nleast once per week. Following use on a client with evidence of a sore on the\near, scalp or face, with any ear drainage, or with questionable hygiene, disinfection must be performed prior to re-use. (3)\n\nOtoscope specula, real ear probe tubes, otolight tips, or any other item that comes in contact with the ear must be\ncleaned and disinfected using an approved wipe or submersion system prior to\neach client use. The use of disposable specula, probe tubes and tips after each\nclient use is encouraged and will eliminate the need for\ndisinfection. (4)\n\nHearing aid\ncleaning tools and listening stethoscope couplers must be cleaned and\ndisinfected using an approved wipe or submersion system before\nre-use. (5)\n\nReception countertops\nand tabletops used in testing rooms must be cleaned and disinfected using an\napproved wipe or spray at least once per day. (6)\n\nArm rests used by clients in testing\nrooms must be cleaned and disinfected using an approved wipe or spray at least\nonce per week. (e) Procedures with respect to blood, body fluids and client contact. (1)\n\nAll blood, mucous or other body fluid\nencountered in the workplace must be treated as if infectious. Direct contact\nwith blood should be avoided and disposable gloves used whenever such contact\ncan be reasonably anticipated. Cerumen is a potentially infectious material\nonly when it is contaminated with blood or mucous (drainage). Since cerumen is\ndark and viscous it is often difficult to determine if it is contaminated and\nthe content of cerumen cannot be determined through visual inspection. Consequently, cerumen should be treated as an infectious substance. In addition\nto any other statutory or regulatory procedures with respect to blood, body\nfluids and client contact, the following precautionary measures must be\ntaken: (2)\nA hearing aid or earmold\nmust not be handled upon removal from the ear with bare hands until it has been\ncleaned. (3)\n\nEither gloves must be\nworn while disinfecting a hearing aid appliance or earmold, or a disinfectant\ntowelette or spray must be used to hold, clean and disinfect the\nappliance. (4)\n\nAny disposable\nmaterials coming into contact with blood or other contaminated or potentially\ncontaminated body fluids must be disposed of in a plastic bag which will be\nsealed in a manner that protects the dispenser, dispenser's staff, client and\nothers, such as sanitation workers, who may come into contact with the\nmaterial. (5)\n\nAny disposable sharp\nobject that comes into contact with blood or other body fluids shall be\ndisposed of in a sealable rigid puncture proof container which is strong enough\nto protect from accidental cuts or puncture wounds that could happen during the\ndisposal process. (f) Hygienic practices. (1)\n\nHands must be washed\nbefore and after direct contact with each client. (2)\n\nBar soap for more than one person is\nprohibited. Liquid or powder soap dispensers or antimicrobial waterless hand\ncleaners may be used. (3)\n\nDisposable paper towels or hot air dryers shall be available for hand drying\nwhen antimicrobial waterless hand cleaners are not used. (4)\n\nDirect client care and handling of client\ncare equipment is forbidden if the dispenser has exudative lesions or weeping\ndermatitis and the condition has not been medically evaluated and determined to\nbe safe or capable of being safely protected against in providing direct client\ncare or in handling client care equipment.
