  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 528.7 - Farming and commercial horse boarding operations\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, §§ 1101(b)(19), (20); 1105(c)(3)(vi), (5)(iii); 1115(a)(6), (15), (16), (c)(2)\n(a) Exemption. (1)\n\nAll tangible\npersonal property, whether or not incorporated in a building or structure, for\nuse or consumption predominantly either in the production for sale of tangible\npersonal property by farming or in a commercial horse boarding operation (or in\nboth) is exempt from the New York State and local sales and compensating use\ntaxes. (See sections 1115[a][15] and [16] of the Tax Law exempting certain\ntangible personal property sold to a contractor, subcontractor, or repairperson\nwhen the property is to become an integral component part of a structure, building, or real property used predominantly either in the production phase of\nfarming or in a commercial horse boarding operation, or in both.)\n(2)\n\nThe services of installing, maintaining, servicing, and repairing the tangible personal property specified as exempt in\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision are excluded from the State and local sales\nand compensating use taxes. (See section\n527.5\nof this Title for rules pertaining to installing, maintaining, servicing, and\nrepairing tangible personal property.)\n\nExample: A farmer (or an operator of a commercial horse boarding\noperation) in this State has a tractor repaired. The tractor is used\npredominantly in farm production (or in a commercial horse boarding operation). The charge for materials is $100, and the charge for labor is $50. The farmer\ngives the vendor a timely filed and properly completed exemption certificate\nand is not required to pay the New York State and local sales and compensating\nuse taxes on the total charge for materials and labor. It does not matter\nwhether the vendor's invoice separately states the charges for the materials\nand labor since neither is subject to tax. (3)\n\nThe services of maintaining, servicing, and repairing real property, property, or land that is used or consumed\npredominantly either in the production for sale of tangible personal property\nby farming or in a commercial horse boarding operation (or in both) are\nexcluded from State and local sales and compensating use taxes. (See section\n527.7\nof this title for rules pertaining to maintaining, servicing, and repairing\nreal property. (4)\n\nFuel, gas, electricity, refrigeration, and steam, and gas, electric, refrigeration, and\nsteam service of whatever nature for use or consumption either in the\nproduction for sale of tangible personal property by farming or in a commercial\nhorse boarding operation (or in both) are exempt from State and local sales and\ncompensating use taxes. (See, however, sections 1115[j] and\n1120\nof the Tax Law\nwith respect to motor fuel and diesel motor fuel.)\n(5)\n\nTangible personal property and services\neligible for exemption or exclusion may be purchased without payment of tax\nupon the issuance to the vendor of a timely filed and properly completed\nexemption certificate. (See subdivision [e] of this section.)\n(b) Farming and commercial\nhorse boarding operation defined. (1)\n\nThe term\nfarming\nmeans and includes the following types of\nfarming and activities: (i) agriculture, floriculture, horticulture, aquaculture, and silviculture; (ii)\nstock, dairy, poultry, fruit, fur-bearing animal, truck, and tree farming; (iii)\ngraping; (iv)\nranching; (v) operating nurseries, greenhouses, vineyard trellises, or other similar structures used primarily for the raising\nof agricultural, horticultural, vinicultural, viticultural, floricultural, or\nsilvicultural commodities; (vi)\noperating orchards; (vii)\nraising, growing, and harvesting crops, livestock and livestock products (see section\n301[2] of the New York State Agriculture and Markets Law); and\n(viii)\nraising, growing, and harvesting\nwoodland products, including, but not limited to, timber, logs, lumber, pulpwood, posts and firewood. Example 1: Breeding, raising and feeding livestock, poultry, or other\nanimals, which produce a product for sale or are themselves a food product, is\nfarming. Example 2: The breeding of dogs, cats and other pets or laboratory\nanimals is not farming. Example 3: An individual who does not own a farm but does own farm\nequipment which he uses to perform custom work for a commercial farmer may\npurchase such equipment tax-free since the equipment will be used in\nfarming. (2)\n\nThe\nterm\ncommercial horse boarding operation\nmeans an agricultural\nenterprise, consisting of at least seven acres and boarding at least ten\nhorses, regardless of ownership, that receives $10,000 or more in gross\nreceipts annually from fees generated either through the boarding of horses or\nthrough the production for sale of crops, livestock, and livestock products, or\nthrough both such boarding and such production. A commercial horse boarding\noperation does not include any operation whose primary on-site function is\nhorse racing. (See section 301[13] of the New York State Agriculture and\n\nMarkets Law.)\n(c) Production. (1)\n\nThe activities in\nfarming may be classified as administration, production or distribution. (i) Administration includes activities such\nas sales promotion; general office work; credit and collection; purchasing; maintenance; transporting, receiving and testing of raw materials; and clerical\nwork in production such as preparation of work production and time records. However, tangible personal property used or consumed in administrative\nactivities that are related to farm production, as described in subparagraph\n(ii) of this paragraph, is considered to be used or consumed in farm\nproduction. This includes tangible personal property used in activities such as\npreparing animal feed, weight, and health records; and performing research\nrelated to farm production. (ii)\n\nFarm production begins with the preparation of the soil or other growing\nmedium, or, in the case of animals, from the beginning of the life cycle. Production ceases when the product is ready for sale in its natural state. For\nfarm products that will be converted into other products, farm production\nceases when the normal development of the farm product has reached a stage\nwhere it will be processed or converted into a related product. Example 1: Production ceases when cattle will be processed into meat, raw milk into butter, cheese or bottled milk, grapes into wine or juice, etc., by a related industry, whether such industry is owned by the farmer or\nanother. Cross-reference: For a discussion of when farming production stops and\nmanufacturing production begins, see the manufacturers production exemption in\nsection\n528.13\n(b) of this Title. (iii)\n\nDistribution includes all operations subsequent to production, such as storing, displaying, selling, loading and shipping products that are ready for\nsale. (2)\n\nProduction\nends for a specific producer (farmer or other person) when the product is in\nthe form in which he will offer it for sale. However, production may again\nstart for a specific purchaser when he gains ownership of the product, and\nproduction will continue until the product is in a form in which it, in turn, will be offered for sale. Example 2: A farmer raises and sells calves to a feed lot operator who\nintends to feed and finish the calves into beef cattle. (d) Predominantly. (1)\n\nPredominantly\nmeans that\nthe tangible personal property must be used or consumed; the real property or\nland must be used or consumed; or the building, structure, or real property\ninto which the tangible personal property has been incorporated must be used, more than 50 percent of the time either in the production for sale of tangible\npersonal property by farming or in a commercial horse boarding operation, or in\nboth. (2)\n\nSee section\n1115 (a)(6)(B)\nof the Tax\n\nLaw concerning motor vehicles used predominantly (\ni.e., more\nthan 50 percent) either in the production for sale of tangible personal\nproperty by farming or in a commercial horse boarding operation, or in both. The percentage of a vehicle's use in such activities may be computed either on\nthe basis of mileage or hours of use, at the discretion of the purchaser or\nuser. (e) Exemption certificate. (1)\n\nAn\nappropriate and properly completed exemption certificate may be used by a\nfarmer or by an operator of a commercial horse boarding operation to make\nexempt or excluded purchases of tangible personal property and services\ndescribed in this section. (2)\n\nAn\nexemption certificate may not be used for purchases of motor fuel. The tax must\nbe paid on such purchases, and the farmer or operator of a commercial horse\nboarding operation may apply for a refund or credit of the tax paid on motor\nfuel that is used for exempt or excluded purposes. (3)\n\nAn exemption certificate may be used as a\nblanket certificate or as a single purchase certificate. (4)\n\nAn exemption certificate is considered to\nbe properly completed when it contains the following information: (i) name and address of the vendor; (ii)\nname and address of the farmer or of the\noperator of the commercial horse boarding operation; (iii)\nsignature of the farmer or of the\noperator of the commercial horse boarding operation (or of the authorized\nrepresentative of the farmer or operator) certifying that the property or\nservices will be used or consumed in an exempt or excluded manner; (iv)\ndate prepared; and\n(v) any other information required pursuant\nto articles 28 and 29 of the Tax Law and Part 532 of this Title.
