  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10, app 75-A § 75-A.1 - Introduction\n\nState Regulations\n(a) This appendix applies to on-site wastewater treatment systems serving residential properties and receiving sewage without the admixture of industrial wastes or other wastes, as defined in Environmental Conservation Law, Section 17-0701, in quantities of less than 1,000 gallons per day (GPD). (b) Definitions. As used in this appendix, the following words and terms shall have the indicated meaning: (1)\n\nAbsorption Area. An area to which wastewater is distributed for infiltration to the soil. (2)\n\nAbsorption Field. The area to which sewage is distributed for infiltration to the soil by means of a network of pipes. (3)\n\nAbsorption Trench. A long narrow area which includes a pipe for the distribution of septic tank effluent. (4)\n\nAerobic Treatment Unit. A system that provides for the biological decomposition of the organic portion of the wastewater by mechanical aeration of the wastewater. (5)\n\nAggregate. Washed gravel or crushed stone 3/4 - 11/2 inches in diameter. (6)\n\nApplication Rate. The rate at which septic tank effluent is applied to a subsurface absorption area, for design purposes, expressed in gallons per day per square foot (gpd/sq. ft.). (7)\n\nBaffle. A flow deflecting device used in septic tanks and distribution boxes to inhibit the discharge of floating solids, reduce the amount of settleable solids that exit, and reduce the exit velocity of the wastewater. (8)\n\nBuilding Sewer. That part of the drainage system which extends from the end of the building drain and conveys wastewater to the sewage system or sewer. (9)\n\nCleanout. An opening providing access to part of the sewage system. (10)\n\nCommissioner. The State Commissioner of Health. (11)\n\nCurtain Drain. A subsurface drain designed and constructed to control groundwater and surface water intrusion into the area of the sewage system. (12)\n\nDesign Professional. A person licensed or registered in the State of New York and authorized by the State Education Law to design the systems described in the standards. (13)\n\nDistribution Device. A device used to uniformly distribute sewage to the absorption area. (14)\n\nDistribution Line. The perforated pipe used to distribute wastewater to the absorption area. (15)\n\nDrinking Water. Water whose physical, chemical and biological quality is or is intended to be satisfactory for human consumption, food preparation or culinary purposes. (16)\n\nEffective Grain Size. A measure of the diameter of soil particles, when compared to a theoretical material having an equal transmission constant. It is the dimensions of that mesh screen which will permit 10 percent of the sample to pass and will retain 90 percent. (17)\n\nEnhanced Treatment. The biological and physical treatment of wastewater to reduce the amount of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and total suspended solids (TSS) of wastewater effluent prior to distribution to an absorption area. (18)\n\nEnhanced Treatment Unit (ETU). Pre-manufactured structures that provide enhanced treatment of wastewater prior to discharge to a subsurface soil absorption area. (19)\n\nGas Baffle. A device on the outlet of a septic tank which deflects gas bubbles away from the outlet and reduces the carry over of solid particles from the septic tank. (20)\n\nGroundwater. Subsurface water occupying the saturation zone from which wells and springs are fed. (21)\n\nHeavy Equipment. All equipment which would result in the compaction of the design absorption area at a depth equivalent to the design depth of the distribution lines. (22)\n\nInfiltration. The flow or movement of water into the interstices or pores of a soil through the soil interface. (23)\n\nInvert. The floor, bottom, or lowest point of the inside cross section of a pipe. (24)\n\nLocal Health Department. A city, county, or part-county department of health or a State Department of Health District Office. (25)\n\nPercolation. The movement of water through the pores of a soil or other porous medium following infiltration through the soil interface. (26)\n\nPermeability. A measure of the rate of movement of liquid through soil. (27)\n\nResponsible Management Entity (RME). A legal entity with the requisite managerial, financial and technical capacity to ensure long-term management of residential wastewater treatment systems. RMEs may include: sewer districts, utilities, municipal authorities or other entities with the authority to enforce and the capacity to finance the long-term operation and maintenance requirements necessary to ensure residential wastewater treatment systems are functioning properly. (28)\n\nScum. The wastewater material which is less dense than water and floats on top of the water. (29)\n\nSewage. The combination of human and household waste with water which is discharged to the home plumbing system including the waste from a flush toilet, bath, sink, lavatory, dishwashing or laundry machine, or the water-carried waste from any other fixture, equipment or machine. (30)\n\nStabilized Rate of Percolation. The rate corresponding to two consecutive equal or near equal percolation test results. (31)\n\nTire Derived Aggregate (TDA). Aggregate manufactured from waste tires to a similar size distribution as conventional gravel or stone aggregate and used as alternative to gravel or stone aggregate in soil absorption areas. (32)\n\nUseable Soil. Unless otherwise stated a soil with a percolation rate from one to 60 min/in with a compatible soil classification. (33)\n\nWastewater. Any water discharged from a house through a plumbing fixture to include, but not limited to, sewage and any water or waste from a device (e.g., water softener brine) which is produced in the house or property. (34)\n\nWatercourse. A visible path through which surface water travels on a regular basis. Drainage areas which contain water only during and immediately after a rainstorm shall not be considered a watercourse. (35)\n\nWatershed. An area of drainage for a body of water that serves as a source of drinking water and for which watershed rules and regulations have been adopted by the Commissioner. (36)\n\nWell Head Area. The area surrounding a well which includes the cone of influence (where the drawdown of groundwater causes groundwater flow). (37)\n\nWetland. An area(s) of marshes or swamps which have been designated as such by the State Department of Environmental Conservation or other agency having jurisdiction. Marshes or swamps that have not been classified by an agency as a wetland shall not be treated for design purposes as a wetland. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs.
