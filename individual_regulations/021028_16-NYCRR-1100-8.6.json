  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-8.6 - Disclosure\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prior\nto the issues determination. Discovery is limited to what is afforded\nunder the Freedom of Information Law (New York Public Officers Law - Access to\n\nRecords). In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the ALJ shall not\ngrant petitions for further disclosure. This provision does not alter the\nrights of any person under the Freedom of Information Law, nor does it limit\nthe ability of any party to seek disclosure after the issues determination is\nmade. (b) Without\npermission of the ALJ. Within ten (10) days after service of the final\ndesignation of the issues, any party has the right to serve a disclosure demand\nupon any other party demanding that party provide: (1)\n\nDocuments, in general conformance with\nCPLR section 3120(a)(1)(i); (2)\nA\nlist of witnesses to be called, their addresses, and the scope and content of\neach witness's proposed testimony, and the qualifications and published works\nof each, in general conformance with CPLR section 3101(d)(1), except that\ndisclosure of fact witnesses as well as expert witnesses may be\ndemanded; (3)\n\nAn inspection of\nproperty, in general conformance with CPLR section 3120(a)(1)(ii), except that\ndrilling and other intrusive sampling and testing is not provided as of\nright; (4)\nA request for admission, in general conformance with CPLR section 3123; or\n(5)\n\nLists of documentary or physical evidence\nto be offered at the hearing. (6)\n\nElectronically stored information (ESI). Unless authorized by the ALJ, disclosure of ESI is limited only to ESI that is located in a computer's memory\nor in storage media (including servers, desktop or laptop computers, tablets, cellphones, hard drives, flash drives, compact discs, digital video discs, and\nportable media players) that is immediately available in the normal course of\nbusiness. (c) By\npermission. With permission of the ALJ, a party may: (1)\n\nObtain discovery prior to the issues\ndetermination; (2)\n\nUse discovery\ndevices from the CPLR not provided for in subdivision (b) of this\nsection; (3)\n\nSubmit late requests\nfor discovery or vary the time for responding to requests; and\n(4)\n\nAccess real property in the custody or\ncontrol of another for the purpose of conducting drilling or other sampling or\ntesting. In such instance, all parties shall be given notice of such activities\nand be allowed to observe and to take split samples or use other specified\nmethods of verification. (5)\n\nUpon\nmotion of any party demonstrating substantial prejudice, the ALJ may order\nadditional disclosure of ESI beyond that provided for in subdivision (b) of\nthis section, subject to any terms and conditions deemed appropriate by the\nALJ. Such a motion shall be accompanied by an affirmation of an attorney, or an\naffidavit of the moving party if not represented by an attorney, describing the\ngood faith efforts to resolve the dispute without resort to a\nmotion. (d) Protective order and motion to compel. (1)\nA party against whom disclosure is\ndemanded may make a motion to the ALJ for a protective order, in general\nconformance with CPLR 3103 to deny, limit, condition or regulate the use of any\ndisclosure device in order to prevent unreasonable annoyance, expense, embarrassment, disadvantage, or other prejudice. Such a motion shall be\nsubmitted within ten (10) days of the disclosure demand and shall be\naccompanied by an affidavit of counsel, or by the moving party or other\nauthorized representative if not represented by counsel, reciting good faith\nefforts to resolve the dispute without resort to a motion. (2)\n\nIf a party fails to comply with a\ndisclosure demand without having made a timely objection, the proponent of the\ndisclosure demand may apply to the ALJ to compel disclosure. The ALJ may direct\nthat any party failing to comply with disclosure after being directed to do so\nby the ALJ suffer preclusion from the hearing of the material demanded. Further, a failure to comply with the ALJ's direction will allow the ALJ or the\n\nExecutive Director to draw the inference that the material demanded is\nunfavorable to the noncomplying party's position. (e) Pre-filed testimony. The\nALJ shall require the submission of pre-filed written testimony for fact and\nexpert witnesses in advance of an adjudicatory hearing. Such testimony shall be\nattested to at the hearing and the witness shall be available to be\ncross-examined on the testimony, unless otherwise stipulated by the parties and\ndirected by the ALJ. Pre-filed written testimony shall provide, or shall be\naccompanied by, a technical report which provides, a full explanation of the\nbasis for the views set forth therein, including data, tables, protocols, computations, formulae, and any other information necessary for verification of\nthe views set forth, as well as a bibliography of reports, studies and other\ndocuments relied upon. Upon ten (10) days' notice (which time may be shortened\nor extended by the ALJ), the party submitting pre-filed written testimony may\nalso be required to make available all raw data, laboratory notes, and other\nbasic materials, as well as all items on the bibliography provided. (f) Subpoenas. Consistent\nwith the CPLR, any attorney of record in a proceeding has the power to issue\nsubpoenas. A party who is not represented by an attorney admitted to practice\nin New York State may request the ALJ or if no ALJ has been assigned to the\nproceeding, the Executive Director, to issue a subpoena, stating the items or\nwitnesses needed by the party to present its case. The service of a subpoena is\nthe responsibility of its sponsor. In addition, the sponsor shall be\nresponsible for all costs arising from the issuance of or compliance with the\nsubpoena. A subpoena shall give notice that the ALJ may quash or modify the\nsubpoena pursuant to the standards set forth under CPLR article 23. This Part\ndoes not affect the authority of an attorney of record for any party to issue\nsubpoenas under the provisions of CPLR section 2302. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
