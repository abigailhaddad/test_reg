  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 3.118 - Executive order no. 118: establishing the council on state priorities\n\nState Regulations\n\nOur State has successfully faced many of the most difficult\nissues of government and public administration which result from increasing\npublic demands for services in times of contracting financial resources. Our\nsuccess is due to the careful application of the available resources to human\nand governmental requirements. It is fitting that this administration's accumulated\nknowledge and experience be gathered and be focused on the issues which our\n\nState will face in the future. Further, it is in the best interest of the\npeople to be informed by the Governor and members of his administration of\nthose issues, and to have the benefit of the perspective provided by a\nrepresentative body of private individuals who have demonstrated an ability to\naddress and resolve complex problems: A mechanism must be created to permit\nsuch individuals to participate in an effort coordinated with State officials. This goal can be achieved best by the establishment of the Council on State\n\nPriorities, composed of distinguished citizens representing various sectors of\nour society, including business, labor and academia. NOW, THEREFORE, I, Hugh L. Carey, Governor of the State of\n\nNew York, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and Laws\nof the State of New York, do hereby order as follows: I. Council on State Priorities. There is hereby created within the Executive Department a\ngroup to be known as the Council on State Priorities (the \"council\"). The\nmembers of the council shall be appointed by the Governor. The Governor shall\nserve as cochairman of the council, and shall appoint a cochairman to serve\nwith him from among the members. The members of the council shall receive no\ncompensation, but shall be entitled to reimbursement for any necessary expenses\nincurred in connection with the performance of their duties. II. Powers and Responsibilities of the\n\nCouncil. The council shall prepare a series of reports on issues to\nbe designated by the Governor, which reports shall include a concise analysis\nof present policy, identify the stress points of public administration, and\nsuggest the policy options available to deal with those difficulties. The\ncouncil shall additionally be prepared to advise public officials and others of\nits conclusions. III. Procedures of the Council. The council may employ such staff as may be deemed\nnecessary by the cochairmen at compensation to be fixed by them contingent on\nthe availability of funds from private or public sources. In carrying out its\nfunctions, powers and duties, the council shall, wherever possible make use of\nthe staff resources of the Executive Chamber and of State agencies. All\ndepartments, divisions, boards, offices and public corporations of the State\nare directed to cooperate with the council and to provide such assistance as\nthe council may request to fulfill its purposes. Such assistance may include, but need not be limited to, the provision of statistical and policy data in\nsuch form as is determined by the council, and consultation with such agency\nstaff as the council identifies. IV. Advisory Panel. There is hereby created an advisory panel to the council\n(the \"panel\") whose members, designated by the Governor, may include\ncommissioners, directors and chairpersons of State agencies and authorities, as\nwell as members of the Executive Chamber. The Governor, in his discretion, may\nappoint to the panel additional members from the private and independent sector\nwho have made significant contributions to public policy. Signed: Hugh L.
