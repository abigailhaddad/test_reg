  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 526.10 - Vendor\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 1101(b)(8)\n(a) Persons included. (1)\n(i) A\nperson making sales of tangible personal property the receipts from which are\nsubject to tax is a vendor. Example 1: Auctioneers, door to door salesmen, independent brokers, and operators of service stations, retail stores, restaurants, etc., are\nvendors. Example 2: An independent manufacturer's representative, representing\nmany clients and acting on his own behalf, who solicits orders from New York\n\nState customers is a vendor. Example 3: An individual who collects and sells antiques as a hobby\nand uses a room in his home one day a week for display and sales purposes is a\nvendor. (ii)\nA person making\nsales of services, the receipts from which are subject to tax, is a vendor. This may include a person entering this State from outside the state to perform\nservices on property located in this State. Example 4: S company (a shopping mall management company) hires B\nCompany (a parking lot maintenance company located in New Jersey) to patch, seal and line-strip the parking lots of nine malls managed by S Company at\nvarious locations throughout New York. B Company is a vendor because it is\nproviding a service in New York subject to tax. Cross-references: For exemption of certain sales at a person's residence, see\n\nPart 528 of this Title. For the status, as a vendor, of a person performing\nservices outside the state but delivering such services in the State, see\nparagraphs (3), (4), (5) and (6) of this subdivision. (2)\n(i) A person maintaining a place of business\nin the State making sales, whether at such place of business or elsewhere, to\npersons within the State of tangible personal property or services, the use of\nwhich is tax, is a vendor. (ii)\nA\nperson shall be considered to be maintaining a place of business in the State\nif it, either directly or through a subsidiary, has a store, salesroom, sample\nroom, showroom, distribution center, warehouse, service center, factory, credit\nand collection office, administrative office or research facility in the\n\nState. (3)\nA person who\nsolicits business by employees, independent contractors, agents or other\nrepresentatives and by reason thereof makes sales to persons within the State\nof tangible personal property or services, the use of which is subject to tax, is a vendor. Example 5: A California based company uses independent manufacturers'\nrepresentatives, who are residents of New York State, to sell its product in\n\nNew York. The California company is a vendor. (4)\n(i) A\nperson who solicits business by the distribution of catalogs or other\nadvertising matter, without regard to whether such distribution is the result\nof regular or systematic solicitation, if such person has some additional\nconnection with the State which satisfies the nexus requirement of the United\n\nStates Constitution and by reason thereof makes sales to persons within the\n\nState of tangible personal property or services the use of which is subject to\ntax, is a vendor. (ii)\n\nFor purposes\nof subparagraph (i) of this paragraph, the additional connection with the State\na person may have in order to qualify as a vendor shall include, but not be\nlimited to: (a) the operation of a retail\nstores in the State; (b) the\npresence of traveling sales representatives in the State; (c) the presence of employees, independent\ncontractors or agents in the State; (d) the presence of service representatives\nin the State; (e) the maintenance\nof a post office box in the State for receiving responses to such person's\nsolicitations; or\n(f) the\nmaintenance of an office in the State, even if such office performs no\nactivities related to the sales solicited by such person. Example 6: Company K is engaged in the mail-order retail sale of\ncomputer hardware and software in New York State. Sales are solicited in New\n\nYork by means of direct mail advertising sent from the company's Oregon\nheadquarters. Company K has no property or employees in New York State. The\nhardware and software are sent to New York customers via common carrier. Customers of Company K who experience problems using a product purchased may\ncontact the company by phone in Oregon for assistance. In certain instances, and at no charge to the customer, Company K will send a computer expert\nemployed by it in Oregon to New York State and provide technical assistance at\nthe customer's premises. Company K is a vendor because of its having service\nrepresentatives in the State. The result would be the same if, alternatively, Company K had an independent contractor or agent based in New York State or\nelsewhere provide technical assistance at the customer's premises on Company\nK's behalf. Example 7: Company S, with its main office in Nevada, has a mail order\nbusiness that solicits sales in New York State via catalogs mailed directly to\ncustomers in New York. Customer orders are sent to, and all orders are filled\nfrom, the mail order headquarters in Nevada. Company S also operates retail\nstores in New York. Company S is a vendor for purposes of both the mail order\nbusiness and the retail stores. Example 8: B Company is a manufacturer and mail-order retailer of\nspecialty sporting equipment and has its main office in Wyoming. B Company\nsolicits sales in New York via catalogs mailed directly to customers in New\n\nYork. Customer orders are sent to, and all orders are filled from, the\nmail-order headquarters in Wyoming. B Company maintains an office in New York whose only\nfunction is to sell advertising space in the company's quarterly publication\nthat contains information of interest to sporting enthusiasts. E Company is a\nvendor because it maintains an office in New York State. Example 9: Company U is a photo developer located in Delaware. It\nsolicits business in New York by means of advertising packets included with the\n\nSunday supplements of local newspapers within New York. Customers are directed\nto enclose their film and payment in a preaddressed envelope. The address is\nthat of a post office box in the city in New York where the newspaper offices\nare located. The contents of the various post office boxes are forwarded daily\nto Company U's processing plant in Delaware. Company U is a vendor because of\nits additional connection with New York. (See also paragraph [6] of this\nsubdivision.)\n(5)\n(i) A\nperson who makes sales of tangible personal property or services, the use of\nwhich is subject to tax, and who regularly or systematically delivers such\nproperty or services in the State by means other than the United States mail or\ncommon carrier is a vendor. (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph, a person is presumed to be regularly or\nsystematically delivering property or services in the State if the cumulative\ntotal number of occasions such person or his agent came into the State to\ndeliver property and/or services exceeded 12 during the immediately preceding\nfour quarterly sales tax reporting periods ending on the last day of February, May, August and November. As a result, on the first day of each quarterly sales\ntax reporting period (December, March, June and September) a person must\ndetermine whether this presumption has been met. Example 10: A company in Ohio makes weekly deliveries of business forms\nin its own trucks to its customers in New York. The forms were ordered by mail\nor telephone. The company is presumed to be regularly or systematically\ndelivering property in the State and is therefore presumed to be a\nvendor. Example 11: A furniture reupholsterer located in New Jersey offers free\npick-up and delivery service to its customers. Between September 15, 1988 and\n\nMarch 5, 1990, the reupholsterer came into New York to deliver furniture, reupholstered at its New Jersey factory, on 16 occasions as follows: Job No. Delivery Date\n1\n\nSeptember 15, 1988\n2\n\nSeptember 15, 1988\n3\n\nSeptember 19, 1988\n4\n\nSeptember 22, 1988\n5\n\nOctober 5, 1988\n6\n\nNovember 8, 1988\n7\n\nMarch 10, 1989\n8\n\nMarch 28, 1989\n9\n\nApril 5, 1989\n10\n\nJune 15, 1989\n11\n\nJune 21, 1989\n12\n\nJuly 13, 1989\n13\n\nAugust 24, 1989\n14\n\nAugust 28, 1989\n15\n\nFebruary 9, 1990\n16\n\nMarch 5, 1990\n\nAs can be seen from the above chart, 14 of the occasions\nthe reupholsterer came into New York were during the period September 15, 1988\nthrough August 28, 1989. Accordingly, as of September 1, 1989, the reupholsterer is\npresumed to be regularly or systematically delivering services in the State and\nis therefore presumed to be a vendor. This is so because during the immediately\npreceding four quarterly sales tax reporting periods ending on November 30, 1988, February 28, 1989, May 31, 1989 and August 31, 1989, the reupholsterer\ncame into the State on more than 12 occasions to deliver its service. (Note, the number of times the reupholsterer came into New\n\nYork to pick up furniture to reupholster is not used in determining status as a\nvendor; only delivery trips are considered.)\n(iii)\n\nNotwithstanding the provisions of\nsubparagraph (ii) of this paragraph, if a person can demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner that he cannot reasonably be expected to\neffect deliveries of property and/or services on more than 12 occasions during\nthe next succeeding four quarterly sales tax reporting periods, such person\nwill not be presumed to be regularly or systematically delivering property or\nservices in the State. Example 12: H Corporation, located in New Jersey, has two stores. Store\n\nNo. 1 is in southern New Jersey and Store No. 2 is situated close to the New\n\nYork City metropolitan area. It is economically practicable only for Store No. 2 to access the New York marketplace. During the period September 1, 1988\nthrough August 31, 1989, Store No. 2 regularly delivered property into New York\nwithin the meaning of section\n526.10\n(a)(5)(ii)\nof the Sales and Use Tax\n\nRegulations. However, on July 1, 1989 H Corporation decided to close Store No. 2 effective August 31, 1989. H Corporation will not be presumed to be regularly\nor systematically delivering property or services in the State and therefore\nwill not be presumed to be a vendor and will not be required to register as\nsuch provided it does not otherwise qualify as a vendor in New York. (For\ncancellation of a vendor's certificate of authority, see section\n539.2\n[e]\nof this Title.)\n(6)\n(i) A\nperson who regularly or systematically solicits business in the State by the\ndistribution to persons within the State, by mail or otherwise, without regard\nto the location from which such distribution originated or in which the\nmaterials were prepared, of catalogs, advertising flyers or letters, or by any\nother means of solicitation of business from persons in this State, and by\nreason thereof makes sales to persons within the State of tangible personal\nproperty, the use of which is subject to tax, is a vendor. Such a person is a\nvendor even though such person has no additional connection with the State (see\nparagraph [4] of this subdivision). (ii)\n\nFor purposes of this paragraph, the\nphrase \"any other means of solicitation\" includes but is not limited to: (a) advertisements which are directed at\npersons in this State or which can reasonably be expected to result in sales of\ntangible personal property to persons in this State such as advertisements\nplaced in newspapers or periodicals circulated in this State or advertisements\nbroadcast in or into this State by a radio or television station or by cable\ntelevision; and\n(b) a\ntelecommunication or television shopping system which is transmitted in or into\nthis State by cable television or other means of broadcasting. Example 13: A furniture store in Vermont places advertisements in\nnewspapers which are published or circulated in New York State. Such\nadvedtisements constitute \"any other means of solicitation\". Example 14: A clothing store in northern New Jersey advertises its\nmerchandise on radio and television stations which have an audience in the\nmetropolitan New York City area. Such advertisements constitute \"any other\nmeans of solicitation\". It does not matter whether the stations are located\ninside or outside New York State. (iii)\n\nAny person who solicits business in\nthis State under the circumstances described in paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision will qualify as a vendor whether or not he regularly or\nsystematically solicits business in this State within the meaning of this\nparagraph. (iv)\n\nFor purposes of\nthis paragraph, a person is presumed to be regularly or systematically\nsoliciting business in the State if, for the immediately preceding four\nquarterly sale ending on the last day of February, May, August and November, the cumulative total of such person's gross receipts from sales of property\ndelivered in the State exceeds $300,000 and such person made more than 100\nsales of property delivered in the State. Example 15: Company P, a mail-order house located in Utah, solicits\nsales in New York only through its mail-order catalogs sent four times a year\ndirectly to resident addresses in New York State. All orders are filled in Utah\nand sent via U.S. mail to New York. Company P began soliciting business in New\n\nYork in September 1989 and during the period September 1, 1989 through August\n31, 1990, Company P has the following gross sales (summarized by sales tax\nquarterly filing period) to customers in New York. Gross Sales in New York\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of Sales\n\nDollar Amount\n9/1/89 - 11/30/89\n700\n$ 42,000\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n1,300\n$ 71,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n1,500\n$ 81,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n1,800\n$ 97,000\n\nTotals (9/1/89 - 8/31/90)\n5,300\n$291,000\n\nAlthough Company P's number of sales of property delivered\nin New York exceeded 100 during the four quarterly sales tax reporting periods, its dollar volume of sales for this period was only $291,000. Accordingly, Company P is not presumed to be regularly or systematically soliciting business\nin the State and therefore is not presumed to be a vendor for the quarter\nbeginning September 1, 1990. Nor is Company P a vendor pursuant to paragraph\n(4) of this subdivision because it has no additional connection with New York\n\nState: Example 16: Assume the same facts as in example 15 except that the\nperiod is December 1, 1989 through November 30, 1990. The sales data for that\nperiod is as follows: Gross Sales in New York\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of Sales\n\nDollar Amount\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n1,300\n$ 71,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n1,500\n$ 81,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n1,800\n$ 97,000\n9/1/90 - 11/30/90\n2,200\n$114,000\n\nTotals (12/1/89 - 11/30/90)\n6,800\n$363,000\n\nSince Company P's number of sales delivered in New York for\nthe period 12/1/89 - 11/30/90 exceeded 100 and the gross receipts from these\nsales exceeded $300,000, Company P is presumed to be regularly or\nsystematically soliciting business in this State and is therefore presumed to\nbe a vendor for the quarter beginning December 1, 1990. Example 17: Company Q is a computer manufacturer and retailer located\nin California that solicits sales in New York State through advertisements\nplaced in national computer technology magazines. Customers interested in\n\nCompany Q's computers may request the product-line catalog by filling in and\nmailing a request form to California. All orders are filled in California and\nshipped via common carrier. During the period September 1, 1989 through August 31, 1990, Company Q had the following sales (summarized by sales tax quarterly\nfiling period) to customers in New York. Gross Sales in New York\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of Sales\n\nDollar Amount\n9/1/89 - 11/30/90\n21\n$ 76,000\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n22\n$ 81,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n20\n$ 73,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n28\n$ 92,000\n\nTotals (9/1/89 - 8/31/90)\n91\n$322,000\n\nAlthough Company Q's gross receipts from sales in New York\nexceeded $300,000 for the period 9/1/89 - 8/31/90, its number of sales\ndelivered in New York was less than 100 for this period. Accordingly, Company\nQ, is not presumed to be regularly or systematically soliciting business in the\n\nState and therefore is not presumed to be a vendor for the quarter beginning\n\nSeptember 1, 1990. Nor is Company Q a vendor pursuant to paragraph (4) of this\nsubdivision because it has no additional connection with New York State. Example 18: Assume the same facts as in Example 17 except that the\nperiod is December 1, 1989 through November 30, 1990: The sales data for that\nperiod is as follows: Gross Sales in New York\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of Sales\n\nDollar Amount\n12/1/89 - 2/28/90\n22\n$ 81,000\n3/1/90 - 5/31/90\n20\n$ 73,000\n6/1/90 - 8/31/90\n28\n$ 92,000\n9/1/90 - 11/30/90\n36\n$119,000\n\nTotals (12/1/89 - 11/30/90)\n106\n$365,000\n\nSince Company Q's number of sales delivered in New York for\nthe period from 12/1/89 - 11/34/90 exceeded 100 and the gross receipts from\nthese sales exceeded $300,000, Company Q is presumed to be regularly or\nsystematically soliciting business in the State and is therefore presumed to be\na vendor for the quarter beginning December 1, 1990. (v) Notwithstanding the provisions of\nsubparagraph (iv) of this paragraph, if a person can demonstrate to the\nsatisfaction of the commissioner that he cannot reasonably be expected to have\ngross receipts in excess of $300,000 or more than 100 sales of property\ndelivered into New York over the next succeeding four quarterly sales tax\nreporting periods, such person will not be presumed to be regularly or\nsystematically soliciting business in the State. Example 19: Company L, located in Montana, was the exclusive\nmanufacturer and retailer of a unique product for which it held a patent. Company L solicited its sales only through advertisements placed in national\ntechnology magazines. All orders were filled from Montana and shipped via\ncommon carrier. Although Company L sold products in New York besides its\npatented product, 90% of its sales in New York were of the patented product. The other 10% of the company's sales were of ancillary products which customers\nordered from Company L as a matter of convenience when placing their main\norder. These other products were readily available from other suppliers. During\nthe period September 1, 1988 through August 31, 1989, Company L had the\nfollowing sales to customers in New York (summarized by quarterly sales tax\nreporting period): Gross Sales In New York\n\nPeriod\n\nNumber of Sales\n\nDollar Amount\n9/1/88 - 11/30/88\n6,200\n$810,000\n12/1/88 - 2/28/89\n600\n$ 52,000\n3/1/89 - 5/31/89\n500\n$ 43,000\n6/1/89 - 8/31/89\n400\n$ 33,000\n\nTotal (9/1/88 - 8/31/89)\n7,700\n$938,000\n\nDue to a technological breakthrough by one of its\ncompetitors in January 1989, Company L's patented product was made obsolete and\ndemand for this product virtually disappeared. News of the demise of Company\nL's product was cited in a technology magazine article featuring the product of\n\nCompany L's competitor. Although Company L's sales activities in New York in the\nlast four sales tax quarters would otherwise require Company L to register as a\nsales tax vendor, as a result of the loss of sales volume from its main\nproduct, Company L can demonstrate that its sales in the next four quarters\nwill not exceed the $300,000/100 transaction threshold. Therefore Company L is\nnot presumed to be a vendor for the period beginning September 1, 1989. (7)\n(i) A person who makes sales of tangible\npersonal property, the use of which is subject to tax, where such person\nretains an ownership interest in the property and the property is brought into\nthis State by the purchaser who is or becomes a resident of this State or uses\nthe property in any manner in carrying on any employment, trade, business or\nprofession in this State, is a vendor. (For registration requirements see\nsection\n539.2\n[g]\nof this Title). (ii)\n\nFor purposes\nof this paragraph, a person retains an ownership interest in tangible personal\nproperty where such person has any right with respect to the use or possession\nof, or dominion and control over, such tangible personal property, such as a\ntitle holder, lessor, sub-lessor, franchisor, sub-franchisor, licensor, sub-licensor, or a trustee of such property. A person who retains a security\ninterest in tangible personal property is not deemed to retain an ownership\ninterest in such property. Example 20: A non-New York Corporation leases a number of motor\nvehicles to a wholly owned subsidiary, also a non-New York Corporation. The\nsubsidiary has the right to, and does, sublease the motor vehicles to a New\n\nYork State company for use in New York State. Since the subsidiary corporation\nalso has the right to lease the motor vehicles, the same right as the parent\ncorporation which is the owner, the subsidiary corporation is deemed to retain\nan ownership interest in such property and is a vendor under section\n1101 (b)(8)(i)(F)\nof the\n\nTax Law. Example 21: ABC Equipment Leasing, Inc., a non-New York corporation\nwhose only place of business is located outside New York State, leases a piece\nof construction equipment to a New York State contractor for one year. The\ncontractor signs the lease and picks up the equipment at ABC Equipment Leasing\n\nInc.'s premises on September 11, 1990 and returns to New York State on\n\nSeptember 14, 1990. ABC Equipment Leasing, Inc. is a vendor as of September 14, 1990, the date the contractor brought the leased equipment into this\n\nState. Example 22: A New York State partnership whose only place of business\nis within New York State agrees to accept a non-New York State resident into\nthe partnership in return for such person's contributing substantial capital, consisting of a computer system, to the partnership. The partnership takes\ndelivery of the computer system outside New York and arranges for delivery of\nthe system to its New York office. The non-New York resident does not receive\nany compensation other than becoming a partner. The contribution of the computer system to the partnership\nfor a partnership interest therein is not subject to sales or use tax in\naccordance with section\n526.6\n(d)(1)(v)\nof this Part. Accordingly, although the new partner retains an ownership\ninterest in the computer system, this partner is not a vendor pursuant to\nsubparagraph (i) of paragraph (7) of this subdivision because the use of the\ncomputer by the partnership is not subject to tax. Example 23: Assume the same facts as in example 22 except that the\nnon-New York resident, in addition to becoming a partner, receives specific\nmonetary reimbursement on a monthly basis as partial reimbursement for\nconveying the computer system to the partnership. The non-New York resident has\nmade a sale of tangible personal property the use of which is taxed by article\n28 of the Tax Law, and has retained an ownership interest. Accordingly, the\nnon-New York resident is a vendor pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (7)\nof this subdivision. Example 24: A non-New York corporation whose only place of business is\nlocated outside New York leases computer equipment to a non-resident of New\n\nYork State for a two-year period. In the second year of the lease, the lessee\nbecomes a New York resident and subsequently brings the computer equipment into\n\nNew York State. The lessor is a vendor as of the date that the lessee brings\nthe equipment into New York. Example 25: A non-resident of New York State leases a motor vehicle\nfrom a non-New York corporation whose only place of business is located outside\n\nNew York State. During the term of the lease, the lessee brings the motor\nvehicle into New York State while on vacation. Although the lessor's property\nin which he has an ownership interest is in New York State, the lessor is not a\nvendor pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (7) of this subdivision. This\nis so because the lessee is not a resident of the State while using the\nproperty in the State and the property is not being used in the carrying on of\nany employment, trade, business or profession in the State. Example 26: A New York State resident leases a motor vehicle for three\nmonths from a non-New York corporation whose only place of business is located\noutside New York. The resident picks up the motor vehicle at the lessor's place\nof business and immediately returns to New York with the vehicle. The\nout-of-state lessor is a vendor when the motor vehicle is brought into New York\n\nState by the resident lessee. Example 27: A non-New York company whose only place of business is\nlocated outside New York State rents and occasionally delivers contracting\nequipment to persons located within New York. Between June 1, 1990 and May 31, 1991, the company delivered rented equipment into New York State on nine\ndifferent occasions. On six other occasions New York residents rented and\npicked up equipment at the lessor's place of business and immediately returned\nto New York with such equipment. Although this company is not presumed to be a\nvendor by virtue of having made regular or systematic deliveries in New York\nwithin the meaning of paragraph (5) of this subdivision, this company is a\nvendor pursuant to subparagraph (i) of paragraph (7) of this subdivision. The\ncompany became a vendor as of the date the first New York resident lessee\nbrought the rented equipment into New York. Cross-reference: For registration requirements of vendors under this\nparagraph see Part 533 and section\n539.2\n(g) of this Title. (8)\n\nAny other person making sales to persons\nwithin the State of tangible personal property or services the use of which is\ntaxed, who may be authorized by the commissioner to collect the tax is a\nvendor. Example 28: A mail-order house that is not otherwise required to\nregister voluntarily registers so that its customers will not be liable for the\ncompensating use tax. (9)\n\nNew York State, including any of its agencies, instrumentalities, or public\ncorporations or political subdivisions is a vendor when such entity sells\nservices or property of a kind ordinarily sold by private persons, including\nsales of food and drink. Example 29: A municipality that makes sales of electricity to its\nresidents is selling a service which is normally sold by private persons\ntherefor, the municipality is a vendor. Example 30: The New York State Thruway Authority auctioning surplus\nvehicles and other property is a vendor because it is selling property of a\nkind ordinarily sold by private persons. (10)\n\nAny organization or entity described in\nsubdivision (a) of section\n1116\nof the Tax Law that makes taxable\nsales described in such section is a vendor. Example 31: A local church, that has an exempt organization certificate\noperates a food booth at a country fair. This is the only time during the year\nthat they operate the booth. The church is considered to be a vendor. Example 32: An exempt organization selling tickets to a fund raising\ndinner at a hotel is not a vendor. Example 33: An exempt organization operating a used furniture store is\na vendor. (11)\n\nThe United\n\nStates, and any of its agencies or instrumentalities and the United Nations, or\nany international organization of which the United States is a member, is a\nvendor when such entity sells in the State services or property of a kind\nordinarily sold by private persons, where authorized by law. (12)\n\nAny salesman, representative, peddler or\ncanvasser whom the commissioner may treat as the agent of the vendor, distributor, supervisor or employer under whom he operates or for whom he\nsolicits business, or from whom he obtains tangible personal property sold by\nhim, in the State is a vendor. Such person may be jointly responsible with his\nprincipal, distributor, supervisor or employer for the collection and payment\nof tax. See subdivision (e) of this section. (b) Responsibilities of vendors. Every vendor, unless specifically excluded by a section of\nthe Tax Law or this Title, has certain obligations with respect to\nregistration, collection of tax from customers, filing of returns and payment\nof tax. See Parts 532, 533, 539 and 540 of this Title. (c) Interstate vendors.
