  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 21 § 10075.10 - Administration and enforcement\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Powers of the general manager. (1)\n\nThe\ngeneral manager is authorized to issue permits in accordance with this Part\nallowing discharge of wastes and stormwater to the B.S.A. POTW or MS4, as the\ncase may be, to validate and issue connection permits, and to prevent illicit\nconnections, activities, and discharges to the MS4. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding any other provisions\nherein, the general manager or his authorized representative is authorized by\nthis Part to take any of the following actions, through a notice of violation\nor otherwise, with respect to users whenever, in his sole discretion, any\nsection of this Part is violated: (i) reject\nthe waste; (ii)\nrequire\npretreatment; (iii)\nrequire a\ncontrol over quantities and rate of discharge; (iv)\nrequire a payment of a surcharge to be\ndetermined by the general manager based on reasonable assessment of the degree\nof violation and/or additional costs of treatment resulting from the\nviolation; (v) require surveillance\nand/or monitoring of discharges and attendant reporting; (vi)\nrequire the development of compliance\nschedules and submission of attendant reports necessary to assure\ncompliance; (vii)\nmodify or revoke\nthe B.P.D.E.S. or any other permit; (viii)\nterminate sewer service; (ix)\nrequire implementation of best\nmanagement practices to control illicit discharges and activities; (x) require the elimination of illicit\nconnections or illicit discharges; (xi)\nrequire cessation of violating\ndischarges, practices or operations; (xii)\nrequire abatement or remediation of\nstormwater pollution or hazardous materials and the restoration of any affected\nproperty; (xiii)\nrequire the\nperformance of monitoring, analyses and reporting; (xiv)\nrequire payment of a fine; (xv)\nseek injunctive relief. (3)\n\nThe owner or operator of a\ncommercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at his own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or\nother wastes into the MS4 through the use of structural and non-structural\nBMPs. (4)\n\nAny person responsible\nfor a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit\ndischarge or an activity contaminating stormwater, may be required to\nimplement, at such person's expense, additional structural and non-structural\nBMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4. (5)\n\nCompliance with all terms and conditions\nof a valid SPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with\nindustrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with\nthe provisions of this section. (6)\n\nIf refused access to private property, the general manager, or his or her\nauthorized representative, may seek a warrant in a court of competent\njurisdiction to be authorized to enter upon the property to determine whether a\nviolation of B.S.A.'s regulations has occurred. Upon determination that a\nviolation has occurred, the general manager or authorized representative may\nseek a court order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate\nthe violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and\nmaintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the person\nresponsible for the property or discharge or violation. (7)\n\nExcept in the event of an emergency, reasonable advance notice of the action to be taken shall be given by the\ngeneral manager but, unless negotiated upon initiation by the user, shall in no\ncase exceed 30 calendar days. Once notice of action is given, the user shall\nhave 10 business days to respond to the charges contained therein or submit a\nresponse contesting the action. (8)\n\nThe general manager reserves the right to terminate or prevent a discharge\nafter informal notice to the discharger to immediately halt a discharge which\nreasonably appears to present imminent endangerment to the health or welfare of\npersons, property of the B.S.A. POTW, MS4 or to the environment. Informal\nnotice shall be followed as soon as practicable by action as provided by this\nsection. (9)\n\nActions to be taken by\nthe general manager shall be documented in the form of a letter, an\nadministrative order, or other document as the general manager may reasonably\ndetermine. (10)\n\nThe general manager\nmay promulgate administrative procedures, technical specifications or guidances\nto implement any and all sections of this Part. These procedures, specifications and guidances shall have the same force and effect as if they\nwere fully set forth in this Part. (b) Illicit discharges in emergency\nsituations. (1)\n\nThe general manager may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such\nsuspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which\npresents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, to\nthe health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The general manager shall\nnotify the person of such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in\nwriting of the reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with\na suspension order issued in an emergency, the general manager may take such\nsteps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to\nminimize danger to persons or the environment. (2)\n\nAny person discharging to the MS4 in\nviolation of this regulation may have their MS4 access terminated if such\ntermination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The general manager\nwill notify a violator in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access\nand the reasons therefor. The violator may petition the general manager for a\nreconsideration and hearing. Access may be granted by the general manager if he\nfinds that the illicit discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps\nto prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if the general manager\ndetermines in writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to\nrecur. A person commits a violation if the person reinstates MS4 access to\npremises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the\ngeneral manager. (c) Suspension of a BPDES permit. (1)\n\nThe general\nmanager may suspend a BPDES permit when such suspension is necessary in the\nopinion of the general manager, in order to stop a discharge which presents a\nhazard to the public health, safety or welfare, to the environment, or to the\nauthority's sewerage system, or causes the authority to violate any condition\nof its N.P.D.E.S./S.P.D.E.S. permit. (2)\n\nAny person notified of a suspension of\nhis BPDES permit shall immediately stop the discharge of all industrial\nwastewater to the B.S.A. system. The general manager shall reinstate the BPDES\npermit upon written proof of satisfactory compliance with all discharge\nrequirements of these regulations. (d) Revocation of a BPDES permit. (1)\n\nThe general manager may revoke a BPDES\npermit upon a finding that the user has violated any provision of his permit or\nof these regulations or applicable Federal or State regulations, including, but\nnot limited to: (i) failure of the industrial\nuser to report accurately the wastewater constituents and characteristics of\nhis discharge; (ii)\nfailure of the\nindustrial user to report significant changes in operation, or wastewater\nconstituents and characteristics; and/or\n(iii)\nrefusal of reasonable access to the\nindustrial user's premises for the purpose of inspection or\nmonitoring. (2)\n\nAny\nperson whose BPDES permit has been revoked shall immediately stop all discharge\nof any wastes covered by the permit to any public sewer that is tributary to a\nsewer or sewer system of the authority. The general manager may disconnect or\npermanently block from such public sewer the industrial connection of any user\nwhose permit has been revoked, if such action is necessary to insure compliance\nwith the order of revocation. (3)\n\nBefore any further discharge of industrial wastewater may be made by the user, he must apply for a new BPDES permit and pay all charges that would be required\nupon initial application together with all delinquent fees, charges and such\nother sums as the discharger may owe to the authority. Costs incurred by the\nauthority in revoking the permit and disconnecting the industrial sewer shall\nbe paid for by the discharger before issuance of a new permit. (e) Violations and civil liability. (1)\n\nWhen the general manager finds that a\nperson has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of these\nregulations, a B.P.D.E.S. permit or other discharge permit or order issued\nhereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the general\nmanager may impose upon such person a penalty in an amount not to exceed\n$10,000, which shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case\nof monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, such penalty shall be\nassessed for each day during the period of violation. Each violation shall be a\nseparate and distinct violation. (2)\n\nUnpaid charges, fines, and penalties\nshall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of 10 percent\nof the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 18\npercent per year. A lien against the person's property is hereby imposed for\nall unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. (3)\n\nPersons desiring to dispute such\npenalties must file a written request with the general manager for a hearing to\npresent evidence why such penalty should not be imposed. Where a request has\nmerit, the general manager may convene a hearing on the matter. The general\nmanager may add the costs of preparing administrative enforcement actions, such\nas notices and orders, to the penalty. (4)\n\nIssuance of an administrative penalty\nshall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action\nagainst the person. (5)\n\nIn\ndetermining the amount of the above fines, the general manager may consider\nfactors such as, but not limited to, the nature of the violation, the magnitude\nof impact on human health, the environment, and/or the B.S.A. treatment plant\noperation caused by the violation, the users past violation record, and other\nrelevant factors. (6)\n\nEach day on\nwhich a violation is found to occur or continue shall be deemed a separate and\ndistinct offense. A day shall consist of a 24-hour period beginning at 12:01\na.m. and ending the following 12:01 a.m. (7)\n\nWhen, in the opinion of the general\nmanager, or the governmental agencies having jurisdiction in the matter, a\nviolation of these regulations is of such a nature as to be likely to cause\ndamage to sewer systems or P.O.T.W. of the Buffalo Sewer Authority, or a threat\nto the health or safety of the inhabitants of any areas served, the Buffalo\n\nSewer Authority may forthwith discontinue and sever any connections with its\nsewer system without any liability for prosecution or damages. (f) Falsification of data. User\nrepresentatives providing information and data as required for any application, record, report, plan, or other document required by these regulations shall be\nsubject to the provisions of section 309(c)(2) of the Clean Water Act governing\nfalse statements, representations, or certifications. (g) Notifications. (1)\n\nAny person found in violation of these\nregulations or of any limitation or requirement of a permit issued hereunder, shall be served, by the general manager, with a written notice (except in the\ncase of an emergency situation) stating the nature of the violation and\nidentifying the enforcement actions which will or may be taken. Within 30 days\nof the date of notice, the person in violation shall submit a plan for\ncorrective actions to be taken to prevent continuance or reoccurrence of the\nviolation. (2)\n\nIn the event of an\nemergency situation (as determined by the general manager), the general manager\nis required only to give an informal notice in order to immediately and\neffectively halt a discharge which presents an imminent endangerment to the\nauthority's facilities, the environment, or the health and welfare of\npersons. (h) Show cause\nhearing. (1)\n\nIn the event of violation of any\nprovision of the regulations by a user, either the authority or the user may\nrequest a hearing to show cause why enforcement action should not be taken. A\nnotice shall be served on the user designating the time and place of the\nhearing to be held regarding the violations, the reasons why the action is to\nbe taken, the proposed enforcement action, and requesting the user to show\ncause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. (2)\n\nThe authority may issue notice of such\nhearings requesting the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the\nproduction of evidence relevant to any matter involved in such hearings. Testimony will be taken under oath, recorded, and kept on file for inspection\nby the public or any interested party. (3)\n\nEnforcement actions, if any, taken by the\nauthority subsequent to the hearing shall be based upon the evidence presented. If the person in violation has failed to show cause why enforcement action\nshould not be taken, the authority shall issue a directive to the user\nresponsible for the violation specifying the remedial action to be taken and a\nschedule for completion of this action. Further orders and directives relative\nto the assessment of a fine(s), enforcement actions to be carried out, and/or\nother corrective actions required may also be issued. (i) Legal action. If any user discharges into\nthe authority's facilities in a manner which violates any provision of these\nregulations, Federal or State pretreatment requirements, or any orders of the\nauthority, the B.S.A. may initiate an action to seek injunctive\nrelief. (j) Violations deemed a\npublic nuisance. In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties\nprovided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the\nprovisions of this regulation is a threat to public health, safety, and\nwelfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or\nrestored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or\notherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken. (k) Improper use of sewers. (1)\n\nThe Buffalo Sewer Authority hereby\nreserves the right to inspect any existing building service sewer and drain, lateral or collecting sewers that discharge wastewater directly or indirectly\nto the authority's facilities. If it is found that such laterals or collecting\nsewers are used or maintained in such a way as to cause discharge of septic\nwastewater or groundwater and debris which exceeds the design criteria of said\nsewer, or any other substance deemed objectionable by the general manager, the\ngeneral manager will give notice of the unsatisfactory condition to the\noffending discharger and shall direct that the condition be\ncorrected. (2)\n\nIn cases of\ncontinued noncompliance with the general manager's directive, the Buffalo Sewer\n\nAuthority may disconnect the said sewer from the authority' s sewerage system\nwithout any liability for prosecution or damages. (l) Excessive sewer maintenance expense. (1)\n\nSewer or sewerage maintenance expenses\nwhich result from a user violation of any of the prohibited or limited\ndischarge requirements in these regulations will be charged to the user in\nviolation. Such maintenance may include but not be limited to stoppage, plugging, breakage, any reduction in sewer capacity or any other damage to\nsewers or sewerage facilities of the authority. The costs charged to the user\nin violation may include the costs and expenses for complete restoration of the\nimpaired facilities to a functional condition. (2)\n\nRefusal of the user in violation to pay\nthe necessary maintenance expenses resulting from such violation shall\nconstitute further violation of these regulations subject to a fine as defined\nin subdivision (c) in this section. (m) Damage caused by prohibited waste\ndischarge. Any industrial wastewater discharger who discharges, or causes the\ndischarge, of prohibited wastewaters which cause damage to the authority's\nfacilities, detrimental effects on treatment processes or any other damages\nresulting in costs to the sewer authority, shall be liable for all damage\noccasioned thereby. (n) Discrepancies between actual and reported surchargeable waste quantities. (1)\n\nWhen inspection or verification\nmonitoring or other investigation by B.S.A. reveals a user's surchargeable\nwaste constituents and/or waste volume to be substantially greater (20 percent\ngreater) than reported in that user's most recent discharge monitoring report\nsubmitted and approved by B.S.A. for purpose of surcharge calculation, then the\nuser may be required to resample for purpose of amending the surcharge\ncalculation. At least three, 24-hour composite samples and flow measurements\nshall be obtained and analyzed in accordance with the B.S.A. Sampling and\n\nAnalytical Guidelines Sheet (see Appendix 52 of this Title), either by the\nauthority or by another independent laboratory acceptable to both parties, with\nall costs of sampling and analysis to be paid by the user. This new sample data\nalong with any other relevant information or data obtained by the authority or\nsubmitted by the user shall be used to calculate a corrected surcharge\naccording to the formula set forth in the B.S.A. Schedule of Sewer Rents and\n\nOther Charges (see Appendix 52 of this Title). (2)\n\nSurcharges corrected on the basis of\nsubstantially greater surchargeable waste constituents shall be applicable to\nthe period following the time when inspection, verification or other\ninvestigation revealed the discrepancy. Surcharges for periods preceding any\nsurcharge amendment shall be based on the last set of data submitted by the\nuser and approved by the B.S.A. for purpose of surcharge calculation. (o) Annual publication of\nviolators. At least annually, the Buffalo Sewer Authority shall publish a\nlisting of all significant violators of the pretreatment standards and\nrequirements. Notes\nN.Y.
