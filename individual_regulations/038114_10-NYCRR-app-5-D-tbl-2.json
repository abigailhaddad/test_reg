Where well water sources may be potentially influenced by surface water, appropriate water quality testing shall be done in accordance with Department guidance to determine if the well water source is directly influenced by surface water. 2\nCWS means community water system as defined in 10 NYCRR Subpart\n5-1. NTNCWS means nontransient noncommunity water system as defined in 10 NYCRR Subpart\n5-1. TNCWS means a public water system that is neither a CWS nor a NTNCWS. 3\n\nSpecified duration is the minimum required pumping period and must include a minimum of six hours of stabilized drawdown at the end of the test except as allowed under subdivision 5-D.4(d) of this Appendix. 4\nLHD means local health department as defined in Appendix 5-B. 5\n\nFor wells located in areas that have the potential to draw water from carbonate aquifers, the local health department may determine based upon a hydrogeologic assessment, records of well logs, and/or other local geologic data that the aquifer is unlikely to show a surface water influence associated with karst topography. Where such determination is made, GWUDI testing need not be done. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
