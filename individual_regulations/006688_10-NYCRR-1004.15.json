  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 1004.15 - Pricing\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Definitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms have the\nfollowing meanings: (1)\n\nCost\nanalysis\nshall mean the review and evaluation of the separate cost\nelements and profit of a proposed price and the application of judgment to\ndetermine how well the proposed costs represent what the price per unit for\napproved medical marihuana products should be, assuming reasonable economy and\nefficiency. (2)\n\nPrice\nshall mean the cost to manufacture, market and\ndistribute approved medical marihuana products plus a reasonable\nprofit. (b) Department approval required. A registered organization shall only charge a price for an\napproved medical marihuana product that has been approved by the\ndepartment. (c) Determination of price. The department shall set the per unit price of each form of\napproved medical marihuana product sold by any registered organization, as\nfollows: (1)\n\nRegistered organizations\nshall submit a proposed price per unit for each form of medical marihuana\nindicated in its registration. Registered organizations shall submit such\ninformation and documentation, in a manner and format determined by the\ndepartment, sufficient for the department to perform a cost analysis of the\nproposed price. In particular, the registered organization shall, in a manner\nand format determined by the department, provide a detailed breakdown of, and\nsubmit information and documentation concerning, all costs it factored to\narrive at its proposed price, including but not limited to its fixed and\nvariable costs such as materials and services; direct labor; and indirect\ncosts. (2)\n\nThe registered\norganization shall provide cost or pricing data that is accurate and reliable, and shall certify, at the time of submission of its price proposal, that to the\nbest of its knowledge and belief, the cost or pricing data were accurate, complete, and current as of the date of submission. (3)\n\nThe department shall determine the\nreasonableness of the proposed costs. In making this determination, the\ndepartment may consider whether the costs represent inefficient and\nuneconomical practices; are not costs appropriately attributable to the price; and/or are costs unsupported by sufficient documentation or information to\njustify their inclusion in the proposed price. If the registered organization\nhas been granted a renewal of its registration, any relevant historical price, cost and/or sales data of the registered organization; and any other\ninformation the commissioner deems appropriate. (4)\n\nThe department may approve the proposed\nprice, refuse approval of a proposed price, or modify or reduce the proposed\nprice. (d) Examination of records for determination of price. The registered organization shall grant the department or the\ndepartment's authorized representative the right to examine records that formed\nthe basis for the proposed price, including the registered organization's\nbooks, records, documents and other types of factual information that will\npermit an adequate evaluation of the proposed price. (e) Correction of insufficient price\ndata. If the registered organization or department determines that\nthe cost or pricing data submitted is inaccurate, incomplete or noncurrent\nprior to the department's approval of the price, the registered organization\nshall submit new data to correct the deficiency, or consider the inaccuracy, incompleteness, or noncurrency of the data. (f) Duration of price\ndetermination. The department's approved price shall be in effect for the\nentire period of the registered organization's registration; provided, however, that at the conclusion of the first year of the registration period, or prior\nto that time based upon documented exceptional circumstances, the registered\norganization may request that the price be modified based upon a material\nchange in the registered organization's costs. The registered organization\nshall fully support its request with sufficient information and documentation, in a manner and format determined by the department, to justify its request. If\nthe department denies such request, the registered organization shall only\ncharge prices previously approved by the department. (g) Adjustments to determined\nprice. If the department has approved a price, the registered\norganization shall immediately notify the department of any cost or pricing\ndata submitted that it determines was inaccurate, incomplete, or noncurrent as\nof the date of the department's approval of the price. If the registered\norganization provides such notice, or if the department independently learns of\nsuch inaccurate, incomplete or noncurrent data, the department may require the\nregistered organization to provide new data to correct the deficiency, or\nconsider the inaccuracy, incompleteness, or noncurrency of the data. The\ndepartment may adjust the price per dose if the defective data significantly\nincreased the price approved by the department. (h) Audits. The department may perform audits, which may include site\nvisits. The registered organization shall provide reasonable access to the\ndepartment of its facilities, books and records. Notes\nN.Y.
