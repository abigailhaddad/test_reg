The following rules and regulations enacted under the authority of article 11 of the Public Health Law, and of the whole thereof, as last amended by chapter 879 of the Laws of 1953, shall apply to all existing wells and such additional wells and reservoirs on the property of the Village of Mount Kisco and to Byram Lake and its tributaries which now serve or which may be developed in the future to serve as sources of the public water supply of the Village of Mount Kisco and to all watercourses tributary thereto or ultimately discharging into said reservoirs. (b) Definitions. (1)\n\nThe term water supply means the public water supply of the Village of Mount Kisco. (2)\n\nThe term well means any well now used as a source of the water supply of the Village of Mount Kisco or any additional well which may be constructed on the property of the Village of Mount Kisco. (3)\n\nThe term watercourse means every spring, pond (other than reservoirs), stream, marsh or channel of any kind, the waters of which flow or may flow into this water supply. (4)\n\nThe term reservoir includes any natural or artificial lake or pond. (5)\n\nThe linear distance of a structure or object from a well, reservoir or watercourse is the shortest horizontal distance from the nearest point of the structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to the edge, margin or precipitous bank forming the ordinary high-water mark of such watercourse. (6)\n\nThe term human excreta means feces, urine and other excretions commonly disposed of by the so-called dry system as typified by the ordinary privy. (7)\n\nThe term sewage means waste liquids containing human excreta and decomposing matter flowing in or from a house drainage system or sewer. (c) [Human excreta.]\n(1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be deposited, thrown or placed or allowed to escape into any well, reservoir or watercourse. (2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be placed or spread upon the surface of the ground at any point on the watershed of the water supply. (3)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of the water supply, unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 200 feet from any well, reservoir or tributary watercourse and covered with not less than 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow. (4)\n\nNo privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta shall be constructed, placed, maintained or allowed to remain within 200 feet of any well or within 50 feet of any reservoir or tributary watercourse except a properly constructed and operated sewage disposal plant, as hereinafter set forth in paragraph (1) of subdivision (d), provided, however, that the property on which the privy or receptacle is built or is to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances above named can be obtained within the limits of such property. (5)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta, built or to be built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances named in paragraph (4) of this subdivision cannot be obtained, shall be placed as far as possible from any well, reservoir or watercourse and especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from any well, reservoir or watercourse. All privies or receptacles within the limiting distances referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval and under the supervision of the board of trustees of the village of Mount Kisco and in such manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the public water supply. (6)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle for the storage or deposit of human excreta located within the distances of 50 feet and 200 feet of any well, reservoir or tributary watercourse shall be arranged so that all excreta will be received in a suitable watertight receptacle or removable container, which shall be emptied when filled within six inches of the top. The contents, if disposed of on the watershed, shall be buried as set forth in paragraph (3) of this subdivision. (7)\n\nWhenever, in the opinion of the board of trustees of the village of Mount Kisco or of the State or Westchester County Commissioner of Health, excremental matter from the aforesaid privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal may be washed over the surface of the ground or through the soil in an imperfectly purified condition into any well, reservoir or watercourse, the said privy, receptacle, trench or place of disposal shall be removed, after due notice to the owner thereof, to such places as shall be considered safe and proper by the board of trustees of the village of Mount Kisco or the State or Westchester County Commissioner of Health. (d) [Sewage, sink wastes, garbage, etc.]\n(1)\n\nNo sewage shall be discharged or allowed to flow into any reservoir or tributary watercourse nor deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 50 feet of any reservoir or tributary watercourse, except into watertight receptacles, the contents of which shall be disposed of as provided for by paragraph (3) of subdivision (c). If such watertight receptacles are used, they shall not be located within 25 feet of any reservoir or tributary watercourse provided, however, that the property on which the receptacle is built or to be built is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distances above named can be obtained within the limits of the property. In such case, the watertight receptacle shall be constructed and maintained as provided for in paragraph (5) of subdivision (c). These restrictions and limiting distances shall not apply to sewage treatment plants installed under and in accordance with plans which first have been submitted to and approved by the State or Westchester County Commissioner of Health. (2)\n\nNo bath water, sink or laundry wastes or polluted liquid of any kind, except the effluent from a properly constructed and operated sewage treatment plant as hereinbefore provided by paragraph (1) of this subdivision, shall be discharged or allowed to flow into the well, reservoir or any watercourse nor be deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 50 feet of any reservoir or tributary watercourse. (3)\n\nNo garbage, refuse, putrescible matter, decayed fuits [FN*] or vegetables, dead animals or parts thereof or any other matter that pollutes water shall be deposited in any well, reservoir or watercourse nor on or beneath the surface of the ground within 50 feet of any well, reservoir or tributary watercourse nor in such manner that it can be washed by rain, melting snow or otherwise over the surface or through the ground into any well, reservoir or watercourse. (e) [Bathing, boating, animals, manure, etc.]\n(1)\n\nNo person or persons shall bathe or swim or be allowed to bathe or swim in any reservoir or tributary watercourse owned by and which is a part of the public water supply of the village of Mount Kisco.

(3)\n\nNo animal or poultry shall be allowed to stand, wade, wallow or swim nor to be washed or watered in any reservoir or any tributary watercourse and no watering place shall be maintained in such a way as to pollute any well, reservoir or tributary watercourse with excremental matter. (4)\n\nNo stable for cattle or horses, barnyard, hogyard, pigpen, poultry house or yard, hitching place or standing place for horses or other animals shall be so located or maintained in such a manner that the drainage, leachings or washings therefrom may pollute any well, reservoir or any tributary watercourse.
