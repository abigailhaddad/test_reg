  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.511 - Test requirements for service lines\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Except for steel service lines greater\nthan two inches (51 millimeters) in nominal diameter that are to operate at 125\npsig (862 kPa) or more, each segment of a service line must be leak tested in\naccordance with this section before being placed into service. (b) Steel service lines greater than two\ninches (51 millimeters) in nominal diameter that are to operate at 125 psig\n(862 kPa) or more must be tested in accordance with section\n255.505\n(a)-(f)\nof\nthis Part. (c) Except for copper\nservice lines, the test pressure shall be 90 psig (621 kPa) or 1.5 times the\nmaximum operating pressure, whichever is greater; however, the maximum test\npressure and material temperature during the test for plastic service lines\nmust be in accordance with section\n255.507\n(b) of\nthis Part. (d) For copper service\nlines, the test pressure shall be 50 psig (345 kPa) or 1.5 times the maximum\noperating pressure, whichever is greater; however, the maximum test pressure\nmay not be more than three times the design pressure for the pipe. (e) The test medium shall be water, inert gas\nor air. (f) The test duration shall\nbe as follows: (1)\nfor service lines two\ninches (51 millimeters) and smaller to operate at less than 125 psig (862 kPa), 15 minutes; (2)\nfor service lines\ntwo inches (51 millimeters) and smaller to operate at 125 psig (862 kPa) or\nmore, two hours; or\n(3)\nfor service\nlines greater than two inches (51 millimeters) to operate at less than 125 psig\n(862 kPa), 30 minutes. (g) The limits of the test shall be from the\nmain to one of the following points; (1)\nin\nthe case of an inside meter or meter-regulator setting, the first fitting\ninside the wall of the customer's structure through which the service\nenters; (2)\nin the case of an\noutside meter or meter-regulator setting, to the meter riser valve, if any, or\nthe first fitting on the riser upstream of the regulator where one is\ninstalled; or\n(3)\nin the case of an\ninside meter with an outside regulator; to the first fitting on the riser\nupstream of the regulator. (h) The service line connection to the main\nneed not be included in these tests if it is not feasible to be so. However, it\nmust be given a leakage test at operating pressure when placed in\nservice. (i) The test indicator for\nservice line tests shall be a calibrated pressure gauge marked in five psig\n(34.5 kPa) increments for service lines to operate at 100 psig (689 kPa) or\nmore. For tests on lines to operate at less than 100 psig (689 kPa), the test\nindicator must be such that any loss of pressure can be readily\ndetected. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.511\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
