  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 231-1.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose\nof this Subpart, the general definitions of Part 200 of this Title\napply. (b) For the purpose of this\n\nSubpart, the following definitions also apply: (1)\n\nActual emission reduction. The actual\ndecrease in the rate of emissions of an air contaminant from an emission source\nin tons per year. This value is generally an average rate at which the source\nactually emitted the contaminant during the two years preceding the reduction, and is representative of normal source operation based on actual operating\nhours, production rates and material input. A different averaging time period\nmay be acceptable if it can be shown to be more representative of normal\noperation than the two-year period preceding the reductions. (2)\n\nAir contamination source project. This\nmay consist of either a proposed: (i) new air\ncontamination source; (ii)\nmodification; or\n(iii)\ntwo or more\nproposed new air contamination sources which are interdependent as process or\nproduction steps for a common product or similar products. (3)\n\nAnnual actual emissions. The annual\nemissions, including fugitive emissions, of an air contaminant from a facility\nafter control equipment has been applied and based on continuous operation at\nmaximum capacity. Annual actual emissions may be limited by permit conditions\nregarding operating time or production rate. (4)\n\nDe minimis emission limits. Threshold\nincrease in annual actual emissions from an air contamination source project\nbelow which the provisions of this Subpart do not apply. The de minimis\nemission limits are presented in section\n231-1.9\nof this Subpart. (5)\n\nEmission offsets. Emissions reductions\nwhich are obtained to provide reasonable progress toward attainment of ambient\nair quality standards in exchange for approval of an application for a permit\nto construct for a new air contamination source project in a nonattainment\narea. (6)\n\nMajor facility. A\nfacility whose annual actual emissions for either particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, or volatile organic compounds equal or exceed\n100 tons per year. (7)\n\nMajor lead\nfacility. A facility whose annual actual emissions of lead equal or exceed five\ntons per year. (8)\n\nResource\nrecovery facility. Any facility at which refuse is combusted for the purpose of\nrecovering heat for use in producing steam and/or electricity. Energy\nconversion facilities must utilize solid waste to provide more than 50 percent\nof the heat input to qualify as a resource recovery facility. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6\n§§\n231-1.1\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
