(b) It shall be unlawful\nfor any person to remove or attempt to remove any tenant or occupant from any\nhousing accommodations, or to refuse to renew the lease or agreement for the\nuse of such accommodations, because such tenant or occupant has taken, or\nproposes to take, action authorized or required by the Rent Law, or any\nprovision of the Administrative Code of the City of New York, the Multiple\n\nDwelling Law, or the Health Code of the City of New York, or any regulation, order or requirement thereunder. (c) (1)\n\nNo\ntenant of any housing accommodations (as defined in subdivision [f] or [g] of\nsection\n2200.2\nof this Title) shall be\nremoved or evicted, unless and until such removal or eviction has been\nauthorized by a court of competent jurisdiction. (2)\n\nExcept as hereinafter provided, this\nsubdivision shall not apply where the removal or eviction is for nonpayment of\nrent and involves a hotel tenant or an occupant of one or more rooms in a\nrooming house (which meets all requirements of law and the city agencies having\njurisdiction thereof) who has not been in possession for 30 consecutive days or\nlonger, and who occupies his accommodations on a daily or weekly basis, provided the landlord shall give written notice thereof to the tenant at least\nthree days prior to the date specified therein for surrender of possession and\nprior to any action for removal or eviction. In computing the three-day period, the date of service and any intervening Sunday shall be excluded. Every such\nnotice shall include therein a statement of the rent due and the rental period\nor periods for which said rent is due. An exact copy of any such notice, together with an affidavit of service, shall be filed with the district rent\noffice within 48 hours after such notice is given to the tenant. Should the\ntenant tender the rent due within the three-day period, the landlord may not\nremove or evict the tenant. The service of a three-day notice for the removal\nor eviction for nonpayment of rent shall not be required where the landlord\ninstitutes judicial proceedings to remove or evict the tenant. (d) Any statutory tenant who\nvacates the housing accommodations, without giving the landlord at least 30\ndays' written notice by registered or certified mail of this intention to\nvacate, shall be liable to the landlord for the loss of rent suffered by the\nlandlord, but not exceeding one month's rent, except where the tenant has been\nremoved or vacates pursuant to the provisions of this Part. Such notice shall\nbe postmarked on or before the last day of the rental period immediately prior\nto such 30-day period. (e) Notwithstanding any provision of this Part, the State, the city, or the New\n\nYork City Housing Authority may recover possession of any housing\naccommodations operated by it where such action or proceeding is authorized by\nstatute or regulations under which such accommodations are\nadministered.
