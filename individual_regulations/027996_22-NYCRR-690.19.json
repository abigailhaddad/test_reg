Tit. 22 § 690.19 - Petition for advance ruling with respect to past conduct\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Any person who is a\nmatriculated student in an approved law school, as an approved law school is\ndefined in the rules of the Court of Appeals for the admission of attorneys and\ncounselors at law, or who has applied for admission to such a law school, and\nwho has previously been (1) convicted of a felony or misdemeanor, or (2)\nsuspended, removed or dismissed from public office or employment, or (3)\ndishonorably discharged from the armed services of the United States, may\npetition the Appellate Division of the department in which such person resides\nor is employed full-time, or, if such person does not reside and is not\nemployed full-time in the State, the Appellate Division of the Third\n\nDepartment, for an advance ruling, in accordance with this section, as to\nwhether such conviction, suspension, removal or dismissal from public office or\nemployment, or dishonorable discharge, as the case may be, would operate to\ndisqualify the petitioner, on character grounds, from being admitted to\npractice as an attorney and counselor at law in this State. (b) The petition shall include\na detailed statement of the facts with respect to the petitioner's conviction, suspension, dismissal or removal from public office or employment, or\ndishonorable discharge, as the case may be, and of the petitioner's activities\nsubsequent thereto which the petitioner believes bear on character and fitness\nto practice law. (c) The petitioner shall also submit a completed and verified questionnaire, on the\nstandard form furnished by the committee on character and fitness, and\naffidavits of good moral character from two reputable persons who have known\nthe petitioner for at least one year. In addition, the petitioner shall submit\na letter from a person in authority at the approved law school in which the\npetitioner is a matriculated student, or to which the petitioner has applied\nfor admission, stating that such law school would retain or accept the\npetitioner as a student therein, as the case may be, if the petitioner's\nconviction, suspension, dismissal or removal from public office or employment, or dishonorable discharge, as the case may be, would not operate to disqualify\nthe petitioner from being admitted to practice as an attorney and counselor at\nlaw in this State. (d) The petition and other papers\nsubmitted by the petitioner shall be referred to the appropriate committee on\ncharacter and fitness, which shall process and investigate the petition in\naccordance with the procedures set forth in the preceding sections of this\n\nPart. The committee may recommend that a ruling be made either in favor of or\nagainst the petitioner, or that no ruling be made, and its recommendation shall\nbe transmitted to the Appellate Division. (e) A ruling made by the Appellate\n\nDivision in favor of the petitioner shall determine that the petitioner's prior\nconviction, suspension, removal or dismissal from public office or employment, or dishonorable discharge, as the case may be, and the acts committed by the\npetitioner which resulted therein, would not operate to disqualify the\npetitioner, on character grounds, from being admitted to practice as an\nattorney and counselor at law in this State. Such a ruling shall have binding\nforce throughout the State with respect to the determination thus made by it. In the event that the Appellate Division should rule against the petitioner or\nshould refuse to make a ruling, its determination shall be without prejudice to\nthe petitioner's right, after passing the bar examination, to apply for a\nfavorable ruling with respect to character and fitness.
