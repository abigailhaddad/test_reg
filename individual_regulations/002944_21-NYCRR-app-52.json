GENERAL PROVISIONS\n(a) In the event a person, lot, parcel of land, building or\npremises discharging sewage, water or other liquids into the Authority sewer\nsystem, either directly or indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the\n\nBuffalo Water Board, and the quantity of water used is not measured by a water\nmeter acceptable to the Authority, then the sewer charge or rental for all such\naccounts shall be in the respective amounts (expressed in dollars) set forth in\n\nExhibit A, attached hereto and made a part hereof, as the Authority determines\napplicable to such person, lot, parcel of land, building or premises. (b) In addition to all other rentals and charges provided\nherein, a monthly drainage connection service charge shall be due for any and\nall persons, lots, parcels of land, building or premises, other than a City\ndepartment, that discharge sewage, water or other liquids into the Authority\nsewer system, either directly or indirectly, as follows: 1. A monthly charge of $6.00 shall be due for all lots, parcels, land, buildings or premises where the quantity of water used is not\nmeasured by a meter acceptable to the Authority. 2. A monthly charge in the amounts set forth below shall be due\nfor all lots, parcels, land, building or premises where the quantity of water\nused is measured by a meter acceptable to the Authority in accordance with the\nfollowing meter size: Residential\n\nUsers\n\nNon-Residential\n\nUsers\n\nMeter Size\n\nCharge ($)\n\nMeter Size\n\nCharge ($)\n5/8 inch\n6.00\n5/8 inch\n6.00\n3/4 inch\n6.00\n3/4 inch\n6.00\n1 inch\n6.00\n1 inch\n6.00\n11/2 inch\n6.00\n11/2 inch\n55.00\n2 inch\n6.00\n2 inch\n55.00\n3 inch\n55.00\n3 inch\n55.00\n4 inch or larger\n55.00\n4 inch or larger\n55.00\n(c) In the event a person, lot, parcel of land, building or\npremises discharging sewage, water or other liquids into the Authority sewer\nsystem, which directly or indirectly, uses water obtained from a source other\nthan the Buffalo Water Board, and the water so obtained is not measured by a\nwater meter acceptable to the Authority, then, in each such case, the owner, user or other interested party shall, at his own expense, furnish, install, and\nmaintain a water meter or other water or sewage measuring device acceptable to\nthe Authority and the quantity of water used, as measured by said meter, or as\notherwise determined, shall be used to determine the sewer charge or rental and\nthere shall be charged an amount determined as set forth in paragraphs II(a), III(a) and III(b) as the case may be. (d) In the event a person, lot, parcel of land, building or\npremises discharging sewage, water or other liquids into the Authority sewer\nsystem, either directly or indirectly, uses water in excess of 4,000 cubic feet\nper quarter year and it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Authority, that\na portion of the water as measured by the water meter does not and cannot enter\nthe Authority sewer system, then the Authority may determine in such manner as\nmay be found practicable the percentage of metered water entering the Authority\nsewer system and the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge or\nrental shall be that percentage, so determined, of the quantity of water\nmeasured by the water meter, or the Authority may require or permit the\ninstallation of additional meters or measuring devices in such a manner as to\ndetermine the quantity of water or sewage actually entering the Authority sewer\nsystem, in which case the quantity of water used to determine the sewer charge\nor rental shall be the quantity of water actually entering the Authority sewer\nsystem and so determined. (e) In the event a person, lot, parcel of land, building or\npremises discharges sewage or other wastes into the Authority sewer system\nwhich, in the opinion of the Authority, contain unduly high concentrations or\nany substances which add to the operating costs of the Authority facilities, then the Authority may elect to establish and collect special rates of charge, based on the quantity of these substances, which rate of charge may be\nestablished and collected in such manner as the Authority may elect and such\ncharge shall be paid to the Authority, or it may elect to exclude such sewage\nor other wastes from its facilities. (f) As a condition of a Buffalo Discharge Elimination System\n\nPermit (BPDES), a user may be required to pay an industrial waste surcharge for\ndischarging sewage or waste exhibiting a strength of sewage or waste greater\nthan normal domestic sewage. The Industrial Waste Surcharge Formula reflecting\nthe Treatment Plant unit costs for treatment of Biochemical Oxygen Demand\n(BOD\n5\n) Total Suspended Solids (TSS) and Total Phosphate\n(TPO\n4\n) is as follows: Surcharge = 8.34 QMGY (0.1855 (BOD\n5\n-250)\n+ 0.2079 (TSS-250) + 0.0203 (TPO\n4\n-15.35))\n$0.1855 Cost/lb. for treatment of BOD\n5\n$0.2079 Cost/lb. for treatment of TSS $0.0203 Cost/lb. for treatment of\nTPO\n4\nQMGY shall mean the annual total industrial and sanitary\ndischarge - water retention. BOD\n5\nshall mean the average\nconcentration of BOD\n5\nin sewage or waste discharged to\nthe Authority facilities. TSS shall mean the average concentration of TSS in sewage or\nwaste discharged to the Authority facilities. TPO\n4\nshall mean the average\nconcentration of TPO\n4\nin sewage or waste discharged to\nthe Authority facilities. Surchargeable concentrations are as follows: BOD\n5\n- Over 250 mg/L; TSS - Over 250\nmg/L; TPO\n4\n- Over 15.35 mg/L\nThis formula shall be applied in computing the Buffalo\n\nIndustrial Waste Surcharge subsequent to July 1, 2020 and ending June 30, 2021\nfor all users that discharge sewage or waste exhibiting a strength of sewage or\nwaste greater than normal domestic sewage. In addition, this formula with the\nabove rates will be used to calculate all monthly, quarterly, semiannual, and\nannual accounts subsequent to July 1, 2021. (g) Any person who violates the Sewer Regulations of the\n\nAuthority or the conditions of the permits issued thereunder shall be subject\nto fines as specified in said regulations. (h) Whenever sewage or other wastes result in conditions in the\n\nAuthority sewer system as to cause blockage or a substantial reduction in the\nflow, charges for the work necessary to eliminate such blockage or reduction in\nflow may be made, based upon costs incurred by the Authority for labor, materials, equipment hire, insurances, and other overhead, against the owner of\nthe property or premises that caused the discharge of such sewage or other\nwastes into the Authority sewer system. (i) Where sewer facilities have been installed to serve\nimproved and unimproved property and have been paid for in whole or in part by\nthe Authority, a charge shall be made based on a proportionate share of the\noriginal cost, determined by the foot frontage of the parcel served, or by the\narea of such parcels, or by such other method the Authority determines to be\nequitable, as a condition to a permit for a connection to the Authority's\nfacilities. (j) An application and inspection fee for sewer connection\npermits shall be paid as follows at the time said application is filed with the\n\nAuthority: Tap Size\n\nFee ($)\n4 inch\n100\n6 inch\n200\n8 inch\n300\n10 inch\n500\n12 inch\n800\n15 inch\n1,200\n18 inch\n1,800\n21 inch or greater\n2,500\n(k) An application fee of $50 per 2,500 square feet or part\nthereof of soil disturbance or impervious area being drained, whichever is\ngreater, shall be paid at time of plans and/or calculations are submitted to\nthe Authority for site stormwater management review. (l) An application fee of $150 plus $25 for every 100 linear\nfeet or part thereof of new sanitary sewer pipe proposed shall be paid at the\ntime that plans and/or calculations are submitted to the authority for any\nfacility proposing to discharge 2,500 gallons per day or more of additional\nsanitary and/or industrial flow than existing conditions. (m) All persons owning or operating a pump truck or other\ntransport vehicle and desiring to discharge wastes, directly or indirectly, into the Authority's facilities shall first secure a valid Truckers Discharge\n\nPermit after paying an annual permit fee of $120.00. In addition to said permit\nfee, a separate charge shall be billed based upon the verified quantity or\ntruck capacity, and character of the waste discharged and, if applicable, the\npoint of discharge. The following surcharge rates are hereby charged for such\nwastehaulers who are located outside the City: DISCHARGE LOCATION\nTOTAL SUSPENDED\nSOLIDS\nBOD\n5\nTOTAL\nPHOSPHATE\nInlet/South Buffalo Pump\n$0.1969/lb. $0.1748/lb. $0.0271/lb. Mixing Tank\n$0.1626/lb. $0.0998/lb. $0.0271/lb. Thickener/Digester\n$0.1749/lb. $0.1065/lb. $0.0271/lb. The above surcharge rates, along with costs incurred by the\n\nAuthority when handling, testing, conveying, and administering each\nwastehauler, will be used to determine the cost per gallon of each wastestream. The wastehauler user charges for various wastestreams are as follows: 1. Septage and portable toilet wastes\n- The\nrate of $0.04 per gallon discharged will be assigned to all permitted septage\nand portable toilet wastehaulers. 2. Grease trap wastes\n- The rate of $0.05 per\ngallon discharged will be assigned to all permitted grease trap\nwastehaulers. 3. Sludge wastes\n- This rate will vary\ndependent on strength and volume. Sludge rates will be calculated using the\nparameter costs for the mixing tank location. 4. Miscellaneous Wastes\n-This rate will vary\ndependent on strength of waste, volume and discharge location. These rates will be used for all permits effective July 1, 2021. (n) In the event a person, lot, parcel of land, building or\npremises threatens to discharge or discharges sewage or waste into or near the\n\nAuthority's publicly owned treatment works, either directly or indirectly, which in the opinion of the Authority will or is likely to bypass, upset, harm\nor endanger the facilities of the Authority, then such person or the owner or\noperator of such lot, parcel of land, building or premises shall pay to the\n\nAuthority charges for any and all clean up, removal and remediation costs\nactually incurred by the Authority, including but not limited to labor, materials, equipment, insurances or laboratory services for the (i) containment\nor attempted containment of such discharge or threatened discharge, (ii)\nsampling and analysis of such discharge or threatened discharge, (iii) removal\nor attempted removal of such discharge or threatened discharge, (iv) taking of\nreasonable measures to prevent or mitigate damage to property, public health, safety or welfare, or (v) remediation, treatment, storage or disposal of such\ndischarge or threatened discharge and all soils, water or structures affected\nby such discharge. (o) All industrial users and wastehaulers shall pay to the\n\nAuthority a charge for the actual costs of analysis incurred by the Authority\nfor monitoring of any and all discharges of such users. (p) Any person who is granted a temporary permit to discharge\ninto the facilities of the Authority shall pay a permit fee of $800.00 to the\n\nAuthority as a condition of the issuance of such permit. (q) Except as otherwise defined herein, all terms and phrases\nused or contained in this schedule of sewer rents shall bear the same meaning\nand definition as set forth in the Authority's Sewer Use Regulations 21\nN.Y.C.R.R. Part\n10075\nand New York Public Authorities Law Section 1175\net seq. (r) Sewer rents and charges as herein provided shall be payable\nat the office of the Director of the Treasury for the City at Room 117, City\n\nHall, Buffalo, New York 14202, or at such other location or address as may be\nset forth on the Authority's invoice, and shall become due and payable as\nfollows: 1. So much of the sewer rents and charges as are based upon\nwater use and the drainage connection service charge covering the respective\npremises, or such other charges as provided herein shall be due and payable, except as otherwise stated in this schedule or in such invoice, on the same\nday, one month following the month of the invoice billing date, and such\ninvoice may be billed monthly, quarterly or as otherwise determined by the\n\nAuthority; and\n2. So much of the sewer rents and charges as are based upon the\nassessed valuation of chargeable real estate shall become due and payable from\nthe first day of July 1938, and each year thereafter, and may be paid without\ninterest on or before September 30th next succeeding. (s) Such sewer rents and charges that remain unpaid after their\nrespective due dates shall be charged interest, and such interest shall\ncontinue to be charged until such sewer rents and charges are paid in full, as\nfollows: 1. sewer rents based upon water use and drainage connection\nservice charges shall be charged interest at the same rate as unpaid City\ntaxes, to wit: four and one-half percent (4.5%) interest shall be added to\namounts unpaid from the first through the thirtieth day after the due date and\nthereafter one and one-half percent (1.5%) shall be added to all amounts that\nremain unpaid for each succeeding month; 2. sewer rents based upon assessed valuation of chargeable real\nestate that remain unpaid on October 1st of each year shall be charged interest\nat the rate of two percent (2%), and such sewer rents that remain unpaid shall\nbe charged two percent (2%) for each month thereafter until paid; and\n3. all other sewer rents and charges of the Authority shall be\ncharged interest at the rate of one and one-half percent (1.5%) per month if\nnot paid by the due date stated on the invoice issued by the Authority.

(2) Sampling must be performed at the designated B.P.D.E.S. permit location. (3) All discharge lines from one (1) building, or all discharge\nlines from only one (1) single process, must be sampled during the same time\nperiod. (4) If a sample point receives flow from upstream roof drains\nand/or storm connections, sampling will not be acceptable during a\nprecipitation day. If sampling was initiated before a storm and the storm is\nbrief or near the end of sampling the I.W.S. must be contacted for approval to\naccept the sample collected for analysis. (5) If an auto-sampler is used, tubing must be at least \\ 3\nI.D. and the intake hose velocity must be at least 2.0 f.p.s. with a minimum\nlift of twenty (20) feet. (6) After the first day of sampling, the tubing must be cleaned\nwith detergent or methanol and deionized water for each subsequent sampling\nday. Proper refrigeration and preservation of the sample must be maintained\nduring the entire sampling period. (7) All sampling shall be taken at the highest velocity, greatest turbulence and center of flow. (8) All sampling must be done on normal work days. If there is\na regulated process discharge after normal working hours, sampling must\ncontinue until there is no further discharge. (9) The discharge flow monitoring method must be approved by\nthe B.S.A. prior to monitoring. Results and the method used to determine flow\nmust be included with the report. (10) Any split samples with the B.S.A. that indicate an\nanalytical discrepancy of greater than 20% may be grounds for disapproval of\nthe monitoring report. B. Analytical\n(1) The pH must be analyzed from the sample on site unless\notherwise specified. (2) When the following parameters are required to be monitored\nfor the Baseline Monitoring Report (BMR) and Compliance Monitoring Report (CMR)\na minimum of four (4) grab samples must be collected for each parameter: pH, cyanides, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organics. Grab\nsamples must be taken over an equally spaced time period during a normal work\nday. The sample bottle(s) must be glass when oil & grease, total\nextractable hydrocarbons and/or organics are being tested. The method of\nsampling for all periodic permit monitoring requirements will be specified in\nthe B.P.D.E.S. permit. (3) Only laboratories certified by the New York State\n\nDepartment of Health for the specific parameter will be allowed to conduct the\nappropriate analysis. (4) A chain of possession log sheet is required for the\ntransporting and analysis of each sample. The log sheet signed by the lab\ndirector or designee must be included in the monitoring report. Blank copies of\nthe log sheet will be available from the I.W.S. Office. (5) The handling, storage, preservation and analytical\nprocedures for each parameter shall follow Environmental Protection Agency\n\nGuidelines established in 40 CFR Part\n136\nand as amended. This document is\navailable for review at the Buffalo Sewer Authority, Industrial Waste Section, Wastewater Treatment Facility, 90 West Ferry Street, Buffalo, New York 14213; State Register, New York State Department of State, 41 State\n\nStreet, Albany, New York 12231 or can be obtained from Superintendent of\n\nDocuments, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, DC 20402. (6) The BOD\n5\ndetermination has one\nspecial requirement - all samples must be seeded by a commercial BOD test seed, such as Polyseed. The contracted lab must include the Glucose- Glutamic acid\nstandard results with each client's monitoring report. (7) The analytical report must include, for each analyte, the\ndate when the analytical result was calculated and logged, and test\nmethod. C.

APPENDIX 3\nBSA's MASS ALLOCATION APPROACH TO PRETREATMENT PROGRAM\nIMPLEMENTATION\n1.0\nINTRODUCTION\nThe Buffalo Sewer Authority (BSA) recently completed its\ndevelopment of a pretreatment program in conformance with the General\n\nPretreatment Regulations ( 40CFR 403). A formal application for the approval of\nthis program has been prepared and submitted to both the United States\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the New York State Department of\n\nEnvironmental Conservation (NYSDEC). Once this program has been approved, the\nBSA will have the primary responsibility of ensuring that all industrial users\nof the Authority's wastewater collection and treatment system comply with both\nthe BSA pretreatment program requirements and the EPA categorical pretreatment\nstandards. The primary mechanism to be utilized by the BSA to ensure\nindustrial compliance with its sewer use regulations will be industrial\ndischarge limits which have been developed for various pollutants. This\napproach is mandated by the General Pretreatment Regulations (40CFR\n403.5(c)\n), which require\nthat POTW's developing pretreatment programs derive and enforce specific local\ndischarge limits which will be applied to all industrial users within the\nPOTW's service area. The actual function of these local limits is to protect\nboth the BSA POTW against interference from pollutants and the environment from\npollutants which pass through the treatment facility. The BSA has opted to\nrefine the limit development process by deriving critical (allowable) mass\nloadings for each control parameter addressed. This approach gives the\nindustries more operational leeway regarding discharges and allows the BSA more\nflexibility in administering the pretreatment program while still protecting\nthe BSA treatment plant. The purpose of this report is to present the derivation and\nallocation of critical mass loadings for the control parameters identified in\nthe BSA's Industrial Pretreatment Program report. Both the methodology used to\ndevelop this approach and the ramifications of its implementation are\ndiscussed. 2.0\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe methodology utilized to allocate the critical influent\nmasses for specific control parameters identified in the BSA's Industrial\n\nPretreatment Program is presented in detail in Appendix A. The process of\nderiving these critical masses is comprised of several basic steps. First is\nthe determination of critical influent limits for the control parameters. Threshold pollutant concentrations which would either inhibit wastewater and\nsludge treatment processes, adversely impact sludge disposal practices or cause\nNYS water quality standards to be exceeded were calculated, taking into\nconsideration the BSA POTW's ability to remove the identified pollutants. The\ncritical limit for each pollutant was then determined to be the most\nrestrictive of the threshold concentrations derived previously. The second step is the development of specific industrial\ndischarge limits based on the allocation of allowable pollutant mass loadings. The treatment plant critical influent mass was calculated using the POTW design\nhydraulic capacity (180 mgd) and the critical influent concentration for each\npollutant. This quantity was then distributed between four loading categories: uncontrollable sources (domestic, natural background, etc.), present industrial\nusers, an unallocated portion reserved for future industrial users and a\nnon-allocated safety margin. The portion of the POTW's critical mass which has\nbeen allocated to the existing industrial users will be distributed according\nto each industry's discharge volume and pollutant loading. The mass limits\ndesignated for each industry will be implemented through the BSA's BPDES permit\nsystem, with all pollutant mass discharge restrictions being set forth in the\nrespective discharge permits. 3.0\nCRITICAL INFLUENT MASS ALLOCATION\n3.1\n\nCritical Influent Mass\n\nThe critical influent mass is the maximum amount of a pollutant\nthat could be received at the POTW without any adverse effects being\nexperienced. Generally, this mass is expressed as a loading rate, such as\npounds per day. The critical influent mass for any pollutant is determined by\nmultiplying the POTW's design hydraulic capacity (180 mgd) times the\npollutant's critical influent concentration (limit) and the appropriate\nconversion factors to get the loading rate. The calculations made to obtain the\ncritical masses listed in Table 1 are presented in Appendix B. The critical influent mass is also the quantity which is\napportioned among the four loading categories. These categories represent both\nthe masses of pollutants which are being received at the treatment plant\ncurrently and additional amounts reserved for POTW protection and future\nindustrial users. A description of each loading category follows. 3.2\n\nSafety Factor\nA safety factor equal to twenty percent of the critical\ninfluent mass has been set aside for each control parameter (except selenium)\nas a non-allocated reserve. This reserved amount provides a margin of safety to\nensure both protection of the POTW and compliance with SPDES permit\nrequirements. 3.3\n\nUncontrollable Source Mass\n\nFor each pollutant received at the POTW, a specific load is\nattributed to background sources such as eroded minerals and\ndomestic/commercial discharges. These quantities of the pollutants cannot be\ncontrolled by the BSA through enforcement of sewer use regulations. Consequently, the uncontrollable mass of each pollutant has been subtracted\nfrom the total mass available for allocation to industrial users. The specific\nmass of pollutants from uncontrollable sources is calculated by multiplying the\ndesign hydraulic capacity of the POTW times the background concentration for\neach pollutant and the appropriate conversion factors. Background\nconcentrations were obtained by sampling sewer flows in areas which were not\ndownstream of any industrial sources. The analytical results were considered to\nbe representative of natural background concentrations for all control\nparameters. In comparison, the results of a similar analytical program are\nshown in Table 2. As can be seen, the concentrations found in the BSA's system\nare quite similar to those obtained elsewhere. One problem this approach has presented is that for PCB, BHC, pyrene and 1,2,4-dichlorobenzene, the background concentrations recorded were\nhigher than the POTW's critical influent limits. This may indicate that the\nsamples taken are not truly representative and that additional sampling should\nbe completed, which seems to be the case since the critical influent limits for\nthese parameters are not being exceeded in the treatment plant influent. 3.4\n\nAllocated Mass\n\nTo determine the portion of the critical influent mass for each\ncontrol parameter to be allocated to industrial users, data from the BSA's\n\nPretreatment Program industrial survey were used. Various industrial users were\nsampled for parameters related to their specific manufacturing processes. From\nthe available data, the loadings of each control parameter discharged to the\nPOTW were calculated using an industry's discharge rate and detected pollutant\nconcentrations. For each parameter, all industrial loads were complied to\nproduce each respective allocated mass (Table 1). In cases where a categorical\nindustry was discharging a pollutant at concentrations exceeding the\nappropriate categorical pretreatment standard discharge limits, the categorical\nlimits were used for calculation purposes since this discharge level will be\nrequired once the BSA Pretreatment Program is approved by the USEPA. Calculations used to develop the allocated mass loading for each control\nparameter are presented in Appendix C.

The parameters PCB, BHC, Pyrene and 1, 2,4-dichlorobenzene were not included in this table due to\nbackground concentrations which were higher than their respective critical\ninfluent limits. (2) The critical influent masses for the control parameters\nwere developed based on the critical influent concentration limits presented in\n\nTable 7-5 of the URS report cited in Note 1. (3) The masses predicted for the uncontrollable sources are\nbased on the background concentrations listed in Table 7-8 of the URS report\ncited in Note 1. (4) Allocated masses for the control parameters were developed\nfrom the sampling and analysis program results of the BSA Industrial\n\nPretreatment Program. Discharges from firms now out of business were not\nincluded in the calculations. Industrial discharge concentrations exceeding\n\nPretreatment Program limits have been calculated using the respective\nlimits. To prevent an industry from discharging its total allowable\ndaily loading over a short time period, (i.e., slug or batch discharges), maximum instantaneous discharge concentrations for each pollutant have been\ndeveloped and included in both the BSA's Sewer Use regulations and all\ndischarge permits. 3.5\n\nUnallocated Mass\n\nFollowing the calculation of the pollutant loadings which\ncomprised the safety margin, uncontrollable source and allocated mass loading\ncategories for each control parameter, a quantity of the respective critical\ninfluent masses remained unallocated. These unallocated masses remain reserved\nfor any industries which may begin to discharge to the BSA system in the future\nor for the expansion of existing industries. 4.0\nTHE MASS ALLOCATION APPROACH\nUnder this mass allocation system, existing industrial sources\nwill be allocated an allowable mass discharge limit equivalent to their present\ndischarge level. Following Categorical Pretreatment Standard compliance dates, industries subject to the standards will be allocated a mass based on the\nregulated concentration limits and their respective discharge volumes. Should\nan existing industry expand its production level, its allowable mass discharge\nwill be increased accordingly by giving it a portion of the unallocated mass\nreserve..Similarly, if a new industry begins to operate within the BSA's\nservice area, its allowable discharge mass would be taken from the unallocated\nmass reserve. Conversely, if an industry reduces or ceases production, its\nallocated mass which is lost would be placed into the unallocated\nreserve. Table 1 is a summary table for the mass allocation of\npollutants received by the BSA POTW. Each control parameter's critical influent\nmass is divided between the four loading categories. To help clarify the\nrelationships between these categories for each parameter, pie charts are\npresented in Figures 1 through 16. As indicated, all of the control parameters\nexcept selenium exhibit considerable unallocated masses which are available for\nfuture industrial expansion. It is reasonable to expect from this information\nand in consideration of the industrial environment within the BSA's service\narea, that this approach to implementing the pretreatment program should\noperate adequately in the future. The selenium problem is one which must be\naddressed, but this will serve as a good test of the reallocation system which\nmay be required again in the future. The intent of the BSA in implementing the mass allocation\napproach is to provide a degree of flexibility to the administration of its\npretreatment program. Benefits which may be realized initially by industry as a\nresult of using mass allocation include the elimination of industry's need to\ninstall costly pretreatment facilities required to remove pollutants adequately\nhandled by the POTW. In the future, if the POTW's critical influent mass for\nany of the control parameters should be reached or if the unallocated mass\nshould be depleted, the BSA will have to reallocate the masses for the problem\npollutant such that some industries may find it necessary to pretreat their\nwastewater to remain in compliance. The mass of each specific pollutant that initially will be\nallocated to specific industrial users once this mass allocation system is\nimplemented is presented in Appendix C. Presently, it is anticipated that all\nBPDES permits containing the specific mass limits will be issued during the\nfirst five (5) months following EPA/NYSDEC approval of the Authority's\npretreatment program. (Assuming that program approval will be received during\n\nAugust 1984, all BPDES permits will be issued by January 1985.) Top priority\nwill be given to issuance of BPDES permits to Electroplating and Metal\n\nFinishing facilities. Subsequently all other permits will be issued. The total\nnumber of BPDES permits to be issued is 222.

The development and enforcement of local industrial discharge limits are\nessential mechanisms for meeting these objectives. The development process\nbasically involves identification of those operational, environmental and\nhealth and safety factors which are most sensitive to and could be most\nadversely impacted by industrial pollutants. Limits are then derived which are\nexpressly designed to mitigate and prevent the potential for an adverse\nimpact. The methodology used to develop the limits which have been\nincorporated into the BSA Sewer Use Regulations are presented in this manual. All revisions of existing limits and development of additional limits will also\nbe based on this methodology. Methodology\n\nThe approach to develop specific industrial discharge limits\neffort is based on initial determination of critical treatment plant influent\nconcentrations necessary to meet the following objectives: (1) Prevent inhibition or upset of the treatment plant\nanaerobic digestion process. (2) Prevent inhibition or upset of the treatment plant aerobic\nprocess. (3) Prevent limitation of sludge disposal options. (4) Prevent contravention of N.Y. State water quality\nstandards. (5) Prevent violation of incinerator air emission\nstandards. Critical influent limits developed on the basis of the basis of\nthe criteria identified are used to derive critical mass loadings for each\npollutant of concern. This mass is then allocated - in conjunction with the BSA\nBPDES permit system - to industrial contributors in the form of mass discharge\nlimits. The specific manner in which critical influent limits and\nindustrial mass limits are developed is presented below. Critical Influent Limits. Critical influent limits are\ndeveloped for the BSA\ntreatment plant using the methodology of Anthony\nand Breimhurst, 1981 (Ref.1). This methodology involves the following\nsteps: (1) Identify the pollutants (especially the priority\npollutants) which are present in the BSA sewerage system and could have an\nadverse impact. (2) Determine the threshold pollutant concentrations that: 1)\nare inhibitory to the BSA wastewater and sludge treatment processes, 2) would\nadversely impact on sludge disposal or 3) would contravene NYS water quality\nstandards. (3) Determine the efficiency of pollutant removal in the BSA\ntreatment plant and the portion of the total pollutant load that is retained in\nthe sludge. (4) Derive limiting treatment plant influent concentrations\nnecessary to achieve each of the objectives stated above using mathematical\nrelationships which incorporate the information determined in steps 1-3\nabove. (5) By comparison of the limiting concentrations derived, determine the most critical concentration for each pollutant. The specific manner in which this methodology is applied to\nderive limits to meet the previously stated objectives is presented\nbelow. Inhibition of the Anaerobic Sludge Digestion Process - The\npollutant concentrations which are limiting to the BSA anaerobic sludge\ndigestion process are calculated on the basis of the methodology presented in\n\nTable 1. Values for C\ns\nand R\np\nwill be determined from the literature.

Occasionally, when the incinerators aren't operating the sludge is landfilled. This situation is not expected to change in the foreseeable future. Therefore, the consideration of other sludge disposal options, such as landspreading, is\nimpractical for purpose of defining limiting pollutant influent concentrations. Furthermore, no problems have been noted in the past which would adversely\nimpact on continuation of the present practice of sludge disposal. For example, both the BSA sludge and incinerator ash have been tested for a hazardous. leachate potential (i.e. EP Toxicity test) and were determined to be\nnonhazardous. For these reasons, the development of limiting influent\nconcentrations necessary to prevent limitation of sludge disposal options is\nnot presently required. Contravention of N.Y. State Water Quality Based Permit Limits -\nThe BSA's most recent SPDES draft permit contains proposed water quality based\ndischarge limitations for a number of pollutant parameters. The maximum\ntreatment plant influent concentrations which could be allowed without\nviolating such limits are calculated as shown in Table 3. Values for C\ne\nare taken directly from the BSA's SPDES permit. Values\nfor R\no\nwill be determined on the basis of historical\nBSA treatment plant data.

Review of these standards indicates\nthat mercury is presently the only pollutant parameter which is pertinent to\nBSA's situation. The methodology for determination of the maximum treatment\nplant influent concentration which could be allowed without violating the\nmercury emission standard is presented in Table 4.

The value for R\no\nis\ndetermined on the basis of historical BSA treatment plant data. Summary of Critical Limits - The critical limit for each\npollutant is defined as the most restrictive of the limiting concentrations\nderived on the basis of the criteria and methodology identified above. Industrial Limits - The approach used to develop specific\nindustrial discharge limits is based on derivation and allocation of critical\npollutant (allowable) mass loadings. The treatment plant critical influent mass\nis determined on the basis of the critical influent concentration and the\ntreatment plant hydraulic design capacity (e.g. 180 MGD) according to the\nfollowing relationship: Critical Inf. Limit (mg/l) * g/1000 mg * 1b/454 g * 3.785\nl/gal. * hydraulic design capacity (180 MGD) =Critical Inf. Mass\n\nTo determine the quantity of the critical mass available for\nallocation to industrial users, the mass contributed by uncontrollable sources\n(domestic sources, etc.) is subtracted. Twenty percent of the critical influent\nmass is also subtracted and permanently set aside as a nonallocated reserve to\nprovide a margin of safety for treatment plant protection and compliance with\nSPDES permit water quality based limits. Under this mass allocation system, existing industrial sources\nwill be allocated an allowable mass discharge limit equivalent to their present\nlevel of discharge. (Following Categorical Pretreatment Standard Compliance\n\nDates, industries subject to such standards will be allocated a mass based on\nthe regulated concentration limits and each industry's volume of discharge.)\n\nAll unallocated mass will be set aside in an unallocated mass reserve. This\nsituation allows the BSA to exercise flexibility in administration of this\nsystem. For example, when an existing industry expands its production level, its allowable mass discharge could be increased accordingly by giving that\nindustry a portion of the unallocated mass reserve. Likewise, when a new\nindustry moves into the BSA service area, its allowable mass discharge would\nalso be drawn from the unallocated mass reserve. Conversely, when an existing\nindustry moves out of the BSA service area, its mass allocation would be placed\nback into the unallocated mass reserve. The mass allocation system described above is specifically\ndesigned to protect the treatment plant and receiving stream water quality\nwithout imposing unnecessary regulatory restrictions on industry. This system\nis especially intended to eliminate the need for industry to install costly\npretreatment facilities to remove pollutants that are being adequately removed\nat the BSA treatment plant and that are not present in the treatment plant\ninfluent at levels that could have an adverse impact on the treatment plant\noperation. If, however, the treatment plant critical influent limit for any\npollutant is approached or the mass reserve depleted, the BSA will reallocate\nthe mass for that pollutant such that some industries may find it necessary to\npretreat their wastewater to remove that pollutant. The mass limits allocated to each industry will be implemented\nthrough the BSA BPDES permit system. All pollutant mass discharge restrictions\nwill be set forth in each industry's permit. To prevent an industry from\ndischarging its total allowable daily mass over a short period of time (i.e. slug or batch discharges), maximum instantaneous discharge concentration limits\nfor each pollutant parameter will also be placed in each permit and the Sewer\n\nUse Regulations. The slug discharge limits have been determined on the basis of\nthe following relationship: S\n=\n2.5R (Lp - B)\n\nWhere: S\n=\nmaximum allowable instantaneous discharge concentration\n(mg/l). R\n=\nratio of the treatment plant influent volume to the\nvolume of industrial discharges containing a given pollutant\n\nLp\n=\ncritical treatment plant influent concentration for any\ngiven pollutant (mg/l). B\n=\nbackground concentration (mg/l) (e.g. pollutant\ncontribution by domestic and commercial sources). Values for R are obtained from the results of the industrial\nsurvey. Specifically, the industrial sources of each of the pollutants have\nbeen determined on the basis of the wastewater discharge analyses submitted by\nall the significant industrial users in the BSA service area, including the\noutlying service areas. Then, for each individual pollutant, the total volume\nof wastewater from all industrial sources of that pollutant was determined. Each value for R was then determined by dividing the total volume of wastewater\nreceived at the BSA treatment plant by the total volume of industrial\nwastewater containing a given pollutant. To determine the background concentrations (B) of pollutants\n(i.e. pollutant quantities from uncontrollable sources such as private\nresidential areas, commercial establishments and storm water runoff), samples\nof sewerage were collected for subsequent analysis from locations in the BSA\nsewer system that contained no industrial wastes.
