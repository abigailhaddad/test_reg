  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 6.3 - Additional insurance powers of banks and trust companies\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Banking\n\nBoard hereby finds that the promulgation of this section is consistent with the\npolicy of the State of New York as declared in section 10 of the New York\n\nBanking Law and thereby protects the public interest, including the interests\nof depositors, creditors, shareholders, stockholders and consumers and is\nnecessary to achieve or maintain parity between banks and trust companies and\nnational banks with respect to rights, powers, privileges, benefits, activities, loans, investments or transactions. (b) The Banking Board hereby finds that\ntitle 12, United States\n\nCode, section\n92, and title 12, Code of\n\nFederal Regulations,[FN*] section 7.1001, permit national banks located and\ndoing business in places the population of which does not exceed 5,000 persons\nto sell insurance directly. Such power of national banks to sell insurance\ndirectly pursuant to title 12, United States Code,* section 92, was unanimously\nupheld by the United States Supreme Court in the case of Barnett Bank of Marion\n\nCounty, N.A. v. Nelson, 517 U.S. 25, 116 S. Ct. 1103 (1996). (c) Banks and trust companies located and\ndoing business in any place the population of which does not exceed 5,000\ninhabitants, as shown by the last preceding decennial census, may act as the\nagent for any fire, life, or other insurance company authorized by the\nauthorities of the state in which the bank is located to do business in such\nstate, by soliciting and selling insurance and collecting premiums on policies\nissued by such company; and may receive for services so rendered such fees or\ncommissions as may be agreed upon between the bank or trust company and the\ninsurance company for which it may act as agent; provided, however, that no\nsuch bank or trust company shall in any case assume or guarantee the payment of\nany premium on insurance policies issued through its agency by its principal; and provided further, that the bank shall not guarantee the truth of any\nstatement made by an assured in filing his or her application for\ninsurance. (d) This section is\napplicable to any office of a bank or trust company when the office is located\nin a place with a population of less than 5,000, even though the principal\noffice of such bank or trust company is located in a place with a population\nexceeding 5,000. (e) Banks and\ntrust companies engaging in the business of insurance pursuant to this section\nshall do so subject to regulation by the State Insurance Department and\npursuant to all the insurance laws, rules and regulations, provided, however, that the Banking Board, in consultation with the Superintendent of Insurance, may exempt banks or trust companies from any insurance law, rule or regulation\nwhich has been preempted under Federal law, rule or regulation for national\nbanks if such law, rule or regulation has been preempted because it applies to\ninsurance activities of banks or trust companies and not to insurance\nactivities of other entities. (f) Banks and trust companies engaging in the business of insurance pursuant to\nthis section shall comply with the following requirements relating to the sale\nof insurance. (1)\n\nExcept with respect to a\ncredit unemployment insurance policy, group credit life insurance policy, a\ngroup credit health, group credit accident or group credit health and accident\npolicy, or similar group credit insurance covering the person of the insured, banks, trust companies and any person soliciting the purchase of or selling\ninsurance on the premises thereof, must disclose or cause to be disclosed in\nwriting, in clear and concise language, to their customers and prospective\ncustomers who are solicited therefor that any insurance offered or sold: (i) is not a deposit; (ii)\nis not insured by the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation; and\n(iii)\nis\nnot guaranteed by the bank or trust company. (2)\n\nExcept with respect to a flood insurance\npolicy, or a credit unemployment insurance policy, group credit life insurance\npolicy, a group credit health, group credit accident or group credit health and\naccident policy, or similar group credit insurance covering the person of the\ninsured, when a customer obtains insurance and credit from a bank or trust\ncompany, then the credit and insurance transactions shall be completed through\nseparate documents. The expense of insurance premiums may not be included in\nthe primary credit transaction without the express written consent of the\ncustomer. (3)\n\nBanks and trust\ncompanies shall not extend credit, lease or sell property of any kind, or\nfurnish any services, or fix or vary the consideration for any of the\nforegoing, on the condition or requirement that the customer obtain insurance\nfrom the bank or trust company, its affiliate or subsidiary, or a particular\ninsurer, agent or broker. This prohibition shall not prevent a bank or trust\ncompany from informing a customer that insurance is required in order to obtain\na loan or credit, that loan or credit approval is contingent upon the\ncustomer's procurement of acceptable insurance, or that insurance is available\nfrom the bank or trust company; provided, however, that the bank or trust\ncompany shall also inform the customer in writing that his or her choice of\ninsurance provider shall not affect the bank or trust company's credit decision\nor credit terms in any way. Such disclosure shall be given again prior to or at\nthe time that a bank, trust company or person selling insurance on the premises\nthereof solicits the purchase of any insurance from a customer who has applied\nfor a loan or extension of credit. (g) (1)\n\nPreemption of Insurance Law, section 2501. P ursuant to section 2501 of the\n\nInsurance Law, a licensed insurance agent or broker who is owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by a bank shall not negotiate any insurance policy\ncovering real or personal property which is the subject matter of, or security\nfor, a loan or extension of credit made by the bank or by any other bank which\nis owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by such bank. For purposes of\nsection 2501 of the Insurance Law, the term bank includes, among other\nentities, a national bank whose principal office is located in New\n\nYork. (2)\n\nThe Banking Board hereby\nfinds that the restrictions of section 2501 of the Insurance Law are preempted\nwith respect to banks and trust companies. The Banking Board further finds, in\nconsultation with the Superintendent of Insurance, that section 2501 of the\n\nInsurance Law has been preempted because it applies to insurance activities of\nbanks and trust companies and not to insurance activities of other entities. In\nsupport of such findings, the Banking Board takes note that the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the Western District of New York has ruled in the case of\n\nNew York Bankers Association, Inc. et al. v. Neil D. Levin, et al., 97-CIV-6423T, March 27, 1998, that section 2501 of the New York State Insurance\n\nLaw is preempted by title\n12, United States Code, section\n92, and the\n\nSuperintendent of Insurance may not impose the restrictions of section 2501 of\nthe Insurance Law against a national bank doing business pursuant to\ntitle 12, United States\n\nCode, section\n92, in a place the population\nof which does not exceed 5,000 inhabitants.
