Tit. 21 § 1960.5 - Conditions to the use of the water board's POTW and MS4\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Prohibited wastewater discharges and\ncertain notifications to water board. (1)\n\nNo\nperson shall discharge, allow to be discharged, or otherwise allow to enter any\nof the following proscribed waters or wastes to the water board POTW or MS4, any sanitary sewer, combined sewer, or to the diversion sewer: (i) Any pollutant which creates a fire or\nexplosion hazard, including but not limited to, waste streams with a closed cup\nflashpoint of less than 140° F (60° C) as determined by using the test methods\nspecified in 40 CFR part\n262.21. (ii)\n\nAny waters or wastes containing solids, liquids or gases in sufficient quantity, acting either singly or by interaction\nwith other properly shredded wastes, which may create damage, cause pass\nthrough or interference, be a hazard to the water board personnel, create a\npublic nuisance, create a hazard to life, or after treatment cause a violation\nof the water board's SPDES discharge permit. (iii)\n\nAny water or wastes which will cause\ncorrosive structural damage, but in no case those discharged with the following\nproperties: (a) having a pH less than\n5.0; (b) having a pH greater than\n12.0 for any period exceeding 30 minutes; (c) having a pH greater than 10.0 for more\nthan five hours daily or 70 hours monthly; (d) having by itself or by interaction with a\ndischarge or discharges from other sources, properties which would cause the pH\nof the effluent of the water board POTW or MS4 to be outside the range of\n6.0-9.0 for greater than 60 minutes; (e) having by itself or by interaction with a\ndischarge or discharges from other sources, any other aggressive property in a\nquantity or quality capable of causing damage or hazard to any structure or\nequipment; (iv)\nany\nsolid or viscous substance, including but not limited to fats, waxes, greases, petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oils, or products of mineral oil\norigin, of such quantity or size discharged, or by interaction with other\nsubstances, which cause obstruction of flow in the POTW, interference of the\nPOTW, or pass through; (v) any\nliquid or vapor having a temperature higher than 150° F (65° C) at the\ndischarge to the water board POTW or MS4. In addition, any liquid or vapor\nwhich causes, either singly or in combination with other wastewater discharges, the combined influent to the water board POTW to exceed 104° F (40° C) is also\nprohibited; (vi)\nany materials\ncontaining radioactivity of such half-life, concentration or other property as\nmay exceed limits established by applicable State or Federal laws, regulations, guidelines or limitations, or that may cause the water board POTW's or MS4's\neffluent or sludge to exceed such laws, regulations, guidelines or limitations, or to be classified as a hazardous substance under the Federal Comprehensive\n\nEnvironmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act; (vii)\nslug or batch discharges which, in the\nopinion of the director, could cause or substantially contribute to an upset of\nthe POTW treatment process, or result in a violation of the water board's SPDES\ndischarge permit; (viii)\nany waters\nor wastes containing substances which, either singly or in combination with\nother properly shredded wastes, are not amenable to treatment or reduction by\nthe wastewater treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only\nat excessive cost or amenable to treatment only to such degree that the water\nboard's POTW effluent cannot meet the requirements of the water board's SPDES\ndischarge permit; (ix)\nany waters\nor wastes from a motor vehicle, tank truck or any other mobile conveyance\nwithout prior written authorization by the director, specifying the nature, volume, manner, time and place of discharge except for such mobile conveyance\ndischarges from within an SIU facility to sewers carrying water through a\nmonitoring station; (x) any\nsubstance which may cause the water board's POTW or MS4 effluent or any other\nproduct of the water board POTW or MS4 such as residues, sludge, furnace\nsolids, or scum, to be unsuitable for discharge, disposal, reclamation or\nreuse. In no case shall a substance discharged to the water board's POTW or MS4\ncause the water board POTW or MS4 to be in non-compliance with sludge use or\ndisposal criteria, air emissions permit, guidelines or regulations affecting\nsludge use or disposal pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act (including\ntitle II, more commonly referred to as the Resource Conservation and Recovery\n\nAct), the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act or State criteria\napplicable to the sludge management method being used; (xi)\nany pollutant, including oxygen\ndemanding pollutants, released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant\nconcentration which will cause interference with the water board's\nPOTW; (xii)\nany discharge of\npollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors or fumes within\nthe water board POTW or MS4 in a quantity that may cause acute worker health\nand safety problems. (2)\n\nThe occurrence of discharge of wastewater under emergency conditions and the\nspillage of wastewaters in quantity or quality not in accord with the\nprovisions of this section shall be reported by telephone to the water board\nPOTW treatment plant duty operator immediately. Such occurrence or spillage\nshall be confirmed by letter to the director within five working days when\nrequested by the director at the time of the telephone report or later by\nwritten request (SIUs must report according to section\n1960.6\nof this Part). Persons\nresponsible for the discharge shall take all available means to reduce the\nvolume and rate of discharge and shall cooperate with water board personnel to\nreduce potential damaging effects. (b) Prohibited activities. (1)\n\nNo person shall engage in any activities\nthat cause or contribute to a violation of the water board's SPDES stormwater\ndischarge permit or the water board being subject to special\nconditions. (2)\n\nUpon notification\nto a person that he or she is engaged in activities that cause or contribute to\nviolations of the water board's SPDES stormwater discharge permit\nauthorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to correct such\nactivities such that he or she no longer causes or contributes to violations of\nthe water board's SPDES stormwater discharge permit authorization. (c) Local limits for the water\nboard POTW. (1)\n\nIn accordance with the\nprovisions in 40 CFR\n403, specific local limits shall be developed, adopted and\nenforced. A user may not introduce into the POTW any pollutant(s) which can\ncause pass through or interference. These general prohibitions and the specific\nprohibitions listed in this section apply to each user introducing pollutants\ninto the water board POTW whether or not the user is subject to other national\npretreatment standards or any other national, State, or local pretreatment\nrequirements. (2)\n\nNo user shall\ndischarge, allow to be discharged, or otherwise allow to enter the water board\nPOTW any substances, materials, waters, or wastes in quantities greater than\nthose listed in Wastewater Facilities Administrative Procedure No. 6. \"Determination and Use of Local Limits,\" unless the user has been granted\npermission via a valid discharge permit. In no circumstances, can less\nstringent limitations violate any applicable pretreatment standard or\nrequirement. These limitations are deemed pretreatment standards for the\npurposes of section 307(d) of the Clean Water Act. (3)\n\nThe water board shall continue to develop\nthese limits as necessary and effectively enforce these limits. (d) Required notice of change in\nvolume or character of wastes. (1)\n\nAll users\nmust obtain prior approval from the director to discharge new or significantly\nincreased wasteloads. (2)\n\nAny user\ndischarging to the water board POTW who plans to change the volume or character\nof said discharge significantly, shall notify the director no less than 15\nworking days prior to the commencement of any alteration or construction that\nwill result in a significant change in the volume or character of its\ndischarge. (3)\n\nAll users must\nnotify the director of his or her designee no less than 15 working days prior\nto initiating maintenance work, tank cleaning or demolition, internal sewer\nplumbing cleaning or repair or any other activity which will temporarily change\nthe volume or character of the wastewater discharge to the water board\nPOTW. (e) Measuring, recording and sampling devices. (1)\n\nThe water\nboard is authorized, pursuant to\n40\nCFR section\n403.8(f)(1)\nof\nthe pretreatment standards, to require any user to install monitoring equipment\nin a suitable location so that the water board POTW can monitor the user's\ndischarge, and require the user to conduct self monitoring and\nreporting. (2)\n\nAll meters and all\nother measuring and sampling devices installed or required to be used under the\nprovisions of this Part shall be readily accessible to the director. The owner\nof the property upon which any such measuring, recording or sampling device is\ninstalled shall pay for and shall remain responsible for its maintenance and\naccuracy. All repairs and calibrations thereto shall be made at the owner's\ncost, whether such repairs are made necessary by ordinary wear and tear or by\nother causes. These repairs shall be made within such time period as prescribed\nby the director. After proper notification, the water board can undertake such\nrepairs, and the costs for said repairs shall be due and payable at that time, shall be collected in the same manner and shall be subject to the same\npenalties as are the costs for repairs of water meters. Energy for continuous\noperation, as required, shall be provided and paid for by the property owner. Flow record charts shall be changed by the user as required, shall be marked to\nshow time and totalizer register reading at time of change, and shall be\navailable to the director upon request. (3)\n\nAll industrial users shall keep records\non file for a minimum of three years of all records, flow charts, laboratory\ncalculations or any other pertinent data on their discharge to the water board\nPOTW. This retention period may be extended during litigation or notice from\nthe water board. (f) Information requirements. (1)\n\nAll users of the\nPOTW or MS4 shall file, with the water board, wastewater information deemed\nnecessary by the director for determination of compliance with this Part, the\nwater board's SPDES discharge permit conditions, and State and Federal law. Such information shall be provided by completion of a questionnaire supplied by\nthe director and by supplements thereto as may be necessary. Information\nrequested in the questionnaire and designated by the discharger as confidential\nis subject to the conditions of confidentiality as set out in this\nsubdivision. (2)\n\nWhere a person\nowns, operates or occupies properties at more than one location, separate\ninformation submittals shall be made for each location as required by the\ndirector. (3)\n\nInformation and data\nobtained through the water board's pretreatment program from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits, monitoring programs and from\ninspections shall be available to the public without restriction unless the\nuser specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of\nthe water board that the release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of\nthe user. The water board shall implement measures to insure the\nconfidentiality of information provided by a user pursuant to this Part. In no\nevent shall any claimed confidential information be disclosed to the public\nwithout prior notice in writing to the user, and without providing the user\nwith the opportunity to seek judicial relief. (4)\n\nIn accordance with section 308 of the\n\nClean Water Act, all information as described in this subdivision shall be\nimmediately available to the USEPA administrator or authorized\nrepresentative(s) of the USEPA administrator without limitation.

Any and all such effluent data shall\nbe made available to the public on request through Freedom of Information Law\nprovisions. (6)\n\nAny industrial user\nnow or in the future discharging to the diversion sewer, upon and after the\neffective date of this Part shall provide a copy of the applicable State SPDES\napplication and any subsequent permit to the director for such discharge or\ncontinuation of such discharge. (g) Water board's right of revision. The\nwater board reserves the right to establish more or less stringent limitations\nor requirements on discharges to the water board POTW or MS4 to be consistent\nwith the objectives presented in section\n1960.2\nof this Part. However, in\nno circumstance can less stringent limitations violate any applicable\npretreatment standard or requirement. (h) Right of entry, inspection and collateral\nactivities. (1)\n\nPersonnel as designated by\nthe director shall be permitted at any time to enter upon all properties served\nby the water board POTW or MS4 for the purpose of, and to carry out, inspection\nof premises, observation, measurement, sampling and testing, in accordance with\nthe provisions of this Part to determine compliance or non-compliance with\napplicable pretreatment standards and requirements and stormwater permit\nrequirements. Personnel shall also be permitted to inspect and copy any and all\ndocumentation pertaining to discharge monitoring and analysis. (2)\n\nTo the extent allowed under their\nrespective laws and regulations, designated representatives of USEPA, NYSDEC\nand Niagara County Health Department shall be permitted at any time to enter\nupon all properties served by the water board POTW or MS4 for the purpose of, and to carry out, inspection of premises, observation, measurement, sampling\nand testing, in accordance with the provisions of this Part to determine\ncompliance or non-compliance with applicable pretreatment standards and\nrequirements. (i) Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as\nany person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for\nemergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or\nsuspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal\ndischarges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, that person shall take all\nnecessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such\nrelease. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, emergency\nresponse agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services should be\nnotified immediately. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the\nboard should be notified in person or by telephone or facsimile no later than\nthe next business day. Notifications in person or by telephone shall be\nconfirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the municipality within\nthree business days of the telephone notice. If the discharge of prohibited\nmaterials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or\noperator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of\nthe discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records\nshall be retained for at least three years. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 21\n§\n1960.5\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available.
