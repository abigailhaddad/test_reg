  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 504.11 - Financial security\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. (1)\n\nPurpose. The furnishing of financial\nsecurity will indemnify the department against overpayments which may be made\nto the provider. (2)\n\nThis section\napplies only to providers of ordered services or supplies and applicants for\nenrollment as providers of such services or supplies. For the purposes of this\nsection, ordered services or supplies are: (i) pharmacy services and supplies; (ii)\ndurable medical equipment; (iii)\nclinical laboratory services; and\n(iv)\nnonemergency\ntransportation. (3)\n\nThe\ndepartment may require a provider to provide financial security to the\ndepartment if the department has estimated that the total claims for payment\nfor ordered services or supplies to be submitted to the department by that\nprovider exceed either $500,000 per year or $42,000 in any month. The\ncomputation of these estimates must exclude the amount, if any, of the estimate\nof the provider's claims for payment for services that are not ordered\nservices. When the department has determined that a provider must furnish\nfinancial security, that provider must provide such security as a condition of\nthe provider's participation or continued participation in the medical\nassistance program. (b) Exemptions. The department will not require a provider established under the\nauthority of article 28 of the Public Health Law to supply financial\nsecurity. (c) Form of financial\nsecurity. (1)\n\nFinancial security may take the\nfollowing forms: (i) a bond; (ii)\nan irrevocable letter of\ncredit; (iii)\na certificate of\ndeposit inclusive of any interest earned thereon; or\n(iv)\na combination of the above. (2)\n\nFinancial security must be\nissued by an issuing entity. An issuing entity is: (i) a corporate surety authorized to do\nbusiness in this State where the financial security to be supplied is in the\nform of a bond; (ii)\na bank, trust\ncompany, savings bank or savings and loan association which is: (a) chartered by either this State or the\n\nUnited States of America; and\n(b) authorized to do business in this State; and\n(c) insured by either the Federal Deposit\n\nInsurance Corporation or the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation\nwhere the financial security to be supplied is in the form of a letter of\ncredit or certificate of deposit. (3)\n\nThe bond, letter of credit or certificate\nof deposit must be payable to the State of New York. (d) Means of estimation. Providers determined\nto be solvent, stable, and fiscally responsible will not be required to provide\nfinancial security. In determining whether to require a provider to supply\nfinancial security, and in determining whether such security should be\nincreased or decreased, the department will consider the following: (1)\nwhether the provider is solvent as shown\nby a review of certified financial statements, credit checks, other sources of\nincome or other indicia of financial status; (2)\nthe stability of the provider as shown by\nthe length of time the provider has been in business and the length of time the\nprovider has been enrolled in the medical assistance program; and\n(3)\nthe fiscal responsibility of the provider\nas shown by the results of any prior audits or investigations of the provider\nby the department, a health insurance program or another government\nagency. (e) Amount of\nfinancial security. (1)\n\nIf financial security\nis required by the department, it must be in the amount of a provider's\nestimated claims for payment for the year for ordered services as determined by\nthe department in accordance with the provisions of this section. In\ndetermining the estimated claims for payment for the year, the department may\nconsider: (i) the provider's actual billings\nduring the previous year; (ii)\nthe\nbillings of providers of similar services, taking into consideration the\ncomparative sizes of the businesses of such other providers; (iii)\nthe location of the provider; and\n(iv)\nthe provider's estimate of\nyearly billings. (2)\nA\nprovider may request a decrease in the amount of financial security required if\nits actual claims for payment for ordered services are 10 percent or more below\nthe estimated claims for payment. A provider may request such a decrease at the\nend of the first six months after initially providing financial security and\nevery six months thereafter. If a provider's actual claims for payment for\nordered services are below the estimated amount by more than 10 percent, the\ndepartment may reduce the amount of security. The department must make its\ndetermination on the basis of at least six consecutive months of submitted\nclaims. (3)\n\nThe department may\nassess a provider's billings as often as the department deems appropriate to\ndetermine whether the amount of financial security should be increased. If a\nprovider's actual claims for payment for ordered services exceeds the amount of\nestimated claims for payment for ordered services by more than 10 percent, the\ndepartment may require that the amount of security be increased. The department\nwill make its determination on the basis of at least six consecutive months of\nsubmitted claims. The department will notify the provider in writing that the\nprovider must increase the amount of financial security. Such notice will set\nforth the basis for the department's conclusion that the amount of security\nshall be increased. A provider's enrollment in the medical assistance program\nmay be terminated upon the failure to increase the amount of such security\nwithin 90 days of the date of the department's request to increase the amount\nof such security. (4)\nA provider\nwhich was not previously required to supply financial security because its\nestimated claims were less than $500,000 per year or $42,000 per month may\nlater be required to supply such security if that provider's actual claims\nexceed either such amount. The department may require such security if the\nprovider submits at least $42,000 in claims for payment during any given month\nor if the provider submits claims for payment amounting to at least $500,000\nduring any one-year period. The department will notify the provider in writing\nof the requirement that the provider supply financial security. A provider's\nenrollment in the medical assistance program may be terminated upon the failure\nto supply such security within 90 days of the date of the department's request\nto supply such security. (5)\nA\nprovider which was previously required to supply financial security may request\nto be relieved of the obligation to continue to supply such security on the\nbasis that the provider has not submitted billings of $500,000 in a year or\n$42,000 during any given month. In determining whether a provider should be\nrelieved of the obligation to supply financial security, the department will\nconsider the provider's billings for the 12-month period beginning with the\nfirst full month after the provider supplied the financial security. (f) Effect of not supplying\nfinancial security. A provider's enrollment in the medical assistance program\nwill be terminated upon the failure to supply or to increase the amount of\nfinancial security within 90 days of the date of the department's request to\nsupply or increase the amount of such security. A provider's enrollment will\nnot be terminated if the provider can demonstrate in writing within 90 days of\nthe department's request that the failure to supply or increase such security\nis solely attributable to delays on the part of the issuing entity. Except as\nprovided in paragraph (g)(1) of this section, if any financial security\nsupplied pursuant to this section is canceled, revoked, allowed to expire or\notherwise terminated or changed by the issuing entity, the participation of the\nprovider in the medical assistance program will be immediately terminated. The\ndepartment will send the provider a notice confirming any such\ntermination. (g) Financial security\nagreements. (1)\n\nAny bond, letter of credit or\ncertificate of deposit supplied pursuant to this section may not by its terms\nbe canceled, revoked, modified or allowed to expire or be otherwise terminated\nwithout at least 45 days prior written notice to the department and the express\nwritten consent of the department. The department will grant consent only when\nit has previously approved a request made pursuant to either paragraph (e)(2)\nor paragraph (e)(5) of this section. However, the consent of the department is\nnot required before a financial security agreement is terminated or changed by\nthe issuing entity by reason of nonpayment of a premium or other default by the\nprovider or when the amount of security is increased pursuant to paragraph\n(e)(3) of this section. The agreement between the provider and the issuing\nentity concerning the financial security of the provider must contain a\nprovision which requires the issuing entity to provide written notification to\nthe department 45 days in advance of any proposed cancellation, revocation, modification, expiration or other termination or change, including instances\nwhere the agreement is terminated or otherwise affected by a default by the\nprovider. (2)\n\nThe department may\ndemand that the issuing entity pay to the department the proceeds of the\nfinancial security only when the department has determined as a result of an\naudit report issued pursuant to Part 517 of this Title or a notice issued\npursuant to Part 515 of this Title, that a provider was overpaid for services\nclaimed to have been provided to one or more recipients of medical assistance\nand the provider has not complied with a request from the department for\nrepayment of such overpayments, plus interest if any.
