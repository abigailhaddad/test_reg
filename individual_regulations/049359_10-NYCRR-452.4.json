  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 10 § 452.4 - Specialized reporting areas\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interdepartmental services. The following represent areas for which costs must\nbe directly assigned to the functional reporting center operating such costs. The term interdepartmental services, for the purposes of this Article, is\ndefined as the direct cost of utility provided by one residential health care\nfacility department to another. The objective of accounting for\ninterdepartmental services is to establish a proper distribution of direct\ncosts prior to any cost allocation process. (1)\n\nFor the purposes of this Article, the\nfollowing are costs which should be so treated: (i) Plant maintenance. (a) All direct costs incurred in the routine\nmaintenance, repair and service of buildings and equipment are included in the\n\nPlant Operation and Maintenance reporting center. (b) However, the cost of noncapitalizable\nnonroutine maintenance and repairs directly assignable to a single reporting\ncenter (such as a major repair of an X-ray machine) must be transferred to the\nreporting center receiving the service. These costs include all direct expenses\nincurred by the Plant Operation and Maintenance cost center in performing such\nservices. (c) When such nonroutine\nmaintenance and repairs are performed by nonfacility personnel, the cost\nrelated to these purchased services must be either transferred from Plant\n\nOperation and Maintenance or charged directly to the reporting center receiving\nthe service. In the event that such costs are charged directly to the recipient\nreporting center, such costs must be segregated under the new natural\nclassification provided, i.e., Repairs and Maintenance--Purchased Services\n\nDirectly Assignable. (d) It is\nrecommended that identification of direct costs be accomplished by developing a\nwork order system. Written work orders identifying the requesting reporting\ncenter should be prepared upon receipt of the request for services. Upon\ncompletion of the service, the direct cost of labor and materials would be\nentered on the work order. Completed work orders should be sent to general\naccounting on a regular basis so that interdepartmental costs can be\nrecorded. (ii)\n\nEmployee\nbenefits. Employee benefits must be reported in the functional reporting\ncenters which include the applicable employee's compensation. This can be\naccomplished by accumulating all fringe benefit costs in one account and\nassigning the expenses to the appropriate reporting center at year-end as a\npreliminary adjustment prior to cost finding. This assignment can be performed\non an actual basis or upon the following basis: (a) FICA and tuition refunds--actual expense\nby department. (b) Pension and\nhealth insurance. (1)\n\nUnion--gross salaries\nof participating individuals by department. (2)\n\nNonunion--gross salaries of participating\nindividuals by department. (c) All other benefits--the remaining\nbenefits may be allocated to the various departments based upon gross salaries\nof the departments. (iii)\n\nMajor movable depreciation. Major\nmovable depreciation must be reported in the reporting center established\nentitled, \"Depreciation--Major Movable Equipment\". Such depreciation must be\nassigned to the department (as a cost allocation basis later explained) where\nthe equipment is located and utilized. However, those providers who are not\nable to allocate historical costs and depreciation for major movable equipment\nacquired prior to January 1, 1978 may use square feet, net, to allocate\ndepreciation by department. All additions to major movable equipment as of\n\nJanuary 1, 1978 and thereafter will be functionalized. (b) Residential health care\nfacility research and education costs. All direct costs incurred in conducting\nresidential health care facility research and formal educational activities (as\nopposed to inservice education) must be reported in the appropriate\nunrestricted or restricted fund reporting center. (c) Grant accountability. When separate\naccounting is required by law, grant, contract, or donation restricted for\nresearch and educational activities, such grants should be reported separately. Transfers from restricted funds to match the expenditures for these activities\nmust also be segregated. Thus, accountability is maintained for all restricted\nresearch and educational activities. Grants that represent deficit financing\nshould be reported as a reduction of the appropriate contractual allowances\nwhen used rather than, in the case of other grants, as other operating\nrevenue. (d) Grant overhead\nallocation. (1)\n\nNo allocation of overhead\nshould be made prior to cost finding unless such allocation is required by\ngrant agreement. When a grant contract calls for the payment of direct costs\nplus an overhead factor, the overhead factor should be used in billing\nonly. (2)\n\nIf indirect overhead\nmust, by grant contract, be recorded in the unrestricted fund cost centers used\nfor the recording of the direct costs of the grant activity, the natural\nexpense classification (other direct expenses) must be used. Such overhead\nallocations should be accumulated separately in the unrestricted fund. For\nreporting to the New York State Department of Health, this amount must be\noffset against grant activity costs, so such remaining costs are direct costs\nonly. (e) Overhead\nallocation between facilities. An allocation of overhead should be made prior\nto cost finding for facilities which share services or receive services from a\nservice corporation. Statistical bases utilized for such allocation must be\napproved by the New York State Department of Health. (f) Affiliated school contracts. Education\ncosts incurred relative to affiliated school contracts, including salaries, wages and stipends paid to students on approved programs and fees paid to\nphysicians involved primarily in approved education programs, must be reflected\nin the appropriate education reporting center in the Unrestricted\n\nFund. (g) Inservice\neducation--nursing. (1)\n\nNursing inservice\neducation activities are defined as educational activities conducted within the\nresidential health care facility for residential health care facility nursing\npersonnel. The cost of time spent by nursing personnel as students in such\nclasses and activities must remain in the reporting center in which their\nnormal salary and wage costs are charged (i.e., the reporting center in which\nthey work). However, the cost (defined as salary, wages and payroll-related\nfringe benefits) of time spent in such classes and activities by those\ninstructing and administering the programs must be included in the Nursing\n\nAdministration reporting center. (2)\n\nIf instructors do not work full-time in\nthe inservice education program, the cost (as defined above) of the portion of\ntime they spend working in the inservice education program must be included in\nthe \"Nursing Administration\" reporting center. This may be accomplished by\ndirect distribution of these costs (by natural classification of expense\ncategory) each payroll period, or by reclassification (based upon time spent)\nat year end. (3)\n\nThe costs of\nnursing inservice education supplies (such as cassettes, books, medical\nsupplies, etc.) and outside lecturers must also be reflected in the Nursing\n\nAdministration reporting center. (h) Inservice education--other. All costs\nrelative to nonnursing inservice education activities should be included in the\nreporting center to which they apply (e.g.,Physical Therapy, Radiology, etc.), as such inservice education activities will rarely apply to more than one\nfunctional activity. (i) Physician\nremuneration. Due to the numerous types of financial and work arrangements\nbetween residential health care facilities and physicians, comparability of\ncosts between residential health care facilities may be significantly impaired. This section deals with the methods to be used in reporting costs and revenues\nrelated to the services of physicians. (1)\n\nFinancial arrangements. Although the variations in financial arrangements\nbetween residential health care facilities and physicians are endless, there\nare five general types of such arrangements: (i) Attending physician. Under this\narrangement, the physician bills both Medicare, part B, and patients in his\nname for professional services provided. The residential health care facility\nreflects no operating revenue or expense relative to the professional\ncomponent. (ii)\n\nHouse physician. The residential health care facility bills Medicare, part B, in its name and\nreceives payment, or bills in the physician's name and receives payment from\nthe physician. The physician is paid a salary by the residential health care\nfacility which is included in the facility's expense. Amounts received by the\nresidential health care facility from Medicare may be operating revenue to the\nfacility or may be a liability to Medicaid or the patient, depending upon the\nextent of the reimbursement ceiling in effect. (iii)\n\nNormal arrangement. The residential\nhealth care facility bills patients for the physician's contractual\nprofessional services, including this amount as facility revenue. All\ndepartment expenses are paid by the residential health care facility. The\nresidential health care facility remits a fee to the physician which is\nincluded in facility expense. (iv)\n\nRental department. The physician bills the patients for certain of the part A\nand part B component (as defined by Medicare) and incurs all substantial direct\nexpenses. The physician remits a fee to recover certain residential heath care\nfacility expenses. This fee is recorded an nonoperating revenue in the\nappropriate department. (v) Independent/separate department. The department functions are provided by an\nindependent physician or group of physicians. Neither revenues nor expenses are\nincurred by the residential health care facility. The residential heath care\nfacility refers patients and/or specimens to the physician or group, which is\nusually located on separate premises. No costs are incurred and no revenue is\nreceived under this arrangement. (2)\n\nWork arrangement. (i) The services provided by residential\nhealth care facility-based physicians may be categorized into five general\ntypes: (a) professional component--providing\ndirect patient care; (b) education--teaching and supervising student activity in educational\nprograms; (c) research--working in\nresearch projects; (d) administration--administering overall activities; and\n(e) department supervision--supervising\nactivities of the department. (ii)\n\nWhen physicians are involved in more\nthan one of the above functional activities, their remuneration, if any, should\nbe recorded in the reporting center for which services they are paid. Prior to\ncost finding, their remunerations are to be reclassified to the appropriate\nreporting center on the residential health care facility's records. (j) Periodic Interim\n\nPayments (PIP). Periodic interim payments are made biweekly to a residential\nhealth care facility on the PIP program and are based on the facility's\nestimate of applicable Medicare reimbursement for the current cost report\nperiod. When such payments are received, a cash account in the Unrestricted\n\nFund is debited and a PIP clearing account is credited for the amount of the\npayment. When applicable, Medicare charges are billed to the intermediary, the\nPIP clearing account is debited and patient accounts receivable is credited. At\nyear end, adjustments must be made to eliminate any remaining balance in the\nPIP clearing account and to reflect the amount receivable from, or due to, the\n\nMedicare intermediary. (k) Patient\ntrust funds. Patient trust funds consist of amounts deposited on behalf of the\npatient which are to be used for the personal care and expenditure of that\npatient. In most cases, these funds consist of social security funds which are\nreceived by the patient or by the residential health care facility on behalf of\nthe patient. In most instances, the facility must give the patient an allowance\neach month out of these funds. Since patient trust funds are administered by a\nfacility, these funds should be accounted for as agency funds by governmental\nand voluntary facilities. For proprietary facilities, these funds should be\naccounted for as noncurrent assets and noncurrent liabilities. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
