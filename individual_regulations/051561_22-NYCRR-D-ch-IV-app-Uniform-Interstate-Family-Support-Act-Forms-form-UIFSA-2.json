The CSE Transmittal #2 should not be used for making initial referrals, but\nshould only be used for subsequent requests and communication. This form need\nnot be sent when the Notice of Controlling Order form is sent. The CSE\nTransmittal #2 should be sent to the local entity working the case (rather than\nthe State's central registry) unless the local entity working the case is\nunknown. HEADING/CAPTION (Pages 1 & 2): The\njurisdiction which sends the CSE Transmittal #2 determines the heading. Note\nthat the heading appears on both page 1 of the Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #2 and on page 2 the Acknowledgment page. Identify the petitioner and respondent in\nthe appropriate spaces. Check the appropriate space to identify\nthe type of case: IV-D Non Public Assistance; IV-D Non Public Assistance\n\nMedicaid (indicate whether receiving Full Services or Medical Services Only); IV-D Public Assistance; IV-E Foster Care; or Non IV-D. IV-D means the case is\nbeing worked by the State or local child support enforcement agency (i.e., IV-D\nagency). Public Assistance means the obligee's family receives IV-A cash\npayments [IV-A was formerly called Aid to Families with Dependent Children\n(AFDC) and is now called Temporary Family Assistance]. A IV-D Non Public\n\nAssistance Medicaid case is a case where the obligee's family receives Medicaid\nbut does not receive Public Assistance (IV-A cash payments). In the space marked \"To:\", list the name\nand address (street, city, State, and zip code) of the court or agency where\nyou are sending the CSE Transmittal #2. Once an initial referral in a IV-D case\nhas been made to the responding State's central registry (using CSE Transmittal\n#1), subsequent communication can occur with the local\nagency/court/jurisdiction that is actually working the case (using CSE\nTransmittal #2). In the appropriate spaces, if applicable\nand if known, enter the Responding jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case\nnumber, and docket number. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket\nnumber, cause number or any other appropriate reference number that the\nresponding State may use to identify the case, if known. The Responding\njurisdiction is the jurisdiction that is working the case at the request of the\ninitiating jurisdiction. In the space marked \"From:\", list a\ncontact person, agency name, address (street, city, State, zip code), phone\nnumber (including extension), fax number, and Internet address. In the appropriate spaces, enter the\ninitiating jurisdiction's FIPS code, State, IV-D case number, and docket\nnumber. Under \"docket number\", you may enter the docket number, cause number, or any other appropriate reference number which the initiating tribunal or\nagency has assigned to the case. The initiating jurisdiction is the\njurisdiction that referred the case to the responding jurisdiction for\nservices. In the space marked \"Send Payments To:\"\nenter the address to which payments should be sent, if the address is different\nfrom the agency address provided on the form in the space above. Specify the\ncase identifier if you want the responding jurisdiction to use an identifier\nother than the initiating IV-D case number when remitting payments. In the appropriate spaces, enter the FIPS\ncode and State where payments should be sent. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #2 - Subsequent Actions Page 1\n\nIf funds can be transmitted electronically\nvia Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT), enter the bank account number under \"Bank\n\nAccount\" and the bank routing code under \"Routing Code\". Check the appropriate box to indicate\nwhether the initiating jurisdiction uses the Uniform Reciprocal Enforcement of\n\nSupport Act (URESA) or the Uniform Interstate Family Support Act\n(UIFSA). In the appropriate space, enter the state\nwhich you believe has continuing exclusive jurisdiction (CEJ), if known. Under\nUIFSA, a State that issues a child support order maintains CEJ as long as the\nobligor, obligee, or child(ren) reside in that State, or until each party files\nwritten consent allowing another State to assume CEJ. If there are multiple\norders governing the same obligor, obligee, and child(ren), UIFSA contains\nrules for determining which order is controlling. The tribunal that issued the\ncontrolling order has CEJ as long as the conditions for CEJ are met. CEJ means\nthe authority to modify the order. SECTION I (page 1), ACTION: Check the\nappropriate box(es) to indicate which actions are requested or what information\nis being provided. Multiple boxes may be checked, as appropriate. Check item 1 \"Status Request\" if you are\nasking for a status update. Describe the request in Section II. Check item 2 \"Status Update\" if you are\nproviding a status update. Provide the update in Section II. Check item 3 \"Notice of Hearing\" if you\nare providing notice of an upcoming hearing. Provide dates and other\ninformation in Section II. Check item 4 \"Notice of Case Forwarding\"\nif you are providing notice that you have forwarded a misdirected case to the\nappropriate jurisdiction. Explain in Section II. Check item 5 \"Document Filed\" if you are\nproviding notice that document has been filed. Explain in Section II. Check item 6 \"Order Issued/Confirmed\" if\nyou are providing notice that an order has been issued or confirmed. Attach a\ncopy of the order. Check item 7 \"Notice of Arrearage\n\nReconciliation/Determination of Sum-Certain\" if you are providing notice of an\narrearage reconciliation or determination of sum-certain. Attach any\ncalculations or worksheets used. Check item 8 \"Change of Payee/Redirection\nof Payment\" to request a change of payee or redirection of payment. Describe\nyour request in Section II \"Additional Information\". \"Change of Payee\" is an\nadministrative action used when the person or agency entitled to receive funds\nhas changed. It may occur with a change in Public Assistance or Foster Care\nstatus or a change in custody. \"Redirection of Payment\" is an administrative\naction used when the custodian has moved. In some States a court action may be\nrequired if the custodian's move compels transfer of documents or funds to\nanother jurisdiction. Check item 9 \"Other\" if you are requesting\na service or providing information other than the types listed. Describe the\nservice or information on the blank lines. Check the box beside \"Please return the\n\nAcknowledgment Attached\" if an acknowledgment is needed. ____________\nInstructions for Child Support Enforcement\n\nTransmittal #2 - Subsequent Actions Page 2\nSECTION II (page 1), ADDITIONAL\nINFORMATION: In this section, provide additional information which may be\nuseful.

PAGE 2, ACKNOWLEDGMENT: When a\njurisdiction sends a CSE Transmittal #2 to another jurisdiction, it should\ninclude Page 2 Acknowledgment only if the jurisdiction is requesting\ninformation or action. If the jurisdiction is sending the Transmittal #2 to\nprovide notice or information, Page 2 Acknowledgment is not needed. Upon receiving a request for action or\ninformation on a CSE Transmittal #2, the receiving State completes the\n\nAcknowledgments section of page 2. The Acknowledgment can be used to provide\nany information requested on the CSE Transmittal #2, or to indicate when (how\nmany days or on what date) the requested information will be provided. The\njurisdiction sending the Acknowledgment must indicate where the case has been\nreferred for action, and the name, telephone and fax number of a contact\nperson. **************************************************\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995\n\nThis information collection is conducted\nin accordance with\n45 CFR\n303.7\nof the child support enforcement\nprogram.
