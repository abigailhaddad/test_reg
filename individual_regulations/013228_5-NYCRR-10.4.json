Provided, however, such additional distinct and separate\ncontiguous area shall not result in an empire zone that exceeds 1,280\nacres. (m) Any\ncertified business located outside of an empire zone's distinct and separate\ncontiguous areas, pursuant to this section, shall be allowed the empire zone\nbenefits until they are decertified. Such status shall apply to an expansion of\nthe certified business within the parcel or portion thereof that was originally\nlocated in the zone before redesignation.
