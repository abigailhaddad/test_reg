Tit. 14 § 595.9 - Discharge planning and procedures\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Each program shall ensure that a\ndischarge planning process for each resident begins upon admission.

The\ndischarge planning process shall include, at a minimum, the following\nactivities throughout the process: (1)\ninvolvement of the resident, program staff, other community service providers, and collaterals as appropriate and agreed to by the resident; (2)\nclinical assessment of the resident's\npsychiatric status as well as assessment of the resident's rehabilitation, physical, social, and residential needs and goals, which is conducted by\nclinical staff who are qualified by credentials, training and experience to\nconduct such assessments; (3)\nprovision to the resident of options for appropriate residential environments\nand other necessary services; (4)\ncompletion of referrals to appropriate community service and residential\nproviders; and\n(5)\narrangements for\nappointments, where the resident so agrees, with community service and\nresidential providers. (b) A resident who is discharge-ready can be\ndischarged. Discharge readiness requires that: (1)\ndischarge planning activities have been\nfully followed; (2)\nappropriate\nalternative housing has been identified; and\n(3)\nthe resident is willing to relocate to\nsuch housing. (c) A\nresident who is not discharge-ready or who is no longer eligible for services\ncan be discharged provided discharge planning activities have been followed to\nthe extent practicable under the circumstances, and one of the following\nconditions applies: (1)\nthe resident has\npermanently vacated the residence; (2)\nthe resident's condition has changed, as\nfollows: (i) the psychiatric or medical\nstatus of the resident has changed such that the resident requires inpatient\nhospital care; and/or\n(ii)\nthe\nresident's capacity for self preservation, as determined pursuant to section\n595.16\nof this Part, requires a\nlevel of care other than the residential program, or the resident is otherwise\nat risk due to requiring additional medical or psychiatric services or supports\nnot available within the residential program; or\n(iii)\nthe psychiatric status of the resident\nhas changed such that the services or support required can be provided in a\nless restrictive setting, and a clinically-appropriate less restrictive setting\nhas been identified and is available; (3)\nthe resident fails to meet one or more\nmaterial responsibilities for residency as described in section\n595.10\n(a)(2) and\n(c) of this Part; or\n(4)\nthe resident's behavior poses an\nimmediate and substantial threat to the health, safety and well-being of the\nresident or other individuals or creates a serious and ongoing disruption of\nthe therapeutic environment of the residential program; (d) A discharge under paragraph (c)(1) of\nthis section requires that it has been determined that the resident has\nvoluntarily left the residence with no apparent intent to return.
