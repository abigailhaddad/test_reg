(4)\n\nThe term human excreta means feces, urine and other excretions commonly disposed of by the so-called dry system as typified by the ordinary privy. (5)\n\nThe term sewage means waste liquids containing human excreta and decomposing matter flowing in or from a house drainage system or sewer. (c) General prohibitions. No person, including State agencies or political subdivisions having jurisdiction, shall perform any act or grant any permit or approval which may result in the contravention of the standards for raw water quality as contained in Part 170 of this Title. (d) Human excreta. (1)\n\nNo human excreta shall be deposited, thrown or placed on the surface of the ground at any point within 200 feet of any well nor in such manner that it can be washed by rain, melting snow or otherwise over the surface of the ground into any well. (2)\n\nNo human excreta shall be buried in the soil on the watershed of the water supply unless deposited in trenches or pits at a distance of not less than 200 feet from any well and covered with 18 inches of soil in such a manner as to effectually prevent its being washed over the surface of the ground by rain or melting snow.

(2)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle of any kind for the storage or deposit of human excreta, built or to be built on property which is so located, bounded or otherwise placed that the distance named in paragraph (1) of this subdivision cannot be obtained, shall be placed as far as possible from any well and especially constructed of masonry, concrete or metal to form a watertight receptacle from which no outward percolation can take place. Where removable watertight containers are provided, they shall be located as far as practicable from any well. All privies or receptacles referred to in this paragraph shall be constructed or installed only with the approval of the board of trustees of the Village of Walden and in such a manner as effectually to prevent any pollution of the public water supply. (3)\n\nEvery privy or receptacle for the storage or deposit of human excreta located within the distances of 150 feet and 200 feet of any well shall be arranged so that all excreta will be received in a suitable watertight receptacle, or removable container, which shall be emptied when filled within six inches of the top.

(f) Sewage. No sewage shall be discharged or deposited on or beneath the surface of the ground within 200 feet of any well, except in watertight sewers and sewer appurtenances constructed or installed with the approval and under the supervision of the board of trustees of the Village of Walden. These restrictions and limiting distances shall not apply to sewage treatment plants installed under and in accordance with plans which first have been submitted to and approved by the State Commissioner of Health.

(2)\n\nNo stable for cattle or horses, barnyard, hogyard, pigpen, poultry house or yard, hitching place or standing place for horses or other animals shall be so located or maintained in such a manner that the drainings, leachings or washings therefrom may pollute any well.
