  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 255.941 - Low stress reassessment\n\nState Regulations\n(a) General. An operator of a transmission line that operates below 30 percent SMYS\nmay use the following method to reassess a covered segment in accordance with\nsection\n255.939\nof this Part. This method\nof reassessment addresses the threats of external and internal corrosion. The\noperator must have conducted a baseline assessment of the covered segment in\naccordance with the requirements of sections 255.919 and\n255.921\nof this Part. (b) External corrosion. An operator must take\none of the following actions to address external corrosion on the low stress\ncovered segment. (1)\n\nCathodically protected\npipe. To address the threat of external corrosion on cathodically protected\npipe in a covered segment, an operator must perform an electrical survey (i.e., indirect examination tool/method) at least every seven years on the covered\nsegment. An operator must use the results of each survey as part of an overall\nevaluation of the cathodic protection and corrosion threat for the covered\nsegment. This evaluation must consider, at minimum, the leak repair and\ninspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe inspection\nrecords, and the pipeline environment. (2)\n\nUnprotected pipe or cathodically\nprotected pipe where electrical surveys are impractical. If an electrical\nsurvey is impractical on the covered segment an operator must: (i) conduct leakage surveys as required by\nsection\n255.706\nof this Part, at\nfour-month intervals; and\n(ii)\nevery 18 months, identify and remediate areas of active corrosion by evaluating\nleak repair and inspection records, corrosion monitoring records, exposed pipe\ninspection records, and the pipeline environment. (c) Internal corrosion. To address\nthe threat of internal corrosion on a covered segment, an operator must: (1)\nconduct a gas analysis for corrosive\nagents at least once each calendar year; (2)\nconduct periodic testing of fluids\nremoved from the segment. At least once each calendar year test the fluids\nremoved from each storage field that may affect a covered segment; and\n(3)\nat least every seven years, integrate data from the analysis and testing required by paragraphs (1) and (2)\nof this subdivision with applicable internal corrosion leak records, incident\nreports, safety related condition reports, repair records, patrol records, exposed pipe reports, and test records, and define and implement appropriate\nremediation actions. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16\n§\n255.941\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
