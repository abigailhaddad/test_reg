Tit. 18 §§ 398-11.2 - Recovery of overpayments\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The Office will recover any overpayments, including overpayments resulting from aid continuing provided, pursuant to Part\n358 of this Title. (b) The Office\nwill recover overpayments for current recipients through repayment or by\nreducing the amount of any future SSP benefit or SSPNA by no more than 10\npercent of each month's State benefit rate until the overpayment is repaid. (c) In cases where there are\nmultiple overpayments made to a recipient, the order of recovery will be the\nlongest outstanding overpayment followed by the others in chronological\norder. (d) If the individual is no\nlonger an SSP recipient, the recovery shall be made by appropriate legal\nauthority against any income and resources of the former recipient, except that\nthe Office will discontinue recovery efforts of an overpayment from an\nindividual who is no longer a recipient of SSP benefits or SSPNA if the amount\nof the overpayment is less than $125 and the overpayment was not a result of\nfraud on the part of the recipient of SSP benefits or SSPNA. Recovery may be\nreinstated if the individual is subsequently found eligible for SSP benefits or\nSSPNA. (e) Recovery of an SSP\noverpayment will be suspended during the time period when a recipient is in\nreceipt of SSPNA benefits only. (f) In cases where both an underpayment and an overpayment have occurred, the\n\nOffice must offset one against each other and make the appropriate\nadjustment. (g) The Office may\nelect to discontinue recovery of the overpayment for current recipients if it\nis determined that the cost of recovery is greater than the cost of collection\nand reasonable efforts to recover the overpayment have been made, provided that\nthe overpayment was not the result of fraud by the recipient. Reasonable\nefforts must include notification of the amount of the overpayment, the reason\nfor the overpayment, and that repayment is required. (h) All individuals who are liable for the\nrepayment of such overpayment have the right to: (1)\nappeal the determination of the\noverpayment as well as their liability for the overpayment; (2)\nat any time, request that the repayment\nof the overpayment be waived, or the rate of repayment be changed, provided\nthat the overpayment was not the result of fraud; and\n(3)\noffer a compromise settlement to repay a\nsubstantial amount of the overpayment if the Office agrees to waive recovery of\nthe remaining balance, provided that the overpayment was not the result of\nfraud.
