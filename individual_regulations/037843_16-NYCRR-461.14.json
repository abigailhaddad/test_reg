Tit. 16 § 461.14 - Spreading of income, revenue, and expense items\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Income, revenue, or expense items shall\nin all cases be entered in the accounts in the month in which they accrue and\nshall not be equalized by spreading over one or more months by the use of\ndeferred debit, deferred credit, reserve or other accounts, except as otherwise\nspecifically provided in this system of accounts or by order of the\ncommission. (b) When the amount of\nany unusual item includible in an income, operating revenue, or operating\nexpense account for a single month is relatively so large that its inclusion in\nthe accounts for that month would seriously distort those accounts, it may be\nincluded in account 146, other deferred debits, or account 242, other deferred\ncredits, as appropriate, provided an order of the commission shall have been\nobtained permitting such procedure and determining the accounts to which it\nshall be distributed and the period of such distribution.
