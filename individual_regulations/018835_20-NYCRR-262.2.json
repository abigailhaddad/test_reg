  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 262.2 - Allocation of net earnings from self-employment to the City of Yonkers\n\nState Regulations\n\nTax Law, § 4 of § 1340(c); Codes and Ordinances of the City\nof Yonkers, § 92-101\n(a) General. If a nonresident taxpayer derives net earnings from\nself-employment from services performed, or from sources both within and\nwithout the City of Yonkers, such earnings must be apportioned and allocated to\nthe City of Yonkers on a fair and equitable basis in accordance with approved\nmethods of accounting. (b) Method of allocation. (1)\n\nPlace\nof business. If a nonresident taxpayer has no regular place of business\noutside the City of Yonkers, all of such nonresident taxpayer's net earnings\nfrom self-employment must be allocated to the City of Yonkers. (2)\n\nAllocation by taxpayer's books. If the books of the business are so kept as regularly to\ndisclose, to the satisfaction of the State Tax Commission, the proportion of\nthe net earnings derived from or connected with the City of Yonkers sources, the portion of the net earnings from self-employment allocable to the City of\n\nYonkers may be determined from such books. The City of Yonkers earnings tax\nreturn for the nonresident taxpayer must disclose the total amount of net\nearnings from self-employment, the net earnings allocated to the City of\n\nYonkers and the basis upon which such allocation is made. (3)\n\nAllocation by formula. If the books and records of the business do not disclose to\nthe satisfaction of the State Tax Commission the proportion of the net earnings\nfrom self-employment attributable to the activities of the business carried on\nin the City of Yonkers, such proportion must be determined by multiplying the\nnet earnings of the business by the average of the following three\npercentages: (i) Property percentage. (a) General. The percentage computed by\ndividing (\n1\n) the average of the values, at the beginning and\nend of the taxable year, of real and tangible personal property owned or rented\nto the taxpayer, which is connected with net earnings from self-employment and\nlocated within the City of Yonkers, by (\n2\n) the average of the\nvalues, at the beginning and end of the taxable year, of all real and tangible\npersonal property owned by or rented to the taxpayer, which is connected with\nthe net earnings from self-employment and located both within and without the\n\nCity of Yonkers. For this purpose, real property\nincludes real\nproperty whether owned or rented to the taxpayer (also see section\n262.3\nof this Part). For this purpose, real and tangible personal\nproperty\nincludes real and tangible personal property whether owned or\nrented to the taxpayer (also see section\n262.3\nof this Part). (b) Rented real and\ntangible personal property. (1)\n\nThe fair\nmarket value of real and tangible personal property, both within and without\nthe City of Yonkers, which is rented to the taxpayer, is determined by\nmultiplying the gross rents payable during the taxable year by eight. (2)\n\nGross rents, as used in\nthis clause, is the actual sum of money or other consideration payable directly\nor indirectly by the taxpayer or for the taxpayer's benefit for the use or\npossession of the property, and includes: (i) any amount payable for the use or possession of real or tangible personal\nproperty, or any part thereof, whether designated as a fixed sum of money or as\na percentage of sales, profit or otherwise; (ii)\nany amount payable as additional rent or\nin lieu of rent, such as interest, taxes, insurance, repairs or any other\namount required to be paid by the terms of a lease or other\narrangement; (iii)\na proportionate\npart of the cost of any improvement to real or tangible personal property made\nby or on behalf of the taxpayer which reverts to the owner or lessor upon\ntermination of a lease or other arrangement, based on the unexpired term of the\nlease commencing with the date the improvement is completed (or the life of the\nimprovement if its life expectancy is less than the unexpired term of the\nlease); provided, however, that where a building is erected on leased land by\nor on behalf of the taxpayer, the value of the land is determined by\nmultiplying the gross rent by eight, and the value of the building is\ndetermined in the same manner as if owned by the taxpayer. (3)\n\nGross rents do not include: (i) any portion of a payment or credit to the\nproprietor of the business, or to a partner in the partnership conducting the\nbusiness, for the use of real or tangible personal property; (ii)\namounts payable as separate charges for\nwater and electric service furnished by the lessor; (iii)\namounts payable for storage where no\ndesignated space under the control of the taxpayer as a tenant is rented for\nstorage purposes; or\n(iv)\nthat\nportion of any rental payment which, in the discretion of the commissioner, is\napplicable to property subleased by the taxpayer and not used by the taxpayer\nin the carrying on of the business. (c) Other valuation methods. If the general\nmethod outlined in this subparagraph results in valuations which are inaccurate\nor which are not fair and equitable, any other method which will fairly and\nequitably reflect the value may be adopted by the commissioner, either on the\ncommissioner's own motion or on request of a taxpayer. A request by a taxpayer\nfor an alternative method may be made at the time the City of Yonkers earnings\ntax return to which the request relates is filed. A request is made by using\nthe proposed method in the City of Yonkers earnings tax return. The proposed\nmethod must be fully explained in the City of Yonkers earnings tax return. Any\nrequest must contain all facts with respect to the property forming the basis\nfor the proposed valuation, and also a computation of the value of the rented\nreal or tangible personal property based on gross rents in accordance with\nclause (\nb\n) of this subparagraph. Once approved by the\ncommissioner, such basis or such other method must be used for subsequent years\nuntil the facts upon which it is based are materially changed. (ii)\n\nPayroll percentage. The payroll percentage is computed by dividing (\na\n) the total\nwages, salaries and other personal service compensation, paid or incurred\nduring the taxable year to employees in connection with business carried on\nwithin the City of Yonkers, by (\nb\n) the total of all wages, salaries and other personal service compensation, paid or incurred during the\ntaxable year to employees in connection with business carried on both within\nand without the City of Yonkers. (iii)\n\nGross income percentage. The gross\nincome percentage is computed by dividing (\na\n) the gross sales\nor charges for services performed by or through an office, branch or agency of\nthe business located within the City of Yonkers, by (\nb\n) the\ntotal of all gross sales or charges for services performed within and without\nthe City of Yonkers. The sales or charges to be allocated to the City of\n\nYonkers include all sales negotiated or consummated, and charges for services\nperformed by an employee, agent, agency or independent contractor chiefly\nsituated at, connected by contract or otherwise with, or sent out from, offices, branches of the business, or other agencies, situated within the City\nof Yonkers.
