NOTICE DISCLOSING TENANTS' RIGHTS TO REASONABLE\nACCOMMODATIONS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES\nReasonable Accommodations\n\nThe New York State Human Rights Law requires housing\nproviders to make reasonable accommodations or modifications to a building or\nliving space to meet the needs of people with disabilities. For example, if you\nhave a physical, mental, or medical impairment, you can ask your housing\nprovider to make the common areas of your building accessible, or to change\ncertain policies to meet your needs. To request a reasonable accommodation, you should contact\nyour property manager by calling ______________ or ______________, or by\ne-mailing ______________\n*. You will need to inform\nyour housing provider that you have a disability or health problem that\ninterferes with your use of housing, and that your request for accommodation\nmay be necessary to provide you equal access and opportunity to use and enjoy\nyour housing or the amenities and services normally offered by your housing\nprovider. A housing provider may request medical information, when necessary to\nsupport that there is a covered disability and that the need for the\naccommodation is disability related. If you believe that you have been denied a reasonable\naccommodation for your disability, or that you were denied housing or\nretaliated against because you requested a reasonable accommodation, you can\nfile a complaint with the New York State Division of Human Rights as described\nat the end of this notice. Specifically, if you have a physical, mental, or medical\nimpairment, you can request: +\nPermission to change the interior of your housing unit to\nmake it accessible (however, you are required to pay for these modifications, and in the case of a rental your housing provider may require that you restore\nthe unit to its original condition when you move out); Changes to your housing provider's rules, policies, practices, or services; Changes to common areas of the building so you have an equal\nopportunity to use the building. The New York State Human Rights Law requires\nhousing providers to pay for reasonable modifications to common use\nareas. Examples of reasonable modifications and accommodations that\nmay be requested under the New York State Human Rights Law include: If you have a mobility impairment, your housing provider may\nbe required to provide you with a ramp or other reasonable means to permit you\nto enter and exit the building. If your healthcare provider provides documentation that\nhaving an animal will assist with your disability, you should be permitted to\nhave the animal in your home despite a \"no pet\" rule. If you need grab bars in your bathroom, you can request\npermission to install them at your own expense. If your housing was built for\nfirst occupancy after March 13, 1991 and the walls need to be reinforced for\ngrab bars, your housing provider must pay for that to be done. If you have an impairment that requires a parking space close\nto your unit, you can request your housing provider to provide you with that\nparking space, or place you at the top of a waiting list if no adjacent spot is\navailable. If you have a visual impairment and require printed notices\nin an alternative format such as large print font, or need notices to be made\navailable to you electronically, you can request that accommodation from your\nlandlord. Required Accessibility Standards\n\nAll buildings constructed for use after March 13, 1991, are\nrequired to meet the following standards: Public and common areas must be readily accessible to and\nusable by persons with disabilities; All doors must be sufficiently wide to allow passage by\npersons in wheelchairs; and\n\nAll multi-family buildings must contain accessible\npassageways, fixtures, outlets, thermostats, bathrooms, and kitchens. If you believe that your building does not meet the required\naccessibility standards, you can file a complaint with the New York State\n\nDivision of Human Rights. How to File a Complaint\nA complaint must be filed with the Division within one year\nof the alleged discriminatory act or in court within three years of the alleged\ndiscriminatory act. You can find more information on your rights, and on the\nprocedures for filing a complaint, by going to\nwww.dhr.ny.gov, or by calling 1-888-392-3644. You\ncan obtain a complaint form on the website, or one can be e-mailed or mailed to\nyou. You can also call or e-mail a Division regional office. The regional\noffices are listed on the website. -----------\n*\nThe Notice must include contact\ninformation when being provided under 466.15(d)(1), above. However, when being\nprovided under (d)(2) and when this information is not known, the sentence may\nread \"To request a reasonable accommodation, you should contact your property\nmanager.\"\n+\nThis Notice provides information\nabout your rights under the New York State Human Rights Law, which applies to\npersons residing anywhere in New York State. Local laws may provide protections\nin addition to those described in this Notice, but local laws cannot decrease\nyour protections. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
