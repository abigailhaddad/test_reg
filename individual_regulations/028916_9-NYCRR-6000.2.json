Tit. 9 § 6000.2 - Statement of purpose\n\nState Regulations\n(a) With the enactment of the Americans with\n\nDisabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101\net seq., into law, the council\nrecognized the need to revise the height, weight, and physical fitness\nstandards for entry-level police officers to ensure that all such standards\nwere job-related, consistent with business necessity, and did not discriminate\nagainst qualified persons with disabilities. Over a one-year period, a\ncomprehensive statewide job task analysis of the essential functions of an\nentry-level police officer was conducted with the participation of over three\nhundred law enforcement supervisors. A detailed listing of the essential job\nfunctions generally common to all police agencies in the State was developed. Based upon that list, a medical advisory group consisting of physicians and\nother health-related professionals who have examined police officer candidates\npursuant to their employment, formulated a list of standards for entry-level\npolice officers, and noted medical conditions which may potentially disqualify\na candidate from learning and performing the essential functions of an\nentry-level police officer. It is important to keep in mind that the job task\nanalysis only identified the essential job functions generally common to all\npolicing. A local police agency may have additional or different essential job\nfunctions for its entry-level police officers which are not specifically\naddressed in the statewide listing. (b) In accordance with Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. §\n2000e\net\nseq.), the council also recognized the need to revise the physical fitness\nscreening practice so that the test employed provides an objective, verifiable\nmeasure of physical fitness that is properly focused on job-related skills and\naptitudes and provides an accurate assessment of a candidate's physiological\ncapacity to learn and perform the essential job functions of an entry-level\npolice officer. Pursuant to the statewide job task analysis, a battery of\nphysical screening elements was developed based upon the model formulated by\nthe Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research. The analysis recommended the\nadoption of such elements for physical fitness screening and determined that\nsuch elements do not adversely impact a candidate based upon his/her sex. The\nphysical fitness screening elements of the tests are job-related, consistent\nwith business necessity and do not discriminate against qualified persons. Each\nof the physical fitness screening elements of the tests were validated and\ncorrelated to the performance of essential job functions. (c) The purpose of this Part is to set forth\nthe essential job functions adopted pursuant to the statewide job task analysis\nwhich are generally common among all police agencies, the minimum medical and\nphysical fitness standards for entry-level police officer candidates, and the\nprocess for medical review by a qualified physician or a qualified practitioner\nto examine each candidate and allow such candidate to demonstrate on a\ncase-by-case basis, his/her ability to perform the essential job functions of\nan entry-level police officer, regardless of the existence of a potentially\ndisqualifying condition.
