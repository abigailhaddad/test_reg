  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 6020.7 - Time limitations for completion of the basic course for police officers\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Every person appointed as a police\nofficer, on or after July 1, 1960, shall forfeit such position unless he or she\nhas received, within one year from his or her date of original appointment, a\ncertificate of satisfactory completion of a basic course approved by the\ncommissioner. (b) A police officer\nwho, because of exigent circumstances, is unable to complete a basic course\nwithin the one-year period prescribed by subdivision (a) of this section may\napply through his or her employer for an extension of this period by the\ncommissioner. Such applications shall be made in writing and must describe the\ncircumstances which necessitate the application. Illustrative of exigent\ncircumstances are: the officer's inability to complete a basic course for\nhealth reasons or the temporary unavailability of a training program within a\nreasonable distance from the officer's place of employment. If the commissioner\ndetermines that circumstances warrant extension of the one-year period, he or\nshe may grant approval of such extension. In no instance shall this period be\nextended beyond a total of two years from the initial date of appointment as a\npolice officer, except as otherwise required by law. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
