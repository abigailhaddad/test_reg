Such inspection must be\nperformed in the manner prescribed by the commissioner.

Such certificate shall not be\naltered or reproduced. The Department of Motor Vehicles may issue a temporary\ncertificate after application to replace a defective or lost certificate.

Certified motor vehicle certificates are renewable\nupon submission of a completed application and may require proof that the\ninspector has had at least 12 months of experience as a certified motor vehicle\ninspector during the three-year period immediately preceding the renewal date, provided that there is no suspension, revocation or renewal refusal of the\ncertificate or other administrative action in effect pending any prosecution, investigation or hearing and, if required, the inspector has passed the\ninspector certification renewal clinic. Certification may be temporarily\nrenewed pending the outcome of an investigation or hearing. If an inspector's\ncertificate is lost or stolen, the inspector must immediately notify the\ncertification unit in the Albany office of the Department of Motor\n\nVehicles.
