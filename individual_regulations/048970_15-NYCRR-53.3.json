  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15 § 53.3 - Test procedure and records of test\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe test procedure for determination of coefficient of\nfriction of brake linings and the change of coefficient of friction with\nvariables of temperature and time shall be the equivalent of the basic\nprocedure used in the brake lining manufacturing industry as described in\n\nRecommended Practice SAE J661a of the Society of Automotive Engineers, as last\nrevised. Portions of that test procedure to be employed in tests under this\nsection include the following with the exceptions and additions given: (a) Description of test apparatus, except\nthat the heating curve characteristic of the friction machine used in the test, based on the change of drum temperature as a function of time when the drum is\nrunning free is to be recorded. (b) Procedure, including preparation, conditionings, and measurements. (c) Test runs, including base line run, first\nfade run, first recovery run, wear measurements and runs, second fade run, second recovery run and base line rerun. (d) Five complete tests, including\npreparation and conditioning, are to be made for each brake lining submitted\nfor approval except as otherwise provided herein. (e) Recording of data on recommended master\nform titled item 7.1 in SAE Recommended Practice SAE J661a, with the additions\nthat: (1)\nfriction readings should be recorded\nat the temperature points that are necessary for the calculation of the normal\nand hot coefficient of friction. Extrapolation between readings taken at times\nspecified in item 7.1 will be allowed to determine values required by\nsubdivisions (b) and (c) of section\n53.4; (2)\nthe name of the operator is to be printed\ncompletely and legibly in the space provided and is also to be\nsigned; (3)\nthe name of the company\nor firm offering the brake lining for approval, the catalog or formulation\ndesignation, and letter code of the purported coefficient of friction classes\nof the brake lining are to be recorded on the line titled \"Material\". (f) Presentation of data on\nrecommended master form--plot sheet--item 7.2 in SAE Recommended Practice SAE\nJ661a, with the additions that: (1)\none plot\nsheet is to be submitted showing the results of all five tests on one\nsheet; (2)\nplot sheets are to carry\nlegible printed name and signature of the person making the plot, name of the\ncompany offering the brake lining for approval, the catalog or formulation\ndesignation and letter code of purported coefficient of friction\nclass. (g) Computation\nsheets for class coefficient of friction. A computation sheet shall be prepared\nindicating the values of coefficient of friction which were found at the points\nprescribed for normal friction and hot friction. The sheet shall also show the\nprescribed averages of the values for purposes of identifying the classes. This\ncomputation sheet shall be a part of the submittal data for approval of brake\nlinings. (h) Data from each\ncoefficient of friction run shall be recorded to three decimal places. The\ncalculated average shall be rounded off to two decimal places. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 15\n§\n53.3\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release. More comparison features will be added as we have more versions to compare. No prior version found.",
