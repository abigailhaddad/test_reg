  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 361-2.5 - Design and operating requirements for land application facilities\n\nState Regulations\nA land application facility required to obtain a permit\nmust, in addition to the requirements identified in Part 360 of this Title, design, construct, maintain, and operate the facility in compliance with the\nfollowing criteria. For facilities permitted under this section, a closure plan\nand financial assurance are not required. (a) Pollutant limits. (1)\n\nEach waste destined for land application\nmust not exceed the pollutant concentrations found in Table 6 in section\n361-3.9\nof this Part. (i) If the waste contains pollutants at\nconcentrations greater than those set forth in this subdivision, a permit for a\nland application facility will not be issued unless the generator has\nimplemented an identification and abatement program and has remained in\ncompliance with the requirements of this subdivision for a period of at least\nsix continuous months. At least six analyses for total solids and the\nparameter(s) of concern must be provided to the department to demonstrate\ncompliance. (2)\n\nWastewater and partially treated biosolids that are generated at one treatment\nplant and treated at another wastewater treatment facility before land\napplication are not considered separate waste sources. (b) Land application criteria. (1)\n\nThe minimum horizontal distance from the\nperimeter of the land application area must comply with the values found in the\nfollowing table with respect to listed features that exist at the time the\ninitial permit application is submitted to the department. Feature\n\nMinimum horizontal separation distance (in\nfeet)\n\nProperty line........... 50\n\nResidence, place of business, or public contact\narea when waste is not injected*....... 500\n\nResidence, place of business, or public contact\narea when waste is injected*....... 200\n\nPotable water well......... 200\n\nSurface water and State regulated wetland when\nwaste is not injected**........ 200\n\nSurface water and State regulated wetland when\nwaste is injected....... 100\n\nDrainage swale........ 25\n* Excludes owner's or operator's residence. The\nseparation distance requirement applies at the time the permit application is\nsubmitted to the department. The facility is not required to comply with the\nseparation requirement with respect to construction of nearby residences, places of business or public contact areas after the permit application has\nbeen submitted to the department. ** For food processing waste: 100 feet\n(2)\n\nLand application is prohibited in areas\nwhere groundwater is within 24 inches of the ground surface at the time of\napplication. Verification of depth to groundwater prior to application may be\nrequired by the department. If the field is tiled, the top of the tile must be\nat least 24 inches below the ground surface and the discharge of the tile must\nbe at least 200 feet from a potable well, surface water, and State-regulated\nwetland. In areas where carbonate bedrock is present, a greater depth to\ngroundwater may be required by the department. (3)\n\nLand application is prohibited in areas\nwhere bedrock lies less than 24 inches below the ground surface. (4)\n\nThe hydraulic loading must not exceed\n16,000 gallons per acre in any 24-hour period. (5)\n\nLand application is prohibited on land\nwith a slope exceeding 15 percent. Land application of waste with a total\nsolids content of less than 15 percent is prohibited on land with a slope\ngreater than eight percent, unless incorporated within one hour of application\nalong paths parallel to contour lines. (6)\n\nLand application is prohibited in special\nflood hazard areas, unless approved by the department. (7)\n\nThe land application rate must not exceed\nthe lower of the agronomic rate or, for waste with neutralizing value, the\napplication rate needed to achieve a soil pH value in an acceptable range for\nthe crop grown. The department can restrict the application rate based on a\nnutrient other than nitrogen, such as phosphorus. The application rate must be\nsufficiently reduced to ensure appropriate application rates are not exceeded\nif supplemental fertilizer (including manure) will be applied to the\nsite. (8)\n\nThe waste must be\nincorporated into the soil within 24 hours after application, unless a cover\ncrop would be damaged by incorporation and concerns regarding odor and run-off\ncan be mitigated by other means approved by the department. If incorporation is\nused for vector attraction reduction, the period before incorporation is\nlimited to six hours or less. (9)\n\nLand application is prohibited on water-saturated ground or during heavy\nrainfall. Land application is prohibited on snow-covered or frozen ground, except by direct injection below the land surface. Adequate storage or disposal\nfacilities must be available for periods during the year when waste cannot be\napplied. (10)\n\nLand application is\npermitted on all soil types that can support the robust growth of the crop\ngrown. The use of active farmland is sufficient to demonstrate compliance with\nthis requirement. Otherwise, sufficient information must be provided to\ndemonstrate compliance. (11)\n\nProper\nsoil conservation practices and agricultural management practices must be used\nto minimize run-off and soil loss through erosion. (12)\n\nThe temporary field stacking of\nbiosolids prior to land application is allowed, provided the following criteria\nare met: (i) the storage period is a maximum\nof 30 days; (ii)\nthe biosolids are\nstored on the field where they will be applied and the amount stored does not\nexceed the amount that will be land applied on the site; (iii)\nthe storage area must not be located on\nareas with a slope greater than three percent; (iv)\nthe biosolids must have sufficient\nsolids content that it will retain its shape if stacked three feet high and\nmust be formed so that precipitation is shed from the pile; (v) any run-off from the stockpile must be\ncontained within the land application site; and\n(vi)\nafter removal of the residuals, the\nstorage area must be reseeded or returned to active cropland. (13)\n\nWritten permission from the\nlandowner is required for use of the land for land application, unless the\nlandowner is the applicant. (c) Monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. (1)\n\nSufficient monitoring data and other\ninformation needed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this\n\nSubpart must be obtained. The frequency and type of monitoring necessary for\npathogen and vector attraction reduction will be determined by the department\non a case-specific basis and will depend on the monitoring methods\nemployed. (2)\n\nThe annual report\nrequired by paragraph 360.19(k)(3) of this Title must include: (i) the location of each field used for land\napplication and the acreage used for land application on the field; (ii)\nthe crop(s) grown on each\nfield; (iii)\nthe total quantity of\nwaste applied on each field; (iv)\ncalculations showing the hydraulic loading and nutrient loading for the fields\nused for land application; (v) all\nanalytical results required by this Subpart, including copies of all laboratory\nreports; (vi)\nmonitoring data and\ninformation to demonstrate compliance with the pathogen and vector attraction\nreduction requirements of this Subpart, if required; (vii)\na description of any difficulties\nencountered during land application, any complaints arising because of the land\napplication operation and the corrective measures taken; and\n(viii)\na revised management plan for land\napplication for the next year based on previous application rates and crop\nplanting patterns for the next year. The plan must include an identification of\nthe crops to be grown, fields to be used, and revised nutrient and hydraulic\nloading rates. All calculations must be included. (d) Biosolids application. In addition to the requirements identified in\nsubdivisions\n361-2.5\n(a) through\n(c) of this Subpart, a land application\nfacility including biosolids must comply with the following criteria. (1)\n\nLand application criteria. (i) Soil pH must be adjusted to 6.0 standard\nunits or higher before land application unless lime-stabilized biosolids is\nused. If lime-stabilized biosolids is used, the soil pH must be 6.0 standard\nunits or higher after biosolids application. (ii)\n\nLand application must not adversely\naffect a threatened or endangered species or its designated critical\nhabitat. (2)\n\nPathogen\nand vector attraction reduction. (i) One of\nthe following Class B pathogen reduction alternatives must be satisfied. (a) Class B - Alternative 1. The biosolids\nmust be treated by one of the following processes: (1)\n\nAerobic digestion. Biosolids is agitated\nwith air or oxygen to maintain aerobic conditions for a mean cell residence\ntime of at least 40 days at 20 degrees Celsius or greater or at least 60 days\nif the temperature is less than 20 degrees Celsius but greater than or equal to\n15 degrees Celsius. (2)\n\nAir drying. Biosolids is dried on sand beds or on paved or unpaved basins, at a maximum\ndepth of nine inches. The biosolids must dry for a minimum of three months. During at least two of the three months, the ambient average daily temperature\nmust be above zero degrees Celsius. (3)\n\nAnaerobic digestion. Biosolids is treated\nin the absence of air for a mean cell residence time of at least 15 days at 35\ndegrees Celsius or greater or at least 60 days at less than 35 degrees Celsius\nbut greater than or equal to 20 degrees Celsius. (4)\n\nComposting. Using the within-vessel, aerated static pile or windrow composting methods, the temperature of the\nbiosolids is raised to 40° C or higher and remains at 40° C or higher\nfor five consecutive days. For at least four consecutive hours during the five\ndays, the temperature in the compost pile must exceed 55° C; (5)\n\nLime stabilization. Sufficient lime must\nbe added to the biosolids to raise the pH of the biosolids to 12 standard units\nand maintain this pH for a period of at least two hours. (6)\n\nOther methods. Other methods or operating\nconditions may be acceptable if pathogens are reduced to an extent equivalent\nto the reduction achieved by any of the above methods and must be approved by\nthe department; or\n(b) Class B - Alternative 2. The geometric mean of the density of fecal coliform of\nseven analyses representative of the biosolids to be land-applied must be less\nthan either 2,000,000 Most Probable Number per gram of total solids (dry weight\nbasis) or 2,000,000 Colony Forming Units per gram of total solids (dry weight\nbasis).

Vector\nattraction reduction is achieved if the bench-scale digestion produces less\nthan a 17 percent reduction in volatile solids content; (c) if the volatile solids reduction\nrequirement cannot be met for aerobically digested biosolids, vector attraction\nreduction can be demonstrated by aerobically digesting a portion of the\npreviously digested waste that has a percent solids of two percent or less in a\nlaboratory bench-scale unit for an additional 30 days at 20 degrees Celsius. Vector attraction reduction is achieved if the bench scale digestion produces\nless than a 15 percent reduction in volatile solids content; (d) the specific oxygen uptake rate (SOUR)\nfor biosolids treated in an aerobic process must be equal to or less than 1.5\nmilligrams of oxygen per hour per gram of total solids (dry weight basis) at a\ntemperature of 20 degrees Celsius; (e) biosolids is treated by an aerobic\nprocess for a minimum of 14 consecutive days. Throughout that treatment time, the temperature of the waste must remain higher than 40 degrees Celsius and the\naverage temperature of the waste must be higher than 45 degrees\n\nCelsius; (f) the pH of the\nbiosolids must be raised to 12 standard units or higher by alkali addition and, without the addition of more alkali, must remain at 12 standard units or higher\nfor two hours and then remain at 11.5 standard units or higher for an\nadditional 22 hours; (g) for\nbiosolids that does not contain untreated solids generated in a primary\nwastewater treatment process, the percent solids of the waste must be equal to\nor greater than 75 percent, before mixing with other materials, until land\napplication; (h) for biosolids that\ncontains untreated solids generated in a primary wastewater treatment process, the percent solids of the waste must be equal to or greater than 90 percent, before mixing with other materials, until land application; (i) biosolids must be injected below the\nsurface of the land. No significant amount of waste can be present on the land\nsurface within one hour after the waste is applied; or\n(j) biosolids must be incorporated into the\nsoil within six hours after application on the land. (iii)\n\nAccess and crop restrictions: (a) public access to land must be restricted\nduring land application and for at least one year after land application. Access must be controlled during that period using posted signs, fences, gates\nor other appropriate means; (b) food crops with harvested parts that touch the biosolids/soil mixture and are\ntotally above the land surface must not be grown for at least 14 months after\nland application. Food crops with harvested parts below the surface of the land\nmust not be grown for at least 38 months after land application; (c) feed crops, fiber crops, and food crops\ngrown above the soil with harvested parts that do not touch the biosolids/soil\nmixture must not be grown for at least 30 days after land\napplication; (d) animals must not\nbe grazed on the land for at least 30 days after land application; and\n(e) turf grown on land where\nbiosolids has been applied must not be grown for one year after land\napplication when the harvested turf will be placed on either land with a high\npotential for public exposure or a lawn. (3)\n\nMonitoring, recordkeeping and reporting. (i) Each biosolids source must be analyzed\nannually in accordance with the following: (a) the parameters for analysis are found in\n\nTable 1 in section\n361-3.9\nof this Part; (b) the minimum number of analyses, for each\nbiosolids source, is dependent upon the amount of waste that was land applied, as indicated in Table 3 in section\n361-3.9\nof this Part; (c) with the exception of pH and total\nsolids, all results must be reported on a dry weight basis. The analyses must\ncomply with the criteria found in clauses 361-2.4(e)(1)(ii)('f'), ('g'), ('i')\nand ('j') of this Subpart. After the waste has been monitored for two years at\nthe frequency outlined in this paragraph, the department may reduce the annual\nnumber of analyses required if the quality is consistently significantly below\nthe quality standards; and\n(d) wastewater and partially treated biosolids that are generated at one facility\nand treated at another wastewater treatment facility before land application\nare not considered separate sources subject to the criteria in this paragraph. The resultant biosolids generated for land application are subject to this\nparagraph. (ii)\n\nSufficient monitoring data and other information must be obtained and retained\nto demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this Subpart. The frequency\nand type of monitoring necessary to demonstrate compliance with pathogen and\nvector attraction reduction criteria will depend on the methods used, and will\nbe determined by the department. (iii)\n\nAnnual soil sampling is required. Criteria applicable to annual soil sampling are found in paragraph\n361-2.4(e)(5) of this Subpart. Only the fields used for biosolids land\napplication in the previous year must be sampled. (e) Land application of other\nwaste. In addition to the requirements identified in subdivisions\n361-2.5\n(a) -(c)\nof\nthis section, land application of waste other than biosolids must comply with\nthe following criteria: (1)\n\nDomestic sewage\nor septage content. If there is any domestic sewage or septage contribution to\nthe waste, the waste treatment process must satisfy the pathogen and vector\nattraction reduction requirements of this Subpart unless it can be demonstrated\nthat the sanitary waste is a minor portion of the waste stream and that\n\nSalmonella sp. bacteria, enteric viruses, and viable helminth ova are below\ndetectable levels. (2)\n\nNutrient or\nlime content. The waste must contain at least one percent total Kjeldahl\nnitrogen, contains at least 50 percent calcium carbonate equivalence, or\nprovide sufficient documentation to demonstrate in some other manner that the\nwaste is a benefit to the soil or plant grown. (3)\n\nMonitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting. Annual waste monitoring is required, depending on the characteristics of the\nwaste. The parameters for analysis and the frequency will be determined by the\ndepartment depending on the quantity and quality of the waste. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
