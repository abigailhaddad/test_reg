  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 201-6.6 - Permit renewal and modification\n\nState Regulations\n(a) 'Expiration and renewal'. The following procedures shall apply when title V\nfacility permits are renewed or expire: (1)\n\nPermits that are being renewed are subject to the same procedural and review\nrequirements, including those for public participation and affected State and\nEPA review that apply to initial permit issuance. Renewal applications must\ninclude any revisions or modifications enacted during the previous permit term. (2)\n\nPermit expiration terminates\nthe major facility's right to operate unless a timely and complete renewal\napplication has been submitted consistent with section\n201-6.2\n(a) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nIf the department\nfails to act in a timely way in the renewal of a permit, the administrator may\ninvoke the authority under section 505(e) of the act to terminate, modify or\nrevoke and reissue a permit. (4)\n\nThe department shall take final action upon permit renewal within 18 months of\nreceipt of a complete application. If the department fails to take final action\non a renewal application within 18 months of the receipt of a complete\napplication, such failure to act shall be treated as a final agency action\nsolely for the purposes of judicial review for failure to take final\naction. (5)\n\nAll the terms and\nconditions of a permit shall be automatically continued pending final\ndetermination by the department on a request for permit renewal, provided the\nfacility owner or operator has made a timely and complete application and paid\nthe required fees. (b) 'Administrative permit amendments'. (1)\n\nAdministrative amendments to title V facility permits include the following\nchanges: (i) correction of typographical\nerrors; (ii)\nidentification of a\nchange in the name, address, or phone number of any person identified in the\npermit or a similar minor administrative change at the source; (iii)\nthose requiring more frequent\nmonitoring or reporting by the permittee; (iv)\nthose allowing for a change in ownership\nor operational control of a facility where the department determines that no\nother change in the permit is necessary, provided that a written agreement\ncontaining a specific date for transfer of permit responsibility, coverage, and\nliability between the current and new permittee has been submitted to the\ndepartment; or\n(v) incorporation\ninto the permit of the requirements from a State facility permit issued by the\ndepartment provided that public participation pursuant to Part 621 of this\n\nTitle, and the EPA and affected State review process for the state facility\npermit were equivalent to the review process and compliance requirements\nnecessary for issuance of a title V facility permit. (2)\nthe request for an administrative permit\namendment shall be reviewed and acted upon by the department in accordance with\nthe time frames and procedures established in Part 621 of this Title and\nsubparagraph (i) of this paragraph. Administrative permit amendments for the\npurposes of the acid rain portion of the permit shall be governed by\nregulations promulgated under title IV of the act. The department may\nincorporate such changes into the permit without providing notice to the public\nor affected states provided that it designates any such permit revisions as\nhaving been made pursuant to this paragraph. (i) Within 15 days of receipt of a request\nfor an administrative permit amendment, the department shall take final action\non such request, and may incorporate such changes without providing notice to\nthe public or affected states provided that it designates any such permit\nrevisions as having been made pursuant to this section. (ii)\n\nThe department shall make a copy of the\nrevised permit available to the administrator. (iii)\n\nThe owner or operator of a facility may\nimplement the changes addressed in the request f or an administrative amendment\nafter 15 days from receipt of the request by the department. (3)\n\nThe department shall, upon\ntaking final action granting a request for an administrative permit amendment, allow coverage by the permit shield in section 201-6. 4 of this Subpart. The\ndepartment shall also allow such coverage for administrative permit amendments\nmade pursuant to subparagraph (1)(v) o f this subdivision, provided the state\nfacility permit met the relevant requirements of this Part for significant\npermit modifications. (c) 'Minor permit modifications'. (1)\n\nMinor\npermit modification procedures may be used only for those permit modifications\nthat do not exceed the criteria under subparagraphs (i) through (v) of this\nparagraph. In no case shall a facility that has been issued multiple permits be\nallowed to make minor permit modifications which, in the aggregate, would be a\nsignificant permit modification if the facility had been issued a single\npermit, unless such facility complies with all the requirements for a\nsignificant modification. (i) Do not violate\nany applicable requirement. (ii)\n\nDo\nnot involve significant changes to existing monitoring, reporting, or\nrecordkeeping requirements in the permit and are not otherwise a significant\nchange in the permit. (iii)\n\nDo not\nrequire or change a case-by-case determination of a Federal emission limitation\nor other Federal standard, or a specific determination for portable sources\ncausing adverse ambient impacts, or a visibility or increment\nanalysis. (iv)\n\nDo not seek to\nestablish or change a permit term or condition that the facility has assumed to\navoid an applicable requirement to which the emission source would otherwise be\nsubject. Such terms and conditions include: ('a')\na federally enforceable emissions cap\nassumed to avoid classification as a modification under any provision of title\nI of the act or Part 231 of this Title; or\n('b')\nan alternative emissions limit approved\npursuant to the early reduction program under section 112 of the act. (v) Are not modifications under\nany provision of title I of the act, resulting in an NSR major modification as\ndefined and regulated under Part 231 of this Title. (2)\n\nNotwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (9) of\nthis subdivision, minor permit modification procedures may be used for permit\nmodifications involving the use of economic incentives, marketable permits, emission trading, and other similar approaches to the extent that such minor\npermit modification procedures are explicitly provided for in an applicable\nimplementation plan or in applicable requirements promulgated by the\nadministrator. (3)\n\nAn application\nfor a minor permit modification shall meet the requirements of section 201-6.2\n(d) of this Subpart, and shall provide the following information: (i) a description of the change, the\nemissions resulting from the change, and any new applicable requirements that\nwill apply if the change occurs; (ii)\ncertification by a responsible official, consistent with this Subpart, that the proposed modification meets the criteria\ncontained herein for use of minor permit modification procedures and a request\nthat such procedures be used; (iii)\ncompleted forms for use in notifying the administrator and affected states; and\n(iv)\nthe major facility's\nsuggested draft permit in a format acceptable to the department. (4)\n\nThe department will review and\nact on applications for minor permit modifications in accordance with\ntimeframes and procedures established for minor projects under Part 621 of this\n\nTitle. Upon application by an owner or operator for a minor permit\nmodification, the department shall determine whether or not such application is\ncomplete within 15 days after receipt of such application and notify the\napplicant as required under Part 621 of this Title. (5)\n\nThe facility may proceed with the\nrequested modification upon receipt of a notice of complete application from\nthe department confirming that the modification is minor. If the department f\nails to issue such notice, the application shall be deemed complete by default\non the 15th day after receipt of the application and the permittee may proceed\nwith the requested modification on the 25th day after the date that the\ndepartment received the application. After the facility or operator makes the\nchange and until the department takes final action, or notifies the permittee\nthat the requested modification does not meet the minor modification criteria, or that EPA objects to the modification requested, the facility must comply\nwith both the applicable requirements governing the change and any proposed\npermit terms and conditions. During this time period, the facility need not\ncomply with the existing permit terms and conditions it seeks to modify. However, if the facility fails to comply with its proposed permit terms and\nconditions during this time period, the existing permit terms and conditions it\nseeks to modify may be enforced against it. (6)\n\nThe department shall provide the notice\nof complete application, or provide an alternate form of notification approved\nby the administrator, to the administrator and affected states on or before the\ndate that the applicant is notified. Such notification is not required if the\nmodification involves only emission units or permit terms and conditions that\nare not subject to any applicable requirement. (7)\n\nThe department must issue a final\ndecision on a minor modification request not later than 45 day s after the date\nthat the application was complete. However, the department may not issue a\nfinal permit modification until 45 days have elapsed from the date that the\ndepartment notified the administrator under paragraph (6) of this subdivision\nor until the administrator has notified the department that they will not\nobject to issuance of the permit modification, whichever occurs\nfirst. (8)\n\nThe permit shield\ndescribed in section\n201-6.4\nof this Subpart does not\nextend to minor permit modifications. (9)\n\nThe department may process groups of\napplications for minor permit modifications simultaneously. (d) 'Significant permit\nmodifications'. Significant permit modifications are those that are not minor\npermit modifications or administrative permit amendments. Every significant\nchange in existing monitoring permit terms or conditions, and every relaxation\nof reporting or recordkeeping permit terms or conditions at a facility subject\nto this Subpart shall be considered significant. An application for permit\nmodification should be submitted by the owner or operator, and shall be subject\nto the provisions of this Subpart for new applications for a permit. (e) 'Reopenings for cause by EPA'. (1)\n\nIf the administrator finds that cause\nexists to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue a permit pursuant to section\n201-6.4\nof this Subpart, the\nadministrator will notify the department and the permittee of such finding in\nwriting. (2)\n\nThe department shall, within 90 days after receipt of such notification, forward to EPA a proposed\ndetermination of termination, modification, or revocation and reissuance, as\nappropriate. The administrator may extend this 90-day period for an additional\n90 days if the administrator finds that a new or revised permit application is\nnecessary or that the department must require the permittee to submit\nadditional information. (3)\n\nThe\nadministrator will review the proposed determination from the department within\n90 days of receipt. (4)\n\nThe\ndepartment shall have 90 days from receipt of an EPA objection to resolve any\nobjection that EPA makes and to terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the\npermit in accordance with the administrator's objection. (5)\n\nIf the department fails to submit a\nproposed determination pursuant to paragraph (2) of this subdivision or fails\nto resolve any objection pursuant to paragraph (4) of this subdivision, the\nadministrator will terminate, modify, or revoke and reissue the permit after\ntaking the following actions: (i) providing\nat least 30 days' notice to the permittee in writing of the reasons for any\nsuch action. This notice may be given during the procedures in paragraphs (1)\nthrough (4) of this subdivision; (ii)\nproviding the permittee an opportunity\nfor comment on the administrator's proposed action a n d an opportunity for a\nhearing. (f) 'Surrender of title V facility permits'. A source owner or operator may close\ndown operations and surrender title V permit(s) to the\ndepartment. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
