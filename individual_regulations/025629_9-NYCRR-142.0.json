  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 142.0 - Statement of policy\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Subdivisions\n5 and 7 of section\n130\nof the\n\nCivil Service Law were added by chapter 618 of the Laws of 1967. Under\nsubdivision 7, which was amended by chapter 307 of the Laws of 1979, the\ndirector of the Division of Classification and Compensation, Department of\n\nCivil Service, may, subject to the approval of the Director of the Budget, authorize payment of additional salary (a pay differential) to be added as an\nadjustment to the hiring rate and job rate of the salary grade or grades for a\ngiven occupation in one or more areas of the State, provided he finds that\nother employers in such area or areas pay wage rates for the same or a similar\noccupation substantially higher than the rates paid by the State. Such\ngeographic area pay differential shall be paid to employees whose basic annual\nsalary is at or below the unadjusted job rate of the salary grade, less any\namount of additional payment employees may be receiving as a result of a\npreviously authorized geographic area pay differential. Employees whose\nsalaries are above the unadjusted job rate for the salary grade shall receive a\nportion of the differential sufficient to increase their salary to the adjusted\njob rate, less any amount of additional payment which such employees may be\nreceiving as a result of a previously authorized geographic area pay\ndifferential. (b) The purpose of a\ngeographic area pay differential is to enable the State to pay competitive\nsalaries for a particular occupation in a \"high rate\" area, in order to attract\nand retain competent personnel, without having to raise the basic salary grade\nfor the occupation on a statewide scale and without having to establish a\nhigher basic rate of pay than that generally paid by other employers in the\n\nState for the same occupation. (c) A geographic area pay differential is not, nor should it be construed as, a\nsubstitute for general salary adjustments. (d) A geographic area pay differential cannot\nbe authorized because of differences in the cost of living among areas of the\n\nState. (e) The law specifies that a\ngeographic area pay differential shall be in addition to and not part of an\nemployee's basic annual salary, and shall not affect or impair any performance\nadvancement payments, performance awards, longevity payments or other rights or\nbenefits to which an employee is entitled; provided, however, that any\ndifferential shall be included as compensation for retirement purposes. It may\nbe terminated or changed by action of the Director of Classification and\n\nCompensation, subject to approval by the Director of the Budget. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes\nR. & Regs. Tit. 9\n§\n142.0\n\nState regulations are updated quarterly; we currently have two versions available. Below is a\ncomparison between our most recent version and the prior quarterly release.
