  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 6 §§ 374-2.5 - Standards for used oil transporters and transfer facilities\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Applicability. (1)\n\nGeneral. Except as provided in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, this section applies to all\nused oil transporters. Used oil transporters are persons who transport used\noil, persons who collect used oil from more than one generator and transport\nthe collected oil, and owners and operators of used oil transfer facilities. (i) This section does not apply to on-site\ntransportation. (ii)\n\nThis section\ndoes not apply to generators who transport shipments of used oil totaling 55\ngallons or less from the generator to a used oil collection center as specified\nin section\n374-2.3\n(e)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart. (iii)\n\nThis section\ndoes not apply to generators who transport shipments of used oil totaling 55\ngallons or less from the generator to a used oil aggregation point owned or\noperated by the same generator as specified in section\n374-2.3\n(e)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart. (iv)\n\nThis section\ndoes not apply to transportation of used oil from household do-it-yourselfers\nto a regulated used oil generator, collection center, aggregation point, processor/re-refiner, or burner subject to the requirements of this Subpart. Except as provided in subparagraphs (i) through (iii) of this paragraph, this\nsection does apply, however, to transportation of collected household\ndo-it-yourselfer used oil from regulated used oil generators, collection\ncenters, aggregation points, or other facilities where household\ndo-it-yourselfer used oil is collected. (2)\n\nImports and exports. Transporters who\nimport used oil from abroad or export used oil outside of the United States are\nsubject to the requirements of this section from the time the used oil enters\nand until the time it exits New York State. (3)\n\nTrucks used to transport hazardous waste. Unless trucks previously used to transport hazardous waste are emptied as\ndescribed in section\n371.1\n(h) of this\n\nTitle prior to transporting used oil, the used oil is considered to have been\nmixed with the hazardous waste and must be managed as hazardous waste unless, under the provisions of section\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart, the hazardous waste/used oil mixture is determined not to be\nhazardous waste. (4)\n\nOther\napplicable provisions. Used oil transfer facilities may be required to obtain a\npermit in accordance with section\n374-2.10\n(b) of\nthis Subpart. Used oil transporters who conduct the following activities are\nalso subject to other applicable provisions of this Subpart as indicated in\nsubparagraphs (i) through (vi) of this paragraph: (i) transporters who generate used oil must\nalso comply with section\n374-2.3\nof this Subpart; (ii)\ntransporters who process or re-refine\nused oil, except as provided in subdivision (b) of this section, must also\ncomply with sections 374-2.6 and\n374-2.10\n(c) of\nthis Subpart; (iii)\ntransporters\nwho burn off-specification used oil for energy recovery must also comply with\nsection\n374-2.7\nof this Subpart; (iv)\ntransporters who direct shipments of\noff-specification used oil from their facility to a used oil burner, or who\nfirst claim that used oil that is to be burned for energy recovery meets the\nused oil fuel specifications set forth in section\n374-2.2\n(b)(1)\nof\nthis Subpart must also comply with section\n374-2.8\nof this Subpart; (v) transporters who dispose of used oil must\nalso comply with section\n374-2.9\nof this Subpart; and\n(vi)\nused oil transfer\nfacilities that store used oil for 35 days or less, and which do not process\nused oil, must comply with the reporting requirements of section\n374-2.6\n(h)(2)\nof\nthis Subpart that are otherwise applicable to used oil processors/re-refiners, except for the requirement to provide a summary of the manner in which the used\noil is processed as set forth in section\n374-2.6\n(h)(2)(iv)\n(\nc\n) of this Subpart. (b) Restrictions on transporters who\nare not also processors or re-refiners. (1)\n\nUsed oil transporters may consolidate or\naggregate loads of used oil for purposes of transportation. However, except as\nprovided in paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subdivision, used oil transporters\nmay not process used oil unless they also comply with the requirements for\nprocessors/re-refiners in section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nTransporters may conduct incidental\nprocessing operations that occur in the normal course of used oil\ntransportation (\ne.g., settling and water separation), but that\nare not designed to produce (or make more amenable for production of) used oil\nderived products unless they also comply with the processor/re-refiner\nrequirements in section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart. (3)\n\nTransporters of used oil that is removed\nfrom oil bearing electrical transformers and turbines and filtered by the\ntransporter or at a transfer facility prior to being returned to its original\nuse are not subject to the processor/re-refiner requirements in section\n374-2.6\nof this\n\nSubpart. (c) Notification. (1)\n\nIdentification\nnumbers. Used oil transporters who have not previously complied with the\nnotification requirements of RCRA, section 3010 must comply with these\nrequirements and obtain an EPA identification number. (2)\n\nMechanics of notification. Used oil\ntransporters who have not received an EPA identification number may obtain one\nby notifying the EPA regional administrator of their used oil activity by\nsubmitting either: (i) a completed EPA Form\n8700-12 (EPA Form 8700-12 is available at the EPA website, http://www.epa.gov); or\n(ii)\na letter requesting an EPA\nidentification number. Call RCRA/Superfund Hotline to determine where to send a\nletter requesting an EPA identification number. The letter must include the\nfollowing information: (a) transporter\ncompany name; (b) owner of the\ntransporter company; (c) mailing\naddress for the transporter; (d) name and telephone number for the transporter point of contact; (e) type of transport activity\n(\ni.e., transport only, transport and transfer facility, transfer facility only); (f) location of all transfer facilities at which used oil is stored; and\n(g) name and telephone number for a contact\nat each transfer facility. (d) Used oil transportation. (1)\n\nDeliveries. A used oil transporter must\ndeliver all used oil received to: (i) another\nused oil transporter who has obtained an EPA identification number and who is\nauthorized under Part 364 of this Title to transport used oil; (a) owners or operators of a used oil\ntransfer facility must ensure that used oil is transported to their facility\nonly by transporters who are permitted, as required by Part 364 of this Title. Owners or operators of used oil transfer facilities are required to confirm\nthat the transporters delivering used oil to their facilities carry a valid\n\nPart 364 waste transporter permit, if required; (ii)\na used oil processing/re-refining\nfacility who has obtained an EPA identification number and who is authorized\nunder Part 360 of this Title; (iii)\nan off-specification used oil burner facility who has obtained an EPA\nidentification number and who is authorized under Subpart 225-2 of this Title; or\n(iv)\nan on-specification used\noil burner facility. (2)\nDOT requirements. Used oil transporters must comply with all applicable\nrequirements of Part 364 of this Title, and all applicable requirements under\nthe U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR parts\n171\nthrough\n180, as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. Persons transporting used oil that meets the definition of a hazardous\nmaterial in\n49 CFR\n171.8, as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title, must comply with all applicable regulations in\n49 CFR parts\n171\nthrough\n180, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e)\nof this Title. (3)\n\nUsed oil\ndischarges. Any spill, discharge, or release of used oil shall be subject to\nall applicable provisions of article 12 of the Navigation Law (NL sections 170\nthrough 197) and its implementing rules and regulations, 17 NYCRR Parts\n32\n-\n33, and Part 611 of this Title, regarding, but not limited to, notification, clean up, and liability, and are also subject to applicable provisions of\narticle 17, titles 10 and 17, of the Environmental Conservation Law. (i) In the event of a spill, discharge, or\nrelease of used oil during transportation, the transporter must comply with the\nnotification provisions of section\n613-6.2\nof this Title and must take\nappropriate immediate action to protect human health and the environment\n(\ne.g., notify local authorities or dike the discharge\narea). (ii)\n\nIf a discharge of used\noil occurs during transportation and an official (State or local government or\na Federal agency), acting within the scope of official responsibilities, determines that immediate removal of the used oil is necessary to protect human\nhealth or the environment, that official may authorize the removal of the used\noil by transporters who do not have EPA identification numbers. (iii)\n\nAn air, rail, highway, or water\ntransporter who has discharged used oil must: (a) give notice, if required by\n49 CFR\n171.15, as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title, to the National Response Center ([800] 424-8802\nor [202] 426-2675) and, within two hours of detection, to the department Spill\n\nResponse Hotline at (800) 457-7362, or, if calling from out of state, (518)\n457-7362; and\n(b) report in writing\nas required by\n49 CFR\n171.16, as incorporated by reference in\nsection 370.1(e) of this Title, to the Director, Office of Hazardous Materials\n\nRegulations, Materials Transportation Bureau, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590. (iv)\nA water transporter who has discharged\nused oil must also give notice as required by\n33 CFR\n153.203, as incorporated in section 370.1(e)\nof this Title. (v) A transporter\nmust clean up any used oil discharge that occurs during transportation and take\nsuch action as may be required or approved by Federal, State, or local\nofficials so that the used oil discharge no longer presents a hazard to human\nhealth or the environment and is consistent with the remediation standards of\narticle 12 of the Navigation Law. (e) Quality control and rebuttable\npresumption for used oil. (1)\n\nTo\nensure that used oil is not a hazardous waste under the rebuttable presumption\nof section\n374-2.2\n(a)(2)(i)\n(\nb\n) of this Subpart, a used oil transporter must determine\nwhether the total halogen content of used oil being transported is greater than\nor equal to 1,000 ppm. The transporter must make this determination by: (i) testing the used oil; or\n(ii)\napplying knowledge of the halogen\ncontent of the used oil in light of the materials or processes\nused. (2)\nA transporter\nwho is an owner or operator of a used oil transfer facility must test all\nincoming loads of used oil for total halogen content by employing the screening\nprocedures set forth under section\n374-2.6\n(d) of this\n\nSubpart. The owner or operator must develop and follow a written quality\ncontrol plan for the facility, in accordance with section\n374-2.6\n(f) of this\n\nSubpart. (3)\n\nIf the used oil\ncontains greater than or equal to 1,000 ppm total halogens, it is presumed to\nbe a hazardous waste because it has been mixed with halogenated hazardous waste\nlisted in section\n371.4\nof this Title. The owner or\noperator may rebut the presumption by demonstrating that the used oil does not\ncontain hazardous waste (for example, by demonstrating that the used oil does\nnot contain significant concentrations of halogenated hazardous constituents\nlisted in Appendix 23 of this Title). (i) Laboratory analyses completed for purposes of rebuttable presumption must be\nperformed by a laboratory currently certified under the appropriate approval\ncategories by the New York State Department of Health's Environmental\n\nLaboratory Approval Program (ELAP). (ii)\n\nThe rebuttable presumption does not\napply to metalworking oils/fluids containing chlorinated paraffins, if they are\nprocessed, through a tolling arrangement, as described in section\n374-2.3\n(e)(3)\nof\nthis Subpart, to reclaim metalworking oils/fluids. The presumption does apply\nto metalworking oils/fluids if such oils/fluids are recycled in any other\nmanner, or disposed. (iii)\n\nThe\nrebuttable presumption does not apply to used oils contaminated with\nchlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) removed from refrigeration units if the CFCs are\ndestined for reclamation. The rebuttable presumption does apply to used oils\ncontaminated with CFCs that have been mixed with used oil from sources other\nthan refrigeration units. (4)\n\nUsed oil containing 50 ppm by weight, or\ngreater, of PCBs is a hazardous waste, excluding oil derived from small\ncapacitors, as defined in section\n371.4\n(e)(3)(ii)\nof\nthis Title, as the sole PCB contamination source. Applicable standards are\ncontained in Part 370 through Subpart 374-1 and Part 376 of this\n\nTitle. (5)\n\nRecord retention. Records of analyses conducted or information used to comply with paragraphs\n(1), (2), (3), and (4) of this subdivision must be maintained by the\ntransporter for at least three years. The owner or operator of a transfer\nfacility subject to permitting under Part 360 of this Title must maintain the\nrecords for at least seven years. (f) Used oil storage at transfer\nfacilities. Used oil transporters are subject to all applicable Spill\n\nPrevention, Control and Countermeasures ( 40 CFR part\n112, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) in addition to the requirements of this section. Used oil transporters\nare also subject to the Underground Storage Tank ( 40 CFR part\n280, as\nincorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) standards for used oil stored in underground tanks whether or not the\nused oil exhibits any characteristics of hazardous waste, in addition to the\nrequirements of this section. (1)\n\nApplicability. This subdivision applies to used oil transfer facilities. Used\noil transfer facilities are transportation related facilities including loading\ndocks, parking areas, storage areas, and other areas where shipments of used\noil are held for more than 24 hours during the normal course of transportation\nand not longer than 35 days. Transfer facilities that store used oil for more\nthan 35 days are subject to regulation as processors under section\n374-2.6\nof this Subpart. (2)\n\nStorage units. Owners or operators of\nused oil transfer facilities may not store used oil in units other than tanks, containers or units subject to regulation under Subparts 373-2 and 373-3, of\nthis Title. (3)\n\nUsed oil tanks. Compliance with petroleum bulk storage regulations. (i) All aboveground or underground used oil\ntank systems, regardless of tank size, must be in compliance with Part 613 of\nthis Title. In addition, owners and/or operators must comply with the following\nrequirements: (a) aboveground used oil tanks\nmust be equipped with secondary containment: (1)\nthe secondary containment system must\nconsist of, at a minimum: (i) dikes, berms or\nretaining walls; and\n(ii)\na floor.

(2)\n\nThe entire\ncontainment system, including walls and floors, must be sufficiently impervious\nto used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment system from\nmigrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface\nwater. (b) used oil tanks\nat a facility licensed under Part 610 of this Title do not require registration\nunder Part 613 of this Title. (ii)\n\nNew aboveground and new underground used\noil tank systems, regardless of tank size, must be installed in accordance with\n\nPart 613 of this Title. (4)\n\nCondition of units. Containers and\naboveground used oil tanks used to store used oil at transfer facilities must\nbe: (i) in good condition (no severe rusting, apparent structural defects or deterioration); and\n(ii)\nnot leaking (no visible\nleaks). (5)\n\nSecondary\ncontainment for containers. Containers used to store used oil at transfer\nfacilities must be equipped with a secondary containment system. (i) The secondary containment system must\nconsist of, at a minimum: (a) dikes, berms or\nretaining walls; (b) a floor. The\nfloor must cover the entire area within the dikes, berms or retaining walls; or\n(c) an equivalent secondary\ncontainment system. (ii)\n\nThe entire containment system, including walls and floors, must be sufficiently\nimpervious to used oil to prevent any used oil released into the containment\nsystem from migrating out of the system to the soil, groundwater, or surface\nwater. (6)\n\nLabels. (i) Every container and aboveground used oil\ntank used to store used oil at a transfer facility must be clearly labeled or\nmarked with the words \"Used Oil\". In addition, every aboveground tank used to\nstore oil at a transfer facility must be labeled with the design capacity and\nworking capacity of the tank. (ii)\n\nFill pipes used to transfer used oil into underground used oil tanks at\ntransfer facilities must be clearly labeled or marked with the capacity of the\ntank and with the words \"Used Oil\". (7)\n\nResponse to releases. (i) Any spill, discharge, or release of used\noil shall be subject to all applicable provisions of article 12 of the\n\nNavigation Law (NL sections 170 through 197) and its implementing rules and\nregulations, 17 NYCRR Parts\n32\n-\n33\nand Part 611 of this Title, regarding, but\nnot limited to, notification, clean up, and liability, and are subject to\napplicable provisions of article 17, titles 10 and 17, of the Environmental\n\nConservation Law, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title. (ii)\n\nUpon detection of a release of used oil\nto the environment that is not subject to the requirements of subpart F of 40\nCFR part\n280, as incorporated by reference in section 370.1(e) of this Title, and Subpart 613-6 of this Title, the owner/operator of a transfer facility must\nperform the following cleanup steps: (a) stop\nthe release; (b) contain the\nreleased used oil; (c) clean up and\nmanage properly the released used oil and other materials; (d) if necessary, repair or replace any\nleaking used oil storage containers or tanks prior to returning them to\nservice.
