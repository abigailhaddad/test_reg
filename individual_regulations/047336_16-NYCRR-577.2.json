  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 § 577.2 - Additions and retirements of water plant\n\nState Regulations\n(a) For the purpose of avoiding undue\nrefinement in accounting for additions to and retirements and replacements of\nwater plant, all property shall be considered as consisting of units of\nproperty or retirement units and minor items. Units of property means those\nitems of water plant which are sufficiently distinct or important so that when\nthey are retired with or without being replaced by other units of the same type\nor use, they are accounted for by crediting the amount at which they are\ncarried on the books to the water plant account in which included. All other\nitems are to be considered as minor items. These retirement units should not be\nconfused with continuing property record units filed by utilities with annual\noperating revenues in excess of $50,000; the latter are units for which the\ncost will be shown separately in the continuing property records. Whenever\nunits of property are mentioned in this system of accounts, the term refers to\nretirement units and not to continuing property record units. Each utility may\nadopt its own list of units of property for the purpose of this instruction\nuntil such time as the commission shall prescribe a list of units. (b) Units of property. (1)\n\nWhen a unit of property is added to water\nplant, the cost thereof shall be added to the appropriate water plant\naccount. (2)\n\nWhen a unit of\nproperty is retired from water plant (i.e., is removed, sold, abandoned, destroyed or otherwise ceases to be used or useful in water service), whether\nor not replaced by another unit of the same type or use, the amount at which it\nis carried on the books shall be credited to the water plant account in which\nit is included (determined in the manner set forth in subd. [d], below) and\ncharged to the depreciation reserve provided for such property. (c) Minor items of property. (1)\n\nWhen a minor item of property which does\nnot replace a similar item is added to water plant the cost thereof shall be\ncharged to the appropriate maintenance account and no entry shall be made in\nthe water plant or depreciation reserve accounts. (2)\n\nWhen a minor item is retired and replaced\nindependently of the unit of property of which it is a part, the cost of\nreplacement shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account and no\nentry shall be made in the water plant or depreciation reserve\naccounts. (3)\n\nWhen a minor item the\nbook cost of which does not exceed $50 is retired and not replaced, if the book\ncost of such minor item is included with or spread over one or more units of\nproperty so that it will be accounted for through the retirement of such one or\nmore units of property, no separate credit to the water plant account shall be\nmade; otherwise, however, the book cost of such minor item shall be credited to\nthe appropriate water plant account and charged to account 1250, Reserve for\n\nDepreciation of Utility Plant. Note: For example, if a given length of main, including\nall fittings, valves, etc., is a unit and the cost of such section of main\nincludes the cost of the fittings, valves, etc., no separate credit to the\nplant accounts shall be made when a fitting or valve (the book cost of which is\nless than $50) is retired even though not replaced. Any labor in connection\nwith the removal shall be charged to the appropriate maintenance account, and\nany salvage for material recovered shall be credited to the appropriate\nmaintenance account. (d) Determination of amount to be credited to\nplant accounts. Water plant retired shall be credited to the plant accounts at\nthe amount at which such property is included therein, including all components\nof construction costs, such as engineering, supervision, interest and taxes\nduring construction, etc. The amount shall be determined from the utility's\nrecords and if this can not be done, it shall be estimated. When it is\nimpracticable to determine the amount carried on the books for each item, due\nto the relatively large number or small cost thereof, the average of such\nitems, with due allowances for any differences in size, character, and year of\ninstallation (if known), shall be used. (e) Land retired. When land is retired the\namount at which it is carried on the books shall be credited to the appropriate\nland account. If the land is sold, the difference between the amount at which\nit is carried on the books and the sale price of the land (less commissions and\nother expenses of making the sale) shall be credited or debited to account\n1250, Reserve for Depreciation of Utility Plant.
