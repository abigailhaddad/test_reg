  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 16 §§ 1100-2.23 - Exhibit 22: Electric and Magnetic Fields\n\nState Regulations\n\nExhibit 22 shall contain: (a) For the entire ROW of the proposed\ninterconnection line, or any collection line rated over sixty-nine (69)-kV, providing the electrical interconnection between the facility, and any\ntransmission line between the facility and the existing electric transmission\nand distribution system: identify every ROW segment having unique electric and\nmagnetic field (EMF) characteristics due to structure types and average\nheights, ROW widths, and co-location of other transmission facilities in the\nROW. (b) For each identified ROW\nsegment, provide both \"base case\" and \"proposed\" cross-sections to scale\nshowing: (1)\n\nAll overhead electric\ntransmission, sub-transmission and distribution facilities including the\nproposed facility showing structural details and dimensions and identifying\nphase spacing, phasing, and any other characteristics affecting EMF\nemissions; (2)\n\nAll underground\nelectric transmission, sub-transmission and distribution facilities; (3)\n\nAll underground gas transmission\nfacilities; (4)\n\nAll right-of-way\nboundaries; and\n(5)\n\nStructural\ndetails and dimensions for all structures (dimensions, phase spacing, phasing, and similar categories) and include a station number identifying the\nlocation. (c) A set of\nthe aerial photos/drawings enhanced by showing the exact location of each: (1)\n\nIdentified ROW segment; (2)\n\nCross-section; and\n(3)\n\nNearest residence or occupied\nnon-residential building in each identified ROW segment with a stated\nmeasurement of the distance between the edge of ROW and the nearest edge of the\nresidence or building. (d) An EMF study with calculation tables and\nfield strength graphs for each identified ROW segment cross-section, as\nfollows: (1)\n\nThe study shall be signed and\nstamped/sealed by a licensed professional engineer registered and in good\nstanding in the State of New York; (2)\n\nProvide the name of the computer software\nprogram used to model the facilities and make the calculations; (3)\n\nRegarding electric fields, model the\ncircuits at rated voltage and provide electric field calculation tables and\nfield strength graphs calculated at one (1) meter above ground level with five\n(5)-foot measurement intervals depicting the width of the entire ROW and out to\nfive hundred (500) feet from the edge of the ROW on both sides, including\ndigital copies of all input assumptions and outputs for the\ncalculations; (4)\n\nRegarding\nmagnetic fields, model the circuit phase currents equal to the summer normal, summer short term emergency (STE sum), winter- normal, and winter short term\nemergency (STE win) loading conditions and provide magnetic field calculation\ntables and field strength graphs calculated at one (1) meter above ground level\nwith five (5)-foot measurement intervals depicting the width of the entire ROW\nand out to five hundred (500) feet from the edge of the ROW on both sides, including digital copies of all input assumptions and outputs for the\ncalculations; (5)\n\nRegarding\nmagnetic fields, also model the circuit phase currents equal to the maximum\naverage annual load estimated to be occurring on the power lines within ten\n(10) years after the proposed facility is put in operation and provide magnetic\nfield calculation tables and field strength graphs calculated at one (1) meter\nabove ground level with five (5)-foot measurement intervals depicting the width\nof the entire ROW and out to five hundred (500) feet from the edge of the ROW\non both sides, including digital copies of all input assumptions and outputs\nfor the calculations; (6)\n\nRegarding\nmagnetic fields, also model a \"base case\" with the circuit phase currents equal\nto the maximum average annual load currently estimated to be occurring on the\nexisting power lines within the ROW (without construction or operation of the\nproposed facility) and provide magnetic field calculation tables and field\nstrength graphs calculated at one (1) meter above ground level with five\n(5)-foot measurement intervals depicting the width of the entire ROW and out to\nfive hundred (500) feet from the edge of the ROW on both sides, including\ndigital copies of all input assumptions and outputs for the calculations; and\n(7)\n\nProvide a demonstration\nthat the facilities, including interconnection transmission lines, will conform\nwith the Public Service Commission's Statement of Interim Policy on Magnetic\n\nFields of Major Electric Transmission Facilities (see section\n1100-15.1(m)(1)(i) of this Part) at the proposed ROW edges.
