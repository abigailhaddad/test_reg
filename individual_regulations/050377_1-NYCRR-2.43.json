Tit. 1 § 2.43 - Protection from contamination-item 15p\n\nState Regulations\n(a) The milk plant shall operate in a manner\nto facilitate maintenance and sanitary operations for food-production purposes\n(i.e., manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding). The milk plant shall: (1)\n\nProvide adequate space for placement of\nequipment and storage of materials as is necessary for maintenance, sanitary\noperations, and the production of safe food. (2)\n\nTake adequate precautions to reduce the\npotential for allergen cross-contact and for contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials with microorganisms, chemicals, filth, and other extraneous material. The potential for allergen\ncross-contact and for contamination shall be reduced by adequate food safety\ncontrol, operating practices, or effective design, including the separation of\noperations in which allergen cross-contact and contamination are likely to\noccur, or by any affective means including but not limited to: location, time, partition, air flow systems, dust control systems, and/or enclosed\nsystems. (3)\n\nTake adequate\nprecautions to protect food in installed outdoor bulk vessels by any effective\nmeans, including but not limited to: (i) Using\nprotective coverings; (ii)\n\nControlling areas over and around the vessels to eliminate harborages for\npests; (iii)\n\nChecking on a regular\nbasis for pests and pest infestation. (4)\n\nBe operated in such a manner that drip or\ncondensate from fixtures, ducts and pipes does not contaminate food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging materials; and that aisles or working\nspaces are provided between equipment and walls and are adequately unobstructed\nand of adequate width to permit employees to perform their duties and to\nprotect against contaminating food, food-contact surfaces, or food-packaging\nmaterials with clothing or personal contact. (5)\n\nProvide shatter-resistant light bulbs, fixtures, skylights, or other glass suspended over exposed food in any step of\npreparation or otherwise protect against food contamination in case of glass\nbreakage. (b) During\nprocessing, pipelines and equipment used to contain or conduct milk and milk\nproducts shall be effectively separated from tanks or circuits containing\ncleaning and/or sanitizing solutions. (c) All milk, milk products, and ingredients\nthat have overflowed, leaked, been spilled, improperly handled, or are\notherwise adulterated shall be discarded or, if appropriate, treated or\nprocessed to eliminate the contamination. Milk and milk products drained from\nprocessing equipment at the end of a run, or collected from a defoamer system\nand milk solids rinsed from equipment, containers or pipelines, may be\nrepasteurized only if such milk or milk products are handled in a sanitary\nmanner and maintained at 45ºF (7ºC) or less. When the handling and/or\nrefrigeration of such milk and milk products are not in compliance with this\nrequirement, they shall be discarded. Returned packaged milk and milk products, frozen desserts or melloream shall not be repasteurized for Grade A milk\nproducts, frozen desserts or melloream use; provided, that the repasteurization\nof milk and milk products shipped in transport tankers which have been\npasteurized at another Grade A plant and have been handled in a sanitary manner\nand maintained at 45ºF (7ºC) or less is permitted. (d) All product-contact surfaces of\ncontainers, equipment and utensils are covered or otherwise protected to\nprevent the access of insects, dust, condensation and other contamination. All\nopenings, including valves and piping attached to milk storage and milk tank\ntrucks, pumps or vats, etc., shall be capped or otherwise properly protected. While unloading at a receiving station, transfer station or pasteurization\nplant, one of the following conditions shall be met: (1)\n\nIf the area is completely enclosed (walls\nand ceiling, with doors closed) during the unloading process and the dustcover\nor dome and the manhole cover is opened slightly and held in this position by\nthe metal clamps used to close the cover, then a filter is not required. However, if the dustcover and/or manhole cover(s) are opened in excess of that\nprovided by the metal clamps or the covers have been removed, then a suitable\nfilter is required for the manhole. (2)\n\nIf the area is not completely enclosed or\ndoors of the unloading area are open during unloading, a suitable filter is\nrequired for the manhole or air inlet vent and suitable protection must be\nprovided over the filter material either by design of the filter holding\napparatus or a roof or ceiling over the area. Direct connections from milk tank\ntruck to milk truck must be made from valve to valve and not through the\nmanhole and the manhole and the dustcover (dome) of the milk tank truck being\nfilled must be closed. (3)\n\nReceiving and dump vats shall be completely covered, except during washing and\nsanitizing, and when milk is being dumped. Where strainers are used, the cover\nfor the vat opening shall be designed to cover the opening with the strainer in\nplace. (e) Air under\npressure that is used for the agitation or movement of milk, or is directed at\na milk-contact surface, shall be free of oil, dust, rust, excessive moisture, extraneous materials, and odor. The use of steam containing toxic substances is\nexpressly prohibited. Whenever steam is used in contact with milk or milk\nproducts, it shall be of culinary quality and shall comply with the applicable\nstandards of quality. Compressed air or other gases mechanically introduced\ninto food or used to clean food-contact surfaces or equipment shall be treated\nin such a way that food is not contaminated with unlawful indirect food\nadditives. (f) Standardization is\ndone before the pasteurization process is started, unless pasteurized milk or\nmilk products are used for standardization. Such pasteurized milk products\nshall be protected against contamination. In no case shall pasteurized milk or\nmilk products be standardized with unpasteurized milk unless the standardized\nproduct is subsequently pasteurized. Reconstituted or recombined milk and milk\nproducts shall be pasteurized after reconstitution or recombining of all\ningredients. Standardization of grade A milk and milk products with other than\ngrade A milk and milk products is prohibited. Standardization is done only in\naccordance with the provisions of section\n35.2\nand in plants which have\nreceived permission to standardize in accordance with section\n35.3\nof this Title. (g) The processing of foods and/or drinks\nother than grade A milk and milk products are performed to preclude the\ncontamination of such milk and milk products. (h) Means are provided to prevent\ncontamination of milk containers, utensils and equipment by drippings, spillage\nand splash from overhead piping, platforms or mezzanines. (i) All ingredients and nonproduct-contact\nmaterials used in the preparation or packaging of milk and milk products shall\nbe stored in a clean place and so handled as to prevent their contamination. (1)\n\nRaw materials and other ingredients shall\nbe inspected and segregated or otherwise adequately handled to ensure that they\nare clean and suitable for processing into food and stored be stored under\nconditions that will protect against allergen cross-contact and against\ncontamination and minimize deterioration. Raw materials shall be washed or\ncleaned as necessary to remove soil or other contamination. (2)\n\nRaw materials and other ingredients must\neither not contain levels of microorganisms that may render the food injurious\nto the health of humans, or shall be pasteurized or otherwise treated during\nmanufacturing operations so that they no longer contain levels that would cause\nthe product to be adulterated. (3)\n\nRaw materials and other ingredients susceptible to contamination with aflatoxin\nor other natural toxins shall comply with 21 CFR Part\n109\nfor poisonous or\ndeleterious substances before being incorporated into finished food. (4)\n\nRaw materials, other ingredients, and\nrework that contain an added poisonous or deleterious substance shall not\ncontain an amount any such substance in excess of the applicable defect action\nlevel. (5)\n\nRaw materials, other\ningredients, and rework shall be held in bulk, or in containers designed and\nconstructed so as to protect against allergen cross-contact and against\ncontamination, and must be held at such temperature and relative humidity and\nin such a manner as to prevent the food from becoming adulterated. Material\nscheduled for rework must be identified as such. (6)\n\nFrozen raw materials and other\ningredients shall be kept frozen. If thawing is required prior to use, it must\nbe done in a manner that prevents the raw materials and other ingredients from\nbecoming adulterated. (7)\n\nLiquid or\ndry raw materials and other ingredients received and stored in bulk form shall\nbe held in a manner that protects against allergen cross-contact and against\ncontamination. (8)\n\nRaw materials\nand other ingredients that are food allergens, and rework that contains food\nallergens, shall be identified and held in a manner that prevents allergen\ncross-contact. (j) Pasteurized milk is not strained or filtered except through a perforated metal\nstrainer. (k) Only the following\ntoxic materials may be used or stored in a plant where food is processed or\nexposed: (i) Those required to maintain clean\nand sanitary conditions; (ii)\n\nThose\nnecessary for use in laboratory testing procedures; (iii)\n\nThose necessary for plant and equipment\nmaintenance and operation; and\n(iv)\n\nThose necessary for use in the plant's operations. (l) Those poisonous or toxic materials that\nare necessary: (1)\nshall not be stored in a\nroom where milk or milk products are received, processed, pasteurized or\nstored, or where equipment, containers, or utensils are washed or where\nsingle-service containers, closures or caps are stored; and\n(2)\nshall be stored in a manner that protects\nagainst contamination of food, food-contact surfaces, and food packaging\nmaterials. (m) Those\npoisonous or toxic materials that may be used or stored, pursuant to\nsubdivision (k) of this section, shall be stored in a separate area of the\nplant in containers that have labels affixed thereto that prominently and\ndistinctly advise and warn against the use of such materials in a manner that\nmay cause or contribute to contamination of food, food contact surfaces, or\nfood packaging materials; provided, that this does not preclude the convenient\navailability of detergents or sanitizers to areas where equipment, containers\nand utensils are washed and sanitized. (n) Effective measures shall be taken to\nexclude pests from the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding areas\nand to protect against the contamination of food on the premises by pests. The\nuse of pesticides to control pests in the plant is permitted only to the extent\nthat precautions and restrictions are taken that will protect against the\ncontamination of food, food-contact surfaces, and food-packaging materials. Only pesticides approved by the commissioner and/or registered with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency shall be used for pest control. Such pesticides\nshall be used only in accordance with the manufacturer's label directions and\nshall be prevented from contaminating food, food-contact surfaces, or\nfood-packaging materials. (o) Appropriate quality control operations must be employed to ensure that food is\nsuitable for human consumption and that food-packaging materials are safe and\nsuitable. Adequate precautions shall be taken to ensure that production\nprocedures do not contribute to allergen cross-contact and to contamination\nfrom any source. (p) All operations\nin the manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding of food (including\noperations directed to receiving, inspecting, transporting, and segregating)\nshall be conducted in accordance with adequate sanitation principles. (q) All food manufacturing, processing, packing, and holding shall be conducted under such conditions and controls as\nare necessary to minimize the potential for the growth of microorganisms, allergen cross-contact, contamination of food, and deterioration of\nfood. (r) Chemical, microbial, or\nextraneous-material testing procedures shall be used where necessary to\nidentify sanitation failures or possible allergen cross-contact and food\ncontamination. (s) Instruments and\ncontrols used for measuring, regulating, or recording temperatures, pH, acidity, water activity, or other conditions that control or prevent the growth\nof undesirable microorganisms in food shall be accurate and precise, adequately\nmaintained, and adequate in number for their designated uses. (t) The mixing of adulterated food with\nanother lot of food shall not permitted and renders the final food\nadulterated. (u) The manufacturer, processor, packer, and holder of food shall at all times utilize quality\ncontrol operations that reduce natural or unavoidable defects to the lowest\nlevel currently feasible. (v) Storage and transportation of food shall be under conditions that will\nadequately protect against allergen cross-contact and against biological, chemical (including radiological), and physical contamination of food, as well\nas against deterioration of the food and the container. (w) Human food by-products held for\ndistribution as animal food without additional manufacturing or processing by\nthe human food processor shall be held under conditions that will protect\nagainst contamination, including the following: (1)\n\nContainers and equipment used to convey\nor hold human food by-products for use as animal food before distribution shall\nbe designed, constructed of appropriate material, cleaned as necessary, and\nmaintained to protect against the contamination of human food by-products for\nuse as animal food; (2)\n\nHuman food\nby-products for use as animal food held for distribution must be held in a way\nto protect against contamination from sources such as trash; and\n(3)\n\nDuring holding, human food by-products\nfor use as animal food shall be accurately identified. (4)\n\nLabeling that identifies the by-product\nby the common or usual name shall be affixed to or accompany human food\nby-products for use as animal food when distributed. (5)\n\nShipping containers (e.g., totes, drums, and tubs) and bulk vehicles used to distribute human food by-products for use\nas animal food shall be examined prior to use to protect against contamination\nof the human food by-products for use as animal food from the container or\nvehicle when the facility is responsible for transporting the human food\nby-products for use as animal food itself or arranges with a third party to\ntransport the human food by-products for use as animal food.
