  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 22 § 202.8-a - Motion in General\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Form of\n\nMotion Papers. The movant shall specify in the notice of motion, order to show\ncause, and in a concluding section of a memorandum of law, the exact relief\nsought. Regardless of whether the papers are filed electronically or in hard\ncopy or as working copies, counsel must submit as part of the motion papers\ncopies of all pleadings and other documents as required by the CPLR and as\nnecessary for an informed decision on the motion (especially on motions\npursuant to CPLR 3211 and 3212). Counsel should use tabs on hard or working\ncopies when submitting papers containing exhibits. Copies must be legible. If a\ndocument to be annexed to an affidavit or affirmation is voluminous and only\ndiscrete portions are relevant to the motion, counsel shall attach excerpts and\nsubmit the full exhibit separately. Documents in a foreign language shall be\ntranslated as required by CPLR 2101(b). Whenever reliance is placed upon a\ndecision or other authority not readily available to the court, a copy of the\ncase or of pertinent portions of the authority shall be submitted with the\nmotion papers. (b) Proposed orders. When appropriate, proposed orders should be submitted with motions, e.g., motions to be relieved, pro hac vice admissions, open commissions, etc. No\nproposed order should be submitted with motion papers on a dispositive\nmotion. (c) Adjournment of Motions. Unless the court orders otherwise, no motion may be adjourned on consent more\nthan three times or for a cumulative total of more than 60 days. Notes\nN.Y. Comp.
