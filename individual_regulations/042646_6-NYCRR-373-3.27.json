(1)\n\nThe regulations in this section apply\nonly to owners and operators of facilities that treat, store, or dispose of\nhazardous wastes (except as provided in section\n373-3.1\n[a]\nof this\n\nSubpart). (2)\n\nExcept for paragraphs\n(e)(4) and (5) of this section, this section applies to process vents\nassociated with distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent\nextraction, or air or steam stripping operations that manage hazardous wastes\nwith organic concentrations of at least 10 ppmw, if these operations are\nconducted in one of the following: (i) a unit\nthat is subject to the permitting requirements of Subpart 373-1 of this Part; or\n(ii)\na unit (including a\nhazardous waste recycling unit) that is not exempt from permitting under the\nprovisions of section\n372.2\n(a)(8)(ii)\nof\nthis Title, (\ni.e., a hazardous waste recycling unit that is\nnot a 90-day tank or container) and that is located at a hazardous waste\nmanagement facility otherwise subject to the permitting requirements of Subpart\n373-1 of this Part; or\n(iii)\na unit\nthat is exempt from permitting under the provisions of section\n372.2\n(a)(8)(ii)\nof\nthis Title (\ni.e., a 90-day tank or container) and is not a\nrecycling unit under the requirements of section\n371.1\n(g) of this\n\nTitle. Note: The requirements of subdivisions (c) through (g) of this\nsection apply to process vents on hazardous waste recycling units previously\nexempt under section\n371.1\n(g)(3)(i)\nof\nthis Title. Other exemptions under sections\n371.1\n(e) and\n373-3.1\n(a) of this\n\nTitle are not affected by these requirements. (3)\n\nThe requirements of this section do not\napply to the process vents at a facility where the facility owner or operator\ncertifies that all of the process vents that would otherwise be subject to this\nsection are equipped with and operating air emission controls in accordance\nwith the process vent requirements of an applicable Clean Air Act regulation\ncodified under 40 CRF part 60, part 61, or part 63, as incorporated by\nreference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle. The documentation of compliance under Federal regulations at 40 CRF part\n60, part 61, or part 63 as incorporated by reference in section\n370.1\n(e) of this\n\nTitle, shall be kept with, or made readily available with, the facility\noperating record. (b) Definitions. As used in this section, all terms shall have the meaning\ngiven them in section\n373-2.27\n(b) of\nthis Part, the ECL and Parts 370 through 374 of this Title. (c) Standards: process vents.

(2)\n\nIf the owner or operator installs a\nclosed-vent system and control device to comply with the provisions of\nparagraph (1) of this subdivision, the close-vent system and control device\nmust meet the requirements of subdivision (d) of this section. (3)\n\nDeterminations of vent emissions and\nemission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on\ncontrol devices may be based on engineering calculations or performance tests. If performance tests are used to determine vent emissions, emission reductions, or total organic compound concentrations achieved by add-on control devices, the performance tests must conform with the requirements of paragraph (e)(3) of\nthis section. (4)\n\nWhen an owner or\noperator and the commissioner do not agree on determinations of vent emissions\nand/or emission reductions or total organic compound concentrations achieved by\nadd-on control devices based on engineering calculations, the test methods in\nparagraph (e)(3) of this section shall be used to resolve the\ndisagreement. (d) Standards: closed-vent systems and control devices. (1)\n(i) Owners or operators of closed-vent systems and control devices used to comply\nwith provisions of this Subpart shall comply with the provisions of this\nsubdivision.

The observation period is two hours and\nshall be used according to Method 22. (ii)\n\nThe net heating value of the gas being\ncombusted in a flare shall be calculated using the following equation: H\nT\n= K × (summation (i=1 to\nn)(C\ni\n× H\ni\n))\nwhere: H\nT\n= Net heating value of the\nsample, MJ/scm; where the net enthalpy per mole of offgas is based on\ncombustion at 25°C and 760 mm Hg, but the standard temperature for\ndetermining the volume corresponding to 1 mol is 20°C; K = Constant, 1.74 ×- 10\n-7\n(1/ppm) (g mol/scm) (MJ/kcal) where standard temperature for (g mol/scm) is\n20°C; C\ni\n= Concentration of sample\ncomponent i in ppm on a wet basis, as measured for organics by Reference Method\n18 in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) and measured for hydrogen and carbon monoxide by ASTM D 1946-82\n(incorporated by reference as specified in section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); and\nH\ni\n= Net heat of combustion of\nsample component i, kcal/g mol at 25°C and 760 mm Hg.

(iii)\n\nThe actual\nexit velocity of a flare shall be determined by dividing the volumetric flow\nrate (in units of standard temperature and pressure), as determined by\n\nReference Methods 2, 2A, 2C, or 2D in 40 CFR part\n60\n(see section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle) as appropriate, by the unobstructed (free) cross-sectional area of the\nflare tip. (iv)\n\nThe maximum allowed\nvelocity in m/s, V\nmax, for a flare complying with clause\n(4)(iv)(\nc\n) of this subdivision shall be determined by the\nfollowing equation: Log\n10\n(V\nmax\n)\n= (H\nT\n+ 28.8)/31.7\nwhere: H\nT\n= The net heating value as\ndetermined in subparagraph (ii) of this paragraph. 28.8 = Constant. 31.7 = Constant. (v) The maximum allowed velocity in m/s, V\nmax, for an air-assisted flare shall be determined by\nthe following equation: V\nmax\n= 8.706 + 0.7084\n(H\nT\n)\nwhere: 8.706 = Constant. 0.7084 = Constant.

E\nh\n= Q\n2sd\n× (summation {i=1 to\nn}(C\n1\nMW\ni\n)) × (0.0416)\n× (10\n-6\n)\nwhere: E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate, kg/h; Q\n2sd\n= Volumetric flow rate of\ngases entering or exiting control device, as determined by Method 2, dscm/h; n = Number of organic compounds in the vent gas; C\ni\n= Organic concentration in ppm, dry basis, of compound i in the vent gas, as determined by Method 18; MW\ni\n= Molecular weight of organic\ncompound i in the vent gas, kg/kg-mol; 0.0416 = Conversion factor for molar volume, kg-mol/m\n3\n(@ 293 K and 760 mm Hg); 10\n-6\n= Conversion from ppm, ppm\n-1. (2)\n\nFor sources utilizing Method 25A. E\nh\n=\n(Q)(C)(MW)(0.0416)(10\n-6\n)\nwhere: E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate, kg/h; Q = Volumetric flow rate of gases entering or exiting\ncontrol device as determined by Method 2, dscm/h; C = Organic concentration in ppm, dry basis, as\ndetermined by Method 25A; MW = Molecular weight of propane, 44; 0.0416 = Conversion factor for molar volume, kg\nmol/m\n3\n(at 293 K and 760 mm Hg); 10\n-6\n= Conversion from\nppm. (e) The\nannual total organic emission rate shall be determined by the following\nequation: E\nA\n=\n(E\nh\n)(H)\nwhere: E\nA\n= Total organic mass emission\nrate, kg/y; E\nh\n= Total organic mass flow rate\nfor the process vent, kg/h; H = Total annual hours of operations for the affected\nunit, h. (f) Total organic\nemissions from all affected process vents at the facility shall be determined\nby summing the hourly total organic mass emission rates\n(E\nh, as determined in clause [\nd\n] of\nthis subparagraph) and by summing the annual total organic mass emission rates\n(E\nA, as determined in clause [\ne\n] of\nthis subparagraph) for all affected vents at the facility. (ii)\n\nThe owner or operator shall record such\nprocess information as may be necessary to determine the conditions of the\nperformance tests. Operations during periods of startup, shutdown, and\nmalfunction shall not constitute representative conditions for the purpose of a\nperformance test. (iii)\n\nThe owner\nor operator of an affected facility shall provide, or cause to be provided, performance testing facilities as follows: (a) sampling ports adequate for the test\nmethods specified in subparagraph (i) of this paragraph; (b) safe sampling platform(s); (c) safe access to sampling platform(s); and\n(d) utilities for sampling and\ntesting equipment. (iv)\n\nFor the purpose of making compliance determinations, the time-weighted average\nof the results of the three runs shall apply. In the event that a sample is\naccidentally lost or conditions occur in which one of the three runs must be\ndiscontinued because of forced shutdown, failure of an irreplaceable portion of\nthe sample train, extreme meteorological conditions, or other circumstances\nbeyond the owner or operator's control, compliance may, upon the commissioner's\napproval, be determined using the average of the results of the two other runs. (4)\n\nTo show that a\nprocess vent associated with a hazardous waste distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation\nis not subject to the requirements of this section, the owner or operator must\nmake an initial determination that the time-weighted, annual average total\norganic concentration of the waste managed by the waste management unit is less\nthan 10 ppmw using one of the following two methods: (i) Direct measurement of the organic\nconcentration of the waste using the following procedures: (a) The owner or operator must take a minimum\nof four grab samples of waste for each waste stream managed in the affected\nunit under process conditions expected to cause the maximum waste organic\nconcentration. (b) For waste\ngenerated onsite, the grab samples must be collected at a point before the\nwaste is exposed to the atmosphere, such as in an enclosed pipe or other closed\nsystem that is used to transfer the waste after generation to the first\naffected distillation fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam stripping operation. For waste generated offsite, the grab\nsamples must be collected at the inlet to the first waste management unit that\nreceives the waste, provided the waste has been transferred to the facility in\na closed system such as a tank truck and the waste is not diluted or mixed with\nother waste. (c) Each sample shall\nbe analyzed and the total organic concentration of the sample shall be computed\nusing Method 9060A of SW-846 (incorporated by reference under section\n370.1\n[e]\nof this\n\nTitle); or analyzed for its individual organic constituents. (d) The arithmetic mean of the results of the\nanalyses of the four samples shall apply for each waste stream managed in the\nunit in determining the time-weighted, annual average total organic\nconcentration of the waste. The time-weighted average is to be calculated using\nthe annual quantity of each waste stream processed and the mean organic\nconcentration of each waste stream managed in the unit. (ii)\n\nUsing knowledge of the waste to\ndetermine that its total organic concentration is less than 10 ppmw. Documentation of the waste determination is required. Examples of documentation\nthat shall be used to support a determination under this provision include\nproduction process information documenting that no organic compounds are used, information that the waste is generated by a process that is identical to a\nprocess at the same or another facility that has previously been demonstrated\nby direct measurement to generate a waste stream having a total organic content\nless than 10 ppmw, or prior speciation analysis results on the same waste\nstream where it can also be documented that no process changes have occurred\nsince that analysis that could affect the waste total organic\nconcentration. (5)\n\nThe\ndetermination that distillation fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent\nextraction, or air or stream stripping operations manage hazardous wastes with\ntime-weighted annual average total organic concentrations less than 10 ppmw\nshall be made as follows: (i) by the\neffective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this\nsection or by the date when the waste is first managed in a waste management\nunit, whichever is later; and\n(ii)\nfor continuously generated waste, annually; or\n(iii)\nwhenever there is a change in the waste\nbeing managed or a change in the process that generates or treats the\nwaste. (6)\n\nWhen an owner\nor operator and the department do not agree on whether a distillation, fractionation, thin-film evaporation, solvent extraction, or air or steam\nstripping operation manages a hazardous waste with organic concentrations of at\nleast 10 ppmw based on knowledge of the waste, the dispute may be resolved\nusing direct measurement as specified at subparagraph (4)(i) of this\nsubdivision. (f) Recordkeeping requirements. (1)\n(i) Each owner or operator subject to the provisions of this section shall comply\nwith the recordkeeping requirements of this subdivision. (ii)\n\nAn owner or operator of more than one\nhazardous waste management unit subject to the provisions of this section may\ncomply with the recordkeeping requirements for these hazardous waste management\nunits in one recordkeeping system if the system identifies each record by each\nhazardous waste management unit. (2)\n\nOwners and operators must record the\nfollowing information in the facility operating record: (i) For facilities that comply with the\nprovisions of subparagraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, an implementation\nschedule that includes dates by which the closed-vent system and control device\nwill be installed and in operation. The schedule must also include a rationale\nof why the installation cannot be completed at an earlier date. The\nimplementation schedule must be in the facility operating record by the\neffective date that the facility becomes subject to the provisions of this\nsection. (ii)\n\nUp-to-date\ndocumentation of compliance with the process vent standards in subdivision (c)\nof this section, including: (a) information\nand data identifying all affected process vents, annual throughput and\noperating hours of each affected unit, estimated emission rates for each\naffected vent and for the overall facility (\ni.e., the total\nemissions for all affected vents at the facility), and the approximate location\nwithin the facility of each affected unit (\ne.g., identify the\nhazardous waste management units on a facility plot plan); and\n(b) information and data supporting\ndeterminations of vent emissions and emission reductions achieved by add-on\ncontrol devices based on engineering calculations or source tests. For the\npurpose of determining compliance, determinations of vent emissions must be\nmade using operating parameter values (\ne.g., temperature, flow\nrates or vent stream organic compounds and concentrations) that represent the\nconditions that result in maximum organic emissions, such as when the waste\nmanagement unit is operating at the highest load or capacity level reasonably\nexpected to occur. If the owner or operator takes any action\n(\ne.g., managing a waste of different composition or increasing\noperating hours of affected waste management units) that would result in an\nincrease in total organic emissions from affected process vents at the\nfacility, then a new determination is required. (iii)\n\nWhere an owner or operator chooses to\nuse test data to determine the organic removal efficiency or total organic\ncompound concentration achieved by the control device, a performance test plan. The test plan must include: (a) a description\nof how it is determined that the planned test is going to be conducted when the\nhazardous waste management unit is operating at the highest load or capacity\nlevel reasonably expected to occur.
