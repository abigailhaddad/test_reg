  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 §§ 1627-1.1 - Procedure for processing applications\n\nState Regulations\n\nThe following procedure is to be used in processing\napplications for occupancy in State-aided projects and all projects\n(irrespective of the source of the aid) operated by an authority which also\noperates one or more State-aided projects. Authorities operating more than one\nproject will process applications on a central basis, unless otherwise\nauthorized by the commissioner: (a) Applicant will complete one copy of Preliminary Application for Apartment\n(Exhibit A, Appendix S-4) and return it in person or by mail to the authority's\noffice responsible for processing of applications. Applications will be\nconsecutively numbered as received and a control card (Exhibit B, Appendix S-4)\nprepared for each application. This control card shall be filed alphabetically\nby applicant's surname. Each step in processing application shall be entered in\nappropriate place on card, thus serving as ready reference for current\ndisposition of application. (A supply of preliminary application forms normally\nshould be maintained by each project; however, local authority may make\nadditional arrangements for distribution if situation warrants.)\n(b) Preliminary application forms will be\nscreened and separated into two categories--apparent eligibles and apparent\nineligibles. Those applicants appearing to be ineligible shall be notified by\nmail (Exhibit C, Appendix S-4) and informed that they may be apprised of the\nreasons for ineligibility at a personal interview at the office of the\nauthority. A duplicate copy of the letter will be attached to the preliminary\napplication which will then be transferred to the ineligible file and filed\nnumerically. Preliminary application forms which appear to indicate eligibility\nshould be separated according to size dwelling unit required and filed\nnumerically according to date of return of completed application. (c) Further processing of apparently eligible\napplications may be deferred whenever the waiting list of eligible applicants\nfor the appropriate accommodations substantially exceeds the number of\napartments expected to be available within a reasonable time. Processing will\nbe resumed when the authority determines the waiting list of eligible\napplicants for the appropriate accommodations has been sufficiently reduced to\nwarrant resumption of processing. In all cases where processing of apparently\neligible applications is deferred, applicants will be notified promptly that\npreliminary application forms indicate apparent eligibility but that further\nprocessing is deferred. (See Exhibit C-1, Appendix S-4, as applicable.) When\nprocessing is resumed, applications deferred as provided herein will be\nprocessed consecutively within the category of the size unit needed, according\nto their control number in accordance with subdivisions (d) to (m)\nbelow. (d) Mail interview letter\n(Exhibit D, Appendix S-4) and required verification list (Exhibit E, Appendix\nS-4) to those applicants who appear eligible. At time of scheduled interview, tenant selection personnel will fill out Dwelling Application (Exhibit F, Appendix S-4) with applicant, using documents listed in Required Verification\n(Exhibit E, Appendix S-4) as proof of statements. Dwelling application will be\ngiven the same number assigned the preliminary application. If applicant is\nfound ineligible at that time, he shall be so told and given the reason or\nreasons therefor. In addition, confirming letter (Exhibit C, Appendix S-4) will\nbe mailed to applicant. (See subdivision [e] below.)\n(e) After interview, all dwelling\napplications shall be classified and those found ineligible so notified by mail\n(see subdivision [d] above). A duplicate copy of the letter will be attached to\nthe preliminary application forms of those found ineligible at interview or\nafter classification which will then be filed in ineligible file and the\ndwelling application filed in an ineligible dwelling application\nfile. (f) Mail to employers of\nthose applicants who appear to be eligible two copies of the Employers Report\n(Exhibit G, Appendix S-4); completed report will supplement dwelling\napplication. (g) In case of those\napplicants who own a business or who are self-employed, a Certificate of Income\n\nReceived from Operation of Business (Exhibit H, Appendix S-4) will be completed\nin duplicate by applicant and will supplement dwelling application. (h) In case of those applicants who receive\naid from a public or private welfare agency, two copies of the Social Agency\n\nReport form (Exhibit I, Appendix S-4) will be mailed to contributing agency for\ncompletion. (i) One completed and\nsigned copy of applicable form, as referred to in subdivisions (f), (g) or (h)\nwill be returned to authority's management office by person, corporation or\nagency involved; duplicate copy retained for their own file if\ndesired. (j) Data from completed\nforms will be assembled in authority's management office and transcribed to\n\nDwelling Application forms (Exhibit F, Appendix S-4). The data should be\nchecked carefully and reviewed for completeness and reasonableness, with\nfurther investigation made if indicated. Any applicant found ineligible on the\nbasis of this data review will be notified and application filed as provided in\nsubdivision (e) above. Those applicants found eligible for tenancy in a project\nwill be put on a waiting list in the order of their application number, and\nexcept for admission preference cases, will be notified upon availability of\napartment, and advised to report to the authority to sign lease (Exhibit\nJ[FN*], Appendix S-4) and make rent deposits and security deposit payments in\nsuch order. (k) Upon refusal by an\napplicant of the apartment offered to him, an application shall be deemed void\nand a notation of such refusal made on his progress or control card (Exhibit B, Appendix S-4). Before being reconsidered, the application must be reprocessed\ncompletely beginning at subdivision (a). (l) Eligible applications should be reviewed\nannually by mailing an inquiry to the applicant in order to determine his\npresent interest as well as any change in the information on the application. Failure of the applicant to respond within 15 days of this or any\ncorrespondence in connection with the processing of the application can be\nconsidered by the authority as a basis for placing the application in the\nineligible file. (m) Selection of\ntenants for intra-project or inter-project transfer will be made on an\nequitable basis. Request for such transfer will be on a locally developed form\nproviding the following information as a minimum: (1)\ntenants' name and address; (2)\nage and sex of persons residing in\napartment; (3)\ndate of request. The request will be submitted to the authority's office\nresponsible for processing of applications and such request will be\nconsecutively numbered as received. The extent of over-occupancy, as compared\nwith the authority's occupancy standards, will determine the urgency of\ntransfer. Transfers will be made on the basis of the greatest degree of\nurgency. Within the same degree of urgency, intra-project transfers will\nprecede inter-project transfers; where all conditions are equal, the lower\nnumbered request will prevail.
