  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 9 § 5319.54 - Program interruption and resumption\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Interruption. After a program\ninterruption (e.g., processor reset), software shall be able to recover to the\nstate such software was in immediately prior to the interruption occurring. It\nis acceptable for the game to return to a game-completion state so long as the\ngame history and all credit and accounting meters comprehend a completed game. If a power failure occurs during acceptance of a bill or other note, the bill\nvalidator shall give proper credits or return the note. (b) Restoring power. When a gaming device is\npowered down while in an error condition, upon restoring power, the specific\nerror message shall still be displayed and the gaming device shall remain\nlocked-up. If power-down is used as part of the error reset procedure upon\npower-up or door closure, a gaming device shall check for the error condition\nand confirm that the error is no longer in existence. (c) Simultaneous inputs. A program shall not\nbe affected adversely by the simultaneous or sequential activation of the\nvarious inputs and outputs, such as \"play buttons,\" that might, whether\nintentionally or not, cause malfunctions or invalid results. (d) Resumption. On program resumption, the\nfollowing procedures shall be performed as a minimum requirement: (1)\nany communications to an external device\nshall not begin until the program resumption routine, including self-tests, is\ncompleted successfully; and\n(2)\nthe\nbill validator device shall perform a self-test at each power up. In the event\nof a self-test failure, the bill validator shall disable itself automatically\n(i.e., enter bill-reject state) until the error state has been\ncleared. (e) Microprocessor-controlled reels. Microprocessor-controlled reels (e.g., stepper\nmotor reels) shall re-spin automatically to the last-valid-play mode result\nwhen the play mode is re-entered and the reel positions have been altered\n(e.g., the main door is closed, power is restored, audit mode is exited or an\nerror condition cleared). (f) Required door metering. Software shall be able to detect access to the\nfollowing doors or secure areas, provided power is supplied to a device: (1)\nall external doors (e.g., main, belly, top box); (2)\ndrop box\ndoor; (3)\nstacker door; and\n(4)\nany other currency storage\nareas that have a door.
