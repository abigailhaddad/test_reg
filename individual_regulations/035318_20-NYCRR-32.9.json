  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 20 § 32.9 - Examples\n\nState Regulations\n\nUnless otherwise provided, assume the following facts for\nall examples: Corporation A owns all of the stock of corporations B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, L, M, N, O, P, Q, and R. All of the corporations are calendar year\ntaxpayers for Federal income tax purposes. Corporation I is taxable under\narticle 9-A. Corporations B and C are taxable under sections 1501 and 1502 of\narticle 33. All remaining corporations would be subject to tax under sections\n1501 and 1502 of article 33 if they had nexus with New York. None of the\ncorporations are taxable under section 1502-a. Only Corporation D is a\ncorporation organized under the laws of a country other than the United States. To the extent that the conclusion of the example is filing on a separate basis, it is assumed that the Commissioner did not find that a combined report would\nbe required to properly reflect tax liability as a result of inter-company\ntransactions or some agreement, understanding or arrangement or\ntransaction. Example 1: 90 percent of B's receipts are from D. Therefore, there are substantial intercorporate transactions between B and D. B\nand D are a tentative combined group and must file a combined return. Example 2: B's receipts are: 22 percent from A, 20 percent\nfrom C, 30 percent from D, 10 percent from E and the rest are from unrelated\nentities. 40 percent of C's expenses are to B. No other substantial\nintercorporate transactions occur between the corporations. Since there is no\ntentative combined group among the related corporations, corporations B and C\nfile on a separate basis. Example 3: 90 percent of B's receipts are from D and 100\npercent of D's receipts are from E. D is an alien corporation. There are\nsubstantial intercorporate transactions between B and D, and D and E. B, D and\nE must file a combined return. Example 4: A is the only taxpayer and 50 percent of A's\nreceipts are from B, with another 4 percent from E. 30 percent of E's\nexpenditures are to A and 20 percent to D. C has no transactions with anyone in\nthe group. 50 percent of D's receipts are from A. 50 percent of F's receipts\nare from A. 100 percent of H's receipts are from F. 100 percent of R's receipts\nare from H. 20 percent of B's receipts are from L, 20 percent from M, and 20\npercent from N. 100 percent of L's receipts are from M. 100 percent of M's\nreceipts are from N. 40 percent of O's receipts are from R and 30 percent are\nfrom D. 60 percent of P's receipts are from O. 80 percent of L's expenditures\nare to Q. All of these corporations are in the step 1 group of related\ncorporations because they meet the stock ownership test. The step 2 tentative\ncombined group consists of A, B, D, and F. As a result of step 3, H is added to\nthe tentative combined group. As a result of step 4, R is added to the\ntentative combined group. As described in step 5, L, M, N and Q is an\nunattached related group and O and P is an unattached related group. Corporations O and P are added to the tentative group pursuant to step 6\nbecause 70 percent of O's receipts are from R and D. The step 6 tentative\ncombined group is A, B, D, F, H, R, O and P. The corporations in the unattached\nunrelated group of L, M, N and Q are all added to the tentative combined group\npursuant to step 7 because B has substantial intercorporate transactions with\nthe unattached related group of L, M, N and Q. The step 7 tentative combined\ngroup is A, B, D, F, H, R, O, P, L, M, N and Q. Pursuant to step 8, E is added\nto the step 7 tentative combined group because 30 percent of its expenditures\nare from A and 20 percent are from D. The step 9 tentative combined group is\nthe same as the step 8 tentative combined group. Since no corporations will be\nexcluded from the step 9 tentative combined group pursuant to step 10, the\ngroup of corporations that must file a combined return are A, B, D, F, H, R, O, P, L, M, N, Q and E. Example 5: A's only activity is to receive dividends from\nits wholly owned subsidiaries. B sells stocks, C sells municipal bonds and D\nsells corporate bonds. B, C and D each have their own employees. However, the\nemployees of one corporation are authorized to and do sell extensively the\nsecurities sold by the other corporations. 80 percent of the receipts of B, 70\npercent of the receipts of C and 60 percent of the receipts of D are generated\nby sales made by the common pool of employees of B, C, and D. All three\ncorporations carry on their activities at or using common facilities. Because\nthere are substantial intercorporate transactions using common facilities and\nemployees among B, C and D, they are a combined group and must file a combined\nreturn. A is not included in the combined group because it has no substantial\nintercorporate transactions with a related corporation. Example 6: 90 percent of B's receipts are from I and 100\npercent of I's receipts are from E. C has no transactions with anyone in the\ngroup. I is taxable under article 9-A. There are substantial intercorporate\ntransactions between B and I, and I and E. B, I and E are a tentative combined\ngroup. However, since I is taxable under another franchise tax imposed by the\n\nTax Law, it cannot be included in a combined return. Therefore, B and E must\nfile a combined return. C files on a separate basis. Example 7: A, B, C, D, and E are parties to an intercompany\nreinsurance pooling agreement. In accordance with the terms and conditions of\nthis agreement, the member companies cede 100% of their direct and assumed\nbusiness to Company A, the lead company pool participant. In turn, each pool\nparticipant assumes their percentage share of the pooled business ceded from\n\nCompany A. The capital stock requirement is met but substantial intercorporate\ntransactions are absent. However, the Commissioner deems a combined report\nincluding A. B, C, D and E is necessary to properly reflect tax liability\nbecause of inter-company agreements between the corporations. Notes\nN.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs.
