  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 18 § 368.1 - Definitions\n\nState Regulations\n(a) Aid to the\naged, blind or disabled or AABD means the combined program for providing\nfinancial assistance, care and referral for services, exclusive of medical\nassistance, to the following: (1)\nindividuals\n65 years of age or older (OAA); (2)\nblind persons (AB); and\n(3)\nindividuals, 18 years of age but less than 65 who are permanently and totally\ndisabled (AD). (b) Blind\nmeans that the individual is totally without or has impaired vision of not more\nthan 20/200 visual acuity in the better eye and for whom a diagnosis and\nmedical findings show that vision cannot be improved to better than 20/200; or\nwho has loss of vision due wholly or in part to impairment of field vision or\nto other factors which affect the usefulness of vision to a like\ndegree. (c) Permanently and totally\ndisabled means that the individual has a permanent physical or mental\nimpairment, disease; or loss, or combination thereof that substantially\nprecludes him from engaging in useful occupations within his competence, such\nas holding a job or performing homemaking. (1)\n\nPermanently refers to a condition which is not likely to improve or which will\ncontinue throughout the life time of the individual; it may be a condition\nwhich is not likely to respond to any known therapeutic procedure, or a\ncondition which is likely to remain static or to become worse unless certain\ntherapeutic measures are carried out, where treatment is unavailable, inadvisable, or is refused by the individual on a reasonable basis; \"permanently\" does not rule out the possibility of vocational rehabilitation or\neven possible recovery in light of future medical advances or changed\nprognosis; in this sense the term refers to a condition which continues\nindefinitely as distinct from one which is temporary or transient. (2)\n\nTotally involves considerations in\naddition to those verified through the medical findings, such as age, training\nskills, and work experience and the probable functioning of the individual in\nhis particular situation in light of his impairment; an individual's disability\nwould usually be tested in relation to ability to engage in remunerative\nemployment; the ability to keep house or to care for others would be the\nappropriate test for (and only for) individuals, such as housewives, who were\nengaged in this occupation prior to the disability and do have a history of\ngainful employment; eligibility may continue even after a period of\nrehabilitation and readjustment, if the individual's work capacity is still\nvery considerably limited (in comparison with that of a normal person) in terms\nof such factors as the speed with which he can work, the amount he can produce\nin a given time, and the number of hours he is able to work. (3)\n(i) Group I. Individuals having permanent impairments which are totally disabling\nand definitely irreversible. This classification includes persons who show no\npossibility of engaging in a useful occupation but who are under medical\nsupervision engaging in motivated activity or in an occupational therapy\nprogram. (ii)\n\nGroup II. Individuals\nhaving permanent impairments which, while totally disabling at the time of\ninitial determination, are such that the condition may be arrested or a\nremission may occur, or for which therapeutic advances are occurring or where\nrehabilitation is deemed feasible. Group II designation is limited to those\npersons who are expected to show a change in physical or mental status or\nimproved functioning which will enable them to become capable of useful\nemployment. (4)\n\nTerminal\nillness. An illness in its final stage which: (i) cannot benefit from further treatment; and\n(ii)\nis expected to lead to\nprogressive physical and/or mental deterioration; and\n(iii)\nis expected to cause the patient's\ndeath in a relatively short period of time. (5)\n\nCompletely helpless. A condition of\npermanent impairment of such severity confirmed by medical judgment that a\nperson must remain confined indefinitely in his or her home or a medical\ninstitution. (6)\n\nReview team means\ntechnically competent persons, not less than a physician and a social worker\nqualified by professional training and pertinent experience, acting\ncooperatively, employed by the department or designated by the department, who\nare responsible for the agency's decision that the applicant does or does not\nmeet the State's definition of permanent and total disability, based on the\nevaluation of the medical report and social history. (i) The medical report shall include a\nsubstantiated diagnosis, based either on existing medical evidence or upon\ncurrent medical examination; (ii)\n\nThe social history shall contain sufficient information to make it possible to\nrelate the medical findings to the activities of the \"useful occupation\" and to\ndetermine whether the individual is totally disabled. (7)\n\nUseful occupation means gainful\nemployment and homemaking. (i) Employment. Employment as a useful occupation refers to a full-time job for which the\nperson is compensated at the prevailing wages in the community. It excludes\nhobbies, activities which do not provide a bona fide job opportunity, activity\nwhich if discontinued by the individual would not require someone to be hired\nas a replacement, and activities primarily of therapeutic or rehabilitative\nnature. It also excludes those situations where the severely handicapped person\nthrough diligent effort does some work or where sympathy or compassion of\nothers provides the opportunity to engage in remunerative work or where the\nenergy output of the handicapped person is far beyond that which is ordinarily\nrequired for that activity or where it takes him substantially more time to do\nthe work than a normal person. It does not necessarily exclude persons employed\nin a sheltered workshop. (ii)\n\nHomemaking. Homemaking as a useful occupation involves ability to carry major\nhome management and decision-making responsibilities and provide essential\nservice within the home for at least one person, in addition to one's\nself. (iii)\n\nHomemaker. A person who\nresides alone shall not be evaluated as a homemaker. Only those individuals, such as housewives, who were engaged in this occupation prior to the disability\nand who do not have a history of gainful employment are to be evaluated as\nhomemakers. (8)\n\nSubstantially precludes means the inability of a person to perform activities\nrelated to gainful employment well enough for a sufficient number of hours or\nwith sufficient regularity to receive regular payment for the employment; or in\nthe case of the homemaker, the person is unable to perform regularly a\nsignificant combination of the activities required of a homemaker within\nacceptable standards. There shall be sufficient medical and social data to\nsupport the person's inability to perform on a predictable basis any job for\nwhich he has competence and which exists in the community. (9)\n\nCompetence means the ability to perform\nthe activities required by a useful occupation for which the individual is\nfitted by age, background, skills, training, education or work\nexperience. (10)\nA job which exists\nin the community is one within an area which is reasonably accessible rather\nthan in the immediate neighborhood of the disabled person's home. However, whether it is feasible for a handicapped person to accept a specific job within\nthe larger employment area will depend on such factors as its distance from his\nhome, what methods of transportation are available and his ability to use such\nform of transportation, the time consumed in travel and the cost.
