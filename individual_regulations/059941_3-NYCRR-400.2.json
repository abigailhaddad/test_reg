  "content": "N.Y. Comp. Codes R. & Regs. Tit. 3 § 400.2 - Books, records and microfilm\n\nState Regulations\n\nEvery licensee shall maintain the following records and\ninformation. All entries therein shall be made in ink, be typed or be available\nthrough computer printouts. Records maintained under subdivision (a) of this\nsection may, with the prior written approval of the superintendent, be\nmaintained on microfilm. Approval shall be granted if the superintendent finds\nthat the licensee has the capability of utilizing microfilm in accordance with\nsubdivision (b) of this section. These records must be preserved for at least\nthree years after the date of final entry, and kept readily available for\ninspection by representatives of the Banking Department. (a) A \"daily record of checks cashed\", in\nwhich shall be recorded all cash transactions occurring each day. This record\nshall include the following information with respect to each check, draft or\nmoney order cashed in the face amount of $100 or more, and with respect to any\nnumber of checks cashed at any one time drawn by any one maker with an\naggregate face amount thereof totaling $100 or more: (1)\n\nDate on which the check, draft, or money\norder is cashed. (2)\n\nDate of the\ncheck, draft, or money order. (3)\n\nNumber of the check, draft, or money order. (4)\n\nName and location, or American Bankers\n\nAssociation number, or Clearing House number, of the banking institution on\nwhich the check, draft, or money order is drawn. (5)\n\nName of the drawer of the check, draft, or money order which is cashed. (6)\n\nName and home or business address of the individual, partnership, or\ncorporation for which such check, draft, or money order is cashed. Where the\nlicensee maintains an index card or computer record showing current home or\nbusiness addresses of customers, such address need not be repeated for each\ntransaction on individual checks, drafts, or money orders for $1,500 or less. Complete details, including current address, must be recorded individually for\neach check (other than a payroll check), draft, or money order exceeding\n$1,500. On payroll checks, the licensee may accept the address of the employer\nas the address of the employee cashing the check. (7)\n\nFace amount of the check, draft, or money\norder. (8)\n\nThe fee collected for\ncashing each such check, draft, or money order. (9)\n\nThe amount of each bank deposit, recorded\nin such form as will clearly identify the particular checks, drafts, money\norders, or cash included in each such deposit. Reporting requirements (1) through (8) (paragraphs [1]-[8]\nof this subdivision) shall not apply to any United States Government, state, or\nmunicipal checks or to checks issued by any banking institutions or insurance\ncompanies less than $1,500; that is to say all items more than $1,500 are to be\nindividually listed. However, when 10 or more payroll checks, regardless of\namount, of any one employer or 10 or more checks, each of which is less than\n$1,500, of the United States Government or of any state or municipality are\ncashed during any one day, it will be sufficient for the licensee to retain a\nduplicate adding machine listing or other record of each group of such items, showing the individual checks and fees charged as well as the total number of\nsuch checks cashed, the name of the drawer, the bank on which they are drawn, the total amount of the checks, and the total fees charged. This information\nneed be shown only once in the daily record of checks cashed for each group of\nsuch checks cashed. Except for checks cashed at any one time drawn by any one\nmaker with the aggregate amount thereof totaling $100 or more, the licensee\nshall retain a duplicate adding machine listing or other record of all checks, drafts, or money orders where the face amount thereof is less than $100, showing the face amounts of individual checks, drafts, or money orders, the\ntotal amount thereof, and the total fees charged therefor listed on such tape. The information need be shown only once in the daily record of such checks, drafts, or money orders cashed, covered by a separate adding machine listing or\nother equivalent record. Additionally, when the licensee receives checks, drafts, or money orders in connection with any other business conducted on the\npremises, a separate record shall be made of such checks, drafts, or money\norders, and the nature of the transaction must also be shown. (b) Microfilm. Microfilm equipment\nmay be used to record all the checks, drafts and money orders cashed in the\nbusiness, under the following conditions: (1)\n\nEach roll of film must be processed promptly after it is exposed. (2)\n\nThe date items are microfilmed shall be\nidentified by means of a date card inserted into the machine before the items\nare microfilmed. This shall be done at the beginning of each business day and\nwhenever a new roll of film is put into use. The date indicated shall be the\ndate on which these items were cashed. (3)\n\nThe microfilm equipment must\nsimultaneously record together or in sequence the front and back of each check, draft or money order that the licensee cashes. (4)\n\nEach check, draft or money order cashed\nshall be microfilmed together with the deposit ticket indicating the date and\ntotal amount of the deposit. The adding machine tape listing all items included\nin such deposit will be attached to the \"Daily Record of Checks Cashed\". Items\nshall be microfilmed in such a manner as to avoid overlapping of the checks, drafts or money orders or otherwise obscuring such items. (5)\n\nThe name and home or business address of\nthe individual, partnership or corporation for which the check, draft or money\norder is cashed shall be indicated on the item before it is microfilmed. Where\nthe licensee maintains an index card or computer record with the current home\nor business address of customers, such address need not be microfilmed for each\ntransaction on individual checks, drafts or money orders for $1,500 or less. However, the complete details as required by subdivision (a) of this section\nincluding the current address shall be maintained in written or typed form for\neach check, draft or money order exceeding $1,500. On payroll checks, the\nlicensee may accept the address of the employer as the address of the employee\ncashing the check. (6)\n\nThe fee\ncollected for cashing each check, draft or money order must be indicated on the\nface of the item before it is microfilmed. If payroll checks are cashed and no\nfee is charged, a notation to this effect (such as N/C) must be indicated on\nthe face of the item. (7)\n\nAn\ninventory log of microfilm shall be maintained. This log is to include the\nfollowing information for every roll of film exposed: (i) The beginning and ending dates of the\nperiod covered. (ii)\n\nThe date on\nwhich the exposed roll was sent for processing. (iii)\n\nThe date on which the developed roll\nwas returned and reviewed. (iv)\n\nThe\nname of the employee reviewing the film. (8)\n\nIf the licensee's review of microfilm\ndetermines that processed film is not accurate and legible, or if any equipment\nbecomes inoperable, the licensee shall immediately begin to maintain written\nrecords as required by subdivision (a) of this section until such time as the\nmicrofilm equipment has been repaired or replaced. (9)\n\nEach roll of microfilm shall be clearly\nlabeled showing the beginning and ending dates of the period covered. (10)\n\nAn operative microfilm viewer must be\nmaintained on the premises at all times. (11)\n\nThe licensee must: (i) maintain all microfilm equipment so as to\nensure continuous proper operation; (ii)\nverify that all microfilmed records are\nmaintained in an accurate and legible form; and\n(iii)\nassure that all personnel working at\nthe location are familiar with these terms and requirements. If it is found that the licensee is not complying with any\nof the above requirements, authorization to use microfilm equipment may be\nrevoked in the sole discretion of the superintendent and, upon notice thereof, the licensee shall thereafter be required to maintain the record of checks, drafts and money orders cashed in written form in conformity with subdivision\n(a) of this section. (c) A \"summary of business\" in which the\nnumber of checks, drafts, or money orders cashed, their total face amount, and\nthe aggregate fees received, shall be shown for each business day and totaled\nfor each calendar month.
